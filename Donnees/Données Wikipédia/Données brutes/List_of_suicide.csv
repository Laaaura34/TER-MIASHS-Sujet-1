*** "*page_ Antoine-Jean_Gros" "*cat_ Artists_who_committed_suicide" "     In 1810 ,  his Madrid and Napoleon at the Pyramids (Versailles) show that his star had deserted him .  His Francis I and Charles V ,  1812 (Louvre) ,  had considerable success ,  but the decoration of the dome of St .  Genevieve (begun in 1811 and completed in 1824) is the only work of Gros's later years which shows his early force and vigour ,  as well as his skill .  The """"Departure of Louis XVIII"""" (Versailles) ,  the Embarkation of Madame d'Angoulême (Bordeaux) ,  the plafond of the Egyptian room in the Louvre ,  and finally his Hercules and Diomedes ,  exhibited in 1835 ,  testify only that Gros's efforts – in accordance with the frequent counsels of his old master David – to stem the rising tide of Romanticism only damaged his once brilliant reputation . Again citing the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica ,  """"Exasperated by criticism and the consciousness of failure ,  Gros sought refuge in the gros"

*** "*page_ Andreas_Baader" "*cat_ People_who_committed_suicide_in_prison_custody" "    According to official accounts of his death ,  Raspe learned of GSG 9's success on a smuggled transistor radio ,  and spent the next few hours talking to Baader ,  Ensslin ,  and Möller ,  who agreed to a suicide pact .  In the morning ,  Baader and Raspe were found dead in their cells ,  having died from gunshot wounds ,  while Ensslin was found hanging from a noose made from speaker wire .  RAF member Irmgard Möller was found with four stab wounds to her chest ,  but survived . All official inquiries on the matter concluded that Baader and his two accomplices committed collective suicide ,  and Baader-Meinhof biographer Stefan Aust argued in the original edition of his book ,  The Baader-Meinhof Group (1985) ,  that they did kill themselves . Aspects to the deaths have been debated :  Baader was supposed to have shot himself in the base of the neck so that the bullet exited through his forehead ;  repeated tests indicated that it was virtually impossible for a person to hold and fire a gun in such a way .  In addition ,  three bullet holes were found in his cell :  one lodged in the wall ,  one in the mattress ,  and the fatal bullet itself lodged in the floor ,  suggesting that Baader had fired twice before killing himself .  Finally ,  Baader had powder burns on his right hand ,  but he was left-handed .  Raspe showed no signs of powder burns . The theory itself that guns had been smuggled into Stammheim depended on the testimony of Hans Joachim Dellwo (brother of prisoner Karl-Heinz Dellwo) and Volker Speitel (husband of Angelika Speitel) .  Both had been arrested on 2 October 1977 ,  and charged with belonging to a criminal association ;  under pressure from the police they subsequently became crown witnesses and admitted to acting as couriers and testified that they were aware of lawyers smuggling items to the prisoners during the trial .  In consideration for this testimony ,  authorities reduced their sentences and provided them with new identities .  In 1979 ,  two defence attorneys were tried and convicted for smuggling weapons .  However ,  as noted above ,  the lawyers had been unable to meet with their clients after 6 September 1977 due to the Kontaktsperre order . In the revised version of his comprehensive book on the RAF ,  which was published in English in 2009 ,  Stefan Aust is categorical that the group members committed suicide . Following their apparent suicides ,  the German government had the brains of Baader ,  Meinhof ,  Ensslin and Raspe illegally removed for study at the Neurological Research Institute at the University of Tübingen .  The results of the study of the others' brains are not known . Aside from the removal of his brain ,  a death mask was made of Baader .  The brains of all but Meinhof have apparently been lost and cannot be accounted for by German authorities .  "

Rodriguez sought a legal exception in her home province ,  British Columbia ,  but was denied . The British Columbia Civil Liberties Association (BCCLA) filed a lawsuit ,  Rodriguez v British Columbia (AG) ,  that challenged section 241(b) as contrary to sections 7 ,  12 ,  and 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . On February 12 ,  1994 ,  with the assistance of an anonymous doctor ,  Sue Rodriguez ended her own life by ingesting a liquid mixture of morphine and secobarbital .  Robinson has vowed never to reveal the anonymous doctor's identity . Almost 23 years later ,  on June 7 ,  2016 ,  medical assistance in dying became legal in Canada as the result of a similar Supreme Court case ,  Carter v Canada (AG) .  The Court unanimously struck down parts of section 241(b) and section 14 of the Criminal Code which the justices ruled unjustifiably infringed on section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  "
*** "*page_ Roger_Williamson" "*cat_ Deaths_from_asphyxiation" "    After his Formula One debut at the 1973 British Grand Prix ,  Williamson's second Formula One appearance was at the 1973 Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort Circuit .  On his eighth lap ,  a suspected tyre failure caused his car to flip upside down and catch fire .  Williamson had not been seriously injured by the impact ,  but was trapped under the car which was swiftly engulfed in flame .  The track marshals were both poorly trained and badly equipped ,  and did not assist him .  Another driver ,  David Purley ,  upon witnessing the crash of his friend ,  abandoned his own race and pulled over in a desperate and valiant attempt to rescue Williamson .  He ran across the still active track to Williamson's car and tried to turn it upright ,  before grabbing a fire extinguisher from a marshal and returning to the engulfed car .  He emptied it on the car and signalled for others to help .  Purley's efforts to turn the car upright and extinguish the flames were in vain ,  and the marshals were unable to handle the vehicle without flame retardant overalls .  Purley later stated he could hear Williamson's screams from underneath the car ,  but by the time the first fire engine arrived and the fire was extinguished ,  Williamson had died of asphyxiation .  As most racers mistakenly identified Purley as the driver of the crashed car ,  and therefore thought the burning car to be empty ,  none of them stopped to help and the race continued ,  even as Purley stood on the circuit and gestured with his hands for them to stop .  Furthermore ,  the track marshals were wearing normal blazers and not the fire-resistant overalls which the drivers wore ,  and thus were not able to go near the large flames .  Purley was later awarded the George Medal for the bravery he displayed in attempting to rescue Williamson .  A series of photos of the incident ,  showing a clearly desperate and ultimately dejected Purley ,  won that year's World Press Photo award for Photo Sequences .  Williamson's body was later cremated with his ashes being taken to an undisclosed location .  In the years following the accident ,  fire-resistant clothing would become mandatory for all trackside marshals so that they would be able to assist in the event of a fire .  The next few years also saw a noticeable increase in drivers stopping at accident sites to assist in rescue efforts ,  notably at the 1976 German Grand Prix .  Williamson was 25 years old at the time of his death . In 2003 ,  on the thirtieth anniversary of his fatal crash ,  a bronze statue of Williamson was unveiled at the Donington Park circuit in his native Leicestershire .  Then-owner Tom Wheatcroft had provided financial backing to Williamson ,  and described the day Williamson died as """"the saddest day of my life"""" .  "

These other injuries may have been enough to end his racing career on their own ,  but the head injuries and the trauma of Barrett's death also changed his personality . In his final months towards 1937 ,  he was described as suffering delusions and was admitted to a nursing home .  On 10 April 1937 he was found dead in a bedroom at his home near the KLG factory ,  having apparently gassed himself . At the coroner's inquest ,  his brother Sir Algernon Guinness produced a letter that indicated the likelihood of suicide .  The coroner's verdict was ,  """"Suicide ,  while of unsound mind"""" .

*** "*page_ Ajax_the_Great" "*cat_ Suicides_in_Greek_mythology" "    As the Iliad comes to a close ,  Ajax and the majority of other Greek warriors are alive and well .  When Achilles dies ,  killed by Paris (with help from Apollo) ,  Ajax and Odysseus are the heroes who fight against the Trojans to get the body and bury it with his companion ,  Patroclus . In Sophocles' play Ajax ,  a famous retelling of Ajax's demise ,  after the armor is awarded to Odysseus ,  Ajax feels so insulted that he wants to kill Agamemnon and Menelaus .  Athena intervenes and clouds his mind and vision ,  and he goes to a flock of sheep and slaughters them ,  imagining they are the Achaean leaders ,  including Odysseus and Agamemnon .  When he comes to his senses ,  covered in blood ,  he realizes that what he has done has diminished his honor ,  and decides that he prefers to kill himself rather than live in shame .  He does so with the same sword which Hector gave him when they exchanged presents . Ajax's half-brother Teucer stood trial before his father for not bringing Ajax's body or famous weapons back .  Teucer was acquitted for responsibility but found guilty of negligence .  He was disowned by his father and was not allowed to return to his home ,  the island of Salamis off the coast of Athens . Homer is somewhat vague about the precise manner of Ajax's death but does ascribe it to his loss in the dispute over Achilles' armor ;  when Odysseus visits Hades ,  he begs the soul of Ajax to speak to him ,  but Ajax ,  still resentful over the old quarrel ,  refuses and descends silently back into Erebus . Like Achilles ,  he is represented (although not by Homer) as living after his death on the island of Leuke at the mouth of the Danube .  Pausanias also relates that a gigantic skeleton ,  its kneecap 5 inches (13cm) in diameter ,  appeared on the beach near Sigeion ,  on the Trojan coast ;  these bones were identified as those of Ajax .

Both Li Keju and Wang Rong the military governor of Chengde Circuit (成德 ,  headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang ,  Hebei) were fearful of Li Keyong's growing strength ,  and therefore formed a pact to conquer Yiwu and divide its territory .

He believed it was no one's fault other than his own for getting himself into his situation .  Jones would later be quoted as saying ,  """"I'm not happy with what's happening to my situation and I'm going to draw attention to it whichever way I can .  My paramount goal is for no one other than myself to get hurt . """"On Thursday ,  April 30 ,  1998 ,  around 3 : 00p . m .  ,  40-year-old Jones parked his dark gray Toyota pickup truck on the transition loop from the Harbor Freeway to the Century Freeway in Los Angeles (33°55′53 . 1″N 118°16′50 . 1″W﻿ / ﻿33 . 931417°N 118 . 280583°W﻿ / 33 . 931417 ;  -118 . 280583) .  He sat in the front of his truck with his dog Gladdis .  He began pointing a loaded shotgun at passing cars on the freeway ,  causing motorists to report him to the police .  Jones himself then called 911 ,  revealing he was emotionally distraught about health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and the circumstances surrounding his HIV .  He said that he was in pain because of mistreatment by the HMO in whose care he had been placed .  He complained that it would take him a month to schedule an appointment with a doctor and another month to get the results of a test . Jones unfurled a large ,  square banner with white handlettering that read :  """"HMO's are in it for the money!! Live free ,  love safe or die . """"The standoff between Jones and the police had lasted close to 50 minutes . During the standoff ,  Jones had thrown a videotape over the freeway wall .  When recovered by the authorities ,  who viewed the video ,  it was discovered that it was a videotaped suicide note recorded by Jones on the previous day .  "

While on approach for the fourth and final landing on a different runway (19) ,  Munson did not extend the flaps and allowed the aircraft to sink too low before increasing engine power ,  causing the jet to clip a tree and fall short of the runway .  The plane then hit a tree stump and burst into flames , Hall and Anderson both survived the accident .  Hall received burns on his arms and hands ,  and Anderson received burns on his face ,  arm and neck .  Munson ,  however ,  was in a more precarious position .  Unable to move due to what was originally thought to be the wrecked fuselage of the plane pinning him against his seat ,  Munson was trapped and Hall and Anderson were unable to free him in the only attempt they were able to make before flames engulfed the cockpit .  Munson died of asphyxiation due to the inhalation of superheated air and toxic substances . The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation into the crash stated that the probable cause was """"the pilot's failure to recognize the need for ,  and to take action to maintain ,  sufficient airspeed to prevent a stall into the ground during an attempted landing .  The pilot also failed to recognize the need for timely and sufficient power application to prevent the stall during an approach conducted inadvertently without flaps extended .  Contributing to the pilot's inability to recognize the problem and to take proper action was his failure to use the appropriate checklist and his nonstandard pattern procedures which resulted in an abnormal approach profile . """" Munson was not wearing the available shoulder harness restraint ,  only a lap belt ,  which contributed to the severity of his injuries .  "

Kemys then committed suicide by shooting himself in the chest with a pistol ,  then when that did not prove immediately fatal ,  stabbing himself in the heart with a knife . On Raleigh's return to England ,  an outraged Count Gondomar ,  the Spanish ambassador ,  demanded that Raleigh's death sentence be reinstated by King James ,  who had little choice but to do so .  Raleigh was brought to London from Plymouth by Sir Lewis Stukley ,  where he passed up numerous opportunities to make an effective escape .  Raleigh was beheaded in the Old Palace Yard at the Palace of Westminster on 29 October 1618 . With the aggression of the Indians towards Spain ,  the Spanish never returned in force particularly and this allowed other European countries (France and Holland as well as England) to colonize the region at east of Esequibo river over the next two centuries with the creations of Dutch Guyana ,  French Guiana and eventually British Guyana . Over time as more explorers came to the region Lake Parime's existence was definitively disproved in the early 19th century and there was a theory that the seasonal flooding of the Rupununi savannah may have been misidentified as such .

The early Church Father Papias of Hierapolis (c .  60–130 AD) recorded in his Expositions of the Sayings of the Lord ,  which was probably written during the first decade of the second century AD ,  that Judas was afflicted by God's wrath ; According to the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus ,  which was probably written in the fourth century AD ,  Judas was overcome with remorseThe discrepancy between the two different accounts of Judas's death in Matthew 27 : 1–10 and Acts 1 : 18 has proven to be a serious challenge to those who support the idea of Biblical inerrancy . Modern scholars reject these approaches . Matthew's description of the death as fulfilment of a prophecy """"spoken through Jeremiah the prophet"""" has caused difficulties ,  since it does not clearly correspond to any known version of the Book of Jeremiah but does appear to refer to a story from the Book of ZechariahMore recently ,  scholars have suggested that the Gospel writer may also have had a passage from Jeremiah in mind , Scholar Glenn W .  Most suggests that Judas' death in Acts can be interpreted figurately ,  writing that πρηνὴς γενόμενος should be translated as saying his body changed in position from vertical to prone ,  rather than falling headlong ,  and the spilling of the entrails is meant to invoke the imagery of dead snakes and their burst-open bellies .  Hence Luke was stating that Judas became a snake and died like one .  "

When a doctor had asked him why such an educated person like him committed self-immolation ,  he had replied that several thousands of more intelligent and educated Tamil people were dying in Eezham and that he intended to save thousands of lives by sacrificing himself . Muthukumar's grandmother ,  who remains in his native place of Kulavai Nallur in Thoothukudi (Tuticorin) ,  had made plans to get him married in the coming months .  When she learned news of his self-immolation ,  she broke down and cried uncontrollably .  "

He suggested an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing's death :  the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus used to electroplate gold onto spoons .  The potassium cyanide was used to dissolve the gold .  Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room .  Copeland noted that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison .  Turing also habitually ate an apple before going to bed ,  and it was not unusual for the apple to be discarded half-eaten . It has been suggested that Turing's belief in fortune-telling may have caused his depressed mood . But it was a lovely sunny day and Alan was in a cheerful mood and off we went .  .  .  Then he thought it would be a good idea to go to the Pleasure Beach at Blackpool .  We found a fortune-teller's tent but he obviously was deeply unhappy .  I think that was probably the last time we saw him before we heard of his suicide . In August 2009 ,  British programmer John Graham-Cumming started a petition urging the British government to apologise for Turing's prosecution as a homosexual . Thousands of people have come together to demand justice for Alan Turing and recognition of the appalling way he was treated .  While Turing was dealt with under the law of the time and we can't put the clock back ,  his treatment was of course utterly unfair and I am pleased to have the chance to say how deeply sorry I and we all are for what happened to him .  .  .  So on behalf of the British government ,  and all those who live freely thanks to Alan's work I am very proud to say :  we're sorry ,  you deserved so much better . In December 2011 ,  William Jones and his Member of Parliament ,  John Leech ,  created an e-petitionWe ask the HM Government to grant a pardon to Alan Turing for the conviction of """"gross indecency"""" .  In 1952 ,  he was convicted of """"gross indecency"""" with another man and was forced to undergo so-called """"organo-therapy""""—chemical castration .  Two years later ,  he killed himself with cyanide ,  aged just 41 .  Alan Turing was driven to a terrible despair and early death by the nation he'd done so much to save .  This remains a shame on the British government and British history .  A pardon can go some way to healing this damage .  It may act as an apology to many of the other gay men ,  not as well-known as Alan Turing ,  who were subjected to these laws . The petition gathered over 37 , 000 signatures , A posthumous pardon was not considered appropriate as Alan Turing was properly convicted of what at the time was a criminal offence .  He would have known that his offence was against the law and that he would be prosecuted .  It is tragic that Alan Turing was convicted of an offence that now seems both cruel and absurd—particularly poignant given his outstanding contribution to the war effort .  However ,  the law at the time required a prosecution and ,  as such ,  long-standing policy has been to accept that such convictions took place and ,  rather than trying to alter the historical context and to put right what cannot be put right ,  ensure instead that we never again return to those times . John Leech ,  the MP for Manchester Withington (2005–15) ,  submitted several bills to ParliamentOn 26 July 2012 ,  a bill was introduced in the House of Lords to grant a statutory pardon to Turing for offences under section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 ,  of which he was convicted on 31 March 1952 .

At the family's request ,  a Quebec coroner agreed to exhume the body so that two pathologists could conduct a second autopsy .  Coroner Jean Brochu said ,  """"We've been waiting for this for a long time , """" and """"it's going to take a while"""" before conclusions can be made ,  and released to the public . The Quebec coroner's report was released in November 2011 .  Brochu agreed with prior conclusions that Gatti died a violent death from asphyxia by neck constriction .  He also noted that Gatti had carisoprodol ,  a muscle relaxant ,  in his system ,  along with alcohol .  An expert toxicologist from Quebec retained by the coroner said the drug can produce withdrawal symptoms ,  such as anxiety ,  confusion and psychosis .  The coroner also stated that """"obvious presence of post-mortem lividity"""" indicated that the body had been suspended for some time before ending up on the floor .   Two independent private investigators from the States hired by Gatti's family proved it was impossible that Gatti's body would have been found in the place and position it was in if he indeed had hanged himself .  They believe his wife had an accomplice to assist with murdering Gatti .  Motive was Gatti's fortune ,  which Rodrigues inherited since she was able to coerce Gatti to void their prenuptial agreement three weeks prior to his death .  Rodrigues threatened to leave Gatti and take their son with her ,  moving to Brazil if Gatti did not write a Will leaving his fortune to Rodrigues . After all the new findings ,  information ,  and facts were gathered and presented by independent ,  outside agencies from Canada and the U . S .  ,  Brazilian authorities again concluded Gatti's death was a suicide ,  and closed the case .  "

Also living there were Cynthia Stoltzmann's daughter ,  Sammantha ,  and her son-in-law ,  John Allen ,  both 23 ,  and twelve or more children .  The family first told the police officers that Ame was playing hide-n-seek and locked herself in the trunk the night before ,  after the adults went to sleep .  They all claimed that they found Ame dead the next day ,  in the trunk .  Police suspected foul play since Ame was found very dirty with bruises on her left leg ,  since it was in forced contact with the trunk .  After being interrogated for a while ,  Sammantha and John Allen confessed to locking Ame in the trunk ,  as a form of punishment ,  because she took a popsicle without permission .  Ame was said to be """"chronically hungry"""" . Ame ,  who was 4 feet ,  2inches and 59 pounds ,  had to be squeezed into the trunk since its dimensions were only 3 feet by 1 foot 2 inches and a foot deep .

The caller affirmed during the call that he did not believe the person was armed and that he did not believe that anyone was in immediate danger . According to the police report ,  McClain resisted when confronted by the responding police officers ,  and Officers Woodyard and Rosenblatt heard Officer Roedema shout """"he is going for your gun"""" .  An attorney representing McClain's family said the officers involved slammed McClain into a wall immediately after apprehending him .  There was no visual body-camera footage of McClain's alleged reach for the gun ,  which the officers explained by stating that all of their cameras had fallen off .  However ,  the cameras continued to record audio ,  and one officer can be heard to say he did not remember feeling McClain go for his gun . The three police officers held McClain on the ground for 15 minutes .  McClain was clearly in distress while restrained ,  sobbing and repeatedly saying """"I can't breathe"""" .  He vomited several times ,  for which he apologized ,  saying :  """"I'm sorry ,  I wasn't trying to do that ,  I can't breathe correctly . """"The body cameras became unattached from the police officer's uniforms during the encounter ,  but the audio can still be heard .  During the recording ,  when one of the body cameras was still attached to an officer ,  another officer can be heard telling him to move his camera .  The attorney representing McClain's family accused the officers of purposely taking off their body cameras to support a false allegation that McClain reached for a gun ,  though this claim was never supported by any evidence during the subsequent investigation . According to the Adam's County Coroner's Office ,  McClain's exact cause of death could not be determined and was therefore was listed as undetermined .  The county coroner Dr .  Stephen Cina stated that it may have been an accident resulting from an idiosyncratic drug reaction ,  could have been homicide if the officers' use of the carotid hold contributed to his death ,  or could have been natural “if (McClain) had an undiagnosed mental illness that led to excited delirium ,  if his intense physical exertion combined with a narrow coronary artery led to an arrhythmia ,  if he had an asthma attack ,  or if he aspirated vomit while restrained . ”The Coroner stated that McClain’s """"physical exertion"""" likely contributed to his death , ” but “It is unclear if the officer’s actions contributed as well"""" and described Mclain as being given a “therapeutic level” of Ketamine . Aurora Police Department officers met with the coroner Dr .  Stephen Cina before his final decision that the cause of death could not be determined was announced ,  and Aurora police investigators were also present during the autopsy . According to body cam audio ,  these were McClain's last words as he was restrained by police officers : I can't breathe .  I have my ID right here .  My name is Elijah McClain .  That's my house .  I was just going home .  I'm an introvert .  I'm just different .  That's all .  I'm so sorry .  I have no gun .  I don't do that stuff .  I don't do any fighting .  Why are you attacking me? I don't even kill flies! I don't eat meat! But I don't judge people ,  I don't judge people who do eat meat .  Forgive me .  All I was trying to do was become better .  I will do it .  I will do anything .  Sacrifice my identity ,  I'll do it .  You all are phenomenal .  You are beautiful and I love you .  Try to forgive me .  I'm a mood Gemini .  I'm sorry .  I'm so sorry .

*** "*page_ Lupe_Vélez" "*cat_ Female_suicides" "    On the evening of December 13 ,  1944 ,  Vélez dined with her two friends ,  the silent film star Estelle Taylor and Venita Oakie .  A suicide note addressed to Harald Ramond was found nearby .  It read : To Harald ,  May God forgive you and forgive me too ,  but I prefer to take my life away and our baby's before I bring him with shame or killing him .  – Lupe . On the back of the note ,  Vélez wrote : How could you ,  Harald ,  fake such a great love for me and our baby when all the time ,  you didn't want us? I see no other way out for me ,  so goodbye ,  and good luck to you ,  Love Lupe . The day after Vélez's death ,  Harald Ramond told the press that he was """"so confused"""" by Vélez's suicide ,  and claimed that even though the two had broken up ,  he had agreed to marry Vélez . The day after Vélez's death ,  the Los Angeles County coroner requested that an inquest be opened to investigate the circumstances surrounding her death . Despite the coroner's ruling that Vélez committed suicide to avoid the shame of bearing an illegitimate child ,  some authors have speculated that this was not entirely true . In the book From Bananas to Buttocks :  The Latina Body in Popular Film and Culture ,  Rosa-Linda Fregoso wrote that Vélez was known for her defiance of contemporary moral convention ,  and that it seems unlikely that she could not have reconciled having a child out of wedlock .  Fregoso believes that in the final year of her life ,  Vélez exhibited signs of extreme mania and depression .  Fregoso goes on to speculate that Vélez's death may have been the result of an untreated mental illness such as bipolar disorder . Robert Slatzer (who later claimed to have been secretly married to Marilyn Monroe)In the 2002 book Tarzan ,  My Father ,  Johnny Weiss Müller ,  Jr .  recounted the events surrounding Vélez's death as a mystery caused by an attempt to """"put a lid"""" on what happened .  It states her housekeeper discovered her body and called Bo Roos ,  Vélez's business manager ,  who called his friend and Beverly Hills Police Chief Anderson to the scene .  The book states after Vélez arranged to meet Ramond ,  decorated her room ,  and dressed in a negligee ,  her ingestion of Seconal was either to calm her nerves to meet him or a failed dramatic gesture to scare him .  The book also suggested the baby was fathered possibly by Cooper ,  not Ramond . Vélez's death was recounted in the 1959 book Hollywood Babylon by Kenneth Anger ,  and has become urban legend .   In his telling ,  Vélez planned to stage a beautiful suicide scene atop her satin bed ,  but the Seconal did not mix well with the """"Mexi-Spice Last Supper"""" she had eaten earlier that evening .  As a result ,  she became violently ill ,  stumbled to the bathroom to vomit ,  slipped on the bathroom floor tile ,  and fell head first into the toilet ,  where she subsequently drowned .  Anger claimed that Vélez's """"chambermaid"""" Juanita found her the next morning .  Despite the fact that his version of events contradicts published reports and the official ruling ,  his story is often repeated as fact or for comedic effect – it was recounted in the pilot episode of the television comedy series Frasier ,  and also referenced in an episode of the cartoon The Simpsons .  Vélez's biographer ,  Michelle Vogel ,  points out that it would have been """"virtually impossible"""" for Vélez to have """"stumbled to the bathroom"""" or even get off her bed after having consumed such a large amount of Seconal .  Seconal ,  a barbiturate ,  is noted for being fast acting even in small doses ,  and Vélez's death was likely instantaneous .  Her death certificate lists """"Seconal poisoning"""" due to """"ingestion of Seconal"""" as the cause of death ,  not drowning .  Further ,  there was also no evidence to suggest Vélez had vomited .  "

*** "*page_ Yamanami_Keisuke" "*cat_ Suicides_by_seppuku" "    Some time after the Zenzaiya incident he tried to escape the Shinsengumi ,  despite the regulation against deserters .   As a result ,  he committed seppuku with Okita as his Kaishakunin on March 20 (lunar calendar February 23) ,  1865 .   There are several speculations on Yamanami's reason to escape ,  including a theory that Yamanami committed suicide without ever leaving the Shinsengumi .  Another theory is Yamanami lost hope about Shogunate's future and was disillusioned about Tokugawa Yoshinobu political decisions ,  but when forced to choose between his friends and Justice ,  he decided to commit an honorable suicide and escape scandal . In Shinsengumi :  the Shogun's Last Samurai Corps by Romulus Hillsborough there is something mentioned about Yamanami's escape .  The following is quoted from this book : The trouble with Yamanami seems to have originated over a disagreement in philosophy ,  though Shimosawa also cites a bitter rivalry with the other vice commander ,  Hijikata Toshizo .  Yamanami was apparently vexed over the lately inflated self-importance of Kondo and Hijikata .  He felt that they had forgotten the original purpose for which the members of the Shieikan had enlisted in the """"loyal and patriotic"""" corps .  The unyielding will to power that had lately consumed his erstwhile friends had diminished their former patriotic ideals .  According to most sources ,  Yamanami's vexation was exacerbated sometime early in 1865 ,  when Kondo and Hijikata ,  unhappy with their cramped headquarters at Mibu ,  decided to move to a more spacious location at Nishihonganji Temple in the southwest of the city .  The temple priests were perplexed over the decision .  Their attempts to rebuff the Shinsengumi were ignored by Kondo and Hijikata .  Yamanami objected to what he considered coercion of Buddhist priests .  """"Certainly there are many other suitable places ,  """" he admonished Kondo ,  and suggested that his commander reconsider .  But his commander would not reconsider ,  and Yamanami resolved to pay the ultimate price .  He composed a farewell letter explaining the reasons he could no longer ,  in good conscience ,  risk his life under Kondo's command .  Then he defected . In short ,  this is the most accepted theory in regard of Yamanami's reason to leave the Shinsengumi ,  even though officially it is still a mystery .  In addition ,  Hillsborough's source in regard of the rivalry between Yamanami and Hijikata ,  Shimosawa Kan's Shinsengumi Shimatsuki ,  is in fact categorized as historical fiction . Yamanami fled to Otsu while Kondo sent Okita to retrieve him .  After Yamanami returned to Mibu ,  he was ordered to commit seppuku .  He asked Okita to serve as his Kaishakunin .  There is also a theory that Kondo asked Okita to serve as Yamanami's Kaishakunin out of respect for Yamanami .  (The Kaishakunin was usually a closest friend or family member whenever possible . ) Yamanami saw Okita as family and the two shared a strong bond till the very end of Yamanami's life . Yamanami was buried at the Kōen Temple (光縁寺 ,  Kōenji) in Kyoto . Before his death ,  Yamanami was the second-in-command of the Shinsengumi .  (It is a misconception that Hijikata had always been the second-in-command .   In fact ,  Hijikata became the second-in-command after Yamanami's death . ) "
*** "*page_ Yamanami_Keisuke" "*cat_ Suicides_by_seppuku" "    Some time after the Zenzaiya incident he tried to escape the Shinsengumi ,  despite the regulation against deserters .   As a result ,  he committed seppuku with Okita as his Kaishakunin on March 20 (lunar calendar February 23) ,  1865 .   There are several speculations on Yamanami's reason to escape ,  including a theory that Yamanami committed suicide without ever leaving the Shinsengumi .  Another theory is Yamanami lost hope about Shogunate's future and was disillusioned about Tokugawa Yoshinobu political decisions ,  but when forced to choose between his friends and Justice ,  he decided to commit an honorable suicide and escape scandal . In Shinsengumi :  the Shogun's Last Samurai Corps by Romulus Hillsborough there is something mentioned about Yamanami's escape .

*** "*page_ Émile_Durkheim" "*cat_ Suicidologists" "    The outbreak of World War I was to have a tragic effect on Durkheim's life .  His leftism was always patriotic rather than internationalist ,  in that he sought a secular ,  rational form of French life .  However ,  the onset of the war ,  and the inevitable nationalist propaganda that followed ,  made it difficult to sustain this already nuanced position .  While Durkheim actively worked to support his country in the war ,  his reluctance to give in to simplistic nationalist fervor (combined with his Jewish background) made him a natural target of the now-ascendant French Right .  Even more seriously ,  the generations of students that Durkheim had trained were now being drafted to serve in the army ,  many of them perishing in the trenches . Finally ,  Durkheim's own son ,  André ,  died on the war front in December 1915—a loss from which Durkheim never recovered .  "

*** "*page_ Heracles" "*cat_ Suicides_in_Greek_mythology" "    This is described in Sophocles's Trachiniae and in Ovid's Metamorphoses Book IX .   Having wrestled and defeated Achelous ,  god of the Acheloos river ,  Heracles takes Deianira as his wife .   Travelling to Tiryns ,  a centaur ,  Nessus ,  offers to help Deianira across a fast flowing river while Heracles swims it .   However ,  Nessus is true to the archetype of the mischievous centaur and tries to steal Deianira away while Heracles is still in the water .   Angry ,  Heracles shoots him with his arrows dipped in the poisonous blood of the Lernaean Hydra .   Thinking of revenge ,  Nessus gives Deianira his blood-soaked tunic before he dies ,  telling her it will """"excite the love of her husband"""" . Several years later ,  rumor tells Deianira that she has a rival for the love of Heracles .   Deianira ,  remembering Nessus' words ,  gives Heracles the bloodstained shirt .  Lichas ,  the herald ,  delivers the shirt to Heracles .  However ,  it is still covered in the Hydra's blood from Heracles' arrows ,  and this poisons him ,  tearing his skin and exposing his bones .   Before he dies ,  Heracles throws Lichas into the sea ,  thinking he was the one who poisoned him (according to several versions ,  Lichas turns to stone ,  becoming a rock standing in the sea ,  named for him) .   Heracles then uproots several trees and builds a funeral pyre on Mount Oeta ,  which Poeas ,  father of Philoctetes ,  lights .  As his body burns ,  only his immortal side is left .  Through Zeus' apotheosis ,  Heracles rises to Olympus as he dies . No one but Heracles' friend Philoctetes (Poeas in some versions) would light his funeral pyre (in an alternative version ,  it is Iolaus who lights the pyre) .   For this action ,  Philoctetes or Poeas received Heracles' bow and arrows ,  which were later needed by the Greeks to defeat Troy in the Trojan War . Philoctetes confronted Paris and shot a poisoned arrow at him .  The Hydra poison subsequently led to the death of Paris .  The Trojan War ,  however ,  continued until the Trojan Horse was used to defeat Troy . According to Herodotus ,  Heracles lived 900 years before Herodotus' own time (c .  1300 BCE) . In Christian circles ,  a Euhemerist reading of the widespread Heracles cult was attributed to a historical figure who had been offered cult status after his death .  Thus Eusebius ,  Preparation of the Gospel (10 . 12) ,  reported that Clement could offer historical dates for Hercules as a king in Argos :  """"from the reign of Hercules in Argos to the deification of Hercules himself and of Asclepius there are comprised thirty-eight years ,  according to Apollodorus the chronicler :  and from that point to the deification of Castor and Pollux fifty-three years :  and somewhere about this time was the capture of Troy . """"Readers with a literalist bent ,  following Clement's reasoning ,  have asserted from this remark that ,  since Heracles ruled over Tiryns in Argos at the same time that Eurystheus ruled over Mycenae ,  and since at about this time Linus was Heracles' teacher ,  one can conclude ,  based on Jerome's date—in his universal history ,  his Chronicon—given to Linus' notoriety in teaching Heracles in 1264 BCE ,  that Heracles' death and deification occurred 38 years later ,  in approximately 1226 BCE .

However Maxtla ,  ruler of Coyoacan and older half-brother of Tayatzin ,  soon incited a rebellion among the nobles of Azcapotzalco and usurped the throne .  Chimalpopoca allied with Tayatzin ,  and the two conspired to retake the throne and kill Maxtla .  Friendly relations between Tenochtitlan and Azcapotzalco were thus replaced by insults and violent intrigue ,  apparently involving tit-for-tat assassination attempts .  Maxtla sent Chimalpopoca a present of women's clothing . Teyatzin was killed ,  and Chimalpopoca decided to offer himself as a sacrifice at the altar of his father Huitzilíhuitl .  Some of his nobles joined him .  In the middle of the ceremony ,  before the tlatoani's turn ,  an expeditionary force from Azcapotzalco invaded Tenochtitlan ,  took Chimalpopoca prisoner and carried him to Azcapotzalco .  There he was exhibited in a cage and kept on starvation rations .  He committed suicide ,  hanging himself from a beam with his belt .  (Another account says he was strangled by his captors . )He was succeeded as tlatoani by his uncle Itzcoatl . A rigorous and critical study based in the sources state ,  however ,  that Chimalpopoca's death must be interpreted as a coup d'etat .  Itzcoatl was the leader of a rebel faction against the Tepanec Empire .  Chimalpopoca ,  as Tezozomoc's grandson ,  was the main collaborator of this Empire in Tenochtitlan ,  and consequently was the first victim of Itzcoatl .  After the victory of the rebel coalition ,  the history was rewritten and the defeated Tepanecs was blamed for Chimalpopoca's death .  This can be considered the official Mexica history (see Santamarina 2006 :  cap .  XIII) .  "

*** "*page_ Lane_Pryce" "*cat_ Fictional_suicides" "    While Lane's work has been critical to SCDP ,  he has struggled with making ends meet while having to agree to being poorly paid to keep SCDP afloat during its shaky early times .  When his $50 , 000 partnership fee comes due ,  Lane liquidates a corresponding amount in securities he had with a brokerage house in the UK .  This subjects him to another financial issue ;  England's high taxes of the 1960s .  To pay the tax collector ,  Lane embezzles $7 , 500 from the company by forging Don's signature on a supposed Christmas bonus payment he anticipates receiving .  However ,  he is left feeling uneasy when the partners announce they will be forgoing their bonuses for that year . Don meets with Lane ,  who admits to the embezzlement after trying to lie his way out of it .  Don demands an explanation ,  first thinking Lane is gambling ,  but then gets the story that he had to cover his partnership fee and then the tax collector .  Don says Lane should have informed him of the matter .  Erupting with anger ,  Lane insists he could not bear the shame of asking for a loan and has never been compensated for his contribution to the agency ;  he also makes a snide remark about Don's jet set lifestyle ,  and generally tries to justify his fraudulent actions .  Don has lost all trust in Lane ,  though ,  and says that while he will cover the $7 , 500 ,  Lane will need to resign and gives him the weekend to """"think of an elegant exit . """" Lane then uncharacteristically flirts with Joan ,  makes a lewd remark to her ,  and seems grimly happy when she responds with muted anger .  Upon returning home after this encounter ,  Lane discovers that Rebecca ,  unaware of their financial situation ,  has bought him a new Jaguar (paid by check) .  Lane puts his affairs in order and attempts to take his life via carbon monoxide poisoning ;  however ,  the attempt fails when the Jaguar doesn't start .  He then goes to SCDP ,  types a resignation letter ,  and hangs himself in his office .  Joan arrives Monday morning to assume her usual duties ,  but has trouble opening the door to Lane's office .  She gets suspicious when the small part of the door she does get ajar shows yellowish gunk on the floor and thinks it is dried urine .  She goes to Pete Campbell ,  whose office is adjacent to Lane's ,  who then discovers what has happened when he stands on his sofa to peep into Lane's office .  The partners send all SCDP employees home ,  falsely claiming they need to evacuate due to a gas leak ,  and also find a boilerplate resignation letter .  When Don shows up with Roger ,  Bert breaks the news to him .  Don is aghast that everyone left Lane's office as is (as the police told them to stay out of the office so a report could be made) and demands Lane's body be cut down immediately . In the wake of Lane's suicide ,  the partners are left mourning the loss .  Joan ,  in particular ,  feels guilty over dismissing his advances ,  and she confesses to Don that she feels responsible for his death .  Ironically ,  Lane's death ending up costing Don significantly more than the stolen money .  Besides the loss of a skilled partner who was indeed trying to get SCDP out of the red ,  Lane was under contract ,  as were the other partners ,  that in case of death the partnership fees were to go to the next of kin within a 7-year deadline before legal action would be invoked .  Don's failure to tell anyone else nor alert the authorities did not give prior evidence of defalcation ;  and Lane's boilerplate letter was not much to go by with a paper trail .  As the suicide occurred prior to Don's Monday deadline of """"an elegant exit"""" ,  it meant Lane died while technically employed at SCDP .  Rather than get embroiled in a questionable legal issue ,  Don elects to make a full refund of Lane's $50 , 000 fee to Rebecca Pryce .  In response ,  Rebecca claims that Lane was worth more to the agency than $50 , 000 and accuses Don and the partners of filling """"a man like that with ambition"""" ,  leading to his suicide .  She also accuses Don of egging her late husband into committing adultery .  Although true (by way of the prostitute) ,  Rebecca's basis is the wallet photo of the attractive woman Lane pilfered ,  which Don has no clue about and honestly tells Mrs .  Pryce he never saw that woman before .  Later ,  Don saw hallucinations of his brother ,  which were likely psychological as Adam's fate was the exact same as Lane's (hanged himself after Don told him """"I want you out of my life"""") .

After being elected to additional terms in 1974 and 1978 , From 1979 to 1981 ,  before Dwyer was state treasurer ,  public employees of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania overpaid millions of dollars in Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes (FICA) . In early 1984 ,  Dennis Schatzman ,  deputy controller of the Pittsburgh school district ,  noticed financial discrepancies in the CTA contract ,  and wrote to Pittsburgh school officials regarding these . An investigation into Dwyer's awarding of the CTA contract was undertaken by federal prosecutors .  Upon learning of this investigation ,  Dwyer rescinded the contract with CTA on July 11 ,  1984 .  After being indicted by a federal grand Jury ,  Dwyer was finally charged with agreeing to receive a kickback of $300 , 000 in return for awarding CTA the contract . Dwyer stated that he offered to take a polygraph exam but only on the condition that if he passed it ,  he would not be indicted .  The state rejected Dwyer's offer . I met with Dwyer in his office and at the insistence of Torquato offered to give him $300 , 000 if he signed a contract with CTA LTD .

It was revealed at Dwyer's trial that he sought and won approval for special legislation—Act 38 of 1984 (House Bill 1397)—that authorized him to recover the FICA overpayments ,  and that coded computer tape seized from CTA's office on July 6 ,  1984 ,  showed that Dwyer was to receive a $300 , 000 pay-off for awarding CTA the contract . Dwyer awarded the contract to CTA—an obscure California firm with three employees ,  little equipment ,  and little experience—despite being informed in April 1984 by the major Pennsylvania-based accounting firm Arthur Young and Associates (who had two hundred and fifty employees and submitted a proposal on April 13 ,  1984 ,  at least fourteen days prior to CTA's proposal) that they could perform the FICA recovery as fast as CTA for half the cost . Nevertheless ,  Dwyer denied any wrongdoing ,  stating that after the CTA contract was signed ,  Smith merely made a """"generic"""" offer to help him with his campaign . On December 18 ,  1986 ,  Dwyer was found guilty on 11 counts of conspiracy ,  mail fraud ,  perjury and interstate transportation in aid of racketeering ,  and consequently faced a sentence of up to 55 years imprisonment and a $300 , 000 fine . Accounting firm Levin-Horwath ultimately fulfilled the contract for $1 , 300 , 000 ,  with slightly over a third of the fee possibly being subject to rebate .  If CTA were to have performed the recovery work ,  Pennsylvania would have lost $6 , 000 , 000 . Pennsylvania law stated that Dwyer could not officially be removed from office until his sentencing in January . Dwyer continued to profess his innocence after being convicted ,  and on December 23 wrote a letter to President Ronald Reagan seeking a presidential pardon , The week of Dwyer's sentencing ,  Pennsylvania State Attorney General LeRoy Zimmerman and state prosecutors were investigating a provision of the Pennsylvania state constitution where removal of a civil worker from office who has been convicted of a crime is """"self-executing"""" ,  thus ,  automatic upon that person's sentencing .  A decision confirming this constitutional point was expected on January 22 ,  the day before Dwyer's sentencing hearing .   "

He joined the armed forces of the Congo ,  the Force Publique ,  as a lieutenant on 3 October 1890 ,  and embarked for the Congo the same day at Vlissingen .  He arrived in Boma on 2 November . After a short stint at Zobe ,  Costermans was appointed district commissioner of Stanley Pool (Léopoldville) ,  where he arrived on 26 May 1891 .  On 26 September ,  King Leopold II promoted him district commissioner 2nd class .  He undertook major construction projects for the burgeoning colonial town .  On 24 February 1892 ,  having fallen ill ,  he handed over his command and left Léopoldville for Boma ,  where he arrived on 10 March .  He embarked for Europe on 16 April and arrived a month later on 16 May . On 6 December 1892 ,  just over six months after having arrived in Europe ,  Costermans left again for Africa .  He was re-appointed district commissioner of Stanley Pool .  His was a nervous personality .  His habit of pacing his veranda at night led the locals to nickname him gondoko (leopard) .  In April 1894 he fell ill again and was ordered to return to Europe .  He left on 20 May and arrived on 24 June . Costermans' second convalescence in Europe lasted a little over a year .  He was back in the Congo on 6 September 1895 ,  again as district commissioner of Stanley Pool .  On 1 June 1897 he was promoted to the rank of district commissioner general .  He explored the territory of the Banfumu people along the Kasai river ,  which had been relatively neglected owing to the tribe's reported cannibalism .  When his term had ended he returned to Belgium on 25 August 1898 . On 1 March 1899 ,  Costermans departed for Léopoldville for the third time ,  this time as inspector-general of the Congo Free State .  On 16 March 1901 ,  he returned to Europe .  Later that year he was given a special commission to explore lake Kivu .  He departed from Antwerp for Naples ,  leaving Naples for Africa on 7 January 1902 .  This time he steamed down the eastern coast ,  arriving at Chinde in Portuguese East Africa .  He took the Zambezi into the interior before heading towards  the Ruzizi river and lake Kivu . Costermans returned to Europe in September 1903 ,  but re-embarked for the Congo on 5 January 1904 with the title of Vice Governor-General to take over the reins from Félix Fuchs .  His government coincided with the release of the Casement Report ,  a damning account of atrocities carried out in the Congo Free State .  On 9 March 1905 ,  in Banana ,  Costermans evaded his own security detail and shot himself dead .  This is generally thought to have been in response to renewed enquiries into Congo atrocities . Costermans was an honorary captain commanding the artillery of the Fortress of Antwerp ,  a knight of the Order of Leopold ,  an officer of the Royal Order of the Lion and a knight of the Order of the African Star and of the French Légion d'honneur .  He also wore the Service Star with four bars and the Military Cross 2nd class .  In 1927 ,  the village of Bukavu on the shore of lake Kivu was renamed Costermansville (Costermansstad in Dutch) .  It has since be restored to its original name .   "

*** "*page_ Hatazō_Adachi" "*cat_ People_who_committed_suicide_in_prison_custody" "   Adachi was promoted to colonel in 1934 ,  and was given command of the IJA 12th Infantry Regiment in 1936 .  During the Shanghai Incident of July 1937 ,  Adachi also gained a reputation of leading his troops from the front ,  where the fighting was the thickest .  He was injured by a mortar barrage in September ,  which permanently damaged his right leg . He was promoted to major general in 1938 ,  and promoted to commander of the IJA 26th Infantry Brigade .  Adachi had a reputation as a """"soldier's general"""" ,  sharing the miserable living conditions of his troops and welcoming open discussion with his officer and staff . Promoted to lieutenant general in August 1940 ,  he was commander of the IJA 37th Division at the Battle of South Shanxi .  In 1940 ,  he became a Chief of staff of the North China Area Army from 1941–1942 ,  during the height of its scorched earth campaigns against the Chinese forces . On 9 November 1942 ,  Adachi was appointed commander in chief of the newly formed 18th Army on Rabaul and the north coast of New Guinea from 1942–1945 .  The 18th Army contained the IJA 20th Division and IJA 41st Division ,  both of which arrived safely .  However ,  the IJA 51st Division ,  including Adachi and his senior staff ,  came under Allied air attack while en route from Rabaul to Lae ,  in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea .  All eight transport ships and four destroyers were sunk with the loss of 3 , 664 men ,  and only 2 , 427 men of the division were rescued . With the defeat of the Imperial Japanese Navy in the Solomon Islands campaign ,  and with landings of US forces led by Douglas MacArthur at Aitape and Hollandia from 22–27 April 1944 ,  isolated the vast majority of Adachi's forces .  His forces ,  suffering from malaria ,  heat exhaustion and malnutrition were rendered ineffective for the remainder of the war ,  despite Adachi's efforts to achieve some form of self-sufficiency by planting crops and giving priority in rations to the sick .  As ammunition began to run low ,  many of Adachi's commanders resorted to banzai charges against the Allied beachhead at Aitape rather than surrender .  By the end of the war in September 1945 ,  most of his forces had been annihilated .  Of Adachi's original 140 , 000 men ,  barely 13 , 000 were still alive when the war ended .  He surrendered to the Australian 6th Division at Cape Wom ,  by Wewak ,  New Guinea . At the end of the war ,  Adachi was taken into custody by the Australian government and charged with war crimes in connection with mistreatment and arbitrary execution of prisoners of war .  Although not personally involved in any of the atrocities mentioned ,  Adachi insisted on absorbing command responsibility for the actions of his subordinates during the military tribunal .  On 12 July 1947 he was sentenced to imprisonment for life .  On 10 September that year he killed himself in his quarters with a paring knife in the prisoners' compound at Rabaul ,  having first written a number of letters . In one of these ,  addressed to those officers and men of the Eighteenth Army who were then in the compound ,  he said : """"I felt it a great honour to have been appointed the C-in-C in November 1942 ,  at a time when the issue of the day was to be settled ,  and posted to the point of strategic importance in order to ensure that the tide of war moved in our favour .  I was thankful for that appointment .  However ,  notwithstanding the fact that my officers and men did their best in the exceptional circumstances ,  surmounting all difficulties ,  and that my superiors gave the utmost assistance ,  the hoped-for end was not attained ,  because of my inability .  Thus I paved the way for my country to be driven into the present predicament .  The crime deserves death .  During the past three years of operations more than 100 , 000 youthful and promising officers and men were lost and most of them died of malnutrition .  When I think of this ,  I know not what apologies to make to His Majesty the Emperor and I feel that I myself am overwhelmed with shame  .   .   .   .  I have demanded perseverance far exceeding the limit of man's endurance of my officers and men ,  who were exhausted and emaciated as a result of successive campaigns and for want of supplies .  However ,  my officers and men all followed my orders in silence without grumbling ,  and ,  when exhausted ,  they succumbed to death just like flowers falling in the winds .  God knows how I felt when I saw them dying ,  my bosom being filled with pity for them ,  though it was solely to their country that they dedicated their lives .  At that time I made up my mind not to set foot on my country's soil again but to remain as a clod of earth in the Southern Seas with the 100 , 000 officers and men ,  even if a time should come when I would be able to return to my country in triumph .

*** "*page_ Sarah_Brown_Ingersoll_Cooper" "*cat_ Deaths_from_asphyxiation" "   After her graduation from college ,  she went to Augusta ,  Georgia ,  as a governess in the family of Governor William Schley .  On the Governor's plantation ,  there were 500 or more slaves , While in Augusta ,  in 1855 ,  she married Halsey Fenimore Cooper ,  also a Cazenovia Seminary graduate , Being abolitionists , Her first Bible class in San Francisco was in the Howard Presbyterian Church ,  where Dr .  Scudder was filling the pulpit .  From there ,  she went to the Calvary Presbyterian Church . Still later ,  opened the class in the First Congregational Church .  That class numbered over 300 members and embraced persons representing many religious sects ,  including the Jewish and the Roman Catholic faiths .  While the credit of establishing the first free kindergarten in San Francisco is due to Prof .  Felix Adler and a few of his friends ,  yet the credit of the extraordinary growth of the work is almost entirely due to Mrs .  Cooper ,  who paid a visit to the Silver street free kindergarten in November ,  1878 ,  and from that moment became the leader of the kindergarten work and the friend of the training school for kindergarten teachers . The rapid growth of the free kindergarten system in California had its first impulse in six articles written by Mrs .  Cooper for the San Francisco Bulletin in 1879 .  The first of these was entitled """"The Kindergarten ,  a Remedy for Hoodlumism , """" and was of vital interest to the public ,  for just at that time ,  ruffianism was so terrific ,  that a vigilance committee was organized to protect the citizens .  The second article was """"The History of the Silver Street Free Kindergarten . """" That aroused immediate interest among philanthropic people .  In the early part of 1878 ,  there was not a free Kindergarten on the western side of the Rocky Mountains ;  by 1892 ,  there were 65 in San Francisco ,  and several others in progress of organization .  Outside of San Francisco ,  they extended from the extreme northern part of Washington to Southern California and New Mexico ,  and they formed in Oregon ,  Nevada ,  and Colorado ,  and in almost every large city and town in California .  Mrs .  Cooper attributed the rapid strides in that work in San Francisco to the fact that wealthy persons ,  induced to study the work for themselves ,  became convinced of its permanent and essential value to the State .  The second free kindergarten in San Francisco was opened under the auspices of Cooper's Bible class ,  in October ,  1879 . In 1882 ,  Mrs .  Leland Stanford ,  who had been an active helper in the work from the very first ,  dedicated a large sum for the establishment of free kindergartens ,  in San Francisco and in adjacent towns ,  in memory of her son .

He joined the paramilitary Hitler Youth (Hitlerjugend ,  HJ) in 1932 . During the summer of 1942 ,  after replacing Hauptsturmführer Herbert Lange at Chełmno ,  Hans Bothmann made substantial changes to the camp's killing methods .  The improvements were prompted by two incidents in March and April of that year .  First ,  the gas van broke down on the highway while full of living victims .  Soon after that ,  the Sauer van exploded while the driver was revving its engine at the loading ramp ;  the gassing compartment was full of living Jews .  The explosion blew off the locked back door ,  and badly burned the victims inside .  Drivers were replaced .  Bothmann's modifications to the killing methods included adding poison to gasoline .  There is evidence that some red powder and a fluid were delivered from Germany by Maks Sado freight company ,  in order to kill the victims more quickly .  Another major change involved parking the gas vans while the prisoners were killed .  They were no longer driven en route to the forest cremation area with living victims inside . The Chełmno death factory ,  credited with the murder of at least 180 , 000 Jews before the war's end (see Chełmno Trials for supplementary data) , In September 1944 ,  the SS brought in new Commando 1005 to exhume and cremate any remaining evidence of genocide .

*** "*page_ Kenny_Carter" "*cat_ Murder–suicides_in_the_United_Kingdom" "   Carter was born in Halifax ,  West Yorkshire .  He was widely regarded as a future World Champion and become the World Pairs Champion with Peter Collins in 1983 .  He took on six-time World Champion Ivan Mauger as his manager in 1981 who set him up with a Weslake bike and Carter qualified for the 1981 World Final run in front of 92 , 500 fans at Wembley Stadium .  He finished 5th in 1981 and repeated the result in 1982 in Los Angeles after a controversial Heat 14 exclusion following a coming together with defending champion (and eventual 1982 winner) ,  arch rival Bruce Penhall in which Carter fell and was excluded for being the reason the race had to be stopped (Carter slid through the fence) .  Amazingly ,  Kenny finished 5th again in 1983 at Norden in West Germany . Kenny Carter also won the British League Riders' Championship in 1981 and 1982 . Carter was British Champion in 1984 and 1985 ,  and later that year appeared as a television commentator alongside Dave Lanning for the 1985 World Final at the Odsal Stadium in Bradford for which he had failed to qualify after breaking his leg in the Intercontinental Final in Sweden .  Less than one year later ,  Carter shot dead his wife ,  Pamela ,  before turning the gun on himself at their home ,  Grey Horse Farm ,  in Bradshaw ,  West Yorkshire . Outspoken and not afraid to stand up for himself ,  Kenny Carter was not universally popular with other riders ,  even those who were his team mates in the Halifax team or the England team .  In a television interview during the 1984 British Final (which he won despite a broken right leg) he stated that some of his England team mates had been verbally criticising him for his desire to continue riding .  Most of the riders' frustrations came from the wet track conditions ,  which they felt were dangerous to ride in . Carter was also seen often talking to the referee of meetings either after being excluded from a race or to get his point of view across .  His most famous joust with a referee came after his exclusion from Heat 14 of the 1982 World Final .  After pleading his case he failed to change Torrie Kittlesen's mind .  He then told Kittlesen that his decision had cost him the World Championship .  Following this ,  Carter walked onto the track and stood at the starting tapes in a vain attempt to prevent the re-run heat going ahead without him ,  with most of the 40 , 000 strong crowd at the Los Angeles Coliseum (who were firmly behind home town hero Penhall) booing him loudly .  Carter then had to be physically removed from the track by security personnel and his manager Ivan Mauger .  Despite Carter's contention that Penhall had deliberately knocked him off his bike ,  amateur video footage of the incident later fully vindicated Kittlesen's decision ,  as it showed that although Penhall and Carter had been bumping each other all the way along the front straight ,  they had not touched in the turn leading up to Carter's fall . Carter was the older brother of Grand Prix motorcycle road racer Alan Carter .   "

*** "*page_ Theresa_Duncan" "*cat_ Suicides_in_New_York_City" "   Collaborating with her boyfriend Jeremy Blake ,  Duncan created three influential CD-ROM computer games for young girls in the second half of the 1990s :  Chop Suey ,  Smarty ,  and Zero Zero .  These games were designed as alternatives to her traditionally male-oriented field where the few """"girls' games"""" created embodied a """"model of boy-catching self-fulfillment"""" . All three games created by Duncan are story-based and revolve around search and discovery .  1995's Chop Suey is an interactive storybook ,  where two young girls explore the town of Cortland ,  Ohio .  Smarty (1996) tells the story of the titular young girl's visit to her Aunt Olive for the summer—there she hosts a spelling radio show ,  explores small-town life ,  and visit a mysterious dime store . Chop Suey was co-created with Monica Gesue and narrated by then-unknown author David Sedaris .  Gesue strived to design a """"colorful ,  warm ,  and bright"""" game that contrasted with the way """"a lot of computer graphics at the time were really icky"""" . Duncan spoke frequently of a proposed game for older girls called Apocalipstick .  She described it as something that """"moves like Doom"""" ,  and """"involves survivors of a cataclysmic destructive event who find the few films that remain ,  which happen to be solely swanky thirties Thin Man-style flicks .  .  . In 2000 ,  Duncan created The History of Glamour ,  a digitally animated hour-long video .  Writing for Salon ,  Matthew Debord described the work as """"a merciless satire of New York's incestuous '90s cultural moment :  fashion ,  art ,  celebrity and various downtown style tribes converge and are shredded for our delectation"""" . Duncan also published frequently .  She wrote articles for publications like Artforum ,  Slate ,  Feed Magazine ,  and Bald Ego ,  and published her own blog called The Wit of the Staircase .  At her blog ,  Duncan listed her interests as """"film ,  philology ,  Vietnam War memorabilia ,  rare and discontinued perfume ,  book collecting ,  philately ,  card and coin tricks ,  futurism ,  Napoleon Bonaparte ,  the history of electricity . """"Duncan's CD-ROMs are widely celebrated .  Chop Suey has the broadest reputation .  Upon its release ,  Entertainment Weekly named it 1995's """"CD-ROM of the Year"""" and was generally praised by reviewers . Because her games were designed on CD-ROMs to be played on operating systems that are """"no longer possible to install on modern computers"""" ,  the games were effectively inaccessible to most people .  Duncan was found dead in the East Village ,  Manhattan apartment she shared with Blake on July 10 ,  2007 .  The official cause of death was suicide as a result of the combined ingestion of Tylenol PM—a combination of acetaminophen and diphenhydramine—and alcohol . The circumstances of Duncan's death led to much media attention ,  including major articles in Vanity Fair and New York magazine . The Law & Order episode """"Bogeyman"""" in season 18 is loosely based on the deaths of Duncan and Blake .  In the episode ,  the body of the character paralleling Theresa Duncan has forensic evidence that calls into question her suicide ,  while the Jeremy Blake parallel character survives his suicide attempt .  A legal case against him is disrupted by the cult group ,  resulting in a near mistrial followed by a plea accepted after the ADA implies both he and the judge are connected to the cult . Baron von Luxxury's 2012 album The Last Seduction features several songs about Duncan and Blake ,  who were his friends .  "

All three games created by Duncan are story-based and revolve around search and discovery .  1995's Chop Suey is an interactive storybook ,  where two young girls explore the town of Cortland ,  Ohio .  Smarty (1996) tells the story of the titular young girl's visit to her Aunt Olive for the summer—there she hosts a spelling radio show ,  explores small-town life ,  and visit a mysterious dime store . Chop Suey was co-created with Monica Gesue and narrated by then-unknown author David Sedaris .  Gesue strived to design a """"colorful ,  warm ,  and bright"""" game that contrasted with the way """"a lot of computer graphics at the time were really icky"""" .

Duncan was found dead in the East Village ,  Manhattan apartment she shared with Blake on July 10 ,  2007 .  The official cause of death was suicide as a result of the combined ingestion of Tylenol PM—a combination of acetaminophen and diphenhydramine—and alcohol .

""""Darrow taught me more law than I had known before , """" Crum said later . In 1934 ,  Neylan ,  """"along with Bartley Crum ,  a young associate who functioned as an administrative aide , """" called newspaper publishers together to take a stand against the 1934 West Coast Longshore Strike and accompanying San Francisco General strike . In 1938 ,  Crum left Neylan and set up a law office with Philip Ehrlich and David A .  Silver .   In 1938 or 1939 ,  he joined the National Lawyers Guild  as an organization of progressive and Communist lawyers to counter the conservative National Bar Association (NLG) , Crum worked in the 1940 and 1944 campaigns of U . S .  presidential candidate Wendell Willkie . In 1943 ,  Crum served as special counsel on FDR's Fair Employment Practices Committee . In October 1944 ,  Crum served as an attorney for Harry Bridges .   In November 1944 ,  Crum sent a letter to the Civil Service Commission on behalf of Larry Resner on the subject of loyalty charges . On March 18 ,  1945 ,  Crum signed a statement issued by the National Federation for Constitutional Liberties ,  advertised in the Daily Worker . On January 1 ,  1946 ,  Crum accepted an invitation to join the Anglo-American Commission of Inquiry on Palestine (AACIP) that advised President Harry Truman to support the opening of the British Mandate of Palestine to unrestricted Jewish immigration and to ease restrictions on Jewish land purchases . As vice president of the NLG's state chapter and with Kenny as president ,  Crum entered into increasing prominent issues involving civil rights of left-leaning people . In 1946 ,  Crum answered Paul Robeson in his """"crusade call"""" and endorsed the American Crusade Against Lynching (ACAL) organization . In 1947 ,  Crum served as attorney for some of the so-called """"Hollywood Ten"""" (originally the """"Unfriendly Nineteen"""") ,  subpoenaed to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee .  National Lawyers Guild members formed the core team ,  originally Charles Katz and Ben Margolis , During pre-hearing preparation ,  the Nineteen and their lawyers negotiated and agreed to a strategy of unanimity as well as a please to cite the First Amendment of the United States Constitution .   His daughter recalled :      I first learned about the Hollywood blacklist on Nov .  24 ,  1947 .  I remember the exact moment .  I was standing with my father ,  Bartley Crum ,  by a phone booth near Union Square in San Francisco ,  feeding him nickels and dimes while he made a series of intense phone calls to Dore Schary ,  who was the head of MGM .   If you're wondering why he had to make those calls from a pay phone ,  it's because our home phone was bugged by the F . B . I .  At that point I was too young to quite grasp the significance of those bugged calls ,  but I did know that my father had been one of six lawyers who had just defended the Hollywood 10 in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in Washington .      She also recorded differences between Communist and non-Communist lawyers (in which latter camp Crum was) ,  contrary to other accounts of greater unity among lawyers . In 1948 ,  due to blowback from the HUAC Hollywood hearings ,  Crum moved his family from the San Francisco Bay area to New York City . In 1948 ,  Crum's name appeared as a member of the board of directors of the California Labor School ,  listed as a subversive organization by US Attorney General Tom C .

Already in August 1950 ,  HUAC had re-subpoenaed four witness who had been part of Whittaker Chambers's Ware Group :   Lee Pressman ,  Nathan Witt ,  Charles Kramer and John Abt .   The committee had asked both Pressman and Kramer whether they knew Lowenthal ;  both confirmed .  Lowenthal brought former U . S .  Senator Burton K .  Wheeler as counsel .   After reviewing his curriculum vitae ,  the committee tried to link him with known Communist Party members and organizations ,  some of which he confirmed ,  others not ,  all without admitting any wrongdoing .  Names mentioned included :   Crum ,  Alger Hiss ,  Donald Hiss ,  David Wahl ,  Martin Popper ,  Allan Rosenberg ,  Lee Pressman ,  the Russian-American Industrial Corporation ,  the Twentieth Century Fund ,  and the International Juridical Association . In the 1952 United States presidential election ,  Crum supported Adlai E .  Stevenson (Democrat) over Dwight D .  Eisenhower (Republican) . In 1953 ,  syndicated columnist Westbrook Pegler wrote of Crum :        I telephoned Bartley Crum ,  a California lawyer with offices in New York and a Red record so bad that he hangs his head in shame ,  and asked whether Lowenthal had had any real connection with the Hollywood Reds and their friends ,  the so-called Hollywood Committee on the First Amendment .  .  .   Incidentally ,  he became counsel for Drew Pearson in one of his dragging suits against me but finally came into my lawyer's office to say that he had never forsaken his Catholicism and that he was ashamed of his Red record .  During the examination of the Hollywood Reds ,  Crum consulted Lowenthal because he regarded the man as an expert on the procedures and the authority of congressional committees .   Crum says Lowenthal told him the best course was to tell the committee frankly whether this or that one was a member of the Communist Party .   By contrast with this advice Lowenthal himself in his appearance before the House committee was remarkably vague on many matters .   However ,  on careful review of his old testimony I conclude that my early impression was incorrect that he positively withheld the names of """"organizations"""" which arranged for his appointment to a job on Gen .

It was not up to him to volunteer the information and I know the committee regarded the subject as a hot potato .   He did admit knowing a number of the most notorious Reds of the movement but his voluntary estimate of the political character of his friend ,  Crum ,  is laughable in view of Crum's own admission to my attorneys and to Alfred Kohlberg ,  one of the most effective Red-baiters in the country ,  that he was ashamed of his activity in the Red movement ,  Lowenthal said :   """"I had confidence in his true Americanism . """" Thus ,  Lowenthal's notion of true Americanism is peculiar or his knowledge of Crum's activities up to then was faulty .

Their first exhibit ,  called New Pictures ,  was in 1909 ,  and in 1911 ,  they opened another called The Eight .  Other members included Károly Kernstok ,  Béla Czóbel ,  Róbert Berény ,  Ödön Márffy ,  Deszső Orbán ,  Lajos Tihanyi and Bertalan Pór .  The sculptors Márk Vedres and Vilmos Fémes Beck were also associated with them . While they had just three exhibits as a group ,  the painters were influential as part of the radical intellectual life in the city ,  and participated in related events in literature and music ;  they were important through 1918 .  Among the writers and composers involved with The Eight was Endre Ady ,  and Czigány was one of at least four men who painted a portrait of this pivotal figure and friend in the early 20th century .  The composer Béla Bartók was also associated with these artists . By 1914 ,  Czigány was one of four of the group accepted for an exhibit at the Vienna Künstlerhaus ,  together with Márffy ,  Orbán ,  and Kernstok .  The works of Berény and Tihanyi ,  who had embraced expressionism ,  were rejected as too radical . He painted many still lifes in numerous variations . Unlike several members of the group who left in 1919 after the fall of the Hungarian Democratic Republic ,  Czigány stayed in Hungary for most of his career .  In his later life ,  he also painted numerous self-portraits ,  always with a serious expression on his face . Suffering from depression ,  in 1937 Czigány killed his family and committed suicide . Shortly after the end of World War II ,  a solo retrospective exhibition was held in Budapest to honor Czigány's art work .  The opening of the Eastern Bloc in the late twentieth century has stimulated renewed interest in these artists who introduced modernist movements .  In the 21st century ,  there have been several exhibits about the modernists :  a 2004 exhibit on the Fauvists in Hungary at the Hungarian National Gallery .  The centenary of The Eight's first exhibit has prompted two group shows to explore their work in 2011 and 2012 in Hungary and Austria ,  respectively .   "

*** "*page_ C._J._De_Garis" "*cat_ Suicides_by_gas" "   De Garis' father had established a successful market garden business in Mildura from about 1885 . De Garis expanded the business rapidly ,  and in 1910 borrowed heavily to establish a packing shed ,  Sarnia Packing Pty Ltd ,  which later became part of the Sunbeam Foods Group .   In 1913 he borrowed again to purchase the 10 , 009-acre (4 , 050ha) Pyap Village Estate at Pyap ,  near Loxton in South Australia .   £23 , 000 was raised from the sale . In 1919 ,  a shortage of shipping space hit the dried fruits industry which was ,  at that time ,  highly dependent on British markets .   Realising his ability to market ,  the Australian Dried Fruits Association funded De Garis to undertake an Australia-wide publicity campaign to increase domestic consumption .  He also expanded into book publishing ,  as well as producing the Sunraysia Daily newspaper in Mildura ,  which employed nearly 100 staff . Also in 1919 ,  De Garis exposed a con-man ,  with a 'rank but not-too-well-sustained American accent' ,  named George Henry Cochrane .  Cochrane wrote for The Bulletin as """"Grant Hervey"""" ,  and had recently been released from prison for forgery and uttering .  Cochrane emerged in Mildura and presented himself to two thousand Mildura citizens ,  selling the idea that western Victoria ,  including Mildura ,  should secede from Victoria .  He started receiving £5 subscriptions before De Garis revealed his true identity and criminal record . As part of his dried-fruits marketing De Garis travelled to Western Australia where ,  in 1920 ,  he purchased the 47 , 000-acre (19 , 000ha) property of the Hassell family at Kendenup ,  for the purpose of building a new settlement to grow apples ,  potatoes and farm produce .  He subdivided the land into blocks ranging from 10 acres (4ha) to 60 acres (24ha) ,  and set up the De Garis Kendenup (W . A . ) Development Company ,  and the Kendenup Fruit Packing Company ,  which ran a dehydrating factory to process vegetables and fruit grown by the 350 settlers who he had encouraged into the area .  In December 1921 ,  De Garis and his family were living there ,  and the enterprise was under way ,  with a townsite being established .  However the settlement eventually foundered .  It had insufficient capital and the lot sizes were uneconomically small .  De Garis travelled to the United States to raise urgently needed capital ,  which was promised but was never forthcoming .   After two years ,  only 30 settlers remained . The collapse of the settlement was the subject of a 1923 Western Australian Royal Commission into Kendenup land schemes ,  in which fraud had been alleged .  De Garis was eventually cleared of any charges .   "

He started receiving £5 subscriptions before De Garis revealed his true identity and criminal record . As part of his dried-fruits marketing De Garis travelled to Western Australia where ,  in 1920 ,  he purchased the 47 , 000-acre (19 , 000ha) property of the Hassell family at Kendenup ,  for the purpose of building a new settlement to grow apples ,  potatoes and farm produce .  He subdivided the land into blocks ranging from 10 acres (4ha) to 60 acres (24ha) ,  and set up the De Garis Kendenup (W . A . ) Development Company ,  and the Kendenup Fruit Packing Company ,  which ran a dehydrating factory to process vegetables and fruit grown by the 350 settlers who he had encouraged into the area .  In December 1921 ,  De Garis and his family were living there ,  and the enterprise was under way ,  with a townsite being established .  However the settlement eventually foundered .  It had insufficient capital and the lot sizes were uneconomically small .  De Garis travelled to the United States to raise urgently needed capital ,  which was promised but was never forthcoming .   After two years ,  only 30 settlers remained . The collapse of the settlement was the subject of a 1923 Western Australian Royal Commission into Kendenup land schemes ,  in which fraud had been alleged .  De Garis was eventually cleared of any charges .   "

He also studied at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington ,  London ,  from 1899 .  He specialised in the then-new science of forensic pathology . In October 1905 ,  he was appointed resident assistant pathologist at St Mary's Hospital when the London County Council requested all general hospitals in its area appoint two qualified pathologists to perform autopsies following sudden deaths .   In this capacity ,  he worked closely with coroners such as Bentley Purchase . The case that brought Spilsbury to public attention was that of Hawley Harvey Crippen in 1910 ,  where he gave forensic evidence as to the likely identity of the human remains found in Crippen's house .  Spilsbury concluded that a scar on a small piece of skin from the remains pointed to Mrs Crippen as the victim . Spilsbury later gave evidence at the trial of Herbert Rowse Armstrong ,  the solicitor convicted of poisoning his wife with arsenic . The case that consolidated Spilsbury's reputation as Britain's foremost forensic pathologist was the """"Brides in the Bath"""" murder trial in 1915 .  Three women had died mysteriously in their baths ;  in each case ,  the death appeared to be an accident .  George Joseph Smith was brought to trial for the murder of one of these women ,  Bessie Munday .  Spilsbury testified that since Munday's thigh showed evidence of goose bumps and ,  since she was ,  in death ,  clutching a bar of soap ,  it was certain that she had died a violent death– in other words ,  had been murdered .  Spilsbury was also involved in the Brighton trunk murder cases .  Although the man accused of the second murder ,  Tony Mancini ,  was acquitted ,  he confessed to the killing just before his own death ,  many years later ,  vindicating Spilsbury's evidence . Spilsbury was able to work with minimal remains ,  such as those involved in the Alfred Rouse case (the """"Blazing Car Murder"""") .  Here ,  a near-destroyed body was found in the wreck of a burnt-out car near Northampton in 1930 .  Although the victim was never identified ,  Spilsbury was able to give evidence of how he had died and facilitate Rouse's conviction . During his career ,  Spilsbury performed thousands of autopsies ,  not only of murder victims but also of executed criminals .  He was able to appear for the defence in Scotland ,  where his status as a Home Office pathologist in England and Wales was irrelevant :  he testified for the defence in the case of Donald Merrett ,  tried in February 1927 for the murder of his mother and acquitted as not proven . Spilsbury was knighted early in 1923 .  He was a Home Office-approved pathologist and lecturer in forensic medicine at the University College Hospital ,  the London School of Medicine for Women and at St Thomas's Hospital .  He also was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine . In later years ,  Spilbury's dogmatic manner and his unbending belief in his own infallibility gave rise to criticism .

*** "*page_ Hughie_Ferguson" "*cat_ Suicides_by_gas" "   Ferguson started his career with local youth sides in his hometown of Motherwell and represented the Dalziel School's team where he played as a half back .  He moved on to the Motherwell branch of the Boys' Brigade and later Motherwell Hearts as an outside forward where he helped the club reach the Scottish Juvenile Cup final .  He joined Parkhead Juniors in 1914 , Ahead of the 1915–16 season ,  with Scottish football continuing during the First World War ,  Ferguson held talks with his hometown side Motherwell and missed the start of Parkhead's opening game of the campaign after extensive talks with Motherwell manager John Hunter ran late . Syd Puddefoot later recalled a match against Shettleston in the Scottish Junior Cup in which Ferguson played that had been delayed and risked him missing an appointment .  He proceeded to score eight times for Parkhead before feigning injury in order to leave the game early with the result no longer in doubt .  Parkhead went on to win the game 11–1 . After the 1916 final ,  many of Parkhead's squad were signed by professional clubs . Ferguson came close to signing for Celtic , In the opening game of the 1917–18 season ,  Ferguson opened his account for the new campaign by netting all four of Motherwell's goals during a 4–2 victory over Third Lanark . Motherwell began the following year in poor form ,  scoring only twice in their opening five matches ,  one of which was claimed by Ferguson . Ferguson scored his first goals of the 1919–20 season by netting a hat-trick in an opening game victory over Dundee . Despite his absence ,  by the end of January 1920 ,  Ferguson remained tied with James Williamson of Hibernians as the league's top goalscorer with 21 . Ferguson continued his good form into the 1920–21 season and netted four of his side's goal during a 6–0 win over Queen's Park early in the campaign . One month later ,  Ferguson scored four in a single game for the third time during the season ,  this time in a 6–1 win over Ayr United . During the opening months of the 1921–22 season ,  Ferguson scored his first hat-trick of the campaign against Dumbarton in October , At the end of the 1921–22 season Ferguson was placed on the transfer list by Motherwell at his own behest , Having scored six times by mid-October ,  Ferguson was called up to the Scottish League XI for a match against Ireland when George French withdrew due to injury . In the summer of 1923 ,  Third Lanark arranged a tour of South America , Despite his prolific scoring record ,  at the beginning of the 1924–25 season ,  Motherwell experimented by moving Ferguson to inside right rather than his usual central position . Despite his listing ,  Ferguson remained with Motherwell for the start of the 1925–26 season and began the campaign by scoring a brace in a victory over Clydebank on the opening day . In November 1925 ,  officials from Welsh side Cardiff City submitted an offer for Ferguson .  Their bid was rejected but they returned to meet Motherwell's asking price soon after ; After scoring once in his first three appearances ,  Ferguson embarked on a goalscoring run .  He netted seven times in his next five games ,  including the winning goals in matches against Bolton Wanderers ,  Notts County and West Bromwich Albion .  In his first season ,  Ferguson finished as the club's top goalscorer with 19 league goals ,  despite having played in only half of Cardiff's matches .  His tally also included his first hat-trick in the Football League during a 4–2 victory over Notts County in April 1926 .  Cardiff ended the campaign in 16th place ,  avoiding relegation . He was again the club's top goalscorer in the 1926–27 season ,  netting 26 times in 39 league games , Having featured at inside right in all rounds leading up to the final ,  Ernie Curtis ,  the 19‑year‑old teammate of Ferguson said of the goal : Ferguson's goal led Cardiff to become the only team from outside England to have won the competition as they went on to win the match 1–0 . Ferguson scored a penalty on the opening day of the 1928–29 season to give his side a 1–1 draw against Newcastle United .  In the team's second match ,  he set a club record for goals in a league game after scoring 5 times against Burnley on 1 September 1928 as Cardiff ran out 7–0 winners . Ferguson returned to Scotland with Dundee in June 1929 .  Cardiff had hoped to recoup £1 , 000 for him but the transfer was eventually completed for around £800 .  Ferguson sank into depression and it was remarked that he displayed a """"melancholy demeanour and evident physical suffering"""" in early January 1930 . He was aged 34 ,  and left behind his wife Jessie and two children .  "

In the summer of 1923 ,  Third Lanark arranged a tour of South America , Despite his prolific scoring record ,  at the beginning of the 1924–25 season ,  Motherwell experimented by moving Ferguson to inside right rather than his usual central position . Despite his listing ,  Ferguson remained with Motherwell for the start of the 1925–26 season and began the campaign by scoring a brace in a victory over Clydebank on the opening day . In November 1925 ,  officials from Welsh side Cardiff City submitted an offer for Ferguson .  Their bid was rejected but they returned to meet Motherwell's asking price soon after ; After scoring once in his first three appearances ,  Ferguson embarked on a goalscoring run .  He netted seven times in his next five games ,  including the winning goals in matches against Bolton Wanderers ,  Notts County and West Bromwich Albion .  In his first season ,  Ferguson finished as the club's top goalscorer with 19 league goals ,  despite having played in only half of Cardiff's matches .  His tally also included his first hat-trick in the Football League during a 4–2 victory over Notts County in April 1926 .  Cardiff ended the campaign in 16th place ,  avoiding relegation . He was again the club's top goalscorer in the 1926–27 season ,  netting 26 times in 39 league games , Having featured at inside right in all rounds leading up to the final ,  Ernie Curtis ,  the 19‑year‑old teammate of Ferguson said of the goal : Ferguson's goal led Cardiff to become the only team from outside England to have won the competition as they went on to win the match 1–0 . Ferguson scored a penalty on the opening day of the 1928–29 season to give his side a 1–1 draw against Newcastle United .  In the team's second match ,  he set a club record for goals in a league game after scoring 5 times against Burnley on 1 September 1928 as Cardiff ran out 7–0 winners . Ferguson returned to Scotland with Dundee in June 1929 .  Cardiff had hoped to recoup £1 , 000 for him but the transfer was eventually completed for around £800 .  Ferguson sank into depression and it was remarked that he displayed a """"melancholy demeanour and evident physical suffering"""" in early January 1930 . He was aged 34 ,  and left behind his wife Jessie and two children .  "

He wrote many articles ,  perhaps most importantly one in which he developed the theory of global parallelism ,  which he cowrote with Emilio Mignone ,  and presented at the Colloquium of Paris .   "

From there he went to Algiers just in time to take a place with the British troops landing at Salerno ,  Italy in September .  He went in with the second wave—the assault wave which took the full force of German shells ,  and later made a number of battle-action recordings which were broadcast to the United States . During the conquest of southern Italy ,  Hollenbeck moved northward with the troops and was one of the first correspondents to begin broadcasting from Naples when the Army Signal Corps set up transmitters for the correspondents .  But at Salerno he was stricken with malaria ,  then with jaundice and ordered back home :       The first big event for me in covering the news over there was at Salerno ,  just south of the town .  I'll never forget it! We were on a headquarters ship and had put the commanding officer ashore ,  then for a while feared we couldn't get the rest of the people off .  We were under heavy fire ,  so had to back off and spend that morning shuttling back and forth in the bay with German aircraft overhead and German '88' guns on shore ,  and behind us our own destroyers and cruisers bombarding the shore positions ,  so it was not a very pleasant cruise we had around the gulf of Salerno .  .  .  I had a wire recorder with me and was on top of the landing craft trying to make some records at the time .        Asked what kind of protection there was after these forces had landed ,  Hollenbeck replied :       You hope there is air cover .  We had difficulty that way because our forces were based in Sicily .  They had to fly all the way ,  and it didn't give them very much gas to spend over our heads .

From Stars and Stripes September 20 ,  1943 :       Don Hollenbeck of NBC sent back from Italy one of the most dramatic recordings we've ever heard .

Clad in shorts and bathrobe ,  he was found lying on the kitchen floor .  All burners on the gas stove were open .  The assistant medical examiner pronounced the death a suicide .

Like every member of his family ,  some of which were illiterate ,  his time was mostly consumed working in the fields ,  until he tried his luck by presenting himself to a travelling casting team in 1948 .  Fuelled by their praise ,  and the growing want to travel ,  he went to Budapest to enter the Academy of Drama ,  where he was admitted after the first hearing .  The young boy ,  only turning 18 ,  was overwhelmed with the buzzing life of the capital ,  as he rarely even travelled to the county seat before .  Soós entered a class filled with talent ,  including Irén Psota ,  Józsa Hacser ,  and Teri Horváth .  As later documents showed ,  his teachers praised him with high words ,  partially influenced by his forced political involvement ,  that left a strong mark on his later career . He began filming in 1948 ,  to complement his livelihood .  Getting a minor role in Talpalatnyi föld ,  he filled his role of a chanting peasant boy with past memories ,  gaining instant ,  albeit unintentional attention .  The true success comes with his leading role in 1949's Lúdas Matyi ,  the first Hungarian color film ,  in which his life-filled folk-tale character gained success all over the country ,  and abroad - he became the best male actor on the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival of 1950 ,  the highest ranking prize in socialist countries of the era .  As the political climate pressed filmmakers for more realistic presentation of young peasants ,  workers ,  Soós seemed ideal to fill this role ,  especially as he was """"raised from poverty"""" ,  and achieved a lot compared to his comrades .  This ideological background haunted his later life . As his fame grew potentially ,  Soós's self-estimation shrank with it .  Aware of his shortcomings ,  he became more and more closed to others ,  and humble ,  studying extensively to make up for his missing high school graduation .  He works in films all along the academy years ,  finishing in 1952 .  After graduation ,  he gets an offer to work in the Madách Theatre ,  but is denied by the authorities ,  and is sent to the Csokonai Imre Theatre of Debrecen with the intention to serve as an example in his home .  He spends 3 years commuting between filming in the capital and Debrecen ,  where surrounded by fear and bad reputation of being a poster boy of the communists . In 1955 he was finally allowed to work in Madách Theatre ,  however ,  he was not allowed to play certain roles .  By 1955 he finishes Körhinta ,  a film that becomes one of the most acclaimed piece of Hungarian cinema . The media of the time ,  highly motivated by politics ,  dealt with him in varying pace .  If the instructed subject was fitting to Soós ,  he was over-popularized ,  when the government's focus was elsewhere ,  he was completely omitted .  This constant change of values weighted heavily on the actor ,  questioning his own worth ,  despite national and international success ,  the latter ignored by newspapers .  Trying to bury himself with work ,  and to meet more and more expectations ,  he slowly sank into depression ,  along with drug usage and alcohol problems .

*** "*page_ Eleanor_Marx" "*cat_ Suicides_by_poison" "   In 1884 ,  Eleanor joined the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) led by Henry Hyndman and was elected to its executive .  During her work in the SDF ,  she met Edward Aveling ,  with whom she would spend the rest of her life despite his faithlessness ,  thievery from the movement ,  and mental cruelty . In 1885 ,  after some bitter polemics ,  there was a split in the organization .  Eleanor Marx and some others left SDF ,  and founded the rival Socialist League . The split had two root causes :  personality problems ,  as Hyndman was accused of leading the SDF in a dictatorial fashion , Other leaders of the Socialist League were Ernest Belfort Bax ,  Sam Mainwaring ,  and Tom Mann ,  the latter two being representatives of the working class .  Annie Besant was also an active member . Marx wrote a regular column called """"Record of the Revolutionary International Movement"""" for the Socialist League's monthly newspaper ,  Commonweal . In 1884 ,  Marx met Clementina Black ,  a painter and trade unionist ,  and became involved in the Women's Trade Union League .  She would go on to support numerous strikes including the Bryant & May strike of 1888 and the London Dock Strike of 1889 .  She spoke to the Silvertown strikers at an open meeting in November 1889 alongside her friends Edith Ellis and Honor Brooke .  She helped organise the Gasworkers' Union and wrote numerous books and articles . In 1885 ,  she helped organise the International Socialist Congress in Paris . By the late 1880s ,  the Socialist League was deeply divided between those advocating political action and its opponents – who were themselves split between those like William Morris who felt that parliamentary campaigns represented inevitable compromises and corruptions ,  and an anarchist wing which opposed all electoral politics as a matter of principle .  Marx and Aveling ,  as firm advocates of the principle of participation in political campaigns ,  found themselves in an uncomfortable minority in the party .  At the 4th Annual Conference of the Socialist League the Bloomsbury branch ,  to which Marx and Aveling belonged ,  moved that a meeting of all socialist bodies should be called to discuss the formation of a united organisation .  This resolution was voted down by a substantial margin ,  as was another put forward by the same branch in support of contesting seats in both local and parliamentary elections .  Moreover ,  the Socialist League at this occasion suspended the 80 members of the Bloomsbury branch on the grounds that the group had put up candidates jointly with the SDF ,  against the policy of the party .  The Bloomsbury branch thus exited the Socialist League for a new ,  albeit brief ,  independent existence as the Bloomsbury Socialist Society . Along with many other leading Socialists ,  Eleanor took an active role in organizing the London demonstration of 13 November 1887 ,  which was violently suppressed in what became known as Bloody Sunday . In 1893 ,  Keir Hardie founded the Independent Labour Party (ILP) .  Marx attended the founding conference as an observer ,  while Aveling was a delegate .  Their goal of shifting the ILP's positions towards Marxism failed ,  however ,  as the party remained under a strong Christian socialist influence .  In 1897 ,  Marx and Aveling re-joined the Social Democratic Federation ,  like most former members of the Socialist League . After acquiring admission into the Reading Room of the British Museum ,  Eleanor first began work as a paid translator during the late 1870s .  She spent many days here ,  taking information and working on her translations . In the 1880s ,  Eleanor Marx became more interested in theatre and took up acting ,  believing in its potential for promulgating socialism . She also translated various literary works ,  including the first English translation of Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary .  She expressly learnt Norwegian in order to translate Ibsen's plays into English ,  and in 1888 ,  was the first to translate An Enemy of Society .  Two years later ,  the play was revised and renamed An Enemy of the People by William Archer .  Marx also translated Ibsen's The Lady from the Sea in 1890 . In 1898 ,  Eleanor discovered that the ailing Edward Aveling had secretly married a young actress ,  to whom he remained committed .  Aveling's illness seemed to her to be terminal ,  and Eleanor was deeply depressed by the faithlessness of the man she loved . On 31 March 1898 ,  Eleanor sent her maid to the local chemist with a note to which she signed the initials of the man the chemist knew as """"Dr .  Aveling , """" asking for chloroform (some sources say """"padiorium"""") and a small quantity of hydrogen cyanide (then called """"prussic acid"""") for her dog . The maid discovered Eleanor in bed ,  scarcely breathing ,  when she returned .  A doctor was called for but Eleanor had died by the time he arrived .  She was 43 .  A post mortem examination determined the cause of death to have been poison . A funeral service was held in a room at the London Necropolis railway station at Waterloo on 5 April 1898 ,  attended by a large throng of mourners .  Speeches were made by Aveling ,  Robert Banner ,  Eduard Bernstein ,  Pete Curran ,  Henry Hyndman and Will Thorne .  Following the memorial ,  Eleanor Marx's body was taken by rail to Woking and cremated . On 9 September 2008 ,  an English Heritage blue plaque was placed on the house at 7 Jews Walk ,  Sydenham ,  south-east London ,  where Eleanor spent the last few years of her life .   "

Aveling , """" asking for chloroform (some sources say """"padiorium"""") and a small quantity of hydrogen cyanide (then called """"prussic acid"""") for her dog . The maid discovered Eleanor in bed ,  scarcely breathing ,  when she returned .  A doctor was called for but Eleanor had died by the time he arrived .  She was 43 .  A post mortem examination determined the cause of death to have been poison . A funeral service was held in a room at the London Necropolis railway station at Waterloo on 5 April 1898 ,  attended by a large throng of mourners .  Speeches were made by Aveling ,  Robert Banner ,  Eduard Bernstein ,  Pete Curran ,  Henry Hyndman and Will Thorne .  Following the memorial ,  Eleanor Marx's body was taken by rail to Woking and cremated . On 9 September 2008 ,  an English Heritage blue plaque was placed on the house at 7 Jews Walk ,  Sydenham ,  south-east London ,  where Eleanor spent the last few years of her life .   "

*** "*page_ Juan_O'Gorman" "*cat_ Artists_who_committed_suicide" "   In 1929 ,  O'Gorman purchased a plot containing two tennis courts in Mexico City's San Ángel colonia .  On the plot ,  O'Gorman constructed a small house and studio intended for use by his father ,  now known as the Cecil O'Gorman House .  The building's forms were strongly influenced by the work of Le Corbusier ,  whose theories of architecture O'Gorman studied . Diego Rivera ,  a contemporary of O'Gorman ,  impressed with the design of the Cecil O'Gorman House ,  commissioned the architect to design a home for him and Frida Kahlo on an adjacent plot .  The house was built in a similar functionalist style from 1931 to 1932 . The 1929 Cecil O'Gorman HouseThe exterior staircase of the Cecil O'Gorman house . The Rivera-Kahlo house as visible from the streetA bridge connects the two divisions of the Rivera-Kahlo housePanorama of Rivera-Kahlo houseIn 1932 ,  Narciso Bassols ,  then Secretary of Education ,  appointed O'Gorman to the position of Head of Architectural Office of the Ministry of Public Education ,  where he went on to design and build 26 elementary schools in Mexico City . After 6 years of functionalist projects ,  O'Gorman turned away from strict functionalism later in life and worked to develop an organic architecture ,  combining the influence of Frank Lloyd Wright with traditional Mexican constructions . Juan O'Gorman's most celebrated work due to its creativity ,  construction technique ,  and dimensions ,  are the four thousand square meters murals covering the four faces of the building of the Central Library at Ciudad Universitaria at UNAM .  These murals are mosaics made from millions of colored stones that he gathered all around Mexico in order to be able to obtain the different colors he needed . """"From the beginning ,  I had the idea of making mosaics of colored stones in the walls of the collections ,  with a technique in which I was already well experienced .  With these mosaics the library would be different from the other buildings of Ciudad Universitaria ,  and it would be given a particular Mexican character . """"O'Gorman built and designed his own house in the suburb of Pedregal , His paintings often treated Mexican history ,  landscape ,  and legends .  A mural commission in Pátzcuaro ,  Michoacan resulted in the huge """"La historia de Michoacán"""" in the Biblioteca Pública Gertrudis Bocanegra in a former church .  He painted the murals in the Independence Room in Mexico City's Chapultepec Castle ,  and the huge murals of his own 1952 Central Library of the National Autonomous University of Mexico ,  designed with Gustavo Saavedra and Juan Martínez de Velasco . In 1959 ,  together with fellow artists ,  Raúl Anguiano ,  Jesús Guerrero Galván ,  and Carlos Orozco Romero ,  O'Gorman founded the militant Unión de Pintores y Grabadores de México (Mexican Painters and Engravers Union) .  He died on 17 January 1982 ,  as a result of suicide .  Authorities believe the artist grew despondent after being diagnosed with a heart ailment which curtailed his work .  O'Gorman was found dead at his home .  "

*** "*page_ Alexander_McQueen" "*cat_ LGBT-related_suicides" "   In 1992 ,  McQueen started his own label ,  and for a time he lived in the basement of Blow's house in Belgravia while it was under renovation .  In 1993 ,  he relocated to set up his studio in Hoxton Square ,  an area that also housed other new designers including Hussein Chalayan and Pauric Sweeney . McQueen's first professional runway show in 1993 ,  the Spring/Summer 1994's Nihilism collection ,  was held at the Bluebird Garage in Chelsea .  His early runway collections developed his reputation for controversy and shock tactics ,  earning him the title """"l'enfant terrible"""" and """"the hooligan of English fashion"""" . McQueen's second runway show was for the Banshee collection .  Shortly after creating this collection .  McQueen met Katy England ,  his soon to be """"right hand woman"""" , McQueen's """"bumsters"""" were a common feature of his early shows .  Although derided by some and attracted many comments and debate ,  it spawned a trend in low-rise jeans ,  especially after Madonna wore one in an MTV advert in 1994 . McQueen's fourth runway show for his Autumn/Winter collection of 1995 brought McQueen to the world's attention .  The collection ,  titled Highland Rape referring to the Highland Clearances of Scotland ,  was controversial .  Some models on the runway wore clothes that were slashed and torn ,  and in tatters of lace with spatters of fake blood .   Reviewers have interpreted it as being about women who were raped ,  and criticised what they saw as misogyny and the glamorisation of rape . McQueen continued to attract criticisms of misogyny in some of his later shows for designs that some considered degrading to women .  In La Poupée (Spring/Summer 1997) inspired by Hans Bellmer's The Doll ,  McQueen placed models including the black model Debra Shaw in metal restraints ,  which observers took to mean slavery ,  while the silver mouthpiece ins Eshu (Autumn/Winter 2000) forced the wearer to bare her teeth . McQueen followed Highland Rape with The Hunger (Spring/Summer 1996) and Dante (Autumn/Winter 1996) .  Dante further raised his international profile ,  and the collection was shown twice ;  first in Christ Church ,  Spitalfields ,  London ,  later in a disused synagogue in New York ,  both attended by large enthusiastic crowds . McQueen's increasing prominence led to a number of projects for music artists .   In 1996 ,  he designed the wardrobe for David Bowie's tour of 1997 ,  such as the Union Jack coat worn by Bowie on the cover of his album Earthling . McQueen was appointed head designer of Givenchy in 1996 to succeed John Galliano who had moved to Dior .  Hubert de Givenchy ,  founder of the label known for its elegant couture ,  criticised McQueen's appointment ,  describing it as a """"total disaster"""" . McQueen's relationship with Givenchy was fraught ,  and he left in March 2001 after his contract ended ,  with McQueen arguing that Givenchy had started to 'constrain' his creativity . Five weeks after his criticised debut for Givenchy ,  McQueen staged his own show titled It's a Jungle out There ,  which was inspired by nature .  The title was a response to the criticism he received ;  according to McQueen ,  after he watched a nature documentary about gazelles being hunted by lions :  'That's me!' Someone's chasing me all the time ,  and ,  if I'm caught ,  they'll pull me down .  Fashion is a jungle full of nasty ,  bitchy hyenas . """" . McQueen staged many of his shows in an unusual or dramatic fashion .  His Spring/Summer 1998 Untitled collection (originally titled """"Golden Shower"""" until the sponsor objected) was presented on a catwalk showered with water in yellow light , A catwalk show that received widespread media attention was the Spring/Summer 99 collection No .  13 (it was his 13th collection) ,  which was held in a warehouse in London on 27 September 1998 .  It took inspiration from William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement ,  with its concern for handcraft . The following Autumn/Winter 99 collection ,  The Overlook (titled after the Overlook Hotel from Stanley Kubrick's film The Shining) featured winter snowy scene with ice-skaters and presented clothes mostly in white and grey . McQueen held his first runway show in New York in 1999 ,  titled Eye (Spring/Summer 2000) . One of McQueen's most celebrated and dramatic catwalk shows was his 2001 Spring/Summer collection ,  named Voss after a Norwegian town known for its wildlife habitat . The centre piece tableau that dominated the show was an enormous dark glass box within a larger glass box .  Inside the inner dark glass case was an interior filled with moths and ,  at the centre ,  a naked model on a chaise longue with her face obscured by a gas mask .  The tableau was revealed when the glass walls of the inner box fell away towards the end of the show and smashed onto the ground .   McQueen said that the tableau was based on the Joel Peter Witkin image Sanitarium . Because the room outside the box was lit and the inside of the box was unlit before the show started ,  the glass walls appeared as large mirrors ,  so that the seated audience saw only their own reflection .   Alexander McQueen later described his thoughts on the idea used during VOSS of forcing his audience to stare at their own reflection in the mirrored walls for over an hour before the show started : """"Ha! I was really pleased about that .  I was looking at it on the monitor ,  everyone trying not to look at themselves .  It was a great thing to do in the fashion industry—turn it back on them! God ,  I've had some freaky shows . """"Before his contract with Givenchy had finished ,  McQueen signed a deal with Givenchy's rival Gucci in 2000 ,  daring Givenchy to fire him . McQueen continued to present his runway shows in an unconventional manner for which he had become known .  The Autumn 2001 show ,  his last show in London before moving to Paris ,  featured a merry-go-round with models in clown make-ups dragging along a golden skeleton ; McQueen also became known for using skulls in his designs .  A scarf bearing the skull motif ,  which first appeared in the Irere Spring/Summer collection of 2003 ,  became a celebrity must-have and was copied around the world . Although McQueen had incorporated menswear into many of his previous catwalk shows ,  for example Spring/Summer 98 ,  it was only in 2004 that a separate menswear collection was introduced with his first menswear runway show in Milan's menswear event . In 2007 ,  McQueen dedicated his Spring 2008 collection ,  La Dame Bleue ,  to Isabella Blow ,  who had died by suicide earlier that year .  The show included works by his long-time collaborator Philip Treacy ,  another of Blow's protégé .  The collection had a bird theme and featured brightly-coloured clothes with feathers . McQueen produced a well-received collection ,  The Girl Who Lived in the Tree ,  for Autumn/Winter 2008 .  It was based on a story McQueen created about a feral girl who lived in a tree but transformed into a princess and marry a prince to become a queen .  He took inspiration from the Queens of England and the British Raj and Empire to create a romantic and regal collection . The Spring/Summer 2009 collection ,  Natural Dis-tinction Un-natural Selection ,  was inspired by Charles Darwin and the impact of industrial revolution on nature ,  and presented on a runway filled with taxidermied animals . In 2009 ,  McQueen also collaborated with dancer Sylvie Guillem ,  director  Robert Lepage and choreographer Russell Maliphant ,  designing wardrobe for a theater show  """"Eonnagata"""" ,  which premiered at Sadler's Wells theatre in London . Alexander McQueen's last appearance on a fashion show was in Plato's Atlantis ,  presented during Paris Fashion Week on 6 October 2009 .  This Spring/Summer 2010 collection was inspired by the post-human manifesto featuring 46 full looks .   Plato's Atlantis was the first fashion show by any designer to be streamed live over the internet , The show began with a video of Raquel Zimmerman lying naked on sand with snakes on her body .

*** "*page_ Alexander_McQueen" "*cat_ LGBT-related_suicides" "   In 1992 ,  McQueen started his own label ,  and for a time he lived in the basement of Blow's house in Belgravia while it was under renovation .  In 1993 ,  he relocated to set up his studio in Hoxton Square ,  an area that also housed other new designers including Hussein Chalayan and Pauric Sweeney . McQueen's first professional runway show in 1993 ,  the Spring/Summer 1994's Nihilism collection ,  was held at the Bluebird Garage in Chelsea .  His early runway collections developed his reputation for controversy and shock tactics ,  earning him the title """"l'enfant terrible"""" and """"the hooligan of English fashion"""" . McQueen's second runway show was for the Banshee collection .  Shortly after creating this collection .  McQueen met Katy England ,  his soon to be """"right hand woman"""" , McQueen's """"bumsters"""" were a common feature of his early shows .  Although derided by some and attracted many comments and debate ,  it spawned a trend in low-rise jeans ,  especially after Madonna wore one in an MTV advert in 1994 . McQueen's fourth runway show for his Autumn/Winter collection of 1995 brought McQueen to the world's attention .  The collection ,  titled Highland Rape referring to the Highland Clearances of Scotland ,  was controversial .  Some models on the runway wore clothes that were slashed and torn ,  and in tatters of lace with spatters of fake blood .   Reviewers have interpreted it as being about women who were raped ,  and criticised what they saw as misogyny and the glamorisation of rape . McQueen continued to attract criticisms of misogyny in some of his later shows for designs that some considered degrading to women .  In La Poupée (Spring/Summer 1997) inspired by Hans Bellmer's The Doll ,  McQueen placed models including the black model Debra Shaw in metal restraints ,  which observers took to mean slavery ,  while the silver mouthpiece ins Eshu (Autumn/Winter 2000) forced the wearer to bare her teeth . McQueen followed Highland Rape with The Hunger (Spring/Summer 1996) and Dante (Autumn/Winter 1996) .  Dante further raised his international profile ,  and the collection was shown twice ;  first in Christ Church ,  Spitalfields ,  London ,  later in a disused synagogue in New York ,  both attended by large enthusiastic crowds . McQueen's increasing prominence led to a number of projects for music artists .   In 1996 ,  he designed the wardrobe for David Bowie's tour of 1997 ,  such as the Union Jack coat worn by Bowie on the cover of his album Earthling . McQueen was appointed head designer of Givenchy in 1996 to succeed John Galliano who had moved to Dior .  Hubert de Givenchy ,  founder of the label known for its elegant couture ,  criticised McQueen's appointment ,  describing it as a """"total disaster"""" . McQueen's relationship with Givenchy was fraught ,  and he left in March 2001 after his contract ended ,  with McQueen arguing that Givenchy had started to 'constrain' his creativity . Five weeks after his criticised debut for Givenchy ,  McQueen staged his own show titled It's a Jungle out There ,  which was inspired by nature .  The title was a response to the criticism he received ;  according to McQueen ,  after he watched a nature documentary about gazelles being hunted by lions :  'That's me!' Someone's chasing me all the time ,  and ,  if I'm caught ,  they'll pull me down .  Fashion is a jungle full of nasty ,  bitchy hyenas . """" . McQueen staged many of his shows in an unusual or dramatic fashion .  His Spring/Summer 1998 Untitled collection (originally titled """"Golden Shower"""" until the sponsor objected) was presented on a catwalk showered with water in yellow light , A catwalk show that received widespread media attention was the Spring/Summer 99 collection No .  13 (it was his 13th collection) ,  which was held in a warehouse in London on 27 September 1998 .  It took inspiration from William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement ,  with its concern for handcraft . The following Autumn/Winter 99 collection ,  The Overlook (titled after the Overlook Hotel from Stanley Kubrick's film The Shining) featured winter snowy scene with ice-skaters and presented clothes mostly in white and grey . McQueen held his first runway show in New York in 1999 ,  titled Eye (Spring/Summer 2000) . One of McQueen's most celebrated and dramatic catwalk shows was his 2001 Spring/Summer collection ,  named Voss after a Norwegian town known for its wildlife habitat . The centre piece tableau that dominated the show was an enormous dark glass box within a larger glass box .  Inside the inner dark glass case was an interior filled with moths and ,  at the centre ,  a naked model on a chaise longue with her face obscured by a gas mask .  The tableau was revealed when the glass walls of the inner box fell away towards the end of the show and smashed onto the ground .   McQueen said that the tableau was based on the Joel Peter Witkin image Sanitarium . Because the room outside the box was lit and the inside of the box was unlit before the show started ,  the glass walls appeared as large mirrors ,  so that the seated audience saw only their own reflection .   Alexander McQueen later described his thoughts on the idea used during VOSS of forcing his audience to stare at their own reflection in the mirrored walls for over an hour before the show started : """"Ha! I was really pleased about that .  I was looking at it on the monitor ,  everyone trying not to look at themselves .  It was a great thing to do in the fashion industry—turn it back on them! God ,  I've had some freaky shows . """"Before his contract with Givenchy had finished ,  McQueen signed a deal with Givenchy's rival Gucci in 2000 ,  daring Givenchy to fire him . McQueen continued to present his runway shows in an unconventional manner for which he had become known .  The Autumn 2001 show ,  his last show in London before moving to Paris ,  featured a merry-go-round with models in clown make-ups dragging along a golden skeleton ; McQueen also became known for using skulls in his designs .  A scarf bearing the skull motif ,  which first appeared in the Irere Spring/Summer collection of 2003 ,  became a celebrity must-have and was copied around the world . Although McQueen had incorporated menswear into many of his previous catwalk shows ,  for example Spring/Summer 98 ,  it was only in 2004 that a separate menswear collection was introduced with his first menswear runway show in Milan's menswear event . In 2007 ,  McQueen dedicated his Spring 2008 collection ,  La Dame Bleue ,  to Isabella Blow ,  who had died by suicide earlier that year .  The show included works by his long-time collaborator Philip Treacy ,  another of Blow's protégé .  The collection had a bird theme and featured brightly-coloured clothes with feathers . McQueen produced a well-received collection ,  The Girl Who Lived in the Tree ,  for Autumn/Winter 2008 .  It was based on a story McQueen created about a feral girl who lived in a tree but transformed into a princess and marry a prince to become a queen .  He took inspiration from the Queens of England and the British Raj and Empire to create a romantic and regal collection . The Spring/Summer 2009 collection ,  Natural Dis-tinction Un-natural Selection ,  was inspired by Charles Darwin and the impact of industrial revolution on nature ,  and presented on a runway filled with taxidermied animals . In 2009 ,  McQueen also collaborated with dancer Sylvie Guillem ,  director  Robert Lepage and choreographer Russell Maliphant ,  designing wardrobe for a theater show  """"Eonnagata"""" ,  which premiered at Sadler's Wells theatre in London . Alexander McQueen's last appearance on a fashion show was in Plato's Atlantis ,  presented during Paris Fashion Week on 6 October 2009 .  This Spring/Summer 2010 collection was inspired by the post-human manifesto featuring 46 full looks .   Plato's Atlantis was the first fashion show by any designer to be streamed live over the internet , The show began with a video of Raquel Zimmerman lying naked on sand with snakes on her body .  McQueen installed two large cameras on the runway ,  both of which moved back and forth ,   documenting and broadcasting the entire show live on SHOWstudio .  The inspiration for Plato's Atlantis was nature and the post-human movement depicted by sea-reptile prints .

*** "*page_ Norman_Farberow" "*cat_ Suicidologists" "   In the decade after the war ,  suicide rates rose quickly as the sense of unity and shared purpose began to disappear .  embedded in cultural and religious condemnations of shame ,  guilt ,  self-blame and cowardice ,  magnified an underlying sense of worthlessness and hopelessness . Farberow saw the effects of these dynamics and how they compounded the misery of those who were suffering .  His vision for solutions grew to include fundamental and humanitarian changes to the way in which communities treated the suicidal .  Soon his time as a psychotherapist became eclipsed by his continuing research on suicide with Dr .  Edwin Shneidman ,  a colleague equally passionate about changing the understanding and prevention of self-inflicted death . During the 1950s ,  the men worked together at the Veterans Administration (VA) in Los Angeles and sought answers for another jump in suicide rates—the sudden doubling of suicides among the VA’s neuropsychiatric hospital patients .  At the same time ,  a survey they had conducted of L . A . -area hospitals ,  clinics ,  and emergency rooms revealed that no provisions existed for the follow-up care of suicide attempters .  Farberow and Shneidman shared their findings with the National Institute of Mental Health and the VA and proposed the creation of two agencies :  a community-based Referral Center for treating the psychological problems of the suicidal ,  and a Central Research Unit for assessing and investigating suicide among veterans within the VA .

(notes collected from non-suicidal subjects and compared with writings in a 1957 study) . In 1958 with Norman Farberow and Robert Litman ,  he founded the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Center .  The psychoanalyst Litman acted as executive director .  At a time when suicide was little studied and discussion of it was avoided ,  they were pioneers .   Shneidman helped them get funding for the project from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) .   In 1966 Shneidman began working as chief of a national project at the NIH to establish suicide prevention centers ,  and increased their number from a few to 100 in 40 states in three years . In 1968 Shneidman founded the American Association of Suicidology and its bi-monthly journal ,  Suicide and Life Threatening Behavior .  (Its current president in 2020 is Jonathan Singer and its Chief Executive Officer is Colleen Creighton . )Changes in ideas of medical care led to the end of the national project and decreases in funds for suicide prevention centers .  The Los Angeles Center was combined with programs of the Didi Hirsch Community Mental Health Center .   More recently ,  treatment of people suffering depression and bipolar disorder ,  often associated with suicide ,  has depended chiefly on the biological model and psychiatric drugs . In 1970 he became the first professor of thanatology at UCLA ,  where he taught until 1988 .   He continued to write and to mentor other psychologists throughout his life .   "

Thompson believed that her daughter had dramatic ability ,  and wished to test that belief by putting her on the stage .  Ranous wrote in her journal that they tried for three or four years to get her an engagement .  In June 1879 ,  she took a course of lessons from Frederic C .  P .  Robinson ,  an English actor ,  who had played in New York theatres .  She then returned to her home in Ashfield to await results .  A week later ,  she received a summons to New York to meet Augustin Daly ,  who was making up a company for his new theatre at Broadway and Thirtieth Street .  Daly gave her an engagement ,  and she signed a contract to play in his company through the season (which began in September) ,  for a weekly salary of US$10 .  In that  company ,  under one of the most skillful of managers ,  she received an initiation into the profession that was at once pleasant and effective .  Here ,  Ranous made a few lifelong friends .  Among these were Margaret Lanner ,  who became Mrs .  Thomas L .  Coleman ,  and Georgine Flagg ,  who became Mrs .  Brainerd T .  Judkins . With an ambition for more rapid advancement in the profession ,  she left Daly's company ,  and shortly afterward was engaged by The Kiralfy Brothers as leading lady in their drama made from Jules Verne's popular novel ,  Around the World in Eighty Days . In the old home in Ashfield her time was occupied with reading and study and the care of the little daughter .  There John W .  Field ,  who ,  with his wife ,  delighted to spend a summer in that pretty village ,  taught her Italian and was in many ways a wise counselor and friend .  Milo Merrick Belding ,  head of a large silk-manufacturing firm ,  was a native of Ashfield ,  and came there usually to his summer home .  Perhaps it was this circumstance that suggested to Mrs .  Thompson the idea of raising silkworms for certain entertainment and possible profit .  The unused carriage-house was fitted up for the purpose ,  and Ranous assisted her mother in the enterprise ,  while the little Alice looked on wonderingly and talked about the """"vumms . """" The knowledge thus obtained enabled Ranous afterward to prepare an illustrated lecture on silk ,  which in the winter of 1902–3 ,  she delivered several times in Greater New York .  In those days ,  the village was enlivened with frequent dramatic entertainments by home talent ,  in which she sustained important parts .  In 1892 ,  Mrs .  Thompson died . About 1893 ,  through unfortunate investment ,  Ranous lost the property that she had inherited .  But this did not discourage her .  She mastered stenography in half the usual time required ,  and set at work to earn her own living and the funds necessary for her daughter's education .  This was completed in the Henry Churchill de Mille school at Pompton ,  New Jersey ;  and then the daughter also learned stenography and began to support herself . Ranous entered upon literary work in 1898 ,  as editor of educational text-books for Silver ,  Burdett & Co . In the spring of 1901 ,  she joined D .  Appleton & Company ,  and contributed to Appleton's Annual Cyclopedia and to The Criterion magazine .  In 1903 ,  she was engaged to assist Robert Arnot ,  a learned Oxonian ,  in editing sets of books for the subscription business of M .  Walter Dunne ,  to include the first complete editions of works of Guy de Maupassant (15 vols . ) and Gustave Flaubert (10 vols . ) ,  and edited a 20-vol .  edition of Benjamin Disraeli ,  Earl of Beaconsfield .  This work extended into 1904 ,  and on its completion she was engaged ,  still in association with Arnot ,  upon a set of books known as The Immortals .

*** "*page_ William_John_Burchell" "*cat_ Suicides_in_London" "   On 7 August 1805 Burchell at the age of 24 sailed for St .  Helena aboard the East Indiaman Northumberland intending to set up there as a merchant with a partner from London ,  William Balcombe (1779-1829) .  After a year of trading ,  Burchell did not want to continue and dissolved the partnership .  Three months later he accepted a position as schoolmaster on the island and later as official botanist . In 1810 he sailed to the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa on the recommendation of Gen .  J . W .  Janssens to explore and to add to his botanical collection .  Burchell's intended wife had jilted him for the captain of the boat taking her to St .  Helena to join him . Landing at Table Bay on 26 November 1810 ,  after stormy weather had prevented a landing for 13 days ,  Burchell set about planning an expedition into the interior .  He left Cape Town in June 1811 . Burchell travelled in South Africa through 1815 ,  collecting over 50 , 000 specimens ,  and covering more than 7000km ,  much over unexplored terrain .  He described his journey in Travels in the Interior of Southern Africa ,  a two-volume work appearing in 1822 and 1824 .  (It was reprinted in 1967 by C .  Struik of Cape Town . ) He is believed to have planned a third volume ,  since the second ends long before he completed his journey .  On 25 August 1815 he sailed from Cape Town with 48 crates of specimens aboard the vessel Kate ,  calling at St .  Helena and reaching Fulham on 11 November 1815 .  Given his experience and knowledge of South Africa ,  in 1819 Burchell was closely questioned by a select committee of the British House of Commons about the suitability of the area for emigration .  The 1820 Settlers went out from England a year later . He spent time cataloguing and processing his specimens ,  and raising funds for his next expedition .  Burchell travelled in Brazil between 1825 and 1830 ,  again collecting a large number of specimens ,  including more than 20 , 000 insects .  The journals covering his Brazil expedition are missing ,  as are his diaries relating to his later travels .  His field note books ,  detailing his plant collections ,  are held in the collection of Kew Gardens .  Historians have used them to reconstruct the latter part of his trip . Burchell's extensive African collections included plants ,  animal skins ,  skeletons ,  insects ,  seeds ,  bulbs and fish .  After his death ,  his plant specimens ,  drawings and manuscripts ,  both South African and Brazilian ,  were presented by his sister ,  Anna Burchell ,  to Kew Gardens and the insects to Oxford University Museum .  He is known for the copious and accurate notes he made to accompany every collected specimen ,  detailing habit and habitat ,  as well as the numerous drawings and paintings of landscapes ,  portraits ,  costumes ,  people ,  animals and plants . Burchell died in Fulham in 1863 ,  ending his own life by hanging himself in a small outhouse in his garden ,  after a non-fatal suicide attempt by shooting .  He is buried near his home at All Saints Church ,  Fulham .   "

He pursued a military career in keeping with his family's long tradition of military service .  Commissioned in 1898 and accepted as a member of the Imperial General Staff ,  he received several decorations for distinguished service on the western front during World War I .  Nominated for the Pour le Mérite ,  Stülpnagel survived personnel cuts mandated by the Treaty of Versailles .  Dismayed by accusations of German atrocities ,  he published an angry defence of German military conduct in a popular book entitled Die Wahrheit über die deutschen Kriegsverbrechen (The Truth about German War Crimes) (1921) .  Promoted to the rank Generalleutnant (lieutenant general) in 1931 ,  Stülpnagel played a leading role in the Reichswehr in conjunction with Kurt von Schleicher and Erich Freiherr von dem Bussche-Ippenburg during the Weimar era .  Transferred to the fledgling Luftwaffe in 1934 ,  Stülpnagel eventually took charge of the air force academy before falling from favour and retiring in March 1939 . Days before the German invasion of Poland ,  Hitler recalled Stülpnagel to active service and placed him in charge of a military district in Austria (Wehrkreise XVII) ,  and he held the latter post for fourteen months . On 25 October 1940 ,  German army high command transferred  Stülpnagel to France and placed him in charge of a military government with the title of Militärbefehlshaber in Frankreich (MBF ;  """"Military Commander in France"""") .  Not without controversy ,  this last assignment defined Stülpnagel's career . Orders from Hitler placed the army and the MBF in charge of """"security"""" but allowed other state and Nazi party agencies to exercise a degree of influence in Occupied France .  The German ambassador in Paris ,  Otto Abetz ,  first supervised and later controlled diplomatic relations between France and Germany ,  but that power amounted to little in practice .  Hitler would not allow his ambassador to trade concessions for French cooperation ,  and formal negotiations between the Third Reich and Vichy France came to nought .  With control of the flow of vital raw materials ,  food ,  and people across the demarcation line that separated occupied from unoccupied France ,  Stülpnagel could reward French cooperation by allowing people and goods to cross military checkpoints ,  or he could seal the borders and bring the French economy to a grinding halt .  Control over both the demarcation line inside France and borders with Germany and Belgium gave the MBF considerable influence over German policy and French affairs .  Thus Stülpnagel played a major role in Franco-German relations between October 1940 and January 1942 . Determined to support the Nazi war effort by placing French industrial resources at the disposal of the German war economy ,  Stülpnagel discouraged all activities that did not advance the German war effort .  The latter goal placed him at loggerheads with Nazi party stalwarts who viewed World War II as a struggle against Jews and their alleged Communist allies .  Days after German troops occupied Paris ,  agents of the Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce and German embassy staff began to confiscate the art collections of prominent French Jews .  Upset by the apparent seizure of France's artistic patrimony ,  the French government complained to German diplomats and the MBF .  Eager to maintain cordial relations with the Vichy regime ,  Stülpnagel and his staff condemned the confiscations through a series of protests that eventually reached Hitler's desk ,  but to no avail .  Hitler eventually exempted the Einsatzstab from military control and sanctioned the wholesale theft of Jewish art collections . Conflict with the SS followed a similar pattern .  Forced to accept an advisory role at the start of the Occupation ,  the SS complained of the alleged danger of the so-called 'Jewish menace' and pressed MBF to launch an active campaign against """"racial opponents"""" in France ,  but lacked the authority to act independently .  After French Resistance groups shot Colonel Karl Friedrich Hotz in Nantes on 20 October and Hans Gottfried Reimers in Bordeaux on 21 October 1941 ,  Hitler ordered Stülpnagel to execute 100-150 French hostages for each attack .  The MBF immediately condemned Hitler's policy through official channels ,  treated both attacks as a single incident ,  and shot a total of 98 hostages .  Determined to preserve French cooperation ,  Stülpnagel condemned large-scale executions .  In contrast ,  the SS demonstrated its enthusiasm for Hitler's war against the so-called Jewish conspiracy by bombing seven synagogues in Paris on the night of 2/3 October 1941 .  Embarrassed by the attacks ,  Stülpnagel complained to superiors in Berlin ,  but his repeated protests only reiterated tepid support for Nazi racial policy . Suspecting the MBF of Francophilia ,  Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel ,  the head of Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW ;  Armed Forces High Command) grew tired of Stülpnagel's complaints .  On 2 February 1942 ,  he directed the MBF to answer all acts of resistance with """"sharp deterrents ,  including the execution of a large number of imprisoned Communists ,  Jews ,  or people who carried out previous attacks ,  and the arrest of at least 1 , 000 Jews or Communists for later evacuation . """"Stülpnagel ,  who had executed 95 hostages on 15 December 1941 ,  refused to go any further in the implementation of the retaliation policy .  He promptly submitted a bitter letter of resignation .  Succeeded by his cousin Carl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel ,  Stülpnagel may have suffered a nervous breakdown .  He spent the remainder of the war with his wife in Berlin . Arrested by Allied authorities after Germany's surrender ,  Stülpnagel was moved to a French military prison .

After French Resistance groups shot Colonel Karl Friedrich Hotz in Nantes on 20 October and Hans Gottfried Reimers in Bordeaux on 21 October 1941 ,  Hitler ordered Stülpnagel to execute 100-150 French hostages for each attack .  The MBF immediately condemned Hitler's policy through official channels ,  treated both attacks as a single incident ,  and shot a total of 98 hostages .  Determined to preserve French cooperation ,  Stülpnagel condemned large-scale executions .  In contrast ,  the SS demonstrated its enthusiasm for Hitler's war against the so-called Jewish conspiracy by bombing seven synagogues in Paris on the night of 2/3 October 1941 .  Embarrassed by the attacks ,  Stülpnagel complained to superiors in Berlin ,  but his repeated protests only reiterated tepid support for Nazi racial policy . Suspecting the MBF of Francophilia ,  Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel ,  the head of Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW ;  Armed Forces High Command) grew tired of Stülpnagel's complaints .  On 2 February 1942 ,  he directed the MBF to answer all acts of resistance with """"sharp deterrents ,  including the execution of a large number of imprisoned Communists ,  Jews ,  or people who carried out previous attacks ,  and the arrest of at least 1 , 000 Jews or Communists for later evacuation . """"Stülpnagel ,  who had executed 95 hostages on 15 December 1941 ,  refused to go any further in the implementation of the retaliation policy .  He promptly submitted a bitter letter of resignation .  Succeeded by his cousin Carl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel ,  Stülpnagel may have suffered a nervous breakdown .  He spent the remainder of the war with his wife in Berlin . Arrested by Allied authorities after Germany's surrender ,  Stülpnagel was moved to a French military prison .  Charged with war crimes by French authorities ,  Stülpnagel committed suicide in Cherche-Midi Prison on 6 February 1948 .  He is buried in the Champigny-Saint-André German war cemetery .   "

In a 1959 journal article ,  he wrote : I propose that a prisoner condemned to death by due process of law be allowed to submit ,  by his own free choice ,  to medical experimentation under complete anaesthesia (at the time appointed for administering the penalty) as a form of execution in lieu of conventional methods prescribed by law . Senior doctors at the University of Michigan ,  Kevorkian's employer ,  opposed his proposal and Kevorkian chose to leave the University rather than stop advocating his ideas .  Ultimately ,  he gained little support for his plan .  He returned to the idea of using death-row inmates for medical purposes after the Supreme Court's 1976 decision in Gregg v .  Georgia reinstituted the death penalty .  He advocated harvesting the organs from inmates after the death penalty was carried out for transplant into sick patients ,  but he failed to gain the cooperation of prison officials . As a pathologist at Pontiac General Hospital ,  Kevorkian experimented with transfusing blood from the recently deceased into live patients .  He drew blood from corpses recently brought into the hospital and transferred it successfully into the bodies of hospital staff members .  Kevorkian thought that the U .

*** "*page_ Pina_Pellicer" "*cat_ Female_suicides" "   Pellicer's first acting role ,  albeit only her second movie to be released ,  was the Paramount Pictures production One-Eyed Jacks .  In the movie ,  Pellicer played Louisa ,  the stepdaughter of Karl Malden and the lover of Marlon Brando .  Mexican actress Katy Jurado also appeared as Louisa's mother .  The production of the movie was much-delayed ,  and the original director Stanley Kubrick left along with screenwriter Sam Peckinpah ,  leaving Brando to finish the movie – the only time Brando was credited with directing a movie .  So even though production started in 1958 ,  the movie was not released until 1961 .  European response was positive ,  and in July 1961 the movie received the Golden Shell (Concha de Oro) at the San Sebastián International Film Festival .  In addition ,  Pellicer was awarded the prize for best female performer ,  with reviews comparing her to Audrey Hepburn .  In the United States ,  the response was more mixed and the movie received only one Academy Award nomination ,  for Charles Lang's cinematography . The first movie with Pellicer to reach the theaters was the Mexican production Macario ,  released in 1960 .  Pellicer played the wife of the title character opposite Ignacio López Tarso .  Macario was the first Mexican production to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film ,  but ultimately lost out to Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring .  After Macario ,  Pellicer appeared in two more Mexican films ,  Días de Otoño ,  released in 1963 ,  and Sinful ,  released after her death in 1965 .  During her appearance at the San Sebastián Film Festival ,  she met Spanish director Rafael Gil ,  who cast the actress for the title role in the movie Rogelia ,  filmed in Asturias and released in 1962 .  In addition to her movie work ,  she also appeared in episodes for the television shows The Fugitive (""""Smoke Screen"""" ,  1963) and The Alfred Hitchcock Hour (""""The Life Work of Juan Diaz"""" ,  1964 ;  written by Ray Bradbury) ,  as well as on Mexican television .  Pellicer committed suicide on 4 December 1964 ,  aged 30 ,  with an overdose of sleeping pills .  "

*** "*page_ Victor_Sen_Yung" "*cat_ Deaths_from_asphyxiation" "   Sen Yung made his first significant acting debut in the 1938 film Charlie Chan in Honolulu ,  as the Chinese detective's """"number two son , """" Jimmy Chan .  In this movie ,  Sidney Toler replaced the recently deceased Warner Oland as Charlie Chan and Sen Yung replaced Oland's """"number one son"""" Lee ,  who had been played by Keye Luke .  Luke left the series in 1938 ,  leading to the need for a """"number two son"""" .  Sen Yung played the crucial role of lawyer's clerk Ong Chi Seng alongside Bette Davis in The Letter (1940) . In common with other Chinese-American actors ,  Sen Yung was cast in Japanese parts during World War II ,  such as his role as the treacherous Japanese-American Joe Totsuiko in the 1942 Humphrey Bogart film Across the Pacific . During World War II ,  he joined the U . S .  Army Air Forces .  During his military service ,  he was replaced in the Charlie Chan series by Benson Fong ,  who played """"number three son"""" ,  Tommy Chan .  Yung's military service included work in training films at the First Motion Picture Unit and a role in the Army Air Forces' play and film Winged Victory . After the war ,  Sen Yung resumed his Hollywood career .  The Charlie Chan series was now in the hands of Monogram Pictures ,  with Sidney Toler continuing in the leading role .  Toler's health was failing by 1946 ;  Monogram was conserving Toler's waning energy ,  limiting his scenes and giving him long rest periods during filming .  To relieve the burden on Toler ,  Monogram hired his original screen foil ,  Sen Yung (now billing himself as Victor Sen Young) .  He and Mantan Moreland shared much of the footage in Toler's final three films ,  Dangerous Money ,  Shadows over Chinatown ,  and The Trap .  The addition of Moreland as Chan's black chauffeur ,  Birmingham Brown ,  reflected the fact that by this time the Chan films had a significant following among black Americans ,  who liked a film series that for once did not feature a white hero .   Following Toler's death in 1947 ,  Victor Sen Young appeared in five of the remaining six Charlie Chan features .  His character """"Jimmy"""" was renamed """"Tommy"""" (author Scott MacGillivray contends that """"Jimmy"""" was so closely associated with Sidney Toler that audiences would miss seeing Toler opposite him ,  resulting in Monogram making the change) .   Sen Yung continued to work in motion pictures and television ,  in roles ranging from featured players (affable or earnest Asian characters) to bit roles (clerks ,  houseboys ,  waiters ,  etc . ) . Sen Yung was cast as the compassionate Chinese restaurant owner """"Quong Kee"""" in Tombstone ,  Arizona ,  in the 1957 episode ,  """"Quong Kee"""" ,  of the syndicated television anthology series Death Valley Days ,  hosted by Stanley Andrews .  In the story ,  an aging Quong Kee recalls how in 1881 he brought together the Bostonians Art Gresham (Walter Kelley) and his mother (played by Mary Newton) with the saloon musician Ann Bailey (Eugenia Paul) ,  who after a topsy-turvy romance became Mrs .  Art Gresham . Sen Yung is probably best remembered as """"Hop Sing , """" the cook on the long-running television series Bonanza ,  appearing in 107 episodes between 1959 and 1973 . In Bachelor Father (American TV series) (1957-62) ,  Sen Yung had a recurring role as the scheming """"Uncle Charlie , """" a character that Asian rights activist Guy Aoki commends as """"a slick ,  Americanized character .  I thought it was great that way back in the ’50s ,  audiences saw a Chinese American who acted just like anyone else . """"In the early 1970s ,  Sen Yung had a recurring role in seven episodes of the tv series Kung Fu ,  which starred David Carradine as a Shaolin monk ,  also in the Old West . Sen Yung was also an accomplished and talented chef .  He frequently appeared on cooking programs ,  and authored The Great Wok Cookbook in 1974 .   "

*** "*page_ Ted_Gärdestad" "*cat_ Suicides_by_train" "   Ted Gärdestad began his career as a musician in 1962 ,  playing accordion on Swedish television at the age of six years .  who would later manage the pop group ABBA .  Ted was composer and singer ,  while Kenneth wrote lyrics to Ted's melodies ,  a collaboration that continued throughout Ted's career .  Anderson subsequently signed Ted to the label and assigned him to in-house producers Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus . In late 1971 ,  Gärdestad released his first single ,  the gospel-influenced """"Hela världen runt"""" (""""All Over the World"""") .  The follow-up single ,  an acoustic ballad """"Jag vill ha en egen måne"""" (""""I Want a Moon of My Own"""") ,  a song he wrote at age 12 ,  brought him to the attention of the Swedish public .  He quickly became the country's first teen idol ,  touring at folkparks . In February 1973 ,  Gärdestad entered Melodifestivalen 1973 ,  the competition to select Sweden's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest .  The song """"Oh ,  vilken härlig dag"""" (""""Oh What a Lovely Day"""") came joint fourth .  A quartet known as Björn & Benny ,  Agnetha & Anni-Frid finished third with a song called """"Ring Ring (Bara du slog en signal) . """" Gärdestad had another attempt in Melodifestivalen 1975 with the song """"Rockin' 'n' Reelin'"""" ;  Svenne and Lotta placed third with """"Bang-A-Boomerang"""" and Gärdestad finished seventh but the song became a hit single on radio charts Svensktoppen ,  Heta Högen and Kvällstoppen .  Gärdestad and his brother Kenneth returned to Melodifestivalen in 1977 and performed the song """"Det bästa som finns"""" (""""The Best of All"""") with Polar Music labelmate Lena Andersson .  They finished eighth out of ten entries ,  and Gärdestad did not record the track . By 1975 ,  Ted had become a noted star in Sweden .  He was prominently featured in teen magazines Starlet ,  Mitt Livs Novell and Poster ,  his love life was covered by the national newspapers ,  he had a fan club ,  and all of his albums were certificated gold and sold well in the rest of Scandinavia .  Aside from Bjorn ,  Benny ,  Agnetha & Anni-Frid/ABBA and Anni-Frid Lyngstad he was Polar Music's best-selling artist .  Stikkan had plans to launch him internationally and Ted recorded both Swedish and English versions of """"Rockin' 'n' Reelin'"""" as well as an English version of an earlier hit ,  """"Jag ska fånga en ängel"""" (""""I'm Going to Catch An Angel"""") ,  with the title """"Gonna Make You My Angel , """" the latter with lyrics by Gary Osborne ;  neither were a significant hit .  Australian pop singer Mark Holden did ,  however ,  have a major success in Australia with """"Jag ska fånga en ängel"""" under the title """"I Wanna Make You My Lady"""" in 1976 . By 1977 ,  Gärdestad was faced with a dilemma common to many child stars and teen idols ;  as he grew up so did his audiences .  The time of teen mania and screaming crowds in the folkparks was declining and Polar in-house producers Björn and Benny ,  who had played an important part in his early success were now busy writing ,  producing and promoting ABBA and could no longer give Gärdestad or other Polar artists their full attention .  1975 resulted in the release of one single ,  the Melodifestivalen entry """"Rockin' 'n' Reelin' . """" In 1976 ,  the label released the album Franska Kort (""""French Cards""""– an expression for a fairly innocent type of late 19th-century pornography) ,  only partly recorded with Björn and Benny and co-produced by Tretow and Janne Schaffer .  The album produced hit singles """"Angela , """" """"Chapeau-Claque"""" (French for top hat) ,  """"När showen är slut"""" (""""When the Show is Over"""") and """"Klöversnoa , """" a novelty folk dance parody with Benny and Gärdestad playing accordion .  The album peaked at No .  3 ,  making it his first album not to top the Swedish charts ,  and it left the chart after 22 weeks ,  a moderate success compared to his previous releases .  In 1977 ,  ABBA and most of the Polar Music crew including musicians and sound engineers went on their first world tour ,  making ABBA :  The Movie and recording ABBA :  The Album– as an indirect result ,  Gärdestad did not release an album that year . Stig Anderson still thought Gärdestad had some international potential ,  and he and his brother Kenneth travelled to Hollywood in late 1977 to record Gärdestad's first English-language album Blue Virgin Isles .  The west coast rock orientated album featured contributions from American and English musicians including Jeff Porcaro ,  Steve Porcaro ,  Jim Keltner ,  David Hungate ,  Jay Graydon ,  Dr .  John and John Mayall ,  many of whom were Gärdestad's personal idols .  Blue Virgin Isles was released worldwide in late 1978 on Epic Records ,  and produced the singles """"Take Me Back To Hollywood , """" an English version of """"Chapeau-Clacque , """" and """"Love ,  You're Making All The Fools"""" .  Despite the expensive production and the big push to launch Gärdestad—including promotional appearances alongside ABBA—his Swedish success did not translate internationally .  In Sweden ,  the album peaked at No .  29 and spent one week on the chart .  Thirty years after its original release ,  Blue Virgin Isles remains Gärdestad 's only studio album that has not been re-released on CD by Polar Music/PolyGram/Universal Music Group . In early 1979 ,  Ted and Kenneth Gärdestad had a fourth attempt at Melodifestivalen and won with the song """"Satellit , """" a mid-tempo rock track whose arrangement bore resemblances to Toto's 1978 hit """"Hold the Line"""" .  The similarities caused speculation of plagiarism in the Swedish media and disqualification from the contest .  The connection between the two songs was that the song's producer Janne Schaffer had heard four of the future Toto members ,  Steve Porcaro ,  Jeff Porcaro ,  David Hungate and Steve Lukather ,  experimenting with a guitar and bass riff during the Blue Virgin Isles sessions in Los Angeles ,  which eventually evolved into """"Hold the Line . """" Schaffer was inspired by what he had heard when he wrote the arrangement for """"Satellit , """" but at that point neither """"Hold the Line"""" nor Toto's debut eponymous album had been released .  Jeff Porcaro told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet in February 1979 :  """"No ,  it's not a rip-off ,  Ted did not steal our song .  Those piano triplets and that bass and guitar line go back to the 1950s and the fact that we both have happened to use variations on the same theme in our songs right now is purely coincidental . """"After an unsuccessful return to Melodifestivalen in 1980 ,  with """"Låt solen värma dig"""" (""""Let the Sun Warm You"""") with then girlfriend Annica Boller and disappointing sales of his 1981 album Stormvarning (#31 ,  2 weeks)—which was internationally released as I'd Rather Write a Symphony on the Polydor label in a few countries and equally overlooked—Gärdestad left the music scene at the age of 25 . Having left the music business ,  Gärdestad made a brief and unsuccessful attempt at acting and shortly thereafter began exploring meditation and Eastern religions .  He became involved with the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (also known as Osho) movement and publicly renounced his earlier life .  In an interview with Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet in mid-1983 ,  he said he no longer wanted to be addressed as """"Ted Gärdestad , """" his name was now Swami Sangit Upasani .  Like all Bhagwan disciples ,  he wore clothes in a specific shade of orange .  Gärdestad distanced himself from his friends in the music business and his family as his involvement in the movement gradually took over his life ,  affecting his personality .  In June 1983 ,  one month before his second child with actress Ann Zacharias was born ,  he unexpectedly left his family and friends and moved to the movement's headquarters in Oregon ,  United States .  Three years later ,  after Rajneesh was convicted for immigration fraud ,  tax evasion ,  embezzlement of his disciples' funds and bioterror attacks on the citizens of The Dalles and subsequently deported from the US ,  Gärdestad's family persuaded him to move back to Sweden .  His severe mental health problems became increasingly apparent . Shortly after Gärdestad's return to Sweden in 1986 ,  the Prime Minister of Sweden ,  Olof Palme ,  was murdered .  Gärdestad was wrongly mentioned in the Swedish media as """"the 33-year-old , """" a suspect in the investigation of the assassination ,  which severely affected him although Gärdestad was on vacation in Greece at the time of the murder ,  and although he was never questioned by the Swedish police nor was under suspicion by the authorities ,  the speculations and rumours followed him and his family for the rest of the 1980s .  A few years later ,  he was again the subject of rumours accusing him of being Lasermannen ,  a bank robber and serial killer .  The rumours affected the sensitive and already unstable former star ,  and Gärdestad withdrew and fell into a deep depression . In the early 1990s ,  Gärdestad was briefly coaxed out of retirement by his friend and fellow Swedish pop singer Harpo .  He joined Harpo on a concert tour and made guest appearances .  In 1992 ,  they released the duet """"Lycka"""" (""""Happiness"""") as a single ;  it garnered little attention but marked Gärdestad's return to music .  Early that year he embarked on his first tour since 1978 and played a series of dates with Plura Jonsson ,  Tove Naess ,  Totta Näslund and Dan Hylander ,  and received overall positive reviews from the press . In 1993 ,  a compilation album titled Kalendarium 1972–93 was promoted by a tour in the Swedish folkparks ;  the album and tour were successful ,  as was his first composition in twelve years ,  """"För kärlekens skull"""" (""""For Love's Sake"""") ,  which topped the Svensktoppen chart . The following year ,  Gärdestad released a full-length album of new material titled Äntligen på väg (Finally on the Road) on Polar ,  which was produced by the longtime friend Janne Schaffer .  The album included contributions from ABBA drummer Per Lindvall ,  Björn J : son Lindh ,  Gladys del Pilar and Marie Bergman ,  and other renowned Swedish musicians .  It spawned a series of singles including """"Ge en sol"""" (""""Give a Sun"""") ,  """"Om du ville ha mig"""" (""""If You Wanted Me"""") ,  """"I min radio"""" (""""On My Radio"""") and """"Hon är kvinnan"""" (""""She's the Woman"""") ,  all of which entered the Svensktoppen chart .  The lyrics were light ,  harmonious and hopeful ,  and Gärdestad's future seemed more positive ;  his name was finally cleared ,  he remarried and he was back to making music .  He made several television appearances promoting Äntligen på väg album and performed an acoustic concert on ZTV .  He toured extensively all through 1994 ,  1995 and 1996 .  On 22 June 1997 ,  at the age of 41 ,  Gärdestad committed suicide by jumping in front of a train .   "

The rebel armies of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom took control of the city in 1853 ,  and proclaimed revolutionary social policies ,  including the equality of women .  They arranged the first examinations for women in the history of China .  The exam was held on January 13 ,  1853 ,  the birthday of the Taiping Heavenly King ,  Hong Xiuquan .  Fu achieved the highest score ,  earning her the title Zhuangyuan ,  the first and only time in Chinese history that the honor had been (allowed to) and earned by a woman .  After her success ,  no more examinations for women were held . Fu was appointed Chancelloress in the court of Yang Xiuqing ,  the East King (Dong Wang) ,  where she dealt with correspondence and official papers .

*** "*page_ Robert_Fagan" "*cat_ Artists_who_committed_suicide" "   The son of Cork immigrants ,  Fagan was born ca .  1761 in London . He arrived in Rome in 1781 .  Like other artists in Rome he became involved in dealing in antiquities ,  and ,  with the financial backing of some British patrons ,  carried out several archeological digs .  In 1792 he excavated at Vigna San Sebastiano on Via Appia ,  financed by Corbet Corbet (whose portrait he painted that year) .  In 1793 the visiting British Prince Augustus Frederick secured permission from the Pope for Fagan to export antiquities .  As an archaeologist he was involved in the excavations near Laurentum ,  which resulted in the discovery of the Venus ,  now at the Capitoline .  As an artist ,  he made a career out of painting portraits ,  often for traveling British families .  He was married twice ,  first to Anna Marie Ferri and then to Maria Ludovica Flajani a young Italian girl whom he married in 1801 ,  just six months after his first wife's death . Following the Napoleonic occupation of Rome Fagan fled to Naples in 1797 ,  but after a brief stay in Florence he returned to Rome and managed to despatch to Britain paintings by Claude and Moroni and other possessions to Naples .  In 1807 he moved to Sicily .  In 1809 ,  following his daughter's marriage to William Baker ,  Fagan was made British Consul general in Sicily .  That year he began digging at Selinunte ,  and in 1812 at Tyndaris . Fagan fell into debt ,  and committed suicide in Rome by jumping from a window .  After his death his young widow sold to the Vatican museums the antiquities which he had excavated . His grandson Louis Alexander Fagan was a noted engraver and writer .

*** "*page_ Hart_Crane" "*cat_ LGBT-related_suicides" "   Throughout the early 1920s ,  small but well-respected literary magazines published some of Crane's poems ,  gaining him among the avant-garde a respect that White Buildings (1926) ,  his first volume ,  ratified and strengthened .  White Buildings contains many of Crane's best poems ,  including """"For the Marriage of Faustus and Helen"""" ,  and """"Voyages"""" ,  a sequence of erotic poems .  They were written while he was falling in love with Emil Opffer ,  a Danish merchant mariner .  """"Faustus and Helen"""" was part of a larger artistic struggle to meet modernity with something more than despair .  Crane identified T .  S .  Eliot with that kind of despair ,  and while he acknowledged the greatness of The Waste Land ,  he also said it was """"so damned dead"""" , Crane returned to New York in 1928 ,  living with friends and taking temporary jobs as a copywriter ,  or living off unemployment and the charity of friends and his father .  For a time he lived in Brooklyn at 77 Willow Street until his lover ,  Opffer ,  invited him to live in Opffer's father's home at 110 Columbia Heights in Brooklyn Heights .  Crane was overjoyed at the views the location afforded him .  He wrote his mother and grandmother in the spring of 1924 : Just imagine looking out your window directly on the East River with nothing intervening between your view of the Statue of Liberty ,  way down the harbour ,  and the marvelous beauty of Brooklyn Bridge close above you on your right! All of the great new skyscrapers of lower Manhattan are marshaled directly across from you ,  and there is a constant stream of tugs ,  liners ,  sail boats ,  etc in procession before you on the river! It's really a magnificent place to live .  This section of Brooklyn is very old ,  but all the houses are in splendid condition and have not been invaded by foreigners .  .  . His ambition to synthesize America was expressed in The Bridge (1930) ,  intended to be an uplifting counter to Eliot's The Waste Land .  The Brooklyn Bridge is both the poem's central symbol and its poetic starting point . In Paris in February 1929 ,  Harry Crosby ,  who with his wife Caresse Crosby owned the fine arts press Black Sun Press ,  offered Crane the use of their country retreat ,  Le Moulin du Soleil in Ermenonville .  They hoped he could use the time to concentrate on completing The Bridge .  Crane spent several weeks at their estate where he roughed out a draft of the """"Cape Hatteras"""" section ,  a key part of his epic poem . Crane visited Mexico in 1931–32 on a Guggenheim Fellowship ,  and his drinking continued as he suffered from bouts of alternating depression and elation .   When Peggy Cowley ,  wife of his friend Malcolm Cowley ,  agreed to a divorce ,  she joined Crane .  As far as is known ,  she was his only heterosexual partner .

Eliot with that kind of despair ,  and while he acknowledged the greatness of The Waste Land ,  he also said it was """"so damned dead"""" , Crane returned to New York in 1928 ,  living with friends and taking temporary jobs as a copywriter ,  or living off unemployment and the charity of friends and his father .  For a time he lived in Brooklyn at 77 Willow Street until his lover ,  Opffer ,  invited him to live in Opffer's father's home at 110 Columbia Heights in Brooklyn Heights .  Crane was overjoyed at the views the location afforded him .  He wrote his mother and grandmother in the spring of 1924 : Just imagine looking out your window directly on the East River with nothing intervening between your view of the Statue of Liberty ,  way down the harbour ,  and the marvelous beauty of Brooklyn Bridge close above you on your right! All of the great new skyscrapers of lower Manhattan are marshaled directly across from you ,  and there is a constant stream of tugs ,  liners ,  sail boats ,  etc in procession before you on the river! It's really a magnificent place to live .  This section of Brooklyn is very old ,  but all the houses are in splendid condition and have not been invaded by foreigners .  .  . His ambition to synthesize America was expressed in The Bridge (1930) ,  intended to be an uplifting counter to Eliot's The Waste Land .  The Brooklyn Bridge is both the poem's central symbol and its poetic starting point . In Paris in February 1929 ,  Harry Crosby ,  who with his wife Caresse Crosby owned the fine arts press Black Sun Press ,  offered Crane the use of their country retreat ,  Le Moulin du Soleil in Ermenonville .  They hoped he could use the time to concentrate on completing The Bridge .  Crane spent several weeks at their estate where he roughed out a draft of the """"Cape Hatteras"""" section ,  a key part of his epic poem . Crane visited Mexico in 1931–32 on a Guggenheim Fellowship ,  and his drinking continued as he suffered from bouts of alternating depression and elation .   When Peggy Cowley ,  wife of his friend Malcolm Cowley ,  agreed to a divorce ,  she joined Crane .  As far as is known ,  she was his only heterosexual partner .

*** "*page_ Demosthenes" "*cat_ Suicides_by_poison" "   To make his living ,  Demosthenes became a professional litigant ,  both as a """"logographer"""" (λογογράφος ,  logographos) ,  writing speeches for use in private legal suits ,  and as an advocate (συνήγορος ,  sunégoros) speaking on another's behalf .  He seems to have been able to manage any kind of case ,  adapting his skills to almost any client ,  including wealthy and powerful men .  It is not unlikely that he became a teacher of rhetoric and that he brought pupils into court with him .  However ,  though he probably continued writing speeches throughout his career , Judicial oratory had become a significant literary genre by the second half of the fifth century ,  as represented in the speeches of Demosthenes' predecessors ,  Antiphon and Andocides .  Logographers were a unique aspect of the Athenian justice system :  evidence for a case was compiled by a magistrate in a preliminary hearing and litigants could present it as they pleased within set speeches ;  however ,  witnesses and documents were popularly mistrusted (since they could be secured by force or bribery) ,  there was little cross-examination during the trial ,  there were no instructions to the jury from a judge ,  no conferencing between jurists before voting ,  the juries were huge (typically between 201 and 501 members) ,  cases depended largely on questions of probable motive ,  and notions of natural justice were felt to take precedence over written law—conditions that favoured artfully constructed speeches . Since Athenian politicians were often indicted by their opponents ,  there was not always a clear distinction between """"private"""" and """"public"""" cases ,  and thus a career as a logographer opened the way for Demosthenes to embark on his political career .  (i . e .  the diversion of Theoric Funds to military purposes) . Demosthenes was admitted to his δῆμος (dêmos) as a citizen with full rights probably in 366BC ,  and he soon demonstrated an interest in politics . Between 355 and 351BC ,  Demosthenes continued practising law privately while he was becoming increasingly interested in public affairs .  During this period ,  he wrote Against Androtion and Against Leptines ,  two fierce attacks on individuals who attempted to repeal certain tax exemptions . In Demosthenes' time ,  different political goals developed around personalities .  Instead of electioneering ,  Athenian politicians used litigation and defamation to remove rivals from government processes .  Often they indicted each other for breaches of the statute laws (graphē paranómōn) ,  but accusations of bribery and corruption were ubiquitous in all cases ,  being part of the political dialogue .  The orators often resorted to """"character assassination"""" tactics (δῐᾰβολή ,  diabolḗ ;  λοιδορία ,  loidoría) ,  both in the courts and in the Assembly .  The rancorous and often hilariously exaggerated accusations ,  satirised by Old Comedy ,  were sustained by innuendo ,  inferences about motives ,  and a complete absence of proof ;  as J .  H .  Vince states """"there was no room for chivalry in Athenian political life"""" . In 354BC ,  Demosthenes delivered his first political oration ,  On the Navy ,  in which he espoused moderation and proposed the reform of the symmoriai (boards) as a source of funding for the Athenian fleet . Although his early orations were unsuccessful and reveal a lack of real conviction and of coherent strategic and political prioritisation , Most of Demosthenes' major orations were directed against the growing power of King Philip II of Macedon .  Since 357BC ,  when Philip seized Amphipolis and Pydna ,  Athens had been formally at war with the Macedonians . In 352BC ,  Athenian troops successfully opposed Philip at Thermopylae , The theme of the First Philippic (351–350BC) was preparedness and the reform of the Theoric fund , From this moment until 341BC ,  all of Demosthenes' speeches referred to the same issue ,  the struggle against Philip .  In 349BC ,  Philip attacked Olynthus ,  an ally of Athens .  In the three Olynthiacs ,  Demosthenes criticised his compatriots for being idle and urged Athens to help Olynthus . In 348BC a peculiar event occurred :  Meidias ,  a wealthy Athenian ,  publicly slapped Demosthenes ,  who was at the time a choregos at the Greater Dionysia ,  a large religious festival in honour of the god Dionysus . Demosthenes decided to prosecute his wealthy opponent and wrote the judicial oration Against Meidias .  This speech gives valuable information about Athenian law at the time and especially about the Greek concept of hybris (aggravated assault) ,  which was regarded as a crime not only against the city but against society as a whole . In 348BC ,  Philip conquered Olynthus and razed it to the ground ;  then conquered the entire Chalcidice and all the states of the Chalcidic federation that Olynthus had once led . The ekklesia officially accepted Philip's harsh terms ,  including the renouncement of their claim to Amphipolis .  However ,  when an Athenian delegation arrived at Pella to put Philip under oath ,  which was required to conclude the treaty ,  he was campaigning abroad . Philip swore to the treaty ,  but he delayed the departure of the Athenian envoys ,  who had yet to receive the oaths from Macedon's allies in Thessaly and elsewhere .  Finally ,  peace was sworn at Pherae ,  where Philip accompanied the Athenian delegation ,  after he had completed his military preparations to move south .  Demosthenes accused the other envoys of venality and of facilitating Philip's plans with their stance . In 344BC Demosthenes travelled to the Peloponnese ,  to detach as many cities as possible from Macedon's influence ,  but his efforts were generally unsuccessful . In 343BC ,  Macedonian forces were conducting campaigns in Epirus and ,  in 342BC ,  Philip campaigned in Thrace .  Demosthenes now dominated Athenian politics and was able to considerably weaken the pro-Macedonian faction of Aeschines . In 341BC Demosthenes was sent to Byzantium ,  where he sought to renew its alliance with Athens .  Thanks to Demosthenes' diplomatic manoeuvres ,  Abydos also entered into an alliance with Athens .  These developments worried Philip and increased his anger at Demosthenes .  The Assembly ,  however ,  laid aside Philip's grievances against Demosthenes' conduct and denounced the peace treaty ;  so doing ,  in effect ,  amounted to an official declaration of war .  In 339BC Philip made his last and most effective bid to conquer southern Greece ,  assisted by Aeschines' stance in the Amphictyonic Council .  During a meeting of the Council ,  Philip accused the Amfissian Locrians of intruding on consecrated ground .  The presiding officer of the Council ,  a Thessalian named Cottyphus ,  proposed the convocation of an Amphictyonic Congress to inflict a harsh punishment upon the Locrians .  Aeschines agreed with this proposition and maintained that the Athenians should participate in the Congress . At the same time ,  Athens orchestrated the creation of an alliance with Euboea ,  Megara ,  Achaea ,  Corinth ,  Acarnania and other states in the Peloponnese .  However the most desirable ally for Athens was Thebes .  To secure their allegiance ,  Demosthenes was sent by Athens ,  to the Boeotian city ;  Philip also sent a deputation ,  but Demosthenes succeeded in securing Thebes' allegiance . While the Athenians and the Thebans were preparing themselves for war ,  Philip made a final attempt to appease his enemies ,  proposing in vain a new peace treaty . After Chaeronea ,  Philip inflicted a harsh punishment upon Thebes ,  but made peace with Athens on very lenient terms .  Demosthenes encouraged the fortification of Athens and was chosen by the ekklesia to deliver the Funeral Oration .  Nonetheless ,  Alexander moved swiftly to Thebes ,  which submitted shortly after his appearance at its gates .  When the Athenians learned that Alexander had moved quickly to Boeotia ,  they panicked and begged the new King of Macedon for mercy .  Alexander admonished them but imposed no punishment . In 335BC Alexander felt free to engage the Thracians and the Illyrians ,  but ,  while he was campaigning in the north ,  Demosthenes spread a rumour—even producing a bloodstained messenger—that Alexander and all of his expeditionary force had been slaughtered by the Triballians . According to ancient writers ,  Demosthenes called Alexander """"Margites"""" (Greek :  Μαργίτης)Despite the unsuccessful ventures against Philip and Alexander ,  most Athenians still respected Demosthenes ,  because they shared his sentiments and wished to restore their independence . In 324BC Harpalus ,  to whom Alexander had entrusted huge treasures ,  absconded and sought refuge in Athens . Among the accused ,  Demosthenes was the first to be brought to trial before an unusually numerous jury of 1 , 500 .  He was found guilty and fined 50 talents . Mogens Hansen ,  however ,  notes that many Athenian leaders ,  Demosthenes included ,  made fortunes out of their political activism ,  especially by taking bribes from fellow citizens and such foreign states as Macedonia and Persia .  Demosthenes received vast sums for the many decrees and laws he proposed .  Given this pattern of corruption in Greek politics ,  it appears likely ,  writes Hansen ,  that Demosthenes accepted a huge bribe from Harpalus ,  and that he was justly found guilty in an Athenian People's Court .  After Alexander's death in 323BC ,  Demosthenes again urged the Athenians to seek independence from Macedon in what became known as the Lamian War .  However ,  Antipater ,  Alexander's successor ,  quelled all opposition and demanded that the Athenians turn over Demosthenes and Hypereides ,  among others .  Following his order ,  the ekklesia had no choice but to reluctantly adopt a decree condemning the most prominent anti-Macedonian agitators to death .  Demosthenes escaped to a sanctuary on the island of Kalaureia (modern-day Poros) ,  where he was later discovered by Archias ,  a confidant of Antipater .  He committed suicide before his capture by taking poison out of a reed ,  pretending he wanted to write a letter to his family .   "

*** "*page_ Steve_Peregrin_Took" "*cat_ Deaths_from_asphyxiation" "   Took was born Stephen Ross Porter in Eltham ,  London ,  on 28 July 1949 ,  and attended Shooters Hill School .  He took his name from the character Peregrin Took ,  a hobbit ,  in J .  R .  R .  Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings .  At the age of 17 ,  having played drums for some months with a mod band named the Waterproof Sparrows (bass player John Rains) ,  he answered an advert in Melody Maker for Tyrannosaurus Rex ,  the electric band that Marc Bolan was forming following his departure from John's Children .  After one disastrous concert at the Electric Garden in London ,  Bolan and Took reduced the band to a duo ,  busking in subways on acoustic guitar and bongos ,  Took having been obliged to sell his full drum kit to pay the rent until paying gigs started to come in . The flower-power unit ,  championed by John Peel onto the club and stage circuit and thence into the record shops ,  released three albums and achieved two top 40 hits .  Took contributed harmony backing vocals ,  which are more noticeable in live recordings than on studio recordings ,  and provided bongos ,  African drums ,  kazoo ,  pixiphone ,  and Chinese gong .  Took's arrangements contributed to transforming Bolan's music from the straightforward rock 'n roll it had previously been into an exotic brew of musical styles designed to appeal to Bolan's new audience of hippies .  Towards the end of his time in the band ,  as Bolan began returning to the electric guitar ,  Took returned to a full drum set and also contributed some bass guitar parts . The band's producer Tony Visconti credited Took with much of the sound and success of Tyrannosaurus Rex .  In an interview for the documentary Marc Bolan :  The Final Word ,  Visconti opined that """"Marc and Steve were a true 50 : 50 partnership .  Steve was a remarkable musician ,  he could play many instruments .  He played percussion ,  he could pick up a bass or a guitar .  He would also sometimes play some cello parts .  And then his backing vocals were great too . """"Took developed his own songwriting and in early 1969 ,  with recording just complete on Tyrannosaurus Rex's third LP ,  Unicorn ,  Took suggested to Bolan that the duo could perform some of his own material ;  Bolan refused .  By this time ,  their lifestyles were in direct conflict .  Bolan was living quietly with wife-to-be June Child ,  while Took was rapidly forging links with """"revolutionary"""" underground acts ,  such as The Deviants and The Pretty Things .  The relationship was deteriorating badly—Bolan barely tolerated Took's drug use ,  and Steve Mann recalled that it was clear they """"cordially detested each other"""" . In addition ,  Took's friendship with Bolan's idol Syd Barrett had also developed through their shared interests in both LSD and """"strange musical noises"""" .  Mick Farren ,  in his memoir Give The Anarchist A Cigarette ,  recalled that Took would """"drag a bemused Syd Barrett along"""" to events in Ladbroke Grove in the late 1960s ;  Took remained friends with Barrett well into the 1970s .  Took worked with Syd Barrett on unreleased """"Ramadan"""" tracks . Eventually ,  Took donated two of his songs—""""Three Little Piggies"""" and """"The Sparrow Is A Sign""""—to former Tomorrow and Pretty Things drummer Twink's 1969 solo album ,  Think Pink . Took was contractually obliged to go on the US tour ,  but his heart was not in it and he attempted to cope through taking drugs .  Additionally ,  the acoustic duo were overshadowed by the loud electric acts they were billed with .  To counter this ,  he drew from the shock rock style of Iggy Pop ;  as Took explained to the NME in 1972 """"I took my shirt off in the Sunset Strip where we were playing and whipped myself till everybody shut up .  With a belt ,  y'know ,  a bit of blood and the whole of Los Angeles shuts up .  'What's going on ,  man ,  there's some nutter attacking himself on stage . ' I mean ,  Iggy Stooge had the same basic approach . """"After being sacked by Bolan ,  Took formed a prototype version of the Pink Fairies with Twink and Mick Farren ,  recently ousted from his own band ,  the Deviants .  This band was named in honour of a drinking club of the same name the three had formed earlier that year ,  along with other leading lights of the underground scene .  Together with Twink's girlfriend Silva Darling ,  they performed what Farren would later describe as """"less of a gig than a protracted harangue"""" at the University of Manchester in October 1969 ,  which rapidly dissolved into chaos .  Took appeared prominently on Farren's first solo album Mona – The Carnivorous Circus (recorded December 1969 ,  released 1970) .  Twink and the other ex-Deviants then formed a new band called the Pink Fairies (mark 2) ,  without Took or Farren . In February 1970 ,  Farren and Took headhunted guitarist Larry (or """"Lazza"""") Wallis and bassist Tim Taylor from their underground band ,  the Entire Sioux Nation .  A month later ,  Farren dropped out ,  leaving Took in the role of bandleader for the first time in his career .  With the addition of drummer Phil Lenoir ,  Shagrat was formed (named after an orc in The Lord of the Rings) .  They recorded three tracks ,  """"Peppermint Flickstick"""" ,  """"Boo! I Said Freeze"""" and """"Steel Abortion"""" ,  at Strawberry Studios and played live at the Phun City festival ,  before Lenoir and Taylor left .  Took and Wallis continued with drummer Dave Bidwell ,  rehearsing with various bass players and eventually forming an acoustic trio of Took on vocals and guitar ,  Wallis on acoustic bass and Bidwell on tambourine .  This line-up recorded a set of (at least) four home demos ,  """"Amanda"""" ,  """"Strange Sister"""" ,  """"Still Yawning Stillborn"""" and """"Beautiful Deceiver"""" ,  at Wallis's father's home studio in South London ,  which in the 1990s would be paired with the earlier electric studio session for limited edition vinyl release and later a CD album release in 2001 . Wallis would later take over the leadership of the Pink Fairies for their Kings of Oblivion LP ,  substantially transforming the sound and style of the band .  He and Took would work together again at various intervals in 1972 ,  1975–1976 and 1977 . With Wallis and Bidwell otherwise committed to UFO and Savoy Brown respectively ,  the acoustic Shagrat was effectively reduced down to just Took himself performing solo on an acoustic guitar ,  usually sitting on a stool interspersing his songs with jokes and other onstage monologues .  In this format ,  Took made some headway as a live performer .  """"Tookie"""" appeared in frequent support slots for Hawkwind and the Pink Fairies ,  attracting some coverage in the UK music press and even performing a live session on Steve Bradshaw's Breakthrough programme on BBC Radio London . He also performed at various benefit events ,  including the """"Nasty Balls"""" benefits for the Nasty Tales magazineDuring this time ,  Took could also often be seen participating in jamming sessions during encores at Hawkwind and Pink Fairies concerts .  His contributions to these jams were in the role of third drummer ,  and he also once played bass guitar for the """"Pinks"""" ,  substituting for Duncan Sanderson . During 1972 ,  Took was approached by Tony Secunda ,  recently fired as manager for T .  Rex ,  with a view to recovering royalties owed to Took from the Tyrannosaurus Rex years .  Emerging from these conversations ,  Secunda became Took's manager ,  with a view to leading him to stardom to spite Bolan .  Initially ,  Took attempted to rerecord as a single the song """"Amanda"""" from the 1971 acoustic Shagrat session (along with two other tracks ,  Blind Owl Blues and Mr Discrete) with the assistance of the Pink Fairies rhythm section of Sanderson and Russell Hunter ,  whose band was temporarily defunct following the departure of Paul Rudolph .  During this session ,  former Junior's Eyes/Bowie guitarist Mick Wayne was recruited as guitarist . However ,  none of these tracks were ever completed to Took's satisfaction ,  due to what Wayne later described as """"dope-induced thinking"""" and consequently ,  Wayne ,  Sanderson and Hunter formed a new incarnation of the Pink Fairies .  (Wayne was quickly supplanted by Wallis ,  leading to the Kings of Oblivion era as detailed above) .  Took and Secunda ,  meanwhile ,  embarked upon a different approach . Took moved into a basement flat beneath Secunda's Mayfair offices ,  which he set up as a live-in recording studio to demo material at his own ease .  The flat rapidly became a magnet for the cream of musicians on the underground scene ,  who would contribute to the recordings while visiting Took .  As well as old colleagues from Hawkwind and the Pink Fairies ,  Secunda reported that Took received visits from Syd Barrett ,  who at the time was living in Cambridge ,  but would shortly relocate back to London .  From Secunda's account ,  it would appear likely that Barrett is on the recordings done in the flat by Took and his friends . Highlights of the session tapes were eventually released by Cleopatra Records in 1995 ,  as The Missing Link To Tyrannosaurus Rex .  A new version of the 1971 acoustic Shagrat song """"Beautiful Deceiver"""" is tracklisted on the CD as """"Syd's Wine"""" and a credit for guitar and other noises is given to one Crazy Diamond ,  an allusion to the 1975 Pink Floyd track """"Shine On You Crazy Diamond"""" ,  written in tribute to Barrett .  Stripped down versions of the track """"Syd's Wine"""" reveal a second guitarist in the room and audible vocal noises . After splitting with Secunda ,  Took worked with a number of Hawkwind members ,  most notably Robert Calvert ,  Adrian Wagner , For some time around 1975 ,  Took lived in the Kent towns of Canterbury and Margate ,  where he took on local musician and promoter Les Best as his manager .  While down there ,  Took formed a new band ,  Jolly Roger and the Crimson Gash ,  with Takahashi now on bass and two local musicians ,  Bryan East on drums and a guitarist called Phil .   This band gigged locally and recorded at least four tracks ,  produced by Turner at his home studio in Westgate on Sea . By 1976 ,  Took was back in London and using the band name Steve Took's Horns ,  so called after a horned pendant which he habitually wore .  By mid 1977 ,  this had solidified into a steady line-up featuring ,  in what would be the first of several bands together over many years ,  Trevor Thoms and Ermanno Ghisio-Erba ,  later better known to Inner City Unit (ICU) fans as Judge Trev and Dino Ferari . This group ,  managed by Turner's friend since adolescence Tony Landau ,  recorded a session of three studio tracks – It's Over ,  Average Man and Woman I Need – at Pathway Studios on 29 November 1977 ,  before going on to perform a gig on 18 June 1978 at The Roundhouse ,  as part of """"Nik Turner's Bohemian Love-In"""" .  Took felt the gig went badly ,  and decided to split up the band . Despite the break-up ,  Steve Took's Horns had made a considerable impression on Took's circle of acquaintances .  Consequently ,  Nik Turner ,  having first drafted Ghisio-Erba/Ferari into his band Sphynx for a live festival LP recorded that August ,  went on in 1979 to incorporate the Thoms/Ghisio-Erba partnership into his new Inner City Unit . Took guested with ICU a number of times ,  reuniting with his old Horns sidemen ;  the last recorded dates being 16 June 1980 at London's Music Machine and sometime around 21 June 1980 at the Stonehenge Free Festival in Wiltshire – a festival frequented by other 'Festival Bands' ,  most famously Took's old Ladbroke Grove cohorts Hawkwind .  Bootleg recordings exist of the above-mentioned Music Machine show and also an open-air performance on 6 May 1980 Steve Took died on Monday 27 October 1980 at 14 Clydesdale House ,  255 Westbourne Park Road ,  Notting Hill ,  London W11 1ED ,  aged 31 ,  in the maisonette he shared with Billiet and her young daughter .   As a consequence of intervention by Best ,  now once again Took's manager ,  royalty cheques for the Tyrannosaurus Rex 'Blue Thumb' American releases had been arriving periodically ,  and Took had received one that week .  The day prior to his death ,  Took purchased morphine and hallucinogenic mushrooms for himself and Billiet ,  and the evening before Took died ,  they both injected themselves with the morphine .  "

From 1915 ,  he headed the press department of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces . After the war ,  he studied history at the University of Vienna ,  together with his employment at the Austrian War Archives (as director from 1925 to 1938) .  He also achieved the rank of a colonel at the Austrian Heeresnachrichtenamt in 1934 . Originally a monarchist ,  Glaise-Horstenau became the second man in the hierarchy of the banned Austrian Nazi Party in the mid-to-late 1930s behind its leader Josef Leopold .  To improve relations with Nazi Germany ,  he was appointed a member of the Staatsrat of the Federal State of Austria from 1934 in the rank of a Minister Without Portfolio ,  and from 1936 to 1938 ,  he served as Federal Minister of the Interior in the cabinet of Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg ,  after being appointed under pressure from Adolf Hitler .  At the meeting at the Berghof in Berchtesgaden on 12 February 1938 between Hitler and Schuschnigg ,  Germany demanded that Glaise-Horstenau be made Minister of War in a new pro-Nazi government and that he would establish close operational relations between the German and Austrian Armies ,  which would ultimately lead to the assimilation of the Austrian to the German system . After Schuschnigg had to resign on March 11 ,  Glaise-Horstenau served as Vice-Chancellor of Austria under Arthur Seyss-Inquart for two days .   Glaise-Horstenau was then passed into Führer-Reserve and entrusted with the obscure task of Military Historian of the South East until his capture by the US Army on 5 May 1945 .  Fearing extradition to Yugoslavia ,  he committed suicide at Langwasser military camp near Nuremberg ,  Germany ,  on 20 July 1946 .  "

He attended Richmond Hill High School ,  where he appeared in stage productions .  He then attended Bowdoin College ,  where he majored in pre-med with plans to become a doctor .  On the advice of a friend ,  he decided to pursue acting as a career instead .  He made his professional acting debut with a Cincinnati stock company in 1927 .  Within a few months ,  Dekker was featured in the Broadway production of Eugene O'Neill's play Marco Millions . After a decade of theatrical appearances ,  Dekker transferred to Hollywood in 1937 and made his first film ,  1937's The Great Garrick .  He spent most of the rest of his acting career in the cinema but also returned to the stage from time to time . He replaced Lee J .  Cobb as Willy Loman in the original production of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman ,  and during a five-year stint back on Broadway in the early 1960s ,  he played the Duke of Norfolk in Robert Bolt's A Man for All Seasons . Dekker appeared in some seventy films from the 1930s to the 1960s ,  but his four most famous screen roles were as a mad scientist in the 1940 horror film Dr .  Cyclops ,  as a criminal mastermind in 1946's The Killers ,  as a dangerous dealer in atomic fuel in the 1955 film noir Kiss Me Deadly ,  and as an unscrupulous railroad detective in Sam Peckinpah's Western The Wild Bunch ,  released in 1969 .  In 1959 he played a convincing Texas Ranger ,  Captain Rucker ,  in The Wonderful Country .  He was rarely cast in romantic roles ,  but in the film Seven Sinners ,  featuring a romance between Marlene Dietrich and John Wayne ,  Dietrich sails off with Dekker's character at the end of the film .   Dekker was an often memorable guest star – usually a villain – in numerous TV series from the 50s through to 1968 ,  such as Rawhide ,  The Man From UNCLE ,  Mission :  Impossible ,  Climax! ,  Bonanza ,  and I Spy .  Dekker's role as Pat Harrigan in The Wild Bunch was his last screen appearance ;  he died over a year before it was released .   On May 5 ,  1968 ,  Dekker was found dead in his Hollywood home by his fiancée ,  fashion model and future Love Boat creator Jeraldine Saunders .   He was naked ,  kneeling in the bathtub ,  with a noose tightly wrapped around his neck and looped around the shower curtain rod .   He was blindfolded ,  his wrists were handcuffed ,  there was a ball gag in his mouth ,  and two hypodermic needles were inserted in one arm .  His body was covered in explicit words and drawings in red lipstick . Money and camera equipment were missing ,  but there was no sign of forced entry .  Police originally said it was suicide but the deputy coroner found no evidence of foul play nor any indication that he planned to take his life and ruled his death accidental ,  the result of autoerotic asphyxiation . Dekker has a star ,  in the motion picture category ,  on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6620 Hollywood Boulevard .  "

Shipman passed his eleven-plus in 1957 ,  moving to High Pavement Grammar School ,  Nottingham ,  which he left in 1964 .  He excelled as a distance runner ,  and in his final year at school served as vice-captain of the athletics team .  Shipman was particularly close to his mother ,  who died of lung cancer when he was aged 17 .  On 5 November 1966 ,  he married Primrose May Oxtoby ;  the couple had four children . Shipman studied medicine at Leeds School of Medicine ,  University of Leeds ,  graduating in 1970 . Shipman continued working as a GP in Hyde throughout the 1980s ,  and established his own surgery at 21 Market Street in 1993 ,  becoming a respected member of the community .  In 1983 ,  he was interviewed in an edition of the Granada Television documentary World in Action on how the mentally ill should be treated in the community .   Shipman hanged himself in his cell at HM Prison Wakefield at 6 : 20a . m .  on 13 January 2004 ,  the eve of his 58th birthday ,  and was pronounced dead at 8 : 10a . m .  A statement from Her Majesty's Prison Service indicated that he had hanged himself from the window bars of his cell using bed sheets . Some of the victims' families said they felt cheated ,  as Shipman's suicide meant they would never have the satisfaction of his confession ,  nor answers as to why he committed his crimes . Shipman's death divided national newspapers ,  with the Daily Mirror branding him a """"cold coward"""" and condemning the Prison Service for allowing his suicide to happen .  However ,  The Sun ran a celebratory front-page headline ;  """"Ship Ship hooray!""""Shipman's motive for suicide was never established ,  though he reportedly told his probation officer that he was considering suicide to assure his wife's financial security after he was stripped of his National Health Service pension . After Shipman's body was released to the family ,  it remained in Sheffield for more than a year despite multiple false reports about his funeral .  His widow was advised by police against burying her husband in case the grave was attacked .  Shipman was eventually cremated on 19 March 2005 at Hutcliffe Wood Crematorium .  "

*** "*page_ Wally_Wood" "*cat_ Artists_who_committed_suicide" "  Wally Wood was born in Menahga ,  Minnesota ,  and he began reading and drawing comics at an early age .  He was strongly influenced by the art styles of Alex Raymond's Flash Gordon ,  Milton Caniff's Terry and the Pirates ,  Hal Foster's Prince Valiant ,  Will Eisner's The Spirit and especially Roy Crane's Wash Tubbs .  Recalling his childhood ,  Wood said that his dream at age six ,  about finding a magic pencil that could draw anything ,  foretold his future as an artist . Wood graduated from high school in 1944 ,  signed on with the United States Merchant Marine at the close of World War II and enlisted in the U . S .  Army's 11th Airborne Division in 1946 .  He went from training at Fort Benning ,  Georgia ,  to occupied Japan ,  where he was assigned to the island of Hokkaidō . In 1947 ,  at age 20 ,  Wood enrolled in the Minneapolis School of Art but only lasted one term . By October ,  after being rejected by every company he visited ,  Wood met fellow artist John Severin in the waiting room of a small publisher .  After the two shared their experiences attempting to find work ,  Severin invited Wood to visit his studio ,  the Charles William Harvey Studio ,  where Wood met Charlie Stern ,  Harvey Kurtzman (who was working for Timely/Marvel) and Will Elder .  At this studio Wood learned that Will Eisner was looking for a Spirit background artist .  He immediately visited Eisner and was hired on the spot . Over the next year ,  Wood also became an assistant to George Wunder ,  who had taken over the Milton Caniff strip Terry and the Pirates .  Wood cited his """"first job on my own"""" as Chief Ob-stacle ,  a continuing series of strips for a 1949 political newsletter .  He entered the comic book field by lettering ,  as he recalled in 1981 :  """"The first professional job was lettering for Fox romance comics in 1948 .  This lasted about a year .  I also started doing backgrounds ,  then inking .  Most of it was the romance stuff .  For complete pages ,  it was $5 a page  .  .  .  Twice a week ,  I would ink ten pages in one day"""" . Artists' representative Renaldo Epworth helped Wood land his early comic-book assignments ,  making it unclear if that connection led to Wood's lettering or to his comics-art debut ,  the ten-page story """"The Tip Off Woman""""   in the Fox Comics Western Women Outlaws No .  4 (cover-dated January 1949 ,  on sale late 1948) .  Wood's next known comic-book art did not appear until Fox's My Confession No .  7 (August 1949) ,  at which time he began working almost continuously on the company's similar My Experience ,  My Secret Life ,  My Love Story and My True Love :  Thrilling Confession Stories .  His first signed work is believed to be in My Confession #8 (October 1949) ,  with the name """"Woody"""" half-hidden on a theater marquee .  He penciled and inked two stories in that issue :  """"I Was Unwanted"""" (nine pages) and """"My Tarnished Reputation"""" (ten pages) . Wood began at EC co-penciling and co-inking with Harry Harrison the story """"Too Busy For Love"""" (Modern Love #5) ,  and fully penciling the lead story ,  """"I Was Just a Playtime Cowgirl"""" ,  in Saddle Romances No .  11 (April 1950) ,  inked by Harrison . Working from a Manhattan studio at West 64th Street and Columbus Avenue ,  Wood began to attract attention in 1950 with his  science-fiction artwork for EC and Avon Comics ,  some in collaboration with Joe Orlando .  During this period ,  he drew in a wide variety of subjects and genres ,  including adventure ,  romance ,  war and horror ;  message stories (for EC's Shock SuspenStories) ;  and eventually satirical humor for writer/editor Harvey Kurtzman in Mad including a satire of the lawsuit Superman's publisher DC filed against Captain Marvel's publisher Fawcett called """"Superduperman!"""" battling Captain Marbles . Wood was instrumental in convincing EC publisher William Gaines to start a line of science fiction comics ,  Weird Science and Weird Fantasy (later combined under the single title Weird Science-Fantasy) .   Wood penciled and inked several dozen EC science fiction stories .  Wood also had frequent entries in Two-Fisted Tales and Tales from the Crypt ,  as well as the later EC titles Valor ,  Piracy ,  and Aces High . Working over scripts and pencil breakdowns by Jules Feiffer ,  the 25-year-old Wood drew two months of Will Eisner's  Sunday-supplement newspaper comic book The Spirit ,  on the 1952 story arc """"The Spirit in Outer Space"""" .  Eisner ,  Wood recalled ,  paid him """"about $30 a week for lettering and backgrounds on The Spirit .  Sometimes he paid $40 when I did the drawings ,  too"""" . Feiffer ,  in 2010 ,  recalled Wood's studio ,  """"which was at that time in the very slummy Upper West Side Between 1957 and 1967 ,  Wood produced both covers and interiors for more than 60 issues of the science-fiction digest Galaxy Science Fiction ,  illustrating such authors as Isaac Asimov ,  Philip K .  Dick ,  Jack Finney ,  C . M .  Kornbluth ,  Frederik Pohl ,  Robert Silverberg ,  Robert Sheckley ,  Clifford D .  Simak and Jack Vance .  He painted six covers for Galaxy Science Fiction Novels between 1952 and 1958 .  His gag cartoons appeared in the men's magazines Dude ,  Gent and Nugget .  He inked the first eight months of the 1958–1961 syndicated comic strip Sky Masters of the Space Force ,  penciled by Jack Kirby . Wood expanded into book illustrations ,  including for the picture-cover editions (though not the dust-jacket editions) of titles in the 1959 Aladdin Books reissues of Bobbs Merrill's 1947 """"Childhood of Famous Americans"""" series . Wood additionally did art and stories for comic-book companies large and small – from Marvel (and its 1950s iteration Atlas Comics) ,  DC (including House of Mystery and Jack Kirby's Challengers of the Unknown) ,  and Warren (Creepy ,  Eerie ,  1984) ,  to such smaller firms as Avon (Eerie ,  Strange Worlds) ,  Charlton (War and Attack ,  Jungle Jim) ,  Fox (Martin Kane ,  Private Eye) ,  Gold Key (M . A . R . S .  Patrol Total War ,  Fantastic Voyage) ,  Harvey (Unearthly Spectaculars) , For Marvel during the Silver Age of Comic Books ,  Wood's work as penciler-inker of Daredevil #5–8 and inker over Bob Powell of issues #9-11 established the title character's distinctive red costume (in issue #7) . Wood penciled and inked the first four 10-page installments of the company's """"Dr .  Doom"""" feature in Astonishing Tales #1–4 (Aug .  1970-Feb .  1971) , In circles concerned with copyright and intellectual property issues ,  Wood is known as the artist of the unsigned satirical Disneyland Memorial Orgy poster ,  which first appeared in Paul Krassner's magazine The Realist .  Disney took no legal action against either Krassner or The Realist but did sue a publisher of a """"blacklight"""" version of the poster ,  who used the image without Krassner's permission .  The case was settled out of court . At DC Comics ,  he and Jim Shooter launched the Captain Action comic book series in 1968 . Over several decades ,  numerous artists worked at the Wood Studio .  Associates and assistants included Dan Adkins ,  and Mike Zeck . In 1966 ,  Wood launched the independent magazine witzend (originally to be titled et cetera ,  a name which had to be withdrawn when Wood was told another magazine had already used this) one of the first alternative comics ,  a decade before Mike Friedrich's Star Reach or Flo Steinberg's Big Apple Comix for which Wood drew the cover and contributed a story .  Wood offered his fellow professionals the opportunity to contribute illustrations and graphic stories that detoured from the usual conventions of the comics industry .  After the fourth issue ,  Wood turned witzend over to Bill Pearson ,  who continued as editor and publisher through the 1970s and into the 1980s . Wood additionally collected his feature Sally Forth ,  published in the U . S .  servicemen's periodicals Military News and Overseas Weekly in 1968–1974 ,  in a series of four oversize (10""""x12"""") magazines .  Pearson ,  in 1993–95 ,  reformatted the strips into a series of comics published by Eros Comix ,  an imprint of Fantagraphics Books ,  which in 1998 collected the entire run into a single 160-page volume . In 1969 ,  Wood created another independent comic ,  Heroes ,  Inc .  Presents Cannon ,  intended for his """"Sally Forth"""" military readership as indicated in the ads and indicia .  Artists Steve Ditko and Ralph Reese and writer Ron Whyte are credited with primary writer-artist Wood on three features :  """"Cannon"""" ,  """"The Misfits"""" , In 1980 and 1981 ,  Wood did two issues of a completely pornographic comic book ,  titled Gang Bang .  It featured two sexually explicit Sally Forth stories ,  and sexually explicit versions of Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ,  titled So White and the Six Dorks ;  Terry and The Pirates ,  titled Perry and the Privates ;  Prince Valiant ,  titled Prince Violate ;  Superman and Wonder Woman ,  titled Stuporman Meets Blunder Woman ;  Flash Gordon ,  titled Flasher Gordon ;  and Tarzan titled Starzan .  A third volume ,  published in 1983 ,  contained three more sexually explicit parodies of Alice in Wonderland ,  titled Malice in Blunderland ;  a second Flash Gordon sendup titled Flesh Fucker Meets Women's Lib! ;  and The Wizard of Oz ,  titled The Blizzard of Ooze . Wood struggled to be as efficient as possible in the often low-paying comics industry . In 1980 ,  Wood's original ,  three-page ,  24 panel (not 22) version of """"Panels"""" was published with the proper copyright notice in The Wallace Wood Sketchbook (Crouch/Wood 1980) . Wood's """"Panels That Always Work"""" is copyright Wallace Wood Properties ,  LLC as listed by the United States Copyright Office which assigned the work Registration Number VA0001814764 . In 1986 Tom Christopher ,  who had been given a copy by Larry Hama at the DC office in 1978 light boxed the pages ,  incorporating a non-linear dialogue and asked Par Holman to ink it .  Par inked and lettered the piece and the completed art was distributed through Clay Geerdes' Comics World Co-Op ,  whose members produced mini and digest sized comics .  In 2006 ,  writer/artist Joel Johnson bought the Larry Hama paste-up of photocopies at auction and made it available for wide distribution on the Internet .  that featured Dave Sim's homage to Wally Wood and a focus on his 22 Panels ,  including a tribute that features a creation using the motif of one of them ,  depicting Daredevil and Wood himself ,  in Wally Wood style – and the Wally Wood Estate's official print of the panels . Wood was married three times .  His first marriage was to artist Tatjana Wood ,  who later did extensive work as a comic-book colorist .  Their marriage ended in the late 1960s .  His second marriage ,  to Marilyn Silver ,  also ended in divorce . For much of his adult life ,  Wood suffered from chronic ,  unexplainable headaches .  In the 1970s ,  following bouts with alcoholism ,  Wood suffered from kidney failure .  A stroke in 1978 caused a loss of vision in one eye .  Faced with declining health and career prospects ,  he shot and killed himself in Los Angeles on November 2 ,  1981 . In 1972 ,  EC editor Harvey Kurtzman ,  who worked closely with Wood during the 1950s ,  said : Wally had a tension in him ,  an intensity that he locked away in an internal steam boiler .  I think it ate away his insides ,  and the work really used him up .  I think he delivered some of the finest work that was ever drawn ,  and I think it's to his credit that he put so much intensity into his work at great sacrifice to himself . Wally's World :  The Brilliant Life & Tragic Death of Wally Wood ,  the World's 2nd Best Comic Book Artist by Steve Starger & J .  David Spurlock ,  is a comprehensive biography .  It was published in 2006 by Vanguard ,  which also publishes collections of Wood's comic book work ,  including Wally Wood :  Strange Worlds of Science Fiction ,  Wally Wood :  Eerie Tales of Crime & Horror ,   Wally Wood :  Dare-Devil Aces ,  Wally Wood :  Jungle Adventures ,  Wally Wood :  Torrid Tales of Romance ,  new editions of The Wizard King books ,  and the Wally Wood Sketchbook .  In 2017 and 2018 ,  Fantagraphics Books published The Life and Legend of Wallace Wood ,  a set of two hardcover books (ISBN978-1-60699-815-1 ,  ISBN978-1-68396-068-3) ,  mainly compiled by his former assistant Bhob Stewart over a 30-year period .  It is a revised ,  expanded ,  and uncensored version of his previous Wood book Against the Grain :  Mad Artist Wallace Wood (TwoMorrows ,  2003) .  It features personal recollections of Wood's friends ,  colleagues ,  and assistants ,  including John Severin ,  Al Williamson ,  Paul Krassner ,  Trina Robbins ,  Larry Hama ,  and Paul Levitz ;  previously unpublished artwork and photographs ;  and a detailed examination of his life and career .  It was Stewart's last publishing project ,  but he did not live to see it in print .    "

However ,  later ,  he defected to Guan Yu ,  a general under the warlord Liu Bei .  Guan Yu appointed Yang Yi as an Officer of Merit (功曹) and sent him to Chengdu – the capital of Yi Province ,  which covered present-day Sichuan and Chongqing – to meet Liu Bei .  Liu Bei had a discussion with Yang Yi on military strategy and politics and was so pleased with his replies that he appointed Yang Yi as a Senior Clerk (掾) in his administrative office . In 221 ,  Liu Bei declared himself emperor and founded the state of Shu Han to challenge Cao Pi's claim to the Han throne .    After returning to Chengdu ,  Yang Yi thought that he had made great contributions so he strongly believed that he would be chosen to succeed Zhuge Liang as the new head of the Shu government .  He asked one Zhao Zheng (趙正) to use the I Ching to predict his fortune for him and felt gloomy when the prediction was not to his expectation .  When Zhuge Liang was still alive ,  he had secretly noted that Yang Yi was impulsive and narrow-minded ,  so he chose Jiang Wan to be his successor .  After Zhuge Liang's death ,  Jiang Wan was appointed as the Prefect of the Masters of Writing (尚書令) and the Inspector (刺史) of Yi Province ;  Yang Yi ,  on the other hand ,  was appointed as a Central Military Adviser (中軍師) – an appointment with no actual power . Initially ,  when Yang Yi was serving as a Master of Writing (尚書) ,  Jiang Wan ranked lower than him ,  but both of them were later appointed as Chief Clerks under Zhuge Liang .  Yang Yi viewed himself highly and saw himself as superior to Jiang Wan because he had been serving in Shu longer than Jiang Wan .  He openly expressed his dissatisfaction by grumbling and complaining .  The others ignored him due to his poor choice of words in conveying his frustration except Fei Yi ,  who comforted him .  Yang Yi once told Fei Yi ,  """"When the Imperial Chancellor (Zhuge Liang) died ,  I should have brought along my men and defected to Wei if I knew I'd end up in this situation today! I deeply regret but there's nothing I can do now . """" Fei Yi secretly reported Yang Yi's speech to the Shu government .  In 235 ,  Yang Yi was removed from office ,  demoted to the status of a commoner ,  and exiled to Hanjia Commandery (漢嘉郡 ;  around present-day Lushan County ,  Sichuan) .  While he was in Hanjia Commandery ,  Yang Yi wrote a memorial to the Shu imperial court and used emotionally charged language to express his frustration and lash out at the imperial court .

Abd al-Rahman's father ,  Muhammad ,  was far less distinguished ,  serving an unsuccessful tenure as Umayyad governor of Tabaristan ,  and becoming involved in the Second Fitna as a supporter of the anti-Umayyad rebel Ibn al-Zubayr ,  being killed in 686/7 in the campaign that overthrew al-Mukhtar .  Like his father at Siffin ,  he is denigrated by pro-Alid sources for his ambiguous role in the Battle of Karbala in 680 ,  being held responsible for the arrests of Muslim ibn Aqil and Hani ibn Urwa . Ibn al-Ash'ath's mother ,  Umm Amr ,  was the daughter of Sa'id ibn Qays al-Hamdani . According to the historian al-Tabari ,  the young Ibn al-Ash'ath accompanied his father and participated in his political activities :  in 680 he revealed the hiding-place of Muslim ibn Aqil to the authorities . Ibn al-Ash'ath disappears from the record during the next few years ,  but after Mus'ab was defeated and killed by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan at the Battle of Maskin in October 691 ,  he ,  like other followers of Mus'ab ,  apparently went over to the Umayyads . In 694 ,  Abd al-Malik appointed the trusted and capable al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf as the new governor of Iraq ,  a crucial post given the restiveness of the region towards Umayyad rule .  In 697 ,  his remit was expanded to cover the entirety of the eastern Caliphate ,  including Khurasan and Sistan . In late 695 ,  al-Hajjaj entrusted Ibn al-Ash'ath with 6 , 000 horsemen and the campaign against the Kharijite rebels under Shabib ibn Yazid al-Shaybani .  Although the Kharijites numbered just a few hundred ,  they benefited from Shabib's tactical skill and had defeated every Umayyad commander sent against them thus far . As a result ,  the governor of al-Mada'in ,  Uthman ibn Qatan ,  wrote to al-Hajjaj criticizing Ibn al-Ash'ath's leadership as timid and ineffective .  Al-Hajjaj responded by giving command to Uthman ,  but when the latter attacked Shabib on 20 March 696 ,  the Umayyad army suffered a heavy defeat ,  losing around 900 men and fleeing to Kufa .  Uthman himself was killed ,  while Ibn al-Ash'ath ,  who lost his horse ,  managed to escape with the help of a friend and reached Kufa after an eventful journey .  Fearing reprisals for the defeat by al-Hajjaj ,  he remained in hiding until the governor of Iraq granted him pardon . Despite this setback ,  relations between Ibn al-Ash'ath and al-Hajjaj were initially friendly ,  and al-Hajjaj's son married one of Ibn al-Ash'ath's sisters .

*** "*page_ Decebalus" "*cat_ Ancient_people_who_committed_suicide" " After the death of Great King Burebista ,  Dacia split into four ,  then five smaller kingdoms .  Nothing is known about Decebalus' youth or background .  Decebalus appears to have risen to prominence in the court of the Dacian king Duras ,  who claimed authority over all Dacian territory .   An ancient Dacian pot bearing the words “Decebalus per Scorilo” led to the suggestion that this might mean """"Decebalus son of Scorilo"""" . According to Lucian Boia this suggestion was originally a """"scholarly joke"""" ,  but the theory has been considered plausible by several writers . In 85 AD the Dacian army began minor raids upon the heavily fortified Roman province of Moesia ,  located south of the Danube .  In 86 King Duras ordered a more vigorous attack south into Moesia .  Roman sources refer to the attack being led by """"Diurpaneus"""" (or """"Dorpaneus"""") .  Many authors have taken this person to be Duras himself ,  and refer to him as """"Duras-Diurpaneus"""" . The Dacians defeated and killed Oppius Sabinus ,  the governor of Moesia ,  forcing Domitian to deploy more troops to the area .  Marcus Cornelius Nigrinus replaced Sabinus .  Domitian took command to deal with the problem himself ,  arriving with his general ,  prefect of the Praetorian Guards ,  Cornelius Fuscus .    Decebalus was hunted down and finally cornered by Roman detachments seeking his head .   Rather than being captured only to be exhibited and humiliated at Rome ,  Decebalus committed suicide by slashing his own throat ,  as depicted on Trajan's Column (spiral 22 ,  panel b) . It is likely that he killed himself as a Roman cavalry scout named Tiberius Claudius Maximus from Legio VII Claudia was approaching .  He was probably still alive when Maximus reached him ,  as is claimed on Maximus' funerary stele discovered at Gramini in Greece .  Maximus is presumably the figure seen on Trajan's column reaching out to Decebalus from his horse . Decebalus' head and right hand were then taken to Trajan in """"Ranisstorum"""" (an unidentified Dacian village ,  perhaps Piatra Craivii) by Maximus ,  who was decorated by the emperor .  The trophy was sent to Rome where it was thrown down the Gemonian stairs .  "

Ho Ka-i started to get involved in communist politics ,  as a way for his family to try to get out of the lower class .

Throughout the 1920s ,  Ho Ka-i attended conferences and meetings in the USSR and at the age of 22 ,  he joined the Communist Party .  Not long after Ho Ka-i joined the Communist Party ,  he became well known for his intelligence and remarkable organizational skills ,  soon becoming the secretary of the Far Eastern committee of the Soviet Communist Youth League .

Her ballet Death and the Maiden (choreography and costumes) for Ballet Rambert based on the music by Franz Schubert was premiered at the Duchess Theatre ,  London ,  on 23 February 1937 ,  danced by herself as The Maiden ,  and John Bryon as Death .

Her ballet Death and the Maiden (choreography and costumes) for Ballet Rambert based on the music by Franz Schubert was premiered at the Duchess Theatre ,  London ,  on 23 February 1937 ,  danced by herself as The Maiden ,  and John Bryon as Death .  On 18 January 1940 ,  it received its American Ballet Theatre premiere at The Center Theatre ,  New York ,  danced by Howard ,  and with Kurt Karnakoski as Death .

*** "*page_ Kay_Sage" "*cat_ Artists_who_committed_suicide" " Anne Wheeler Ward Sage left her husband and older daughter soon after Kay's birth to live and travel in Europe with Kay as her companion .  She and Henry Sage divorced in 1908 ,  but Henry Sage continued to support his ex-wife and younger daughter ,  and Kay visited him and his new wife in Albany occasionally and wrote him frequent letters . Kay and her mother established a home in Rapallo ,  Italy ,  but visited many other places as well ,  including Paris .  She attended a number of schools ,  including the Foxcroft School in Virginia ,  where she became a lifelong friend of the heiress Flora Payne Whitney . As a child she drew and wrote as hobbies , Sage met a young Italian nobleman ,  Prince Ranieri di San Faustino ,  in Rome around 1923Perhaps spurred by the deaths of her father in 1933 and her sister ,  from tuberculosis ,  in 1934 (Anne had joined Kay and her mother in Italy in the 1920s ,  and the sisters became quite close during Anne's final illness) , Sage moved to Paris in March 1937 and rented a luxurious apartment there . This exposure to Surrealism inspired Sage to begin painting in earnest .  She exhibited six of her new oils in the Salon des Surindépendants show at the Porte de Versailles in the fall of 1938 .  These semiabstract paintings ,  including Afterwards and The World Is Blue ,  borrowed motifs and styles from de Chirico and the Surrealists but showed hints of Sage's own future work as well . Several stories are told about Sage's meeting with her future husband ,  Surrealist artist Yves Tanguy .  One came from Greek poet Nicolas Calas ,  who recalled that he and Tanguy accompanied Surrealist leader André Breton to the Surindépendants exhibit and were impressed enough by Sage's paintings to seek her out .  Calas claimed that Breton  was sure that the paintings must have been made by a man . Tanguy at the time was married to Jeannette Ducroq , Germany invaded Poland in September 1939 ,  beginning World War II ,  and Sage sailed back to the United States a month later .  She immediately set up plans to help the Surrealists immigrate as well and establish themselves in the new country by means of art exhibitions—starting with Tanguy ,  who joined her in New York City in November . Sage did the bulk of her mature work between 1940 ,  when she married Tanguy ,  and 1955 ,  when he died suddenly from a cerebral hemorrhage . Although the Tanguys visited ,  and were visited by ,  many members of both the French expatriate and American art communities ,  such as mobile designer Alexander Calder and his family ,  they had difficulty keeping close friends .  """"Again and again Sage is described During these years Sage's art gained a solid reputation among art critics ,  though she found it difficult to emerge from the shadow of the better-known Tanguy .  Her work was regularly included in national exhibits ,  won prizes ,  and was sold to major art museums . The relationship between Kay Sage and Yves Tanguy was as enigmatic as their art .  At the same parties during which he banged his head against those of other men ,  Tanguy assaulted Sage verbally and sometimes physically ,  pushing her and sometimes even threatening her with a knife .  Sage ,  according to friends' accounts ,  made no response to her husband's aggression except to try to persuade him to go home . Sage did fewer new paintings after Tanguy died ,  partly because of her depression and partly because of her decreasing eyesight due to cataracts . One of the chief paintings in a show of 13 of Sage's oils at the Viviano Gallery in November 1958 was called The Answer Is No . In 1959 and 1960 she underwent operations to remove her cataracts ,  which she had formerly refused to do . Sage wrote in a journal in August 1961 ,  """"I have said all that I have to say .  There is nothing left for me to do but scream . """"    "

Hisamasa had been compelled to step down by many of his retainers in favor of his son ,  Nagamasa .   Hisamasa retired ,  and would later commit suicide along with his son in August 1573 .   Nagamasa successfully battled both Rokkaku Yoshikata and Saitō Tatsuoki between 1560 and 1564 .   He is remembered as being a capable commander of troops on the battlefield . He married Oda Nobunaga's sister Oichi in 1564 .  Nobunaga desired peaceful relations with the Azai clan because of their strategic position in between Oda clan land's and the capital ,  Kyoto .    Over the course of the next two years ,  with the exception of occasional interventions by the Shogun ,  Azai Nagamasa was under constant threat of Nobunaga aggression into Omi .   Often these threats manifested into sieges of the Azai capital of Odani .   During this period the Azai are seen as being loosely aligned with numerous anti-Oda forces ,  including the Asakura ,  the Miyoshi ,  the Rokkaku ,  and several religious complexes . In 1573 ,  Nobunaga laid siege to Odani Castle .  Although the Asakura sent a relief force ,  Nobunaga defeated this force and chased the Asakura into their lands .   Shortly thereafter ,  the Asakura were destroyed .  Nobunaga then returned south to prosecute the siege of Odani Castle . Nagamasa had no hope of winning ,  and chose to commit seppuku .   Before dying ,  he entrusted his wife Oichi and their three daughters to Nobunaga .

However ,  Nobunaga had Hideyoshi execute Manpukumaru ,  and the head was displayed on a stake .  Nobunaga ensured that his sister ,  Oichi ,  was uninformed of this but she eventually came to that suspicion .  There are reports that Nobunaga bore a strong grudge against Nagamasa for his perceived betrayal of their alliance even though it was he who broke the agreement first .

*** "*page_ Cyrus_Leroy_Baldridge" "*cat_ Artists_who_committed_suicide" " Baldridge's career in art began when the 10-year-old Cyrus was accepted as the youngest student at Frank Holme'sBaldridge was admitted to the University of Chicago in 1907 and graduated in 1911 and was evermore devoted to that institution .  He was poor boy with no scholarship in an elite college .  During his whole life lack of money never stopped him from anything ,  and at the University of Chicago he paid his way by drawing signs for campus events .  He became a campus leader ,  most likely to succeed ,  Grand Marshal of the University and a model for students who remembered him long afterwards .  According to Harry Hansen ,  """"Men who knew him then will talk to you about him by the hour – but not necessarily about his drawings .  They will tell you about his honesty ,  his candor ,  his sense of democracy ,  his unfailing good humor and his faith in his fellow man . """"After college ,  life for Baldridge was both struggle and an exuberant adventure .  While looking for commissions as an illustrator ,  he worked in a Chicago settlement house and in the stockyards .  He became superb rider while training in the Illinois National Guard Cavalry and with that skill worked as a cow hand on the 6666 Ranch in Texas for a summer .   When World War I began ,  Baldridge traveled through occupied Belgium and France as a war correspondent and illustrator .  Using a German letter of passage he interacted with the conquered and their conquerors .  He traveled through war zones on bicycle ,  horse cart and horseback until his money ran out and he returned to Chicago . Called to Mexico as a member of the National Guard he was on the Mexican/American border in 1916 to repulse Pancho Villa and in 1917 he joined the French Army as a stretcher bearer .  The entrance of the United States into the war required his transfer to the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) .   In the AEF he joined the talented team that brought the Stars and Stripes newspaper into being .  Baldridge was the chief artist on staff that included Harold Ross ,  founder of The New Yorker ,  Alexander Woollcott ,  drama critic for the New York Times ,  and others who later achieved considerable fame .  As a journalist ,  Baldridge traveled freely and saw as much as any general .  His work appeared in virtually every issue of Stars and Stripes from March 1918 until the end of the War in November ,  1918 ,  and portrayed the full range of emotion of soldiers facing death at the Front .   HaroldRoss called him the greatest illustrator of the War . Cyrus Baldridge saw as much of the War as anyone could ,  having traveled with the German army as a journalist in the beginning ,  and later being part of both the French and American campaigns .  He had walked among piles of dead soldiers and lines of innocent people filling the roads after their homes had been destroyed .  He had begun as an idealistic follower of the Wilsonian dream but ,  by the end ,  was dreadfully disillusioned with war and the colonialism that lay behind it .  In the Chicago Evening Post he described what he had seen as """" .   .   .  a nightmare of horror :  a red vision of machine guns and dead men ,  inspiring only a feeling of disgust for the cold efficiency with which it was accomplished . """"Baldridge's reputation as an illustrator was launched in the United States when his battlefield drawings appeared on many covers of Leslie's Weekly and Scribners .  His illustrations in Stars and Stripes reached an audience of 530 , 000 soldiers weekly by the end of the War and many copies were sent home to family and friends .   After the war he assembled his sketches as his first book ,  I was There with the Yanks in France .  I Was There is a collection of sketches that record ,  better than cameras could ,  intimate moments of sadness ,  heroism and relaxation .  The book's publication was more than an artistic triumph .  Through it Baldridge meant to carry his perceptions of the War to the world .  As he told Harry Hansen ,  """"If only I can make the public see what war is – what a dirty ,  low thing it is ,  and how brutal it makes men ,  fine clean men – then they'd fight to the last ditch for the League of Nations . """"Like most liberals in the 1920s Baldridge believed that war could be outlawed and espoused a one-world internationalism .   He was a follower of Norman Thomas and at least once spoke on behalf of Jane Addams' pacifist Women's International League for Peace and Freedom .  In 1922 he joined the Willard Straight Postof the American Legion in New York .   Formed by John Dos Passos ,  Walter Lippman by other liberal intellectuals ,  it was the only Post to stand against the conservative leadership of the American Legion .   In 1936 ,  as president of the Willard Straight Post and chairman of the Legion's New York Committee on Americanism ,  Baldridge wrote and illustrated a 16-page booklet ,  Americanism -- What Is It ,  which was designed to be distributed in schools for use in the civics curriculum .   Mild in tone and taking its ideas from the words of Lincoln ,  Washington ,  Jefferson and the Constitution ,  the booklet became the target of an attack by the American Legion leadership .   Liberal thinkers like John Dewey and University of Chicago president Robert Maynard Hutchins gave Baldridge their support ,  but conservatives and ,  particularly ,  the Hearst newspapers loudly denounced it .  The fight became national and even reached the floor of Congress where each side had its defenders .   In the end ,  the booklet lost the support of the American Legion ,  but ,  selling in the thousands ,  it generated enormous discussion of important issues—starting with freedom of speech .   Later Baldridge took more pride in writing and defending the little publication than anything else he had ever done and printed it in its entirety in his autobiography . In 1920 ,  Baldridge joined his life with that of the writer Caroline Singer .  They built a house in Harmon ,  New York ,  but frequently turned the key in the front door and left on long journeys around the world .   Caroline Singer shared Baldridge's politics ,  becoming a leader in the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom .  She shared his work life ,  her writing was often enhanced with his illustrations .    But most of all she shared a need ,  at times an almost compulsive ,  to know the world through other eyes .  They became wanderers who left New York time after time on adventures of discovery with hardly enough money to reach the tramp steamer that would begin their journey .  Alexander Woollcott wrote of Baldridge in 1927 : Caroline Singer is his partner in vagrancy .   can lodge with equal comfort in the Ritz or the nearest haystack and move from one to the other with the readiest adaptability . Their travel was not tourism but was designed to help comprehend the great questions of the world .  To understand better the background of the Negro in America ,  they moved ,  mostly on foot ,  across Africa from Sierra Leone to Ethiopia .  Along the way they lived in native villages where Baldridge sketched and communicated with the Africans through pictures .  They traveled light ,  he in a golf cap and she in anything comfortable .  No pith helmets ,  no guns ,  never asking or accepting the special treatment demanded by other members of their race .   In India ,  they never saw the Taj Mahal ,  but they met Rabindranath Tagore and participated in dark-of-night meetings with Gandhian nationalists . From this African journey came a marvelous book ,  written by Caroline Singer and lavishly illustrated by Baldridge ,  White Africans and Black .  It is an elegant and respectful portrayal of black African culture written at a time when whites hardly even acknowledged its existence .  The experience left them deeply committed to the rights of black Americans .  Baldridge frequently worked for Opportunity ,  a journal of the Urban League ,  and he beautifully illustrated several books by African American authors .  After his African adventure he convinced Samuel Insull to donate hundreds of his splendid sketches to Fisk University .  Upon their acquisition ,  Charles S .  Johnson ,  a prominent sociologist who was later to become president of Fisk ,  said ,  """"The Baldridge Collection represents the best representation available of African Life . """" Having seen the world and its people at close hand ,  Baldridge was intense in his refusal to work with any author who portrayed another race as inferior or foolish . More journeys followed to Asia and the Middle East ,  with other fine books growing out of them .  Long periods spent in China and Japan brought him in contact with leading Asian artists .  In 1921 he published A Chinese album ,  monotypes by Cyrus Leroy Baldridge in the journal Asia and later Baldridge and Singer together wrote A Turn to the East . The Baldridge style was considerably changed by his exposure to the spare lines of Asian ,  especially Japanese ,  art .  For a short time in the 1920s he worked with Watanabe Shozaburo in Tokyo and the 1930s he used what he had learned to producing a number of fine woodblock prints ,  etchings and drypoints .  This work in pure art ,  as contrasted with his work as an illustrator ,  was widely admired and in 1935 he given the annual award of the Prairie Printmakers of Chicago and at about the same time his etchings were exhibited in the Smithsonian . Baldridge's long and deep experience with the cultures of Asia ,  Africa and the Middle East put him in line for important commissions .  He illustrated many books and articles with oriental themes the foremost of which were the stunning 1937 reissue of Hajji Baba of Isfahan by James Morier and the 1941 Translations from the Chinese by Arthur Waley .  Both books were early Book-of-the-Month Club special editions and their illustrations ,  distributed separately by the Book of the Month Club ,  were framed and hung on walls in thousands of homes . In the early 1930s ,  Baldridge and a group of New York friends organized the Williard Straight American Legion Post to combat the dominant right-wing ideology of the Legion at that time .  Baldridge was elected president of the Williard Straight Post five times and he was especially proud of a small booklet he wrote and illustrated for the Legion called Americanism :  What is It .  Released in 1936 ,  the booklet was a simple restatement of American values ,  mostly quoted from the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution .  It was distributed free by the Legion to thousands of schools ,  until the right wing leadership got wind that Thomas Jefferson was on the rise forced its withdrawal . In the 1940s ,  Cyrus Baldridge illustrated more than one hundred books and magazine articles and ,  in 1947 ,  he wrote an autobiography :  Time and Chance .  The book is both splendidly written and lavishly illustrated .  It was quite successful ,  being listed on the New York Times best seller list for months .  Profits from Time and Chance ,  combined with several years of earnings from well-paid work with the Information Please Almanac ,  made it possible for him and Caroline to retire to Santa Fe ,  New Mexico in 1951 .  There they lived simply in a small adobe house among like-minded free-spirits . In Santa Fe ,  Baldridge began to seriously work in oils .  His painting ranged over every possible theme ,  but chiefly portrayed New Mexican landscapes .  In the thirty years between his retirement and his death ,  he hiked virtually the whole of northern New Mexico ,  sketching with charcoal or water colors ,  and returning home to complete his work in oils .  A large number of these later works are in the collection of the University of Wyoming . The plan of the couple had been for Caroline to write while Cyrus painted during their years of """"retirement"""" ,  but from the time they arrived in New Mexico she suffered from a block to the great abilities that made her so successful in New York .  She wrote hardly anything and completed nothing .  Later it was speculated that she had begun a series of small strokes that eventually led to dementia and death .   "

King Aegeus who was childless with his previous marriages went to Troezen ,  a city southwest of Athens that had as its patrons Athena and Poseidon .  Here Pittheus got Aegeus drunk on unmixed wine and put him to bed with his daughter .  Following the instructions of Athena in a dream ,  she left the sleeping Aegeus and waded across to the island of Sphairia that lay close to Troezen's shore .  There she poured a libation to Sphairos ,  Pelops' charioteer ,  and laid with Poseidon in the night .  Aethra was therefore impregnated by both Aegeus This opinion ,  however ,  is nothing else but an attempt to strip the genuine story of its marvels .  Aethra ,  later on dedicated in the island of Sphairia a temple to Athena Apaturia (the Deceitful) ,  and called the island Hiera instead of Sphaeria ,  and also introduced among the maidens of Troezen the custom of dedicating their girdles to Athena Apaturia on the day of their marriage .  At a later time ,  when Aethra was thus doubly pregnant ,  Aegeus decided to go back to Athens .  Before leaving ,  he covered his sandals ,  shield and sword under a huge rock ,  that served as a primitive altar to Strong Zeus ,  and told her that when their son would grow up ,  he should move the rock and bring his weapons back .  Aethra did as she was told ,  and Theseus ,  recovering the weapons that were his birthright ,  grew to be a great hero ,  killing the Minotaur ,  among other adventures . Later ,  when Theseus kidnapped Helen ,  he gave her to Aethra for safekeeping .  Helen's brothers ,  the Dioscuri ,  took Helen back and kidnapped Aethra to Lacedaemon in revenge .

During his tenure at the Tribune ,  Bliss concentrated his efforts on unearthing corruption and government waste .  In 1950 ,  he broke the story of rampant sexual and physical abuse at the Cook County juvenile home .  His 1961 series on massive corruption at the Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater Chicago won him the 1962 Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting .  Bliss had discovered that the department had been paying salaries to people not even employed . In 1968 ,  the Tribune refused to let Bliss publish a story on Illinois Secretary of State Paul Powell taking bribes .  Bliss left the newspaper and went to work for a local non-profit ,  the Better Government Association .  In 1971 ,  he uncovered corruption in the city's ambulance companies which helped reporter William Jones win a 1971 Pulitzer Prize .  After the shootings of Fred Hampton and Mark Clark in 1969 ,  the Tribune developed a reputation for being a pro-establishment newspaper .  They rehired Bliss in October 1971 to counter this image .  One of his most extensive series was co-authored with five Tribune reporters ,  including Chuck Neubauer .  The team's investigation uncovered a conspiracy between mortgage companies and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development to defraud American taxpayers .  The investigative team won the 1976 Pulitzer Prize for Local Investigative Specialized Reporting . Bliss was famous for cultivating an image as an """"old-time"""" reporter ,  wearing a fedora and oversized suits and writing all his stories on an old Royal typewriter .  He would sometimes even impersonate police officers or coroners to chase down leads .  An estimated 100 criminal convictions resulted from his news pieces .   "

After joining the Army at age 19 ,  Bodē went AWOL but later received an honorable discharge due to a psychiatric diagnosis . Bodē married Barbara Hawkins at age 20 in 1961 . Around 1970–1971 ,  conversations with the guru Prem Rawat and fellow cartoonist Jeffrey Catherine Jones (with whom Bodē shared a studio in Woodstock ,  New York)Bodē's death was due to autoerotic asphyxiation .  His last words were to his son :  """"Mark ,  I've seen God four times ,  and I'm going to see him again soon .  That's No .  1 to me ,  and you're No .  2 . """"He left behind a library of sketchbooks ,  journals ,  finished and unfinished works ,  paintings ,  and comic strips .  Most of his art has since been published in a variety of collections ,  mostly from Fantagraphics .   In 1963 ,  at age 21 ,  and while living in Utica ,  New York , In the mid 1960s Bodē was living in Syracuse ,  New York ,  attending classes at Syracuse University and contributing to The Sword of Damocles ,  a student-run ,  though not university-sanctioned ,  humor magazine similar to The Harvard Lampoon .  It was here that Bodē's most famous comic creation ,  Cheech Wizard ,  first saw publication .  Cheech Wizard (sometimes characterized as a """"cartoon messiah"""") is a wizard whose large yellow hat (decorated with black and red stars) covers his entire body except his legs and his big red feet .  Cheech Wizard is constantly in search of a good party ,  cold beer ,  and attractive women .  Usually depicted without arms ,  it is never actually revealed what Cheech Wizard looks like under the hat ,  or exactly what kind of creature he is ,  although in the episode entitled """"The Unmasking of Cheech Wizard"""" ,  when he """"doffs the hat"""" ,  it is evident that underneath was a low-rent Oz man all along (in an interview ,  reference is made to the frontal lump in the hat caused by crossed arms) .  Characters pressing the issue generally are rewarded with a swift kick to the groin by Cheech .  After an initial run in The Sword of Damocles ,  the strip continued for a few more years in The Daily Orange ,  the student-written newspaper at Syracuse University . In 1968 ,  Bodē illustrated the cover & interior art for R .  A .  Lafferty's science fiction novel Space Chantey ,  published by Ace Double .  In the late 1960s and early 1970s ,  he illustrated covers and interior art for the science fiction digests Amazing Stories ,  Fantastic ,  Galaxy Science Fiction ,  Witzend and Worlds of If . Discovered by fellow cartoonist Trina Robbins ,  Bodē moved to Manhattan in 1969 and joined the staff of the underground newspaper the East Village Other .  At the East Village Other ,  he helped found Gothic Blimp Works ,  an underground comics supplement to the magazine ,  which ran for eight issues ,  the first two edited by Bodē . Bodē's post-apocalyptic science fiction action series Cobalt 60 featured an antihero wandering a devastated post-nuclear land ,  seeking to avenge the murder of his parents .  Cobalt-60 debuted as a ten-page black-and-white story in the science fiction fanzine Shangri L'Affaires (a . k . a .  Shaggy) #73 ,  published in 1968 .  Bodē won the 1969 Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist largely on the strength of Cobalt 60 ,  but he never did anything else with the character .  (Cobalt-60 was later """"completed"""" in the early 1980s by Bodē's son Mark Bodé ,  with stories by Larry Todd ,  who was Vaughn's friend and collaborator in the 1960s on projects for Eerie ,  Creepy ,  and Vampirella magazines . )Beginning in 1968 and continuing until his untimely death ,  Bodē entered a prolific period of creativity ,  introducing a number of strips and ongoing series ,  most of which ran in underground newspapers or erotic magazines : Print Mint published four issues of Bodē's solo series Junkwaffel from 1971–1974 .  Bodē's graphic novel The Man ,  published by Print Mint in 1972 ,  is about a caveman who accidentally makes important observations about life . Beginning in 1972 ,  Bodē toured with a show called the """"Cartoon Concert"""" ,  that featured him vocalizing his characters while their depictions were presented on a screen behind him via a slide projector Bodē's death was due to autoerotic asphyxiation .

*** "*page_ Margaux_Hemingway" "*cat_ Female_suicides" " Born Margot Louise Hemingway in Portland ,  Oregon ,  she was the daughter of Byra Louise (née Whittlesey) and Jack Hemingway (eldest son of writer Ernest Hemingway) .  When she learned that she was named after the wine ,  Château Margaux ,  which her parents drank on the night she was conceived ,  she changed the spelling from """"Margot"""" to """"Margaux"""" to match . She had two sisters ,  actress Mariel Hemingway ,  and Joan (nicknamed Muffet) .  During her childhood ,  the family relocated from Oregon to Cuba ,  where her grandfather had lived , Margaux struggled with a variety of disorders beginning in her teenage years ,  including alcoholism ,  depression ,  bulimia ,  and epilepsy .  With her permission ,  a video recording was made of her therapy session related to her bulimia ,  and it was broadcast on television .   She also suffered from dyslexia .   At 6 feet (1 . 8m) tall ,  Hemingway experienced success as a model ,  including a million-dollar contract for Fabergé as the spokesmodel for Babe perfume in the 1970s . In a 1997 E! True Hollywood Story that profiled Hemingway's life ,  her mentor and close friend Zachary Selig discussed how he helped launch her early career with his initial marketing and public relations work as she became a global celebrity ,  and he introduced her to yoga and the Solar Kundalini """"Codex Relaxatia"""" paradigm as tools for success and to overcome some of her debilitating mental disorders .  Selig and Hemingway spent time with the Hemingway family at their property in Ketchum adjacent to Sun Valley ,  where they studied Solar Kundalini ,  yoga ,  and meditation together .  Hemingway continued using these relaxation skills for the rest of her life . During the height of her modeling career in the mid- to late 1970s ,  Hemingway was a regular attendee of New York City's exclusive discothèque Studio 54 ,  often in the company of such celebrities as Halston ,  Bianca Jagger ,  Liza Minnelli ,  Grace Jones ,  and Andy Warhol .  At such social mixers ,  she began to use alcohol and drugs . Hemingway made her film debut in the Lamont Johnson-directed rape and revenge film Lipstick (1976) ,  alongside her 14-year-old sister Mariel ,  and Anne Bancroft .  In it ,  she plays a fashion model who is terrorized by a rapist .  The film's violent depiction of rape led it to be labeled an exploitation film ,  though in later years it had success as a cult film . She followed this with a supporting role in the Italian horror film Killer Fish (1979) ,  opposite Lee Majors and Karen Black .  Her following project was the comedy They Call Me Bruce? in 1982 .  In 1984 ,  Hemingway had a supporting part in Over the Brooklyn Bridge ,  opposite Elliott Gould and Shelley Winters .  After a skiing accident in 1984 ,  Hemingway gained 75 pounds (34kg) ,  ending up at nearly 200 lbs ,  and became increasingly depressed .  In 1987 ,  she checked into the Betty Ford Center . Attempting to make a comeback ,  she appeared on the cover of Playboy in May 1990 ,  and asked the magazine to hire Selig as the creative director for her cover story .  It was shot in Belize . Hemingway continued to support herself by appearing in a small number of direct-to-video films into the 1990s ,  autographing her nude photos from Playboy ,  and endorsing a psychic telephone hotline owned by her cousin ,  Adiel Hemingway .  Shortly before her death ,  she was set to host the outdoor adventure series Wild Guide on the Discovery Channel .  On July 1 ,  1996 ,  Hemingway was found dead in her studio apartment in Santa Monica .  Though her body was found reportedly badly decomposed , Hemingway was interred at the Hemingway family plot at Ketchum Cemetery in Ketchum ,  Idaho .

It is often reported that her mother died when she was very young ,  but there is no documented evidence supporting this .  There is ,  however ,  a Last Will and Testament dated 15 December 1922 ,  in the Entwistle family archives ,  in which Robert Entwistle specifically stated the following : Millicent Lilian Entwistle is the daughter of my first wife whom I divorced and the custody of my said daughter was awarded to me .  I do not desire my said daughter to be at any time in the custody or control of her said mother . Peg Entwistle reportedly emigrated to America ,  sailing from Liverpool aboard the S . S .  Philadelphia in 1916 ,  and settled in New York City . In December 1922 ,  Robert Entwistle died ,  the victim of a hit-and-run motorist on Park Avenue and 72nd Street in New York City .    On 18 September 1932 ,  a woman was hiking below the Hollywoodland sign ,  when she found a woman's shoe ,  purse ,  and jacket .  She opened the purse and found a suicide note ,  after which she looked down the mountain and saw the body below .  The woman reported her findings to the Los Angeles police and laid the items on the steps of the Hollywood police station . Later ,  a detective and two radio car officers found the body in a ravine below the sign .  Entwistle remained unidentified until her uncle ,  with whom she had been living in the Beachwood Canyon area ,  identified her remains .  He connected her two-day absence with the description and the initials """"P . E .  , """" written on the suicide note ,  which had been published in the newspapers . The cause of death was listed by the coroner as """"multiple fractures of the pelvis . """"The suicide note ,  as published ,  read : I am afraid ,  I am a coward .  I am sorry for everything .  If I had done this a long time ago ,  it would have saved a lot of pain .  P . E . Entwistle's death brought wide and often sensationalized publicity .  Her funeral was held at the W . M .  Strathers Mortuary ,  in Hollywood ,  on 20 September . In 2014 ,  roughly 100 people marked the anniversary of Entwistle's death by gathering in the parking lot of Beachwood Market in Hollywood ,  to watch Thirteen Women on an outdoor screen .  Proceeds from a raffle and from food and beverages sold at the screening were donated to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention in Entwistle's name .  "

He had a sister named Pomponia .  Growing up ,  he studied and developed close friendships with Cicero ,  Lucius Manlius Torquatus ,  and Gaius Marius the Younger .  He is said to have been an excellent student ,  and in 85BC ,  Atticus moved to Athens to further his education ,  particularly in philosophy .  His love of Athens inspired his self-appointed nickname """"Atticus"""" ,  or """"Man of Attica"""" ,  which is mentioned in the fifth book of Cicero's De Finibus (section 4) .  During his visit to Athens ,  Julius Caesar was Atticus's guest . Atticus inherited family money ,  which he successfully invested in real estate ,  enhancing his wealth .  Using his income to support his love of letters ,  he had trained Roman slaves as scribes and taught them to make papyrus scrolls ,  allowing Atticus to publish ,  amongst other things ,  the works of his friend Cicero .  His editions of Greek authors such as Plato ,  Demosthenes ,  and Aeschines were prized for their accuracy in the ancient world . In 65 BC ,  Atticus returned from Athens to Rome .  In keeping with his Epicurean sympathies ,  he kept out of politics to the greatest extent possible ,  except to lend Cicero a helping hand in times of peril — for instance ,  when Cicero was forced to flee the country in 49 BC ,  Atticus made him a present of 250 , 000 sesterces .   All in all ,  his political activity was minimal ,  though we know that ,  like Cicero ,  he belonged to the optimates (the aristocratic party) ,  and held generally conservative views .   He was also a partner of the Triumvir Marcus Licinius Crassus . Upon the death of his wealthiest maternal uncle Quintus Caecilius ,  Atticus became his adopted son and heir ,  assuming the name Quintus Caecilius Pomponianus Atticus .  Lucius Licinius Lucullus ,  despite being his personal friend ,  resented Atticus's receiving an inheritance he felt he was entitled to for his association with the campaign against Mithridates and as Governor of Syria . In his later years ,  he married a relative ,  Pilia (c .  75 – 46BC) ,  daughter of Pilius and a maternal granddaughter of the Triumvir ,  Crassus .

Lucius Licinius Lucullus ,  despite being his personal friend ,  resented Atticus's receiving an inheritance he felt he was entitled to for his association with the campaign against Mithridates and as Governor of Syria . In his later years ,  he married a relative ,  Pilia (c .  75 – 46BC) ,  daughter of Pilius and a maternal granddaughter of the Triumvir ,  Crassus .   Atticus and Pilia were married in 58/56BC ,  when Atticus was already 53/54 years old ,  and she died after 12 years of happy marriage .   She bore him a son of the same name ,  Titus Pomponius Atticus (of whom little is known) ,  as well as a daughter ,  Attica ,  who became the first wife of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa . Atticus lived out the remainder of his life in Rome .  Just after his 77th birthday he fell ill ,  and at first his ailment appeared minor .  But after three months his health suddenly deteriorated .

*** "*page_ François_Buzot" "*cat_ 18th-century_suicides" " Born at Évreux ,  Eure ,  he studied Law ,  and ,  at the outbreak of the Revolution was a lawyer in his home town .  In 1789 he was elected deputy to the Estates-General and there became known for his radical opinions .  He demanded the nationalization of the possessions of the Roman Catholic Church ,  and the right of all citizens to bear arms . After the dissolution of the National Constituent Assembly ,  Buzot returned to Évreux ,  where he was named president of the criminal tribunal . In 1792 he was elected deputy to the National Convention ,  and joined the Girondists under the influence of his friend Madame Roland .  Buzot entered a polemic with the main rival of the Girondists ,  Jean-Paul Marat ,  and demanded the formation of a National Guard from the départements to defend the Convention against the Paris crowds of sans-culottes .  His proposal was carried ,  but never put into force - the Parisians subsequently singled him out as a target of their hatred . In the trial of King Louis XVI ,  Buzot voted in favour of the capital punishment death ,  but with appeal to the people and postponement of sentence (sursis) .  He had a sentence of death passed against the Royalist émigrés who did not return to France ,  and against anyone who should demand the re-establishment of the monarchy . Proscribed with the Girondists on 2 June 1793 ,  he escaped ,  and took refuge to Calvados in Normandy ,  where he contributed to organize a Girondist insurrection against the convention ,  which was suppressed soon after . The Convention prosecuted him ,  and decreed """"that the house occupied by Buzot be demolished ,  and never to be rebuilt on this plot .  He left behind his Memoirs ,  first published in 1823 .

*** "*page_ Bobby_Fuller" "*cat_ Deaths_from_asphyxiation" " Born in Baytown ,  Texas ,  Fuller was born in the middle of three boys ,  having a maternal older half-brother ,  Jack ,  and a younger brother ,  Randy .  Fuller moved as a small child to Salt Lake City ,  Utah ,  where he remained until 1956 ,  when he and his family moved to El Paso ,  Texas .  It was the same year that Elvis Presley became popular ,  and Bobby Fuller became mesmerized by the new rock and roll star .  Fuller soon adopted the style of fellow Texan Buddy Holly ,  fronting a four-man combo and often using original material .   During the early 1960s ,  he played in clubs and bars in El Paso ,  and he recorded on independent record labels in Texas with a constantly changing line-up .  The only constant band members were Fuller and his younger brother ,  Randy Fuller (born on January 29 ,  1944 ,  in Hobbs ,  New Mexico) on bass .   These independent releases (except two songs recorded at the studio of Norman Petty in Clovis) ,  and an excursion to Yucca Records ,  also in New Mexico ,  were recorded in the Fullers' own home studio ,  with Fuller acting as the producer .  He even built a primitive echo chamber in the back yard .  The quality of the recordings ,  using a couple of microphones and a mixing board purchased from a local radio station ,  was so impressive that he offered the use of his """"studio"""" to local acts for free so he could hone his production skills . Fuller moved to Los Angeles in 1964 with his band The Bobby Fuller Four and was signed to Mustang Records by producer Bob Keane ,  who was noted for discovering Ritchie Valens and producing many surf music groups .   By this time ,  the group consisted of Fuller and his brother Randy on vocals/guitar and bass respectively ,  Jim Reese on guitar and DeWayne Quirico on drums .  This lineup recorded """"I Fought The Law"""" .  (There are actually two versions of """"I Fought The Law"""" by Fuller ,  the original hit that was released as a 45-rpm single and the re-recording that was issued on an album .  The arrangements are identical ,  but the vocals by Fuller are slightly different . )At a time when the British Invasion and folk rock were the dominant genres in rock ,  Fuller stuck to Buddy Holly's style of classic rock and roll with Tex Mex flourishes .  His recordings ,  both covers and originals ,  also reveal the influences of Eddie Cochran ,  The Beatles ,  Elvis Presley ,  Little Richard ,  and The Everly Brothers ,  as well as surf guitar .  Less well known was Fuller's ability to emulate the reverb-laden surf guitar of Dick Dale and The Ventures .  His first Top 40 hit was the self-penned """"Let Her Dance"""" .  Within months of """"I Fought the Law"""" becoming a top 10 hit ,  Fuller was found dead in an automobile parked outside his Hollywood apartment . Erik Greene ,  a relative of Sam Cooke ,  has cited similarities in the deaths of Cooke and Fuller .  Fuller's bandmate Jim Reese suspected that Charles Manson played a role in Fuller's death ,  but never provided credible evidence ;  Manson was in prison from 1961 to 1967 .  A sensationalist crime website has speculated that the Los Angeles Police Department may have been involved because of Fuller's connection to a Mafia-related woman . Fuller was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles . His death was also explored in the May 11 ,  2015 episode of the NPR program All Things Considered .  "

*** "*page_ Jack_Cole_(artist)" "*cat_ Artists_who_committed_suicide" " Born in New Castle ,  Pennsylvania ,   In 1936 ,  having married childhood sweetheart Dorothy Mahoney soon after graduating high school ,  Cole moved with his wife to New York City's Greenwich Village .  After spending a year attempting to break in as a magazine/newspaper illustrator ,  Cole began drawing for the studio of the Harry """"A"""" Chesler ,  one of the first comic-book """"packagers"""" who supplied outsourced stories to publishers entering the new medium .  There ,  Cole drew such features as """"TNT Todd of the FBI"""" and """"Little Dynamite"""" for Centaur Publications comics such as Funny Pages and Keen Detective Funnies .  He produced such additional features as """"King Kole's Kourt"""" (under the pseudonym Geo .  Nagle) ,  """"Officer Clancy"""" ,  """"Ima Slooth"""" ,  """"Peewee Throttle"""" ,  and """"Burp the Twerp :  The Super So-An'-So"""" (the latter two under the pseudonym Ralph Johns) . Lev Gleason Publications hired Cole in 1939 to edit Silver Streak Comics ,  where one of his first tasks was to revamp the newly created superhero Daredevil .  Other characters created or worked on by the prolific tyro include MLJ's The Comet in Pep Comics—who in short order became the first superhero to be killed—and his replacement ,  the Hangman . After becoming an editor at Lev Gleason and revamping Jack Binder's original Golden Age Daredevil in 1940 ,  Cole was hired at Quality Comics .  He worked with Will Eisner ,  assisting on the writer-artist's signature hero The Spirit—a masked crime-fighter created for a weekly syndicated newspaper Sunday supplement and reprinted in Quality Comics .  At the behest of Quality publisher Everett """"Busy"""" Arnold ,  Cole later created his own satiric ,  Spirit-style hero ,  Midnight ,  for Smash Comics No .  18 (Jan .  1941) .  Midnight ,  the alter ego of radio announcer Dave Clark ,  wore a similar fedora hat and domino mask ,  and partnered with a talking monkey—questionably in place of the Spirit's young African-American sidekick ,  Ebony White . Cole created Plastic Man for a backup feature in Quality's Police Comics #1 (Aug .  1941) .  While Timely Comics' quickly forgotten Flexo the Rubber Man had preceded """"Plas"""" as comics' first stretching hero ,  Cole's character became an immediate hit ,  and Police Comics' lead feature with issue #5 .  As well ,  Cole's offbeat humor ,  combined with Plastic Man's ability to take any shape ,  gave the cartoonist opportunities to experiment with text and graphics in groundbreaking manner—helping to define the medium's visual vocabulary ,  and making the idiosyncratic character one of the few to endure from the Golden Age to modern times .  Plastic Man gained his own title in 1943 . By the decade's end ,  however ,  Cole's feature was being created entirely by anonymous ghost writers and artists—including Alex Kotzky—despite Cole's name being bannered .  One last stint by Cole himself in 1949 and 1950 could not save the title .  Plastic Man was cancelled in 1956 after several years of reprinting the Cole material ,  and new stories by others . Additionally ,  Cole and writer Joe Millard created the lighthearted feature """"The Barker"""" ,  starring carnival barker Carnie Callhan .  Introduced in National Comics #42 (May ,  1944) ,  the feature spun off into a 15-issue comic of its own (Autumn 1946 - Dec .  1949)Cole's career by that time had taken on another dimension .  In 1954 ,  after having drawn slightly risqué ,  single-panel """"good girl art"""" cartoons for magazines ,  using the pen name """"Jake"""" ,  Cole became a cartoon illustrator for Playboy .  Under his own name ,  he produced full-page ,  watercolored gag cartoons of beautiful but dim girls and rich but equally dim old men .  Cole's art first appeared in the fifth issue ;  he would have at least one piece published in Playboy each month for the rest of his life .  , In 1958 ,  Cole created his own daily newspaper comic strip ,  Betsy and Me ,  which he sold to the Chicago Sun-Times Syndicate . On August 13 ,  1958 ,  Cole got in his Chevy station wagon ,  purchased a rifle ,  and fatally shot himself in the head .  On the day he died ,  Cole mailed a suicide note explaining the reasons for his suicide to his wife Dorothy .  The coroner deemed that letter too personal and did not enter it as evidence at the ensuing inquest .  The only explanation Dorothy Cole publicly gave was """"We had had an argument before . """" She subsequently remarried ,  and disappeared from public view .  Cole also wrote a suicide note to his editor and father figure ,  Hugh Hefner ,  which was printed in Art Spiegelman's biography of Cole ,  Jack Cole & Plastic Man :  Forms Stretched To Their Limits .  The note reads : Gravett notes that while Cole owed Hefner money ,  his estate would cover this debt .  Cole did not participate in the Playboy lifestyle ,  though the evening before his suicide ,  he did drink a substantial amount at a Playboy office party . The reason why the 43-year-old Cole killed himself remains one of the greatest mysteries in 20th century American cartooning ,  according to journalist Paul Gravett .

*** "*page_ Leopoldo_Lugones" "*cat_ Suicides_in_Argentina" " Born in Villa de María del Río Seco ,  a city in Córdoba Province ,  in Argentina's Catholic heartland ,  Lugones belonged to a family of landed gentry .  He was the firstborn son of Santiago M .  Lugones and Custodia Argüello .  His father ,  son of Pedro Nolasco Lugones ,  was returning from the city of Buenos Aires to Santiago del Estero when he met Custodia Argüello while stopping in Villa de María ,  a locality that was at that time disputed territory between the provinces of Santiago del Estero and Córdoba .  It was his mother who gave young Leopoldo his first lessons and was responsible for his strict Catholic upbringing . When Lugones was six years old and following the birth of a second child ,  the family moved to the city of Santiago del Estero and later to Ojo de Agua ,  a small town situated in the south of the province of Santiago del Estero close to the border with Córdoba ,  where the poet's two younger brothers were born :  Ramón Miguel Lugones (1880 ,  Santiago del Estero) ,  and the youngest of the four children ,  Carlos Florencio Lugones (1885 ,  Ojo de Agua) .  Later his parents sent him to study at the Colegio Nacional de Monserrat ,  in Córdoba ,  where his maternal grandmother lived .  In 1892 the family would move to that city ,  at the time when Lugones was beginning his forays into the fields of journalism and literature . He first worked for La Montaña ,  a newspaper ,  and was in favour with the aristocratic Manuel Quintana ,  a candidate to become a president of Argentina .  This brought him first to Buenos Aires in 1896 ,  where his literary talent developed quickly . That year ,  he married Juana Agudelo ,  from whom he had a son ,  Leopoldo Polo Lugones ,  who would become the notorious chief of the Federal Police during the dictatorship of José Félix Uriburu .  In 1899 ,  he became an active Freemason .   Lugones was the leading Argentine exponent of the Latin American literary current known as Modernismo .  This was a form of Parnassianism influenced by Symbolism .  He was also the author of the incredibly dense and rich historical novel La Guerra Gaucha (1905) .  He was an impassioned journalist ,  polemicist and public speaker who at first was a Socialist ,  later a conservative/traditionalist and finally a supporter of Fascism and as such an inspiration for a group of rightist intellectuals such as Juan Carulla and Rodolfo Irazusta . Leopoldo Lugones went to Europe in 1906 ,  1911 ,  1913 and in 1930 ,  in which latter year he supported the coup d'état against the aging Radical party president ,  Hipólito Yrigoyen .  Between 1924 and 1931 ,  Lugones took part in the works of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations . On February 18 ,  1938 ,  the despairing and disillusioned Lugones committed suicide by taking a mixture of whisky and cyanide while staying at the river resort of El Tigre in Buenos Aires .  Political frustration has been the most widely cited cause of his suicide .  Nevertheless ,  recent publications in Argentina have shed light on another possible motivation :  Lugones was very enamored of a girl he met at one of his lectures in the university .  He maintained a passionate and emotional relationship with her until ,  discovered and pressured by his son ,  he was forced to leave her ,  causing in him a depressive decline that would end his life . His descendants have had similarly tragic fates .  It is believed that his son Polo ,  the chief of police during Uriburu's dictatorship ,  was the creator of the picana and the one who introduced it as a method of torture .  Polo Lugones committed suicide in 1971 .  Polo's younger daughter ,  Susana Pirí Lugones ,  was detained and disappeared in December 1978 as a victim of the Dirty War .  His older daughter ,  Carmen ,  whom he called Babú ,  is still alive .  One of Pirí's sons ,  Alejandro ,  committed suicide ,  like his great-grandfather ,  in Tigre .  This comprises Lugones' tragic familial fate ,  curiously similar to that of Horacio Quiroga's ,  himself a friend and admirer of Leopoldo Lugones .   "

Polo Lugones committed suicide in 1971 .  Polo's younger daughter ,  Susana Pirí Lugones ,  was detained and disappeared in December 1978 as a victim of the Dirty War .  His older daughter ,  Carmen ,  whom he called Babú ,  is still alive .  One of Pirí's sons ,  Alejandro ,  committed suicide ,  like his great-grandfather ,  in Tigre .  This comprises Lugones' tragic familial fate ,  curiously similar to that of Horacio Quiroga's ,  himself a friend and admirer of Leopoldo Lugones .   "
*** "*page_ Yasunari_Kawabata" "*cat_ Suicides_in_Japan" " Born into a well-established family in Osaka ,  Japan ,  Yasunari was orphaned by the time he was four ,  after which he lived with his grandparents .  He had an older sister who was taken in by an aunt ,  and whom he met only once thereafter ,  at the age of ten in July 1909 .  She died shortly after when he was 11 .  Kawabata's grandmother died when he was seven (September 1906) ,  and his grandfather when he was fifteen (May 1914) . Having lost all close paternal relatives ,  Yasunari moved in with his mother's family (the Kurodas) .  However ,  in January 1916 ,  he moved into a boarding house near the junior high school (comparable to a modern high school) to which he had formerly commuted by train .  Through many of Kawabata's works the sense of distance in his life is represented .  He often gives the impression that his characters have built up a wall around them that moves them into isolation .  In a 1934 published work Kawabata wrote :  """"I feel as though I have never held a woman's hand in a romantic senseAfter graduating from junior high school in March 1917 ,  Kawabata moved to Tokyo just before his 18th birthday .  He hoped to pass the exams of Dai-ichi Kōtō-gakkō (First Upper School) ,  which was under the direction of the Tokyo Imperial University .  He succeeded in the exam the same year and entered the Humanities Faculty as an English major in July 1920 .  A young Kawabata ,  by this time ,  was enamoured by the works of another Asian Nobel laureate ,  Rabindranath Tagore . Kawabata graduated in 1924 ,  by which time he had already caught the attention of Kikuchi Kan and other noted writers and editors through his submissions to Kikuchi's literary magazine ,  the Bungei Shunju . In addition to fictional writing ,  Kawabata also worked as a reporter ,  most notably for the Mainichi Shimbun .  Although he refused to participate in the militaristic fervor that accompanied World War II ,  he also demonstrated little interest in postwar political reforms .  Along with the death of all his family members while he was young ,  Kawabata suggested that the War was one of the greatest influences on his work ,  stating he would be able to write only elegies in postwar Japan .  Still ,  many commentators detect little thematic change between Kawabata's prewar and postwar writings . While still a university student ,  Kawabata re-established the Tokyo University literary magazine Shin-shichō (""""New Tide of Thought"""") ,  which had been defunct for more than four years .  There he published his first short story ,  """"Shokonsai ikkei"""" (""""A View from Yasukuni Festival"""") in 1921 .  During university ,  he changed faculties to Japanese literature and wrote a graduation thesis titled ,  """"A short history of Japanese novels"""" .  He graduated from university in March 1924 .   Kawabata started to achieve recognition for a number of his short stories shortly after he graduated ,  receiving acclaim for """"The Dancing Girl of Izu"""" in 1926 ,  a story about a melancholy student who ,  on a walking trip down Izu Peninsula ,  meets a young dancer ,  and returns to Tokyo in much improved spirits .  The work explores the dawning eroticism of young love but includes shades of melancholy and even bitterness ,  which offset what might have otherwise been an overly sweet story .  Most of his subsequent works explored similar themes . In the 1920s ,  Kawabata was living in the plebeian district of Asakusa ,  Tokyo .  During this period ,  Kawabata experimented with different styles of writing .  In Asakusa kurenaidan (The Scarlet Gang of Asakusa) ,  serialized from 1929 to 1930 ,  he explores the lives of the demimonde and others on the fringe of society ,  in a style echoing that of late Edo period literature .  On the other hand ,  his Suisho genso (Crystal Fantasy) is pure stream-of-consciousness writing .  He was even involved in writing the script for the experimental film A Page of Madness . In 1933 ,  Kawabata protested publicly against the arrest ,  torture and death of the young leftist writer Takiji Kobayashi in Tokyo by the Tokkō special political police . Kawabata relocated from Asakusa to Kamakura ,  Kanagawa Prefecture ,  in 1934 and ,  although he initially enjoyed a very active social life among the many other writers and literary people residing in that city during the war years and immediately thereafter ,  in his later years he became very reclusive . One of his most famous novels was Snow Country ,  started in 1934 and first published in installments from 1935 through 1937 .  Snow Country is a stark tale of a love affair between a Tokyo dilettante and a provincial geisha ,  which takes place in a remote hot-spring town somewhere in the mountainous regions of northern Japan .  It established Kawabata as one of Japan's foremost authors and became an instant classic ,  described by Edward G .  Seidensticker as """"perhaps Kawabata's masterpiece"""" . After the end of World War II ,  Kawabata's success continued with novels such as Thousand Cranes (a story of ill-fated love) ;  The Sound of the Mountain ;  The House of the Sleeping Beauties ;  Beauty and Sadness ;  and The Old Capital . His two most important post-war works are Sembazuru (Thousand Cranes) from 1949 to 1951 ,  and Yama no Oto (The Sound of the Mountain) ,  1949–1954 .  Sembazuru is centered on the tea ceremony and hopeless love .  The protagonist is attracted to the mistress of his dead father and ,  after her death ,  to her daughter ,  who flees from him .  The tea ceremony provides a beautiful background for ugly human affairs ,  but Kawabata's intent is rather to explore feelings about death .  The tea ceremony utensils are permanent and forever ,  whereas people are frail and fleeting .  These themes of implicit incest ,  impossible love and impending death are again explored in Yama no Oto ,  set in Kawabata's home town of Kamakura .  The protagonist ,  an aging man ,  has become disappointed with his children and no longer feels strong passion for his wife .  He is strongly attracted to someone forbidden – his daughter-in-law – and his thoughts for her are interspersed with memories of another forbidden love ,  for his dead sister-in-law . The book that he himself considered his finest work ,  The Master of Go (1951) ,  contrasts sharply with his other works .  It is a semi-fictional recounting of a major Go match in 1938 ,  on which Kawabata had actually reported for the Mainichi newspaper chain .  It was the last game of the master Shūsai's career and he lost to his younger challenger ,  only to die a little over a year later .  Although the novel is moving on the surface as a retelling of a climactic struggle ,  some readers consider it a symbolic parallel to the defeat of Japan in World War II . Kawabata left many of his stories apparently unfinished ,  sometimes to the annoyance of readers and reviewers ,  but this goes hand to hand with his aesthetics of art for art's sake ,  leaving outside any sentimentalism ,  or morality ,  that an ending would give to any book .  This was done intentionally ,  as Kawabata felt that vignettes of incidents along the way were far more important than conclusions .  He equated his form of writing with the traditional poetry of Japan ,  the haiku .  Kawabata apparently committed suicide in 1972 by gassing himself ,  but a number of close associates and friends ,  including his widow ,  consider his death to have been accidental .  One thesis ,  as advanced by Donald Richie ,  was that he mistakenly unplugged the gas tap while preparing a bath .  Many theories have been advanced as to his potential reasons for killing himself ,  among them poor health (the discovery that he had Parkinson's disease) ,  a possible illicit love affair ,  or the shock caused by the suicide of his friend Yukio Mishima in 1970 .

*** "*page_ Yasunari_Kawabata" "*cat_ Suicides_by_gas" " Born into a well-established family in Osaka ,  Japan ,  Yasunari was orphaned by the time he was four ,  after which he lived with his grandparents .  He had an older sister who was taken in by an aunt ,  and whom he met only once thereafter ,  at the age of ten in July 1909 .  She died shortly after when he was 11 .  Kawabata's grandmother died when he was seven (September 1906) ,  and his grandfather when he was fifteen (May 1914) . Having lost all close paternal relatives ,  Yasunari moved in with his mother's family (the Kurodas) .  However ,  in January 1916 ,  he moved into a boarding house near the junior high school (comparable to a modern high school) to which he had formerly commuted by train .  Through many of Kawabata's works the sense of distance in his life is represented .  He often gives the impression that his characters have built up a wall around them that moves them into isolation .  In a 1934 published work Kawabata wrote :  """"I feel as though I have never held a woman's hand in a romantic senseAfter graduating from junior high school in March 1917 ,  Kawabata moved to Tokyo just before his 18th birthday .  He hoped to pass the exams of Dai-ichi Kōtō-gakkō (First Upper School) ,  which was under the direction of the Tokyo Imperial University .  He succeeded in the exam the same year and entered the Humanities Faculty as an English major in July 1920 .  A young Kawabata ,  by this time ,  was enamoured by the works of another Asian Nobel laureate ,  Rabindranath Tagore . Kawabata graduated in 1924 ,  by which time he had already caught the attention of Kikuchi Kan and other noted writers and editors through his submissions to Kikuchi's literary magazine ,  the Bungei Shunju . In addition to fictional writing ,  Kawabata also worked as a reporter ,  most notably for the Mainichi Shimbun .  Although he refused to participate in the militaristic fervor that accompanied World War II ,  he also demonstrated little interest in postwar political reforms .  Along with the death of all his family members while he was young ,  Kawabata suggested that the War was one of the greatest influences on his work ,  stating he would be able to write only elegies in postwar Japan .  Still ,  many commentators detect little thematic change between Kawabata's prewar and postwar writings . While still a university student ,  Kawabata re-established the Tokyo University literary magazine Shin-shichō (""""New Tide of Thought"""") ,  which had been defunct for more than four years .  There he published his first short story ,  """"Shokonsai ikkei"""" (""""A View from Yasukuni Festival"""") in 1921 .  During university ,  he changed faculties to Japanese literature and wrote a graduation thesis titled ,  """"A short history of Japanese novels"""" .  He graduated from university in March 1924 .   Kawabata started to achieve recognition for a number of his short stories shortly after he graduated ,  receiving acclaim for """"The Dancing Girl of Izu"""" in 1926 ,  a story about a melancholy student who ,  on a walking trip down Izu Peninsula ,  meets a young dancer ,  and returns to Tokyo in much improved spirits .  The work explores the dawning eroticism of young love but includes shades of melancholy and even bitterness ,  which offset what might have otherwise been an overly sweet story .  Most of his subsequent works explored similar themes . In the 1920s ,  Kawabata was living in the plebeian district of Asakusa ,  Tokyo .  During this period ,  Kawabata experimented with different styles of writing .  In Asakusa kurenaidan (The Scarlet Gang of Asakusa) ,  serialized from 1929 to 1930 ,  he explores the lives of the demimonde and others on the fringe of society ,  in a style echoing that of late Edo period literature .  On the other hand ,  his Suisho genso (Crystal Fantasy) is pure stream-of-consciousness writing .  He was even involved in writing the script for the experimental film A Page of Madness . In 1933 ,  Kawabata protested publicly against the arrest ,  torture and death of the young leftist writer Takiji Kobayashi in Tokyo by the Tokkō special political police . Kawabata relocated from Asakusa to Kamakura ,  Kanagawa Prefecture ,  in 1934 and ,  although he initially enjoyed a very active social life among the many other writers and literary people residing in that city during the war years and immediately thereafter ,  in his later years he became very reclusive . One of his most famous novels was Snow Country ,  started in 1934 and first published in installments from 1935 through 1937 .  Snow Country is a stark tale of a love affair between a Tokyo dilettante and a provincial geisha ,  which takes place in a remote hot-spring town somewhere in the mountainous regions of northern Japan .  It established Kawabata as one of Japan's foremost authors and became an instant classic ,  described by Edward G .  Seidensticker as """"perhaps Kawabata's masterpiece"""" . After the end of World War II ,  Kawabata's success continued with novels such as Thousand Cranes (a story of ill-fated love) ;  The Sound of the Mountain ;  The House of the Sleeping Beauties ;  Beauty and Sadness ;  and The Old Capital . His two most important post-war works are Sembazuru (Thousand Cranes) from 1949 to 1951 ,  and Yama no Oto (The Sound of the Mountain) ,  1949–1954 .  Sembazuru is centered on the tea ceremony and hopeless love .  The protagonist is attracted to the mistress of his dead father and ,  after her death ,  to her daughter ,  who flees from him .  The tea ceremony provides a beautiful background for ugly human affairs ,  but Kawabata's intent is rather to explore feelings about death .  The tea ceremony utensils are permanent and forever ,  whereas people are frail and fleeting .  These themes of implicit incest ,  impossible love and impending death are again explored in Yama no Oto ,  set in Kawabata's home town of Kamakura .  The protagonist ,  an aging man ,  has become disappointed with his children and no longer feels strong passion for his wife .  He is strongly attracted to someone forbidden – his daughter-in-law – and his thoughts for her are interspersed with memories of another forbidden love ,  for his dead sister-in-law . The book that he himself considered his finest work ,  The Master of Go (1951) ,  contrasts sharply with his other works .  It is a semi-fictional recounting of a major Go match in 1938 ,  on which Kawabata had actually reported for the Mainichi newspaper chain .  It was the last game of the master Shūsai's career and he lost to his younger challenger ,  only to die a little over a year later .  Although the novel is moving on the surface as a retelling of a climactic struggle ,  some readers consider it a symbolic parallel to the defeat of Japan in World War II . Kawabata left many of his stories apparently unfinished ,  sometimes to the annoyance of readers and reviewers ,  but this goes hand to hand with his aesthetics of art for art's sake ,  leaving outside any sentimentalism ,  or morality ,  that an ending would give to any book .  This was done intentionally ,  as Kawabata felt that vignettes of incidents along the way were far more important than conclusions .  He equated his form of writing with the traditional poetry of Japan ,  the haiku .  Kawabata apparently committed suicide in 1972 by gassing himself ,  but a number of close associates and friends ,  including his widow ,  consider his death to have been accidental .  One thesis ,  as advanced by Donald Richie ,  was that he mistakenly unplugged the gas tap while preparing a bath .  Many theories have been advanced as to his potential reasons for killing himself ,  among them poor health (the discovery that he had Parkinson's disease) ,  a possible illicit love affair ,  or the shock caused by the suicide of his friend Yukio Mishima in 1970 .

In 1945 ,  at age 17 ,  while riding in a carriage in Paris ,  Lefebvre was noticed by a commercial photographer .  Adopting the French name of a flower ,  """"Capucine"""" (nasturtium ,  Tropaeolum) ,  she became a fashion model ,  working for the fashion houses Givenchy and Christian Dior . Capucine met Audrey Hepburn while modeling for Givenchy in Paris .  They remained close friends for the rest of Capucine's life .   Capucine made her film debut in Jean Cocteau's The Eagle with Two Heads (1948) ,  in a small ,  unbilled role .  She also appeared in Jacques Becker's Rendezvous in July (1949) and Robert Dhéry's Crazy Show (1949) . She was in My Friend Sainfoin (1950) and Dhery's Bernard and the Lion (1951) . After a break of a few years ,  Capucine appeared in Mademoiselle from Paris (1955) and Frou-Frou (1955) . In 1957 ,  film producer Charles K .  Feldman spotted Capucine while she was modeling in New York City .  Feldman put her under contract at $150 a week .  He brought her to Hollywood to learn English and study acting under Gregory Ratoff . She signed a seven-year contract with Columbia Pictures in 1958 .  After unsuccessfully auditioning for the role of Feathers in Rio Bravo (1959) she landed her first English-speaking role in the film Song Without End (1960) ,  a biopic of Franz Liszt ,  where Capucine played Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein .  Producer William Goetz said ,  """"You can teach a girl to act ,  but nobody can teach her how to look like a princess .  You've got to start with a girl who looks like a princess . """"""""Every time I get in front of the camera ,  I think of it as an attractive man I am meeting for the first time"""" ,  she said in 1960 .  """"I find him demanding and aloof ,  so I must do all I can to interest him . """"She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award . Capucine followed this with North to Alaska (1960) ,  a comedy which had been set up with her in mind by Feldman at 20th Century Fox .  She played a French prostitute who becomes the love interest of John Wayne .  Directed by Henry Hathaway ,  it was successful at the box office . Capucine returned to Europe to co star in Le triomphe de Michel Strogoff (1961) with Curd Jürgens ,  a sequel to Michel Strogoff (1956) . Back in Hollywood ,  she had second billing in Walk on the Wild Side (1962) ,  produced by Feldman ,  in which she portrayed a redeemed hooker .  Co-star Laurence Harvey complained that Feldman cut his part to expand Capucine's role . She was then William Holden's love interest in The Lion (1962) .  During filming ,  Capucine began a romance with Holden ,  which led to the end of her romantic relationship with Feldman ;  however ,  the producer remained loyal professionally . Feldman announced he would put Capucine in Mary Magdalene but neither happened . She moved to Switzerland in 1962 . Blake Edwards cast Capucine in The Pink Panther ,  playing Inspector Clouseau's wife ,  who is having an affair with a jewel thief ,  played by David Niven .  It was a huge hit ,  and led to a number of sequels .  In 1964 ,  Capucine said the directors she had learned most from were Edwards and Henry Hathaway . Capucine was reunited with Holden in The 7th Dawn (1964) produced by Feldman ;  it was a box-office disappointment .  Another film she did for Feldman ,  the comedy What's New Pussycat? (1965) ,  which costarred Sellers and Peter O'Toole ,  was far more successful ;  it was filmed entirely in France . Capucine was one of several European stars in Sex Quartet (1966) for Columbia (originally The Queens) , Feldman died in May 1968 ,  and Capucine's career never regained its former momentum . Capucine had a support role in Fräulein Doktor (1968) and the lead in the Spanish thriller The Exquisite Cadaver (1969) .  She was in the supporting cast of Fellini Satyricon (1969) .  Fellini said """"she had a face to launch a thousand ships .  .  .  but she was born too late . """"In 1968 ,  she told an Italian magazine she wished she didn't always have to be elegant ,  that she longed to play a """"dishevelled woman"""" ,  but """"since the directors know I was a model ,  it is obvious that they can't see me as anything else . """"Dirk Bogarde suggested her for the role of Tadzio's mother in Death in Venice (1971) ,  but Luchino Visconti turned her down ,  saying ,  """"She has a horrible voice and too many teeth .  She looks like a horse ,  a beautiful horse ,  I know that ,  I was a trainer .  I know all about horses ,  but I don't want a horse . """"Capucine had a supporting role in the Western Red Sun (1971)She supported Jean-Paul Belmondo in Incorrigible (1975) and Richard Burton in Jackpot ,  which was ultimately abandoned . She appeared on television in Cinéma 16 ,  and La pêche miraculeuse (1976) ,  and had roles in The Con Artists (1976) ,  Per amore (1976) ,  Ecco noi per esempio (1977) ,  Nest of Vipers (1978) ,  From Hell to Victory (1979) ,  Atrocious Tales of Love and Death (1979) ,  Neapolitan Mystery (1979) ,  Arabian Adventure (1979) ,  Jaguar Lives! (1979) ,  and Martin Eden (1979) . Capucine was in episodes of Orient Express ,  and Hart to Hart . She went to Europe to make Les invités (1982) ,  Aphrodite (1982) ,  Trail of the Pink Panther (1982) ,  and Curse of the Pink Panther (1983) . Capucine can be seen in episodes of Série noire ,  Voglia di cantare ,  Murder ,  She Wrote ,  Honor Thy Father ,  Sins ,  Delirium (1987) ,  My First Forty Years (1987) ,  Gila and Rik (1987) ,  Una verità come un'altra (1989) ,  Quartier nègre (1989) ,  Blaues Blut (1990) and Il giudice istruttore .

*** "*page_ W._J._Cash" "*cat_ Suicides_in_Mexico" " Cash was born and grew up in the mill village of Gaffney ,  South Carolina .  He attended Wofford College and graduated from Wake Forest College (now Wake Forest University) in 1922 ,  also attending law school for a year there .  During his final two undergraduate years ,  he served first as managing editor and then editor of the college newspaper ,  the Old Gold & Black .  Cash left law school ,  declaring later that it """"required too much mendacity , """" and taught college and high school for two years ,  before turning permanently to journalism and writing as his profession . During the period 1926-28 ,  Cash undertook several newspaper jobs :  a year in Chicago writing for the now-defunct Chicago Evening Post ;  several months with The Charlotte News ,  during which he wrote a wistful ,  philosophical column titled """"The Moving Row"""" ;  and a four-month stint during the fall of 1928 as the chief editor of a small ,  semi-weekly newspaper in Shelby ,  North Carolina ,  during which Cash excoriated the Ku Klux Klan and the anti-Catholicism at work ,  especially in the South ,  against the candidacy of Al Smith for president against Herbert Hoover . During the period of primary writing on The Mind of the South (1929 through 1937) ,  Cash lived in Boiling Springs ,  North Carolina and Shelby ,  North Carolina .  When his contributions to The American Mercury ended after the passage of the Mercury's editorship from H .  L .  Mencken to Lawrence Spivak ,  Cash supported himself with freelance weekly book reviews to The Charlotte News from 1935 through 1939 ,  for each of which he received a meagre $3 .  These """"book reviews"""" often became fierce analytical diatribes penetrating the mindset of Nazism under Hitler and Fascism under Mussolini ,  while at other times exploring the South through Southern writers such as James Branch Cabell ,  Erskine Caldwell ,  Lillian Smith ,  Ellen Glasgow ,  Claude McKay ,  Thomas Wolfe ,  and William Faulkner .  During this period Cash also wrote occasional editorials for The News ,  focusing primarily on the danger of Hitler and Mussolini to worldwide democracy ,  a topic on which he regularly expounded beginning in 1935 ,  a topic which by the latter thirties would overtake his interest in the South and further delay completion of the book . The strength of the freelance book reviews earned Cash a job as Associate Editor of The Charlotte News from October ,  1937 through May ,  1941 ;  in this role ,  Cash wrote editorials on every conceivable topic ,  stressing the international situation .  The Charlotte News ,  which closed its doors in 1985 ,  was at the time a lively ,  progressive newspaper enjoying the largest circulation of any afternoon daily in the Carolinas and its broad readership expanded admiration for Cash's writing and extraordinary prescience on the developing war news out of Europe and the Pacific .  His writing was considered so eerily predictive of coming events in the war that fellow staff writers at The News nicknamed him """"Zarathustra . """"Cash was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing in 1941 for his work during 1940 on World War II for the newspaper . Frustrated with the duties at a small newspaper ,  Cash abruptly quit shortly after the 1928 election and began writing what would turn out to be eight articles for H . L .  Mencken's American Mercury between 1929 and 1935 ,  including the seminal piece """"The Mind of the South , """" published in October ,  1929 .  Cash's aggressive style owed a great deal to Mencken .  Blanche and Alfred Knopf ,  publishers of the Mercury ,  saw the piece ,  liked it ,  and asked Cash to write a book-length version .  Thus was born the famous book .   The text was delayed ,  much to the Knopfs' worry and frustration ,  for over a decade as Cash meticulously labored to perfect the work to its final conclusion in mid-1940 ,  receiving help along the way from the noted University of North Carolina sociologist ,  Howard Odum . On February 10 ,  1941 ,  The Mind of the South was published by Knopf .  The book ,  a socio-historical ,  intuitive exploration of Southern culture ,  received wide critical acclaim at the time and garnered for Cash praise from sources as diverse as the N . A . A . C . P .  ,  TIME ,  The New York Times ,  The Saturday Review of Literature and most Southern newspapers of note .  (One note of negative criticism came from the Agrarian group out of Nashville . ) TIME ,  for instance ,  stated ,  """"Anything written about the South henceforth must start where he leaves off . """"In March ,  1941 ,  largely on the strength of the critical success of the book ,  Cash was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to spend a year in Mexico writing a novel ,  to be on the progress of a Southern cotton mill family from the Old South into the modern era .  Cash had always considered himself to be superior at writing fiction to non-fiction ,  so stated in his October ,  1940 application to the Guggenheim Foundation ,  and embraced the opportunity for a year to try his hand at a novel with great eagerness .  Cash had made ,  first in 1932 ,  then in 1936 ,  two previous applications for Guggenheim grants :  the first to have been a study of Lafcadio Hearn ,  to have been titled """"Anatomy of a Romantic , """" using Hearn as an exemplar by which to study Southern romantics generally ;  the second to have been a study of the Nazi mindset by spending a year in Germany ,  a contrasting reprise of Cash's bicycle tour of pre-Nazi Europe during the summer of 1927 .

*** "*page_ W._J._Cash" "*cat_ Suicides_in_Mexico" " Cash was born and grew up in the mill village of Gaffney ,  South Carolina .  He attended Wofford College and graduated from Wake Forest College (now Wake Forest University) in 1922 ,  also attending law school for a year there .  During his final two undergraduate years ,  he served first as managing editor and then editor of the college newspaper ,  the Old Gold & Black .  Cash left law school ,  declaring later that it """"required too much mendacity , """" and taught college and high school for two years ,  before turning permanently to journalism and writing as his profession . During the period 1926-28 ,  Cash undertook several newspaper jobs :  a year in Chicago writing for the now-defunct Chicago Evening Post ;  several months with The Charlotte News ,  during which he wrote a wistful ,  philosophical column titled """"The Moving Row"""" ;  and a four-month stint during the fall of 1928 as the chief editor of a small ,  semi-weekly newspaper in Shelby ,  North Carolina ,  during which Cash excoriated the Ku Klux Klan and the anti-Catholicism at work ,  especially in the South ,  against the candidacy of Al Smith for president against Herbert Hoover . During the period of primary writing on The Mind of the South (1929 through 1937) ,  Cash lived in Boiling Springs ,  North Carolina and Shelby ,  North Carolina .  When his contributions to The American Mercury ended after the passage of the Mercury's editorship from H .  L .  Mencken to Lawrence Spivak ,  Cash supported himself with freelance weekly book reviews to The Charlotte News from 1935 through 1939 ,  for each of which he received a meagre $3 .  These """"book reviews"""" often became fierce analytical diatribes penetrating the mindset of Nazism under Hitler and Fascism under Mussolini ,  while at other times exploring the South through Southern writers such as James Branch Cabell ,  Erskine Caldwell ,  Lillian Smith ,  Ellen Glasgow ,  Claude McKay ,  Thomas Wolfe ,  and William Faulkner .  During this period Cash also wrote occasional editorials for The News ,  focusing primarily on the danger of Hitler and Mussolini to worldwide democracy ,  a topic on which he regularly expounded beginning in 1935 ,  a topic which by the latter thirties would overtake his interest in the South and further delay completion of the book . The strength of the freelance book reviews earned Cash a job as Associate Editor of The Charlotte News from October ,  1937 through May ,  1941 ;  in this role ,  Cash wrote editorials on every conceivable topic ,  stressing the international situation .  The Charlotte News ,  which closed its doors in 1985 ,  was at the time a lively ,  progressive newspaper enjoying the largest circulation of any afternoon daily in the Carolinas and its broad readership expanded admiration for Cash's writing and extraordinary prescience on the developing war news out of Europe and the Pacific .  His writing was considered so eerily predictive of coming events in the war that fellow staff writers at The News nicknamed him """"Zarathustra . """"Cash was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing in 1941 for his work during 1940 on World War II for the newspaper . Frustrated with the duties at a small newspaper ,  Cash abruptly quit shortly after the 1928 election and began writing what would turn out to be eight articles for H . L .  Mencken's American Mercury between 1929 and 1935 ,  including the seminal piece """"The Mind of the South , """" published in October ,  1929 .  Cash's aggressive style owed a great deal to Mencken .  Blanche and Alfred Knopf ,  publishers of the Mercury ,  saw the piece ,  liked it ,  and asked Cash to write a book-length version .  Thus was born the famous book .   The text was delayed ,  much to the Knopfs' worry and frustration ,  for over a decade as Cash meticulously labored to perfect the work to its final conclusion in mid-1940 ,  receiving help along the way from the noted University of North Carolina sociologist ,  Howard Odum . On February 10 ,  1941 ,  The Mind of the South was published by Knopf .  The book ,  a socio-historical ,  intuitive exploration of Southern culture ,  received wide critical acclaim at the time and garnered for Cash praise from sources as diverse as the N . A . A . C . P .  ,  TIME ,  The New York Times ,  The Saturday Review of Literature and most Southern newspapers of note .  (One note of negative criticism came from the Agrarian group out of Nashville . ) TIME ,  for instance ,  stated ,  """"Anything written about the South henceforth must start where he leaves off . """"In March ,  1941 ,  largely on the strength of the critical success of the book ,  Cash was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to spend a year in Mexico writing a novel ,  to be on the progress of a Southern cotton mill family from the Old South into the modern era .  Cash had always considered himself to be superior at writing fiction to non-fiction ,  so stated in his October ,  1940 application to the Guggenheim Foundation ,  and embraced the opportunity for a year to try his hand at a novel with great eagerness .  Cash had made ,  first in 1932 ,  then in 1936 ,  two previous applications for Guggenheim grants :  the first to have been a study of Lafcadio Hearn ,  to have been titled """"Anatomy of a Romantic , """" using Hearn as an exemplar by which to study Southern romantics generally ;  the second to have been a study of the Nazi mindset by spending a year in Germany ,  a contrasting reprise of Cash's bicycle tour of pre-Nazi Europe during the summer of 1927 .  Likely because of Cash's lack of a published major work at the time ,  both applications were rejected .  The third and successful application was sponsored by the Knopfs and by Raleigh News & Observer Editor and Guggenheim recipient ,  Jonathan W .  Daniels ,  who had befriended Cash in 1938 .

*** "*page_ Cato_the_Younger" "*cat_ Suicides_in_Tunisia" " Cato was born in 95 BC ,  the son of Marcus Porcius Cato and his wife ,  Livia .  His parents died when he was young ,  and he was cared for by his maternal uncle ,  Marcus Livius Drusus ,  who also looked after Cato's sister Porcia ,  half-brother Gnaeus Servilius Caepio ,  and two half-sisters Servilia Major ,  and Servilia Minor .  Cato was four when his uncle was assassinated in 91 BC ,  an event which helped to spark the Social War . Cato's stubbornness began in his early years .  Sarpedon ,  his teacher ,  reports a very obedient and questioning child ,  although slow in being persuaded of things .  A story told by Plutarch tells of Quintus Poppaedius Silo ,  leader of the Marsi and involved in controversial business in the Roman Forum ,  who made a visit to his friend Marcus Livius and met the children of the house .  In a playful mood ,  he asked the children's support for his cause .  All of them nodded and smiled except Cato ,  who stared at the guest suspiciously .  Silo demanded an answer from him and ,  seeing no response ,  took Cato and hung him by the feet out of the window .  Even then ,  Cato would not say anything . Plutarch recounts a few other stories as well .  One night ,  as some children were playing a game in a side room of a house during a social event ,  they were having a mock trial with judges and accusers as well as a defendant .  One of the children ,  supposedly a good-natured and pleasant child ,  was convicted by the mock accusers and was being carried out of the room when he cried out desperately for Cato .  Cato became very angry at the other children and ,  saying nothing ,  grabbed the child away from the """"guards"""" and carried him away from the others . Plutarch also tells a story about Cato's peers' immense respect for him ,  even at a young age ,  during the Roman ritual military game ,  called """"Troy"""" ,  in which all aristocratic teenagers participated as a sort of """"coming of age"""" ceremony ,  involving a mock battle with wooden weapons performed on horseback .  When one of the adult organisers """"appointed two leaders for them ,  the boys accepted one of them for his mother's sake (he was a son of Metella ,  Sulla's wife) ,  but would not tolerate the other ,  who was a nephew of Pompey ,  named Sextus ,  and refused to rehearse under him or obey him .  When Sulla asked them whom they would have ,  they all cried 'Cato' ,  and Sextus himself gave way and yielded the honour to a confessed superior . """"Lucius Cornelius Sulla ,  the Roman dictator ,  liked to talk with Cato and his brother Caepio ,  and often requested the child's presence even when the boy openly defied his opinions and policies in public .  Sulla's daughter Cornelia Sulla was married to the boys' uncle Mamercus Aemilius Lepidus Livianus .  According to Plutarch ,  at one point during the height of the civil strife ,  as respected Roman nobles were being led to execution from Sulla's villa ,  Cato ,  aged about 14 ,  asked his tutor why no one had yet killed the dictator .  Sarpedon's answer was thus :  """"They fear him ,  my child ,  more than they hate him . """" Cato replied to this ,  """"Give me a sword ,  that I might free my country from slavery . """" After this ,  Sarpedon was careful not to leave the boy unattended around the capital ,  seeing how firm he was in his republican beliefs .    In Utica ,  Cato did not participate in the battle and ,  unwilling to live in a world led by Caesar and refusing even implicitly to grant Caesar the power to pardon him ,  he committed suicide in April 46BC .  According to Plutarch ,  Cato attempted to kill himself by stabbing himself with his own sword ,  but failed to do so due to an injured hand .  Plutarch wrote : Cato did not immediately die of the wound ;  but struggling ,  fell off the bed ,  and throwing down a little mathematical table that stood by ,  made such a noise that the servants ,  hearing it ,  cried out .  And immediately his son and all his friends came into the chamber ,  where ,  seeing him lie weltering in his own blood ,  great part of his bowels out of his body ,  but himself still alive and able to look at them ,  they all stood in horror .  The physician went to him ,  and would have put in his bowels ,  which were not pierced ,  and sewed up the wound ;  but Cato ,  recovering himself ,  and understanding the intention ,  thrust away the physician ,  plucked out his own bowels ,  and tearing open the wound ,  immediately expired . Plutarch wrote that ,  on hearing of his death in Utica ,  Caesar commented ,  """"Cato ,  I grudge you your death ,  as you would have grudged me the preservation of your life . """"Starting with Pliny the Elder ,  later writers sometimes refer to Cato the Younger as """"Cato Uticensis"""" (""""the Utican"""") .  In doing so they apply to him a type of cognomen that was normally awarded to generals who earned a triumph in a foreign war and brought a large territory under Roman influence (e . g .  ,  Scipio Africanus) .  Such names were honorific titles that the senate only granted for the most spectacular victories .  Reference to Cato as """"Uticensis"""" is presumably meant to glorify him by portraying his suicide at Utica as a great victory over Caesar's tyranny .  "

The physician went to him ,  and would have put in his bowels ,  which were not pierced ,  and sewed up the wound ;  but Cato ,  recovering himself ,  and understanding the intention ,  thrust away the physician ,  plucked out his own bowels ,  and tearing open the wound ,  immediately expired . Plutarch wrote that ,  on hearing of his death in Utica ,  Caesar commented ,  """"Cato ,  I grudge you your death ,  as you would have grudged me the preservation of your life . """"Starting with Pliny the Elder ,  later writers sometimes refer to Cato the Younger as """"Cato Uticensis"""" (""""the Utican"""") .  In doing so they apply to him a type of cognomen that was normally awarded to generals who earned a triumph in a foreign war and brought a large territory under Roman influence (e . g .  ,  Scipio Africanus) .  Such names were honorific titles that the senate only granted for the most spectacular victories .  Reference to Cato as """"Uticensis"""" is presumably meant to glorify him by portraying his suicide at Utica as a great victory over Caesar's tyranny .  "

Cheung's career in show business did not take off immediately .  His first film role was in Erotic Dream of the Red Chamber (紅樓春上春 ,  1978) ,  a softcore porn production that features his bare buttocks . Cheung signed with Capital Artists ,  a record label closely associated with the then-dominant television network TVB ,  in 1982 .  His first hit single ,  """"The Wind Blows On"""" (風繼續吹 ;  1982) ,  is a cover version of Momoe Yamaguchi's Japanese single """"The Other Side of Goodbye"""" (さよならの向こう側) .  The song was successful on charts ,  revitalising Cheung's image as a Cantopop singer . The year 1984 was when Cheung achieved mass stardom .  He released the hit single """"Monica"""" ,  a cover of the single by Japanese singer Kōji Kikkawa .  The song topped charts in Hong KongCheung's next albums with Capital were met with similar success .  For Your Heart Only (為你鍾情 ,  1985) yielded the hit single """"Wind Wind"""" (不羈的風) ,  which was among the 10 gold-certified songs honoured at both TVB's Jade Solid Gold and RTHK Top 10 awards .  The album also included songs Cheung recorded for TVB dramas ,  propelling his image as a romantic male lead . Cheung's career ascended to a new peak in 1987 , Cheung embarked on a 23-date tour at the Hong Kong Coliseum in mid-1988 ,  sponsored by Pepsi .  The tour was a sold-out and accumulated over 250 , 000 spectators . In addition to music ,  Cheung had his breakthrough movie role in the crime-action A Better Tomorrow (1986) ,  which would pave the way for his upcoming career in cinema .  in the aftermath of the handover of Hong Kong ,  but subsequently returned to show business in 1990 . He also won Best Actor at the 1994 Hong Kong Film Critics Society Awards in the comedy-drama Ashes of Time (1994) . The turning point in Cheung's acting career came in 1986 with his starring role in John Woo's (吳宇森) A Better Tomorrow , Although Cheung quit his career as a pop singer from 1989 to 1995 ,  he continued his music career as a songwriter .  He composed more than ten songs during that time .  In 1993 ,  he won Best Original Movie Song Award from Golden Horse Film Festival for the theme song Red Cheek ,  White Hair to the film The Bride with White Hair (as a film score composer) .  In 1995 ,  he wrote all three theme songs for the film The Phantom Lover .  As for songwriting ,  Cheung won four nominations for Best Original Movie Song Award at the Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards and two nominations for Best Original Film Song at the Hong Kong Film Awards .  In 1998 ,  he was a member of the jury at the 48th Berlin International Film Festival . In 1995 Cheung signed a contract with Rock Records ,  returning to music as a singer .  At the same year ,  he released his first post-""""retirement"""" album ,  Beloved .  Beloved achieved large market success with the award of IFPI Best Selling Album . In 2001 Cheung collaborated with William Chang ,  the art director of Wong Kar-Wai's Days of Being Wild (1991) ,  to make his music video Bewildered ,  about the intimacy between two gay men . Cheung's last concert tour was the Passion Tour ,  which took place in Hong Kong and overseas from 2000 to 2001 .  Cheung collaborated with fashion designer Jean Paul Gaultier ,  transforming Cheung """"From Angel to Devil"""" in four costumes :  the Angel ,  the Pretty Boy ,  the Latin Lover ,  and the Devil – denoting cross-cultural drag and focusing on Cheung's androgyny and bisexuality . While Cheung could sell well over 200 , 000 copies for an album in his 1980s heyday ,  his later albums struggled to match the same success ,  only 50 , 000 copies each . In 2011 ,  CCTV commented the """"Passion Tour"""" that from performance form ,  art concept ,  costume props and audience response ,  all represent the highest standard of Chinese concerts ,  no one has ever surpassed .

*** "*page_ Christine_Chubbuck" "*cat_ Filmed_suicides" " Christine Chubbuck was born in Hudson ,  Ohio ,  the daughter of Margaretha D .  """"Peg"""" (1921–1994) and George Fairbanks Chubbuck (1918–2015) .  She had two brothers ,  Greg and Tim .   Chubbuck worked for WVIZ in Cleveland between 1966 and 1967 ,  and attended a summer workshop in radio and television at New York University in 1967 .  That same year ,  she worked in Canton ,  Ohio ,  and ,  for three months ,  at WQED-TV in Pittsburgh ,  Pennsylvania ,  as an assistant producer for two local shows ,  Women's World and Keys to the City . Several years before her death ,  Chubbuck had moved into her family's summer cottage on Siesta Key ,  Florida .  The Washington Post later reported that she had painted the bedroom and canopied bed to look like that of a young teenager .  After Chubbuck's parents were divorced ,  her mother Peg and younger brother Greg came to live in the Florida home .  When Greg left ,  her elder brother Tim moved in .  Chubbuck had a close relationship with her family ,  describing her mother and Greg as her closest friends . WXLT-TV's owner ,  Bob Nelson ,  hired Chubbuck as a reporter ,  but later gave her a community affairs talk show ,  Suncoast Digest ,  which ran at 9 : 00am .  Production Manager Gordon J .  Acker described Chubbuck's new show to a local paper :  """"It will feature local people and local activities .  It will give attention ,  for instance ,  to the storefront organizations that are concerned with alcoholics ,  drug users ,  and other 'lost' segments of the community . """" Page five of the article showed a smiling Chubbuck posed with an ABC camera . Chubbuck took her position seriously ,  inviting local officials from Sarasota and Bradenton to discuss matters of interest to the growing beach community .  After her death ,  the Sarasota Herald-Tribune reported that Chubbuck had been nominated for a Forestry and Conservation Recognition Award by the Bradenton district office of the Florida Division of Forestry .  She was considered a """"strong contender"""" by district forester Mike Keel .  He had been scheduled to appear as a guest on Chubbuck's show the morning of her suicide ,  but cancelled because of the birth of his son .  Chubbuck spoke to her family at length about her struggles with depression and suicidal tendencies ,  though she did not inform them of her intent to commit suicide on live television .  She had attempted to overdose on drugs in 1970 and frequently made reference to that event .  Chubbuck had been seeing a psychiatrist up until several weeks before her death .  Her mother chose not to tell WXLT management about her daughter's suicidal tendencies because she feared Chubbuck would be fired . Chubbuck's focus on her lack of intimate relationships is generally considered to be the driving force for her depression .  Her mother later summarized that """"her suicide was simply because her personal life was not enough . """" She lamented to co-workers that her 30th birthday was approaching ,  and she was still a virgin who had never been on more than two dates with a man .  Her brother Greg later recalled she had gone out with a man several times before moving to Sarasota ,  but agreed that she had trouble connecting socially in the beach resort town .  He believed her constant self-deprecation for being """"dateless"""" contributed to her ongoing depression . According to a 1974 Sally Quinn article in The Washington Post ,  Chubbuck had an unrequited crush on co-worker George Peter Ryan .  She baked him a cake for his birthday and sought his romantic attention ,  only to find out he was already involved with sports reporter Andrea Kirby .  Kirby had been the co-worker closest to Chubbuck ,  but she was offered a new job in Baltimore ,  which had further depressed Chubbuck . Chubbuck had her right ovary removed in an operation the year before her suicide ,  and had been told that if she did not become pregnant within two to three years ,  it was unlikely she would ever be able to conceive . A week before her suicide ,  she told night news editor Rob Smith that she had bought a gun and joked about killing herself on air .  Smith later stated that he did not respond to what he thought was Chubbuck's """"sick"""" attempt at humor ,  and changed the subject . On the morning of July 15 ,  1974 ,  Chubbuck confused co-workers by claiming she had to read a newscast to open Suncoast Digest ,  something she had never done before .  That morning's guest waited across the studio while Chubbuck sat at the news anchor's desk . The station quickly ran a standard public service announcement and then a movie . After the shooting ,  news director Mike Simmons found the papers from which Chubbuck had been reading her newscast contained a complete script of her program ,  including not only the shooting ,  but also a third-person account to be read by whichever staff member took over the broadcast after the incident .  He said her script called for her condition to be listed as """"critical"""" . """"She had written something like 'TV 40 news personality Christine Chubbuck shot herself in a live broadcast this morning on a Channel 40 talk program .  She was rushed to Sarasota Memorial Hospital ,  where she remains in critical condition . '""""–Mike Simmons ,  TV-40 news director ,  quoted in The Dallas Morning NewsChubbuck was taken to Sarasota Memorial Hospital ,  where she was pronounced dead fourteen hours later .  Upon receiving the news ,  a WXLT staffer released the information to other stations using Chubbuck's script . Chubbuck's body was cremated .  The funeral ceremony was held on the beach ,  where her ashes were scattered into the Gulf of Mexico .  Approximately 120 people attended ,  including local officials who had appeared on her show . Chubbuck's show ,  Suncoast Digest ,  stayed on the air for several years with new hosts .  Simmons ,  the station director ,  said Chubbuck's suicide was unrelated to the station .  """"The crux of the situation was that she was a 29-year-old girl who wanted to be married and who wasn't , """" he said in 1977 . The broadcast of Chubbuck's death has not been seen since its airing ,  and numerous theories on what happened to the recording have been advanced .  One was that the station owner Robert Nelson kept it ,  and it was in the possession of his widow ,  Mollie .  It was confirmed in June 2016 that the recording of Chubbuck's death exists and had indeed been in Robert Nelson's possession ,  but was handed over to a """"very large law firm"""" for safekeeping by Mollie Nelson .  She has no plans to make it publicly available . In 2007 ,  Greg Chubbuck spoke publicly about his sister for the first time since 1974 in an E! television special .  "

She died in March 1871 at the O'Quinn home and was buried in Foster Cemetery on County Road 478 in Anderson County near Poynor . There is some confusion about Parker's actual birth and death dates .  Different sources place her birth from 1825 to 1827 in Coles ,  Clark ,  or Crawford counties of Illinois ,  and her death from 1864 to 1871 in Anderson County . In 1910 ,  Parker's son ,  Quanah ,  moved her body to Post Oak Mission Cemetery near Cache ,  Oklahoma .  "
*** "*page_ Dalida" "*cat_ Female_suicides" " Dalida was born Iolanda Cristina Gigliotti in Cairo ,  Kingdom of Egypt ,  on 17 January 1933 .  Her father Pietro Gigliotti (1904–1945) and mother Filomena Giuseppina (née d’Alba ;  1904–1971) were born in Serrastretta ,  Calabria in Italy . Unable to make a living in their hometown ,  the young couple moved to the Shubra district of Cairo the year they were married ,  where ,  between the births of Iolanda's older brother Orlando (1930–1992) and younger brother Bruno (1936) ,  the Gigliotti family became well established in the community .  In addition to earnings from Giuseppina's work ,  their social status benefited when Pietro became primo violino at Cairo's Khedivial Opera House ,  and the family bought a two-storey house . At 10 months old ,  Iolanda caught an eye infection and had to wear bandages for 40 days .  Her father would play lullabies on the violin to soothe her .  She underwent eye operations between the ages of three and five .  Having to wear glasses throughout elementary school ,  for which she was bullied ,  she later recalled :  """"I was   enough of it ,  I would rather see the world in a blur than wear glasses ,  so I threw them through the window . """"  Iolanda attended the Scuola Tecnica Commerciale Maria Ausiliatrice ,  an Italian Catholic school located in northern Shubra . In 1940 ,  Allied forces took her father and other Italian men from their quarter to the Fayed prison camp in the desert near Cairo .  When Pietro was released in 1944 ,  he returned home as a completely different person ,  so violent that Iolanda and other children in the neighbourhood were scared of him .  She later recalled ,  """"I hated him when he beat me ,  I hated him especially when he beat my mom and brothers .  I wanted him to die ,  and he did . """" Iolanda was twelve when Pietro died of a brain abscess in 1945 .  That trauma influenced her search for a male partner the rest of her life . In her teen years ,  Iolanda developed an interest in acting due to her uncle's job as a projectionist for a local cinema ,  and often participated in school performances at the end of the semester ,  becoming popular in the neighborhood .  She graduated in 1951 ,  but eventually started working as a copy typist in a pharmaceutical company in the same year .  While required to work to financially help her family ,  Iolanda still had acting ambitions as she continued searching for an opportunity for a breakthrough . Shortly thereafter ,  her best friend Miranda introduced her to Miss Ondine ,  a minor Cairo beauty pageant which she joined under two conditions :  to be the minor oneAs the election was attended by three film directors ,  the victory opened her the doors of the Egyptian cinema ;  Marco de Gastyne cast her in The Mask of Tutankhamun (1954) and Niazi Mostafa for leading role in A Glass and a Cigarette (1954) , On 25 December 1954 ,  Dalila left Egypt for Paris . Dalila's difficulty in finding acting work throughout 1955 ,  led her to try singing .  Vidal introduced her to Roland Berger ,  a friend and professor who agreed to give her singing lessons seven days per week at a low price .  He was strict and used to yell ,  with Dalila responding even more loudly . On 9 April 1956 ,  Dalida participated in the singing contest Les Numéros 1 de demain ,  performing Etrangère au Paradis .  Prior to the competition ,  Eddie Barclay ,  owner of the largest producing house in France ,  Barclay ,  and Lucien Morisse ,  artistic director of the newly established radio station Europe n°1 ,  met in Bar Romain (now Petit Olympia) and discussed what to do that evening .  Barclay wanted to watch a film ,  whereas Morisse wanted to attend the competition ,  which was being held at Olympia ,  then the largest venue in Paris .  They settled their disagreement by playing 421 ,  a dice game ,  which Morisse won .   After the performance in Les Numéros 1 de demain ,  Lucien handed Dalida his card to meet in his office as soon as possible ,  which she accepted without hesitation .  A few days later ,  on the second floor of the building at 26 rue François ler ,  she performed Barco Negro ,  a recent hit by Amália Rodrigues ,  humming the a cappella verses and tapping the fingertips on a corner of Morisse's desk .  Visibly satisfied ,  his interlocutor demanded more work on mini-flaws ,  for a new audition in front of Eddie Barclay in person .  While Morisse was responsible for radio promotion ,  Coquatrix had developed a strategy to grab the headlines .  He planned to promote her through a series of concerts ,  including two concerts at the Olympia ,  two weeks in Bobino ,  and a tour of the provinces . Her first song """"Madona"""" was recorded in June and was first released in August on EP with three other songs .  """"Madona"""" was played on 28 August 1956 on Radio Europe n°1 ,  which was Dalida's first radio appearance . Bambino was released in early December only as a promo single ,  but quickly receiving more public interest than all of her previous recordings ,  Morisse started to heavily promote it and it was placed as title song to Dalida's debut album Son nom est Dalida that was issued by the end of same month . On the night of 27 February 1957 ,  Dalida held her first concert at the Olympia ,  as the opening act for Charles Aznavour ,  and was widely applauded . Dalida's experimenting with exotica resulted with """"Gondolier"""" ,  released over Christmas in 1957 .  For the exotica song with accentuated vocals ,  Dalida delivered a TV appearance where ,  while sailing the imaginary gondola ,  her dress' shoulder strap fell down .  Then Dalida also started to perform more frequently in France ,  Belgium and Luxembourg . By the end of April 1958 ,  a radio programmer heard Dalida recording """"Dans le bleu du ciel bleu"""" in Barclay's Hoche studios in Paris .  Immediately asking for a copy of the tape and passing it on the antenna ,  the radio station was flocked with phone calls of people asking for the number of the disc and when would it be available . In late 1958 ,  Dalida returned to film for her first on-screen role in four years ,  playing supporting role of singer-spy in the mystery film Rapt au deuxième bureau .  A few months later ,  she appeared alongside Eddie Barclay in Brigade des mœurs ,  both starring as themselves .  These two B movies were also used for promotion of her three songs """"Inconnue mon amour"""" ,  """"L'amour chante"""" ,  and """"Aime-moi"""" ,  and were released in September 1958 and March 1959 ,  respectively . On 9 October ,  she again performed at Bobino ,  this time for three weeks as the headline performer ,  where she promoted her latest releases """"Du moment qu'on s'aime"""" ,  that peaked the charts same week ,  and """"Come prima"""" .  Topping charts in January 1959 ,  where it remained during most of winter ,  """"Come prima"""" proved to be an ultimate holiday hit of France and Belgium ,  as Dalida could be seen promoting it on a Christmas-themed television set . Dalida toured extensively in 1959 ,  playing sold-out dates in France ,  Egypt ,  Italy ,  and Germany . In late summer ,  Dalida was back in the studio to record her first major international hit .  In the period from 1958 to 1959 ,  """"Le jour ou la pluie viendra"""" was recorded in three languages ,  which led Dalida straight to the top three in six different European countries .  The German language version """"Am Tag als der Regen kam"""" topped German charts for ten weeks in September and October ,  earning her another gold disc .  It was the best-selling record of the year in Germany ,  and remained one of the most successful songs in history of the country . In the course of 1959 ,  Dalida collected five Top 10 hits in French charts ,  most notably """"Ciao ,  ciao Bambina"""" and """"Guitare et tambourin"""" ;  both earning gold discs .  In Italy ,  RAI awarded her with Oscar di popolarità and Lupo d'oro awards for the best-selling musical artist of the year in the country . Dalida debuted 1960 with """"T'aimer follement"""" ,  a chart topper in France and Belgium in February . The success was followed with her second win of Italian awards Oscar di Popolarità and a Lupo d'Oro for the best-selling musical artist of the year . Success was followed with """"Milord"""" ,  a number one in Austria ,  Germany and Italy ,  after which was named her first album issued solely for Italian public . In January 1961 ,  Dalida covered The Drifters' """"Save the last dance for me"""" as """"Garde Moi la Derniere Danse"""" that reached top two .  It remained her biggest French hit of the year as she busied herself with another year-long world tour which started in Teheran on 18 February ,  in front of Iranian royal family in their Sa'dabad Palace .  At the very end of the year ,  on 30 December Dalida completed her world tour in Olympia's Belgian equivalent Ancienne Belgique in Bruxelles . During 1961 ,  Dalida issued a set of new Italian songs on Canta in Italiano EP ,  and also scored several top ten hits internationally such as """"Nuits d'espagne"""" and """"Tu ne sais pas"""" .  In April she made """"Pépé"""" a number one hit both in Austria and Germany ,  and """"24 mille baisers"""" separately in Austria and France . After a short break Dalida was back on tour ,  this time starting in Canada where Tu peux le prendre had reached number one . From April to July Dalida toured across Italy and Vietnam .  In Saigon ,  her popularity led to traffic congestion when she performed ,  but the local authorities interrupted her show during a rendition of """"La Leçon de Twist"""" because the song was considered to be a political act . Although Dalida filmed her first scopitone in 1961 for the song """"Loin de moi"""" ,  starting a string of music videos followed by almost all yé-yé newcomers ,  her best critically and commercially received scopitone was recorded in September 1962 for song """"Le jour le plus long"""" ,  in which she paid tribute to Allies' disembarkation in Normandy on 6 June 1944 . Dalida fully spent 1963 delivering live appearance across the whole world and dedicating herself more to Canadian youth public ,  as in France the yé-yé experienced its greatest swing in this period .  Her world tour was a success ,  with sold out concerts in Europe from Portugal to Poland ,  Canada ,  Asia ,  Fort-de-France ,  Latin America and the Arabian countries .  In Algeria ,  she became the first artist to appear since the proclamation of independence . In January 1963 at Cortina d'Ampezzo ,  Dalida was awarded with the Oscar Mondiale del Successo dei Juke Box award for the most listened artist on the jukeboxes in Europe . The 1963 world tour was prolonged into 1964 only with several short breaks .  The tour's French leg started on 11 April 1964 ,  after which Dalida traveled 30 , 000 kilometers solely by car during its five-month run ,  with a public attendance over 200 , 000 .  """"The most iconic moment of tour"""" as said by her brother Orlando ,  was a concert at Draguignan on 14 August when """"Dalida appeared with blond hair for the first time ,  and shocked the crowd that that didn't recognized her at first glance"""" . As Dalida again recorded simultaneously to her concerts in course of 1964 ,  releases like """"Ce coin de terre"""" ,  """"Ne t'en fais pas pour ça"""" and """"Chaque instant de"""" were poorly promoted through TV ,  eventually entering only top twenty .  """"Là il a dit"""" peaked at number six in Canada earlier in the year ,  but finishing the tour in November ,  Dalida came back to the studio to record """"Amore scusami"""" ,  the orchestral pop sentimental ballad which was a completely new genre to her repertoire .  The song was rushed into release and swiftly became hit at the end of the year ,  earning Dalida another gold disc ,  the first in two years since """"Le jour le plus long"""" . Refusing to perform at Sanremo Music Festival ,  Dalida instead released EP Sanremo 65 that included her latest Italian top ten hit """"Ascoltami"""" .  Delivering new performances at Bobino and Tete de l'Art in following months ,  she was in top ten in France and Belgium with a cover of Rita Pavone's """"Viva la pappa"""" that gained Dalida huge interest among children's public . In June 1965 ,  Dalida recorded """"La Danse de Zorba"""" ,  a song from 1964 comedy movie Zorba the Greek ,  which became her biggest international success since """"24 mille baisers"""" in early 1961 .  The song once again brought Dalida to seven international charts ,  entering the top three in six and topping in two countries . During summer ,  Dalida performed in Morocco and Algeria ,  played supportive role in Italian comedy movie Menage all'italiana ,  alongside Ugo Tognazzi and then debutante Romina Power ,  and released one of her first records in single format Wenn die Soldaten . In October ,  the song """"Il silenzio"""" came out on the fourth EP of the year .  It was also a chart-topping hit in Europe ,  Canada and Latin America ,  reaching number one in France and Italy ,  where it was the best selling record of the year beating """"La Danse de Zorba"""" and receiving a gold disc .  The success of """"Il silenzo"""" concluded the most successful year in Dalida's career up to that date and produced the album of the same name ,  which collated that year's releases . 1966 was marked by an extensive year-long world tour that started on 13 February in Paris ,  and ended on 31 December in Toulouse .  With more than 150 dates ,  Dalida toured Canada ,  Latin America ,  Arab states and across Europe . With Mama in January 1967 ,  Dalida had success in France and Turkey ,  and was back on top of Italian charts later the same year . Returning to television on 8 June ,  on the verge of tears she made her first TV appearance after four months interpreting """"Les grilles de ma maison"""" ,  a cover of Tom Jones' """"Green ,  Green Grass of Home"""" . On the night of 5 October ,  Dalida premiered her third Olympia concert residency which ran for a month .  Presenting new songs like """"J'ai décidé de vivre"""" ,  """"Entrez sans frapper"""" and """"Loin dans le temps"""" ,  Dalida made a turnaround in her career orientating her repertoire towards more profound lyrics . After competing for four months at Canzonissima ,  then the most popular TV show in Italy ,  in January 1968 Dalida won with """"Dan dan dan"""" that reached number two in Italy . """"Si j'avais des millions"""" and """"La bambola"""" were minor hits of early 1968 ,  but in September Dalida came back to huge success in France with song """"Le temps des fleurs"""" .  It was an instant number one hit with a fair chart performance in several other countries ,  eventually being recorded in two more languages . On 5 December 1968 ,  in Paris city hall Hôtel de Ville ,  Dalida received the Medal of the president of the Republic from hands of General de Gaulle who summarized the """"success ,  kindness and modesty of this woman"""" saying :  """"By giving you this medal ,  I wanted to honor a quality ,  a great lady of France . """" In France ,  she remains the only person from show-business to receive such distinction .  During same event ,  Dalida became a Parisian citizen of honor ,  receiving the Medal of the city of Paris by the Council of Paris ,  and was also named the Godmother of Montmartre pulbots ,  the old name for poor children of the quartier where she lived . Spending 1969 on tour and private travelings to India ,  Dalida released several less successful recordings like """"Zoum zoum zoum"""" ,  """"L'an 2005"""" and """"Les violons de mon pays"""" ,  all poorly promoted on TV and radio attracting some success in Turkey and France .  """"Oh lady Mary"""" was released in autumn and remained her last Italian hit . Dalida and her brother Orlando were already planning for some time to form their own record house as a vehicle to release and to control her musical output .  Dalida's last record released under Barclay label was Concerto pour une voix ,  an EP released on 15 April 1970 . In October 1971 ,  Dalida intended to book herself at Olympia for her big Parisian comeback after four years .  Bruno Coquatrix did not believe in her change of style and refused to produce the show so Dalida rented and paid the venue by herself . Through 1971 and 1972 Dalida held a series of successful worldwide concerts in Asia ,  Canada ,  Europe ,  Lebanon and Latin America .  She continued to choose her new songs only for their poetic value ,  but still paid less attention to their commercial promotion ,  again traveling to Asia to develop a better understanding of herself . In the late 1972 ,  Dalida recorded duet """"Paroles .  .  .  paroles .  .  . """" with her longtime friend Alain Delon who she picked on her own .  Lyrics tell a story of a man offering a woman """"caramels ,  bonbons et chocolat"""" and repeats """"que tu es belle"""" (how beautiful are you) ,  to what she answers with """"paroles ,  paroles"""" (words ,  words) indicating that his words are nothing but hollow . In late July ,  Dalida released another song that went to become her signature track :  """"Je suis malade"""" (""""I am sick"""") .  The writer of the song Serge Lama recorded and released it earlier that year ,  but it did not receive any attention until it was spotted by Dalida who later mentioned :  """"when I saw it on television for the first time ,  I cried and I knew I have to record it"""" .  Dalida's intention to popularize Lama rather than getting a profit from song made her issue it as a B-side to single """"Vado via"""" . By the end of 1973 ,  Dalida released the promotional single A-side Il venait d'avoir 18 ans with B side Non ce n'est pas pour moi .  In that same time ,  she released the album Julien that gathers most of her 1973 songs .  The song Il venait d'avoir 18 ans quickly started gaining success and it was again released in the beginning of 1974 but as B-side to single A-side Gigi l'amoroso .  Il venait d'avoir 18 ans peaked number 3 in Quebec ,  and number 59 in Italy .  The first performance of both songs was during her concerts in Olympia 1974 .  The whole four weeks were sold out and a triumph for the singer and was followed again with a live album Olympia75 . In February 1975 ,  French music critics awarded the singer with the Prix de l'Académie du Disque Français .  Touring from 1974 to 1975 would follow this period of unprecedented sales . At the end of 1975 ,  Dalida released a new album that gathered some songs from singles released in 1974 and '75 plus some new material .  Most of the songs were from the same genre except for the disco-genre song """"J'attendrai"""" .  This song ,  released as a single in January 1976 ,  reached number 1 on the French charts and was both first disco hit in France and disco hit in French language .  Achieving that ,  Dalida holds the title of the inventor of French disco .  Around the same time ,  the popularity of the variety show was increasing in France and Dalida started making television appearances on a weekly basis there and across Europe . Following her disco success ,  in mid-1976 she released a new album with completely new songs ,  most of them disco .  The most notable one was Besame mucho (number 7 in France and number 10 in Turkey) .  1977 was a successful year for Dalida both in her private and professional life .  She released three albums .  One of them was live Olympia77 ,  released following her again four-week triumph at Olympia in 1977 .  The other two were albums with completely new songs .  Salma Ya Salama became the first Raï hit in the world .  Originally sung in Arabic ,  the song was translated into French ,  Italian ,  and German .  Part of the lyrics are based on an old Egyptian folk song about homesickness and celebrating the Egyptian nation . Dalida continued touring the world ,  including the USA ,  for the second time since the 1950s ,  by playing two nights in New York's Carnegie Hall in November 1978 .  The New York Times review of the Carnegie Hall concert praised Dalida's performance and noted its intimacy and intensity after she began to converse midway through it ,  revealing her personality .  Most of the audience were French citizens .  The concerts were almost sold out ,  but nevertheless ,  it was another triumph for her .  Due to the concert ,  she was offered for the second time a contract to perform in the USA ,  but she refused it again .  In February ,  during her 1977 Canada tour ,  an obsessed fan tried to kidnap her by using a hammer but did not succeed . Other hit performances of Dalida include """"The Lambeth Walk"""" ,  sung in English and French .  The song """"Je suis malade"""" ,  written and originally performed by Serge Lama was made into a success by Dalida during 1977 although she released it in 1973 .  In 1979 ,  Dalida recorded her biggest disco hit ,  """"Monday ,  Tuesday .  .  .  Laissez-moi danser"""" (Monday Tuesday  .  .  .  let me dance) .  The song was a smash hit ,  peaking at number 1 on the French charts . In 1979 ,  Dalida met Lester Wilson .  Agreeing to work together he became her choreographer for the upcoming spectacle in the Palais des Sports ,  booked for January 1980 .  In total ,  Dalida performed for three hours per day for fifteen days with ten costume changes and twelve dancers in front of an audience of around 90 , 000 people .  Palais des Sports of Paris was the largest playing venue in Paris and one of the biggest in France ,  there was much the same triumph as in Olympia . Following the spectacle ,  Dalida released the double live album Le spectacle du Palais des Sports 1980 and organized a new European tour and a small World tour .  She toured in the whole Western and Eastern Europe except Yugoslavia and the USSR .  Also ,  she held concerts in Brazil ,  USA and Canada .  When she came back ,  she organized a tour across the whole of France delivering more than 20 sold-out concerts monthly across the French towns and cities .  In 1980 ,  problems in her private life appeared again and were reflected in the song """"À ma manière"""" . Very quickly Dalida left disco and started singing slower ,  moody ,  deep-minded songs with typical 1980s instruments .  It was all caused again by escalating problems in her private life (break up with St .  Germain in 1981) .  That same year ,  she started to sing more often her 1973 song """"Je suis malade"""" (""""I am sick"""") .  Her performances of that song during that year and later on ,  are today one of her most remembered performances .  The song has also become her signature track . From March to April 1981 ,  she gave a month of sold-out concerts at the Olympia in Paris ,  emulating her successful 1980 tour .  It became her last Olympia concert because the following year the Olympia went bankrupt until 1989 .  On the night of her inaugural performance ,  she became the first singer to be awarded a diamond disc ,  in recognition of her record sales which had reached 45 million .  Instead of disco ,  Dalida started to record dance songs ,  which had soon replaced disco in French clubs .  At the end of 1981 ,  she starred in a New Year TV spectacle called Special Dalida .  She co-hosted and sang her songs . At the beginning of 1982 ,  she had many TV appearances singing still unreleased songs ,  followed by the release of a new dance album ,  Special Dalida .  The most remembered songs of the album are the dance songs """"Jouez bouzouki"""" ,  """"Danza"""" and the moody """"Nostalgie"""" .  Dalida launched a new world tour in 1982 and spent most of 1982 to 1984 playing sold-out concerts from Rio de Janeiro across Europe to Asia .  She made a lot of TV appearances in the 1980s almost every second week .  In the summer of 1982 ,  during the FIFA World Cup ,  like many other singers ,  Dalida released a song for the French team ,  """"La chanson du Mundial"""" (#17 in France) . In the first part of 1983 ,  she released several songs ,  the most notable being """"Mourir sur scène"""" .  The dance-pop song has very profound lyrics and has remained a big hit ,  one of the signature tracks by Dalida .  Most of her songs of 1983 were gathered on her album released in mid-1983 ,  Les p'tits mots ,  which also featured such singles as """"Lucas"""" and """"Bravo"""" . By the beginning of 1984 ,  her personal difficulties escalated again ;  she could not dedicate as much time to her career as she would have wanted .  However ,  she recorded a new collection of mainly dance songs including """"Soleil"""" and """"Kalimba de Luna"""" .  In mid-1984 ,  she recorded the album Dali ,  a collection of all her songs released that year .  To promote the album ,  a television special was later released on VHS named Dalida Idéale ;  it was filmed in 1984 ,  and directed by the then highly rated Jean-Christophe Averty .  It includes Dalida singing in seven languages and dancing her way through a huge number of her earlier hits with the best video effects available at the time and wearing more than 40 outfits from the best French and international fashion designers ,  maintaining her """"Glamour"""" and """"DIVA"""" trademarks gained during the disco era in the late seventies . Dalida's eye problems returned .  She underwent two major eye operations in 1985 and put her career on hold as the stage lights started to become difficult for her to endure .  She released Reviens-moi ,  a cover of George Michael's """"Last Christmas"""" .  During early 1985 ,  she occasionally did live performances ,  as well as many TV appearances .  When her eyes recovered in mid-1985 ,  she accepted the role of a young grandmother in the Youssef Chahine film The Sixth Day .  As she always wanted to become an actress ,  she temporarily disregarded her singing career and fully devoted herself to the movie .  She returned to France to promote the movie in late 1985 . In 1986 ,  she released Le Visage de l'amour with more new recordings and some singles from the album ,  which would become her last ever album .  Le temps d'aimer and Le Vénitien de Levallois were songs that failed to hit the charts upon their release .  She did promote the album but not as well as she used to do previously ,  due to issues in her private life which had never been worse since 1967 .  Dalida ,  therefore ,  spent more and more time in her house alone or going out with friends in an attempt to amuse herself ,  again neglecting her career .  Dalida ceased to create new material in the recording studio ,  instead devoting herself to perform concerts .  Once again organising a lot of concerts on a monthly basis and singing her previously-known hits ,  Dalida was then known for the amazing """"show"""" performances ,  wearing her wardrobe from 1980 to 1982 .  She sang glamorous disco-dance songs from same period such as Je suis toutes les femmes ,  Gigi in paradisco ,  Il faut danser reggae ,  Monday ,  Tuesday .  .  .  ,  Comme disait la Mistinguett . By the beginning of 1987 ,  Dalida was entering into severe depression while trying to overcome it .  Although no new songs had been recorded ,  she toured internationally from Los Angeles to the Middle East .  Being part of the music spotlight in 1978 ,  many of her songs appeared daily on TV ,  as well as many notable TV appearances on talk shows from 1986 to 1987 .  Her last live TV appearance was hosting the Nuit des César on 7 March 1987 .  Her last live performance took place in Antalya ,  Turkey from 27 to 29 April 1987 ,  just before her suicide .  Her performance was not recorded by the national television of Turkey which was the only TV channel in the country .   "

*** "*page_ Bella_Darvi" "*cat_ Suicides_in_Monaco" " Darvi was born Bajla Węgier to Jewish parents Chajm Węgier ,  a baker ,  and his wife ,  Chaja (née Zygelbaum) .  She had three brothers ,  Robert ,  Jacques ,  and Jean-Isidore ,  and a sister ,  Sura .  When the Germans invaded France during World War Two ,  Darvi's mother fled to southern France with her sister and two brothers .  Darvi decided to stay in Paris for her education along with her brother Robert .  Both were eventually jailed by the Vichy government due to their Polish background .  She was fifteen years old .  Robert died in a concentration camp . Darvi's mother secured her release after three years ,  in 1943 .  She went to stay with her mother near Toulouse .  """"We were always under threat on account of us being Polish , """" she said . Her elder sister was a model and she did some modelling . She married a businessman ,  Alban Cavalcade ,  on October 7 ,  1950 and traveled with him to Monaco . While on the French Riviera she became associated with Virginia and Darryl Zanuck . She changed her name to Bella Darvi ,  Darvi being a combination of the first names of Zanuck and his wife ,  Virginia .

*** "*page_ Gilles_Deleuze" "*cat_ Suicides_in_France" " Deleuze was born into a middle-class family in Paris and lived there for most of his life .  His initial schooling was undertaken during World War II ,  during which time he attended the Lycée Carnot .  He also spent a year in khâgne at the Lycée Henri IV .  During the Nazi occupation of France ,  Deleuze's older brother ,  Georges ,  was arrested for his participation in the French Resistance ,  and died while in transit to a concentration camp .  In 1944 ,  Deleuze went to study at the Sorbonne .  His teachers there included several noted specialists in the history of philosophy ,  such as Georges Canguilhem ,  Jean Hyppolite ,  Ferdinand Alquié ,  and Maurice de Gandillac .  Deleuze's lifelong interest in the canonical figures of modern philosophy owed much to these teachers . Deleuze passed the agrégation in philosophy in 1948 ,  and taught at various lycées (Amiens ,  Orléans ,  Louis le Grand) until 1957 ,  when he took up a position at the University of Paris .  In 1953 ,  he published his first monograph ,  Empiricism and Subjectivity ,  on David Hume .  This monograph was based on his 1947 DES (diplôme d'études supérieures  From 1960 to 1964 ,  he held a position at the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique .  During this time he published the seminal Nietzsche and Philosophy (1962) and befriended Michel Foucault .  From 1964 to 1969 ,  he was a professor at the University of Lyon .  In 1968 ,  Deleuze defended his dissertations amid the ongoing May 68 demonstrations ,  and later published his two dissertations ,  Difference and Repetition (supervised by Gandillac) and Expressionism in Philosophy :  Spinoza (supervised by Alquié) . In 1969 ,  he was appointed to the University of Paris VIII at Vincennes/St .  Denis ,  an experimental school organized to implement educational reform .  This new university drew a number of well-known academics ,  including Foucault (who suggested Deleuze's hiring) and the psychoanalyst Félix Guattari .  Deleuze taught at Paris VIII until his retirement in 1987 . Deleuze's outlook to life appear sympathetic with the transcendental framework ,  Spinozan ethics and the monist experience .  Some of the important beliefs he held and was inspired by ,  include ,  his personally coined expression pluralism = monism ,  as well as the concepts of Being and Univocity .  His thoughts were shaped by the ideas and inclinations of Spinoza ,  for whom he had great admiration :  for Deleuze ,  Spinoza was the “prince” or even the “Christ” of philosophers . He married Denise Paul """"Fanny"""" Grandjouan in 1956 and he had two children .

*** "*page_ Nikki_Bacharach" "*cat_ Suicides_by_asphyxiation" " Dickinson ,  the second of four daughters ,  was born Angeline Brown (called """"Angie"""" by family and friends) on September 30 ,  1931 , In 1942 ,  when she was ten years old ,  the Brown family moved to Burbank ,  California ,  where Angie attended Bellarmine-Jefferson High School ,  graduating in 1947 at age fifteen .  The previous year ,  she had won the Sixth Annual Bill of Rights essay contest .  She then studied at Immaculate Heart College ,  Los Angeles ,  and at Glendale Community College ,  becoming a business graduate by 1954 .  Taking a cue from her publisher father ,  she had intended to be a writer .  While a student during 1950–52 ,  she worked as a secretary at Lockheed Air Terminal in Burbank (now Bob Hope Airport) and in a parts factory .  She became Angie Dickinson in 1952 when she married football player Gene Dickinson .   Dickinson came in second at a local preliminary for the Miss America contest ,  and that got the attention of a casting agent ,  who landed her a spot as one of six showgirls on The Jimmy Durante Show .  The exposure brought her to the attention of a television industry producer ,  who asked her to consider a career in acting .  She studied the craft and a few years later was approached by NBC to guest-star on a number of variety shows ,  including The Colgate Comedy Hour .  She soon met Frank Sinatra ,  who became a lifelong friend .  She was later cast as Sinatra's wife in the film Ocean's 11 (1960) . On New Year's Eve 1954 ,  Dickinson made her television acting debut in an episode of Death Valley Days .  This led to roles in such productions as Matinee Theatre (eight episodes) ,  Buffalo Bill ,  Jr .  ,  City Detective ,  It's a Great Life (two episodes) ,  Gray Ghost ,  General Electric Theater ,  Broken Arrow ,  The People's Choice (twice) ,  Meet McGraw (twice) ,  Northwest Passage ,  Gunsmoke ,  The Virginian ,  Tombstone Territory ,  Cheyenne and The Restless Gun . In 1956 ,  Dickinson appeared in an episode of The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp .  The next year she took another small role in Richard Boone's series Have Gun – Will Travel in the episode """"A Matter of Ethics"""" . In 1958 ,  she was cast as Laura Meadows in the episode """"The Deserters"""" of an ABC/Warner Bros .  Western series ,  Colt  . 45 ,  with Wayde Preston .  That year ,  she also played the role of defendant Mrs .  Fargo in the Perry Mason episode """"The Case of the One-Eyed Witness"""" . Dickinson went on to create memorable characters in Mike Hammer ,  Wagon Train and Men into Space .  In 1965 ,  she had a recurring role as Carol Tredman on NBC's Dr .  Kildare .  She had a role as the duplicitous murder conspirator in a 1964 episode of The Fugitive series with David Janssen and fellow guest star Robert Duvall .  She was at her evil best as an unfaithful wife and bank robber in the 1958 """"Wild Blue Yonder"""" episode of Rod Cameron's syndicated television series State Trooper .  She starred in two Alfred Hitchcock Hour episodes ,  """"Captive Audience"""" with James Mason on October 18 ,  1962 ,  and """"Thanatos Palace Hotel"""" on February 1 ,  1965 . Dickinson's motion picture career began with a small ,  uncredited role in Lucky Me (1954) starring Doris Day ,  followed by The Return of Jack Slade (1955) ,  Man with the Gun (1955) and Hidden Guns (1956) .  She had her first starring role in Gun the Man Down (1956) with James Arness ,  followed by the Sam Fuller cult film China Gate (1957) ,  which depicted an early view of the Vietnam War . Rejecting the Marilyn Monroe/Jayne Mansfield style of platinum blonde sex-symbolism ,  because she felt it would narrow her acting options ,  Dickinson initially allowed studios to lighten her naturally brunette hair to only honey-blonde .  She appeared early in her career mainly in B-movies or Westerns ,  including Shoot-Out at Medicine Bend (1957) ,  in which she co-starred with James Garner .  In the crime drama Cry Terror! (1958) ,  Dickinson had a supporting role opposite James Mason and Rod Steiger as a femme fatale . Dickinson's big-screen breakthrough role came in Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo (1959) ,  in which she played a flirtatious gambler called """"Feathers"""" who becomes attracted to the town sheriff played by Dickinson's childhood idol John Wayne .  The film co-starred Dean Martin ,  Ricky Nelson and Walter Brennan .  When Hawks sold his personal contract with her to a major studio without her knowledge ,  she was unhappy .  Dickinson nonetheless became one of the more prominent leading ladies of the next decade ,  beginning with The Bramble Bush with Richard Burton .  She also took a supporting role in Ocean's 11 (1960) with friends Sinatra and Martin . These were followed by a political potboiler ,  A Fever in the Blood (1961) ;  a Belgian Congo-based melodrama ,  The Sins of Rachel Cade (1961) ,  in which she played a missionary nurse tempted by lust ;  a scheming woman in Rome Adventure (1962) ,  filmed in Italy ,  and the title role in Jean Negulesco's Jessica (1962) with Maurice Chevalier ,  in which she played a young midwife resented by the married women of the town ,  set in Sicily .  Angie also shared the screen with friend Gregory Peck as a military nurse in the dark comedy Captain Newman ,  M . D .  (1963) . For The Killers (1964) ,  originally intended to be the first made-for-television movie ,  but released to theatres due to its violent content ,  Dickinson played a femme fatale opposite future U . S .  President Ronald Reagan in his last movie role .  Directed by Don Siegel ,  it was a remake of the 1946 version based on a story by Ernest Hemingway and the only film Reagan made in which he was cast as a villain .

His father was a failed businessman .  Although a brilliant student ,  Pierre failed his final exam at the École Libre des Sciences Politiques .  Wounded three times ,  his experience as a soldier during World War I had a deep influence on him and marked him for the rest of his life . In 1917 ,  Drieu married Colette Jéramec ,  the sister of a Jewish friend .  They divorced in 1921 .  Sympathetic to Dada and to the Surrealists and the Communists ,  and a close friend of Louis Aragon in the 1920s ,  he was also interested in the royalist Action Française ,  but refused to adhere to any one of these political currents .  He wrote """"Mesure de la France"""" (""""Measure of France"""") in 1922 ,  which gave him some small notoriety ,  and edited several novels .  He later (beginning in the 1930s) embraced fascism and anti-semitism .

William Druitt was a justice of the peace ,  a governor of the local grammar school ,  and a regular worshipper at the local Anglican church ,  the Minster . Druitt was educated at Winchester College ,  where he won a scholarship at the age of 13 ,  and excelled at sports ,  especially cricket and fives . In his final year at Winchester ,  1875–76 ,  he was Prefect of Chapel ,  treasurer of the debating society ,  school fives champion ,  and opening bowler for the cricket team . At New College ,  he was popular with his peers ,  and was elected Steward of the Junior Common Room by them . Druitt gained a second class in Classical Moderations in 1878 and graduated with a third class Bachelor of Arts degree in Literae Humaniores (Classics) in 1880 .   On 17 May 1882 ,  two years after graduation ,  Druitt was admitted to the Inner Temple ,  one of the qualifying bodies for English barristers .  His father had promised him a legacy of £500 (equivalent to £51 , 000 today) , Druitt's father died suddenly from a heart attack in September 1885 ,  leaving an estate valued at £16 , 579 (equivalent to £1 , 804 , 000 today) . Druitt rented legal chambers at 9 King's Bench Walk in the Inner Temple . To supplement his income and help pay for his legal training ,  Druitt worked as an assistant schoolmaster at George Valentine's boarding school ,  9 Eliot Place ,  Blackheath ,  London ,  from 1880 .  On Friday 30 November 1888 ,  Druitt was dismissed from his post at the Blackheath boys' school .  The reason for his dismissal is unclear . On 31 December 1888 ,  his body was found floating in the River Thames ,  off Thornycroft's torpedo works ,  Chiswick ,  by a waterman named Henry Winslade . Some modern authors suggest that Druitt was dismissed because he was a homosexual or pederast and that may have driven him to suicide . As was usual in the district ,  the inquest was held at the Lamb Tap public house ,  Chiswick ,  by the coroner Dr Thomas Bramah Diplock ,  on 2 January 1889 . It is not known why Druitt committed suicide in Chiswick .  One suggested link is that one of his University friends ,  Thomas Seymour Tuke of the Tuke family ,  lived there .  Tuke was a psychiatric doctor with whom Druitt played cricket ,  and Druitt's mother was committed to Tuke's asylum in 1890 .  "

After VGIK Savinova entered the Gnessin State Musical College to study vocals .  Her rare voice (3 . 5 octave) was so impressive that she was offered to perform at the Bolshoi Theatre and pop scene upon graduation ,  yet she declined all offers ,  because she saw herself only as a cinema actress and """"just enjoyed singing on her own"""" .

She slapped Pyryev in the face ,  and after that he used his influence to ruin her career .  For many years she appeared only in supporting or episodic roles .  Nevertheless ,  she received the Best Acting Award at the 1955 Cannes Film Festival along with other actors of A Big Family .

*** "*page_ Jeffrey_Epstein" "*cat_ People_who_committed_suicide_in_prison_custody" " Epstein was born in 1953 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City .  His parents Pauline (née Stolofsky ,  1918–2004)Epstein attended local public schools ,  first Public School 188 and then Mark Twain Junior High School nearby .   Epstein started working in September 1974 as a physics and mathematics teacher for teens at the Dalton School on the Upper East Side of Manhattan . Epstein joined Bear Stearns in 1976 as a low-level junior assistant to a floor trader . In 1981 ,  he was asked to leave Bear Stearns for ,  according to his sworn testimony ,  being guilty of a """"reg d violation"""" . In August 1981 ,  Epstein founded his own consulting firm ,  Intercontinental Assets Group Inc .  (IAG) , Epstein also stated to some people at the time that he was an intelligence agent . During this period ,  one of Epstein's clients was the Saudi Arabian businessman Adnan Khashoggi ,  who was the middleman in transferring American weapons from Israel to Iran ,  as part of the Iran–Contra affair in the 1980s . Steven Hoffenberg hired Epstein in 1987 ,  as a consultant for Towers Financial Corporation (unaffiliated with the company of the same name founded in 1998 ,  and acquired by Old National Bancorp in 2014) , Hoffenberg and Epstein then refashioned themselves as corporate raiders using Towers Financial as their raiding vessel .  One of Epstein's first assignments for Hoffenberg was to implement what turned out to be an unsuccessful bid to take over Pan American World Airways in 1987 .  A similar unsuccessful bid in 1988 was made to take over Emery Air Freight Corp .  During this period ,  Hoffenberg and Epstein worked closely together and traveled everywhere on Hoffenberg's private jet . In 1993 ,  Towers Financial Corporation imploded as one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in American history ,  losing its investors over US$450million (equivalent to $806 , 185 , 000 in 2020) . In 1988 ,  while Epstein was still consulting for Hoffenberg ,  he founded his own financial management firm ,  J .  Epstein & Company . The only publicly known billionaire client of Epstein was Leslie Wexner ,  chairman and CEO of L Brands (formerly The Limited ,  Inc . ) and Victoria's Secret . By 1995 ,  Epstein was a director of the Wexner Foundation and Wexner Heritage Foundation .  He was also the president of Wexner's Property ,  which developed part of the town of New Albany outside Columbus ,  Ohio ,  where Wexner lived .  Epstein made millions in fees by managing Wexner's financial affairs .  Although never employed by L Brands ,  he corresponded frequently with the company executives .  Epstein often attended Victoria's Secret fashion shows ,  and hosted the models at his New York City home ,  as well as helping aspiring models get work with the company . In 1996 ,  Epstein changed the name of his firm to the Financial Trust CompanyIn 2003 ,  Epstein bid to acquire New York magazine . In 2004 ,  Epstein and Zuckerman committed up to US$25million to finance Radar ,  a celebrity and pop culture magazine founded by Maer Roshan .  Epstein and Zuckerman were equal partners in the venture .  Roshan ,  as its editor-in-chief ,  retained a small ownership stake .  It folded after three issues . Epstein was the president of the company Liquid Funding Ltd .  between 2000 and 2007 . Liquid Funding was initially 40percent owned by Bear Stearns .  Through the help of the credit rating agencies – Standard & Poor's ,  Fitch Ratings and Moody's Investors Service – the new bundled securities were able to be created for companies so that they got a gold-plated AAA rating .  The implosion of such complex securities ,  because of their inaccurate ratings ,  led to the collapse of Bear Stearns in March 2008 and set in motion the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the subsequent Great Recession .  If Liquid Funding was left holding large amounts of such securities as collateral ,  it could have lost large amounts of money . Between 2002 and 2005 ,  Epstein invested $80million in the D . B .  Zwirn Special Opportunities hedge fund . In August 2006 ,  Epstein ,  a month after the federal investigation of him began , On April 18 ,  2007 ,  an investor in the fund ,  who had $57million invested ,  discussed redeeming his investment . By the time that the Bear Stearns fund began to fail in May 2007 ,  Epstein had begun to negotiate a plea deal with the U . S .  Attorney's Office concerning imminent charges for sex with minors . In 2015 ,  the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that Epstein invested in the startup Reporty Homeland Security (rebranded as Carbyne in 2018) .  On July 23 ,  2019 ,  three weeks prior to his death ,  Epstein was found unconscious in his jail cell with injuries to his neck . When Epstein was placed in the special housing unit ,  the jail informed the Justice Department that he would have a cellmate ,  and that a guard would look into the cell every 30 minutes .  These procedures were not followed on the night of his death . Epstein was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York City at 6 : 30a . m .  EDT on August 10 ,  2019 . On August 11 ,  2019 ,  an autopsy was performed . On August 16 ,  2019 ,  Barbara Sampson ,  the New York City medical examiner ,  ruled Epstein's death a suicide by hanging . On August 18 ,  2019 ,  it was reported that Jeffrey Epstein had signed his last will and testament on August 8 ,  2019 ,  two weeks after being found injured in his cell and two days before his death . Following the autopsy ,  Epstein's body was claimed by his brother ,  Mark . Attorney General Barr ordered an investigation by the Department of Justice Inspector General in addition to the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ,  saying that he was """"appalled"""" by Epstein's death in federal custody . On August 14 ,  2019 ,  Manhattan federal court Judge Richard M .  Berman ,  who was overseeing Epstein's criminal case ,  wrote to the Metropolitan Correctional Center warden Lamine N'Diaye inquiring as to whether an investigation into the millionaire's apparent suicide would include a probe into his prior (July 23) injuries .  Judge Berman wrote that to his knowledge it has never been definitely explained what they concluded about the incident . The national president of the Council of Prison Locals C-33 ,  E .  O .  Young ,  stated that prisons """"can't ever stop anyone who is persistent on killing themselves"""" . President Serene Gregg ,  of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3148 ,  said MCC is functioning with fewer than 70 percent of the needed correctional officers ,  forcing many to work mandatory overtime and 60 to 70-hour workweeks . Epstein's attorneys asked Judge Berman to probe their client's death ,  alleging they could provide evidence that the incident resulting in his death was """"far more consistent with assault"""" than suicide . One week after having signed his final will ;  it had been reported that at least one camera in the hallway outside Epstein's cell had footage that was unusable ,  although other usable footage was recorded in the area . On November 19 ,  2019 ,  federal prosecutors in New York charged Metropolitan Correctional Center guards Michael Thomas and Tova Noel with creating false records ,  and with conspiracy ,  after video footage obtained by prosecutors revealed that Epstein had ,  against regulation ,  been in his cell unchecked for eight hours prior to being found dead . As part of a deferred prosecution agreement ,  on May 25 ,  both officers pleaded guilty to falsifying records and conspiracy to defraud the United States .  They were sentenced to six months supervisory release and will be required to perform 100 hours of community service .  "

*** "*page_ Eurydice_II_of_Macedon" "*cat_ Forced_suicides" " Eurydice's birth name appears to have been AdeaShe accompanied her mother on her daring expedition to Asia ;  and when Cynane was put to death by Alcetas ,  the discontent expressed by the troops ,  and the respect with which they looked on Eurydice as one of the surviving members of the royal house ,  induced the imperial regent ,  Perdiccas ,  not only to spare her life ,  but to give her in marriage to King Philip Arrhidaeus ,  Alexander the Great's half-brother and successor to the throne of Macedon ,  as had been Cynane's plan .   Sources hint that this was an unequal marriage ,  because the king was disabled mentally .   Furthermore ,  although Philip Arrhidaeus was king of Macedon ,  this did not make him the imperial successor to Alexander ;  Alexander had won his empire by law of conquest ,  and the Asian portion of the empire (more than nine-tenths of the whole) was not part of the people of Macedon . The sources are again silent as to Eurydice during the life of Perdiccas ;  but after his death ,  in 321 BC Eurydice bid for power :  she demanded that the new regents of Macedon ,  Peithon and Arrhidaeus ,  grant her a share of the regency .   Eurydice's ties to the Macedonian army ,  and her status as king's wife ,  helped her gain influence and succeeded briefly in becoming a sort of de facto regent .   She took an active part in the proceedings at the Treaty of Triparadisus in 321 BC . It was at this point ,  however ,  that a new adversary ,  Alexander the Great's general Antipater ,  returned to the king's court and laid claim to the vacant regency .   In an attempt to forestall this and retain command over the Macedonian army ,  Eurydice spoke in public to the assembled soldiery ,  who were restless due to Antipater's inability to pay them .  Eurydice's speech failed ;  the Macedonian army decided in favor of Antipater ,  and the general was appointed regent and guardian of the king . Eurydice ,  once again relatively powerless ,  accompanied her husband and Antipater to Macedon .  But the death of Antipater in 319 BC ,  the more feeble character of Polyperchon ,  who succeeded him as regent ,  and the failure of his enterprises in Greece ,  and above all ,  the favourable disposition he evinced towards Olympias ,  determined her again to take an active part :  she concluded an alliance with Cassander ,  and ,  as he was wholly occupied with the affairs of Greece ,  she herself assembled an army and took the field in person .  Polyperchon advanced against her from Epirus ,  accompanied by Aeacides ,  the king of that country ,  and Olympias ,  as well as by Roxana and her infant son .  But the presence of Olympias was alone sufficient to decide the contest :  the Macedonian troops refused to fight against the mother of Alexander the Great ,  and went over to her side .  Eurydice fled from the field of battle to Amphipolis ,  but was seized and made prisoner . She was at first confined ,  together with her husband ,  in a narrow dungeon ,  and scantily supplied with food ;  but soon Olympias ,  becoming alarmed at the compassion excited among the Macedonians ,  determined to get rid of her rival ,  and sent the young queen in her prison a sword ,  a rope ,  and a cup of hemlock ,  with orders to choose her mode of death .  The spirit of Eurydice remained unbroken to the last ;  she still breathed defiance to Olympias ,  and prayed that she might soon be requited with the like gifts ;  then ,  having paid as well as she could the last duties to her husband ,  she put an end to her own life by hanging ,  without giving way to a tear or word of lamentation .

He received little formal schooling and eventually apprenticed himself to a clockmaker .   During his apprenticeship ,  Fitch was not allowed to learn or even observe watchmaking (he later taught himself how to repair clocks and watches) . He married Lucy Roberts on December 29 ,  1767 .  Following his apprenticeship in Hartford ,  he opened an unsuccessful brass foundry in East Windsor ,  Connecticut ,  and then a brass and silversmith business in Trenton ,  New Jersey ,  which succeeded for eight years but was destroyed by British troops during the American Revolution . He served briefly during the Revolution ,  mostly as a gunsmith working for the New Jersey militia .   He left his unit after a dispute over a promotion ,  but continued his work repairing and refitting arms in Trenton .  In the fall of 1777 ,  Fitch provided beer and tobacco to the Continental Army in Philadelphia .  During the following winter and spring ,  he provided beer ,  rum and other supplies to troops at Valley Forge . In 1780 ,  Fitch began work as a surveyor in Kentucky ,  where he recorded a land claim of 1 , 600 acres (6 . 5km2) for himself .  In the spring of 1782 ,  while surveying in the Northwest Territory ,  he was captured by indigenous people and turned over to the British ,  who eventually released him .    A life of continual failure ,  frustration and litigation wore Fitch down .   He began drinking heavily once he returned to Bardstown in 1797 .   Fitch died of an overdose of opium pills ,  in what may have been suicide .   He died on July 2 ,  1798 ,  age 55 ,  and was buried in Bardstown .  "

*** "*page_ Barney_Bubbles" "*cat_ Artists_who_committed_suicide" " Fulcher was born in Tranmere Road ,  Whitton ,  Middlesex (now Greater London) ,  in July 1942 .  He attended Isleworth Grammar School .  In 1958 he embarked on a retail display course for a National Diploma in Design (NDD) at the art school of Twickenham College of Technology .  During his five years at the college Fulcher received a multi-disciplinary education that included training in cardboard design ,  display and packaging ,  skills that would be utilised later in his record sleeve work .   After leaving college in 1963 Fulcher worked as an assistant at the design company Michael Tucker + Associates in London . In May 1965 ,  Fulcher was recruited by The Conran Group as senior graphic designer alongside Stafford Cliff ,  Virginia Clive-Smith and John Muggeridge .  He produced a variety of commercial commissions for Conran ,  including the Norman-style archer logo for Strongbow cider and items for Conran's new homewares chain Habitat .  Fulcher also established an association with Justin de Blank ,  a director at Conran ,  which blossomed when de Blank left to launch his own upmarket provisions company and restaurant business in 1968 . Between 1965 and 1966 Fulcher organised happenings ,  parties and other events under the name A1 Good Guyz with two graduates of Twickenham Art College ,  David Wills and Roy Burge . In 1967 Fulcher became known as Barney Bubbles ,  though he did not change his name by deed poll for several more years .  The name came about when Fulcher was operating a light show that created a bubble effect by mixing oils and water on projection slides .  These lightshows were for groups including the Gun and Quintessence at underground venues including the Roundhouse ,  Jim Haynes's Drury Lane Arts Lab ,  the Electric Cinema and Middle Earth . With Wills ,  Bubbles undertook freelance design commissions ,  including a redesign of Motor Racing magazine and a recipe book for the English Egg Marketing Board .  With a team of contributors Bubbles and Wills art-directed Oz magazine issue 12 ,  dubbed The Tax Dodge Special and published in May 1968 . Early in 1969 ,  Bubbles took the lease on a three-storey building at 307 Portobello Road in Notting Hill Gate ,  West London .  He converted the ground-floor space into a graphic art studio ,  which he named Teenburger Designs .  With a business association established with two entrepreneurs ,  Edward Molton and Stephen Warwick ,  and with John Muggeridge from Conran serving briefly as an assistant ,  he set about working primarily for the music industry .  His first record sleeve design was for Quintessence's LP In Blissful Company (1969) .  The gatefold sleeve design uses illustrations by Gopala on the front and back ,  and contains a monochrome glued-in booklet inside . Teenburger also provided record sleeve designs for the bands Brinsley Schwarz and Red Dirt ,  as well as Vertigo artists such as Cressida ,  Gracious! and Dr Z ,  whose LP Three Parts to My Soul is particularly noted for its complex and colourful fold-out sleeve . Following the closure of Teenburger in 1970 as a result of the disappearance of Molton and Warwick ,  Bubbles worked as the designer of the underground newspaper Friends (later renamed Frendz) . While he was working at Friends ,  Bubbles formed an association with Hawkwind and became responsible for a run of their album sleeves ,  including In Search of Space ,  Doremi Fasol Latido and Space Ritual .  Bubbles engaged in many aspects of the group's visual identity ,  titling releases and designing posters ,  adverts ,  stage decoration and performance plans ,  some of which were adorned with mystical and mock-Teutonic insignia .  In 1972 Bubbles produced the triple LP package Glastonbury Fayre .  This comprised a six-panel fold-out card sleeve ,  two poster inserts ,  a booklet and a cut-out and build miniature pyramid ,  housed in a clear vinyl bag (with two sleeve variations and three label variations) . From 1973 onwards ,  Bubbles increasingly avoided credits for his artwork ,  typically working anonymously or occasionally adopting alternative pseudonyms .  During this period he designed album sleeves and additional material for such acts as the Sutherland Brothers ,  Kevin Coyne ,  Edgar Broughton Band ,  Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers ,  Quiver ,  the Kursaal Flyers and Michael Moorcock and the Deep Fix . In 1976 his design relationship with Hawkwind came to an end .  It was rekindled once ,  in 1978 ,  for the Hawklords spin-off ,  but otherwise continued only with design commissions for projects involving the band's saxophonist Nik Turner . Barney Bubbles joined Stiff Records as designer and art director early in 1977 .  With the label's co-founder Jake Riviera he generated a body of creative work that helped to secure Stiff's reputation as an exciting new independent label .  Bubbles created sleeves for bands including the Damned ,  Elvis Costello ,  Ian Dury and Wreckless Eric .  Often these were accompanied by quirky logos such as the face logo for Blockhead ,  advertisements and promotional items .  The marketing of Elvis Costello's My Aim Is True included advertisements in three UK music papers from which a poster of Costello could be constructed ,  and the first 1 , 000 pressings contained an insert headed Help Us Hype Elvis ,  which ,  if completed and returned to Stiff ,  ensured that a friend would receive a free copy . When Riviera left Stiff in late 1977 ,  Bubbles joined him at his new label Radar Records and later at Riviera's F-Beat Records .  At these labels ,  Bubbles created more designs for Elvis Costello ,  as well as other artists such as Nick Lowe ,  Carlene Carter and Clive Langer & The Boxes . Bubbles also maintained his freelance output ,  producing designs for Peter Jenner (Ian Dury and Billy Bragg's manager) ,  and others .  He created a prodigious output by working for such bands ,  musicians and performers as Peter Hammill ,  Vivian Stanshall ,  Generation X ,  Big Star ,  Johnny Moped ,  Whirlwind ,  Billy Bragg ,  Clover ,  the Sinceros ,  Roger Chapman ,  Phillip Goodhand-Tait ,  Dr .  Feelgood ,  Inner City Unit and the Psychedelic Furs .  As a result ,  his work appeared on releases by labels such as Aura ,  Chiswick ,  Utility ,  Go! Discs ,  Epic ,  Charisma ,  CBS ,  Line Records ,  United Artists and Riddle Records .  His signature style emerged as one that was colourful ,  playful ,  loaded with geometry ,  art-history and music-history references ,  jokes ,  cryptograms and symbols .  The overriding appetite was for going against the grain of accepted design standards .  His work is simultaneously complex in meaning and simple in its delivery .  Examples include : Barney Bubbles directed several videos ,  including the Specials' """"Ghost Town"""" ,  Squeeze's """"Is That Love"""" and """"Tempted"""" ,  Elvis Costello's """"Clubland"""" and """"New Lace Sleeves"""" ,  and Fun Boy Three's """"The Lunatics (Have Taken Over the Asylum)"""" .  Two promos for the punk act Johnny Moped ,  """"Incendiary Device"""" and """"Darling Let's Have Another Baby"""" ,  were never commercially released to broadcasters . """"A good video can sell a record which might not do so well , """" Bubbles told Smash Hits magazine in 1982 .  """"The record companies know that .  I think Chrysalis would agree that The Specials' 'Ghost Town' video helped sales a good deal .  This year I intend to make videos which are really inexpensive but really inventive .  It can be done ,  you know . """"In 1979 ,  riding on the reputation of his work for Stiff ,  Bubbles was engaged by the UK music newspaper New Musical Express to spearhead an overhaul of its decades-old brand .  Bubbles' redesign incorporated elements of Pop art and 1920s Soviet poster art into a """"sleek ,  forward-looking"""" graphic format . In 1979 Derek Boshier curated an exhibition entitled Lives at the Hayward Gallery ,  London ,  and he commissioned Bubbles to design the catalogue and poster .  Together with the photographer Chris Gabrin ,  Bubbles also exhibited a video and mixed-media installation in the exhibition . In the early 1980s Bubbles created furniture designs ,  some of which were featured in The Face ,  November 1981 . In 1982 Bubbles conceived the album Ersatz ,  working primarily with Nik Turner and other musicians from Inner City Unit .  The LP was released under the name of The Imperial Pompadours . Bubbles painted privately ,  increasingly in the early 1980s .  Barney Bubbles ,  who suffered from manic depression ,  committed suicide in London on 14 November 1983 by gassing himself ,  trapping the fumes in a plastic bag he placed over his head ,  at the age of 41 .

*** "*page_ Fumiko_Kaneko" "*cat_ People_who_committed_suicide_in_prison_custody" " Fumiko Kaneko was born in the Kotobuki district of Yokohama during the Meiji period in Japan .  Her parents were Fumikazu Saeki ,  a man from a samurai family ,  and Kikuno Kaneko ,  the daughter of a peasant ,  and because they were not officially married ,  Fumiko could not be registered as a Saeki .  She remained unregistered until she was 8 years old ,  at which point she was registered as her mother's sister ,  a fairly common practice for children born out of wedlock .  Kaneko recalls that the first few years of her life were fairly happy ,  as her father was employed as a detective at a police office and cared for his family ,  though they were fairly poor .  However ,  Fumikazu left his job at the police station ,  and the family moved around a considerable amount over the next few years .  Fumikazu was also increasingly drawn to gambling and drinking ,  began to abuse Kikuno ,  and became involved with other women ,  including Kikuno's sister Takano .  Eventually ,  Fumikazu left Kikuno and married Takano . During this time ,  Fumiko was first confronted with the problems of being an unregistered child .  Her circumstances made her “invisible to educational authorities , ” and she was not technically allowed to attend school .     "

Souther's parents divorced when he was four years-old and he was brought up by his mother .  In 1975 ,  Souther graduated from high school in Cumberland ,  Maine ,  and briefly attended university before enlisting in the United States Navy where he was trained as a photographer .  Souther served on the USS Nimitz from July 1976 to November 1978 ,  and was stationed with the United States Sixth Fleet in Italy from April 1979 to 1982 ,  where he married an Italian woman . In 1980 ,  while stationed in Italy ,  Souther attempted to defect to the Soviet Union at the Soviet embassy in Rome ,  stating he did not seek political asylum and did not declare any persecution by the American authorities .  Souther's request was rejected by Boris Aleksandrovich Solomatin ,  the embassy's resident KGB attaché who had coincidentally recruited and handled the American spy John Anthony Walker .  Instead ,  Solomatin recruited Souther to spy on the U . S .  Navy for the Soviet Union in exchange for the potential to earn Soviet citizenship ,  as Souther's job allowed him access to sensitive information that was highly valuable to the Soviets .  According to Solomatin ,  Souther was an ideological spy and not motivated by money . In 1982 ,  Souther was given an honorable discharge from the U . S .  Navy with a rank of petty officer first class to study Russian literature and commissioned officer training at Old Dominion University .  Simultaneously ,  Souther worked as a reservist at the Atlantic Fleet intelligence center in Norfolk ,  Virginia ,  where he was assigned to a laboratory processing satellite-reconnaissance photos ,  and also may have been privy to sensitive communications intercepts .  Souther was one of the Soviets' most effective spies and provided them with highly-important classified information ,  including secret photographs of weapons ,  plans for the movement of fleet ships ,  their weapons ,  and their tasks ,  and the criteria by which the US command assessed the admissibility of a nuclear strike . Souther's estranged wife had approached a Navy officer to report that he was a spy in 1981 ,  but these allegations were not taken seriously until John Anthony Walker's arrest in 1985 .  Thereafter ,  Souther was interrogated by the FBI but was not charged due to a lack of evidence . In May 1986 ,  Souther requested Soviet citizenship ,  aware that the investigation against him was progressing .  In early 1989 ,  Souther was awarded an Order of Friendship of Peoples for his contributions in the intelligence services following a petition from the KGB leadership . Souther did not publicly resurface until July 20 ,  1988 ,  when a television interview program with a segment about him was broadcast on Soviet Central Television .  In the program ,  Souther spoke about his own disillusionment with American nuclear policies and his love for the works of Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky .  He also discussed and criticized several American intelligence operations in which he took part ,  including the 1986 bombing of Libya and the analysis of the Chernobyl disaster .  On July 11 ,  one week before the television interview ,  Izvestia published an article about Souther ,  announcing that he received Soviet citizenship ,  that he defected for ideological reasons ,  and that he was visited by relatives from the United States who were convinced that he did indeed move to the Soviet Union voluntarily .  The Izvestia article was the first new information about Souther in the United States since defecting in 1986 ,  and Souther's fate had previously been unknown to his relatives .  In mid-1988 ,  in another interview ,  Souther made several statements praising his new living conditions in the Soviet Union and optimistic about the country's future .  In reality ,  Souther was impressed by the Soviet Union's free education and health care ,  well-developed public transport ,  and the social security system ,  but found much of the country had failed to live up to his expectations .

On June 22 ,  1989 ,  Souther reportedly committed suicide in Moscow at the age of 32 ,  only three years after his defection .

*** "*page_ Henri_Goetz" "*cat_ Artists_who_committed_suicide" " Goetz was born in New York City in 1909 .  His father ran an electrical plant .  He later described his mother as a """"quasi-academic"""" because of the two large parenting books she owned .  He began drawing because the books told that a child needs a certain number of hours outside in a day ,  and as such he was not allowed to come home before six .  On one rainy day ,  he made use of his time by drawing .  However ,  he was frustrated with his clumsy drawing ,  and tore it up .  He later asked his mother to beat him for his failure as an artist .   In January 1937 ,  Goetz held his first exhibition at the Galerie Bonaparte with his wife .  In 1945 ,  after returning to Paris from several years working with the French Resistance forging documents ,  Goetz worked with René Guilly on a national radio program called The World of Paris .  Ubac covered poetry ,  and Goetz covered painting .  Goetz visited a new studio each week and ,  through this ,  met with artists such as Pablo Picasso ,  Constantin Brâncuși ,  Wassily Kandinsky ,  Julio González ,  Francis Picabia ,  and Max Ernst .  He continued broadcasting for six months before giving his position to someone else . In 1947 ,  Goetz became the subject of a short film by Alain Resnais for the Musée National d'Art Moderne entitled Portrait de Henri Goetz .   Goetz showed the film to Gaston Diehl ,  leading Diehl to commission Resnais to create the film Van Gogh in the following year .  Resnais went on to win an Academy Award in 1950 for the Best Short Subject ,  Two-reel film for Van Gogh . In 1949 ,  Goetz began to teach a painting class .  The class grew so large that he had to move it to the Académie Ranson .  After five years of teaching there ,  he taught for another five years at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière ,  eventually running two classes due to the number of pupils .  He taught at many other schools before finally founding the Académie Goetz .  He never charged money for his lessons .  Of his students ,  Goetz said ,  """"Some became excellent artists ,  and some became fashionable artists ,  but rarely the same ones became both . """" In 1968 he accepted a teaching position at École des Beaux-Arts ,  but the school was closed due to student strikes two weeks later .  He then moved to work at Paris 8 University ,  where he taught painting and etching classes . Goetz and his wife had long worked together to illustrate several books with their etchings .  Christine had taken classes in the subject before World War II at the Académie des Beaux-Arts ,  and had taught Goetz .  They collaborated on Georges Hugnet's book ,  La femme facil ,  as well as other books .  After seeing some of their lithographs ,  a friend of theirs encouraged them to etch full-time .  Johnny Friedlaender gave them a small printing press that he no longer used ,  and Fin ,  Pablo Picasso's nephew ,  helped them modify it .  Christine focused mostly on lithography ,  while Goetz focused mostly on etching .  They also helped design silk screens . Citing a lack of patience and methodical ways , In addition to his carborundum printing research ,  Goetz undertook extensive research on pastels .   "

*** "*page_ Arshile_Gorky" "*cat_ Artists_who_committed_suicide" " Gorky was born in the village of Khorgom (today's Dilkaya) ,  situated on the shores of Lake Van in the Ottoman Empire . In 1915 ,  Gorky fled Lake Van during the Armenian genocide and escaped with his mother and his three sisters into Russian-controlled territory .  In the aftermath of the genocide ,  Gorky's mother died of starvation in Yerevan in 1919 .  Arriving in America in 1920 ,  the 16-year-old Gorky was reunited with his father ,  but they never grew close . In the process of reinventing his identity ,  he changed his name to """"Arshile Gorky"""" ,  claiming to be a Georgian noble  In 1923 ,  Gorky enrolled in the recently founded New England School of Art in Boston ,  eventually becoming a part-time instructor .   During the early 1920s he was influenced by Impressionism ,  although later in the decade he produced works that were more postimpressionist .   During this time he was living in New York and was influenced by Paul Cézanne .   In 1925 he was asked by Edmund Greacen of the Grand Central Art Galleries to teach at the Grand Central School of Art ;  Gorky accepted and remained with them until 1931 .  In 1927 ,  Gorky met Ethel Kremer Schwabacher and developed a lifelong friendship .  Schwabacher was his first biographer .  Gorky said : The stuff of thought is the seed of the artist .  Dreams form the bristles of the artist's brush .  As the eye functions as the brain's sentry ,  I communicate my innermost perceptions through the art ,  my worldview . In 1931 ,  Gorky sent  a group of works ranging in price from $100 to $450 to the Downtown Gallery in New York .  (The artist's name was spelled """"Archele Gorki"""" in the gallery's records .  Most of Gorky's works from this period were unsigned . ) The exact nature of their relationship is unknown .   Mrs .  John D .  Rockefeller (Abby Aldrich Rockefeller) purchased from the gallery a Cézannesque still life by Gorky titled Fruit .   Gorky may have been introduced to the gallery owner by Stuart Davis who regularly exhibited there . In 1933 ,  Arshile Gorky became one of the first artists employed by the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project .  This later came to include such artists as Alice Neel ,  Lee Krasner ,  Jackson Pollock ,  Diego Rivera and Mark Rothko . In 1935 ,  Gorky signed a three-year contract with the Guild Art Gallery (37 West Fifty-seventh Street ,  New York) .  Co-owned by Anna Walinska and Margaret Lefranc ,  but funded and directed by Lefranc ,  the gallery organized the artist's first solo exhibition in New York ,  Abstract Drawings by Arshile Gorky . Notable paintings from this time include Landscape in the Manner of Cézanne (1927) and Landscape ,  Staten Island (1927–1928) .   At the close of the 1920s and into the 1930s he experimented with cubism ,  eventually moving to surrealism .  The painting illustrated above ,  The Artist and His Mother ,  (ca .  1926–1936) is a memorable ,  moving and innovative portrait .   His The Artist and His Mother paintings are based on a childhood photograph taken in Van in which he is depicted standing beside his mother .  Gorky made two versions ;  the other is in the National Gallery of Art Washington ,  DC .  .  The painting has been likened to Ingres for simplicity of line and smoothness ,  to Egyptian Funerary art for pose ,  to Cézanne for flat planar composition ,  to Picasso for form and color . Nighttime ,  Enigma ,  Nostalgia (1930–1934) are the series of complex works that characterize this phase of his painting .  The canvas Portrait of Master Bill  appears to depict Gorky's friend ,  Willem de Kooning .  De Kooning said :  """"I met a lot of artists — but then I met Gorky  .  .  .  He had an extraordinary gift for hitting the nail on the head ;  remarkable .  So I immediately attached myself to him and we became very good friends .  It was nice to be foreigners meeting in some new place . """"When Gorky showed his new work to André Breton in the 1940s ,  after seeing the new paintings and in particular The Liver Is the Cock's Comb ,  Breton declared the painting to be """"one of the most important paintings made in America"""" and he stated that Gorky was a Surrealist ,  which was Breton's highest compliment . Michael Auping ,  a curator at the Modern Art Museum in Fort Worth ,  saw in the work a """"taut sexual drama"""" combined with nostalgic allusions to Gorky's Armenian past .   "

After a training in agricultural management ,  from 1912 ,  he fought in World War I ,  serving from 2 August 1914 .  He served through nearly the entire war ,  receiving numerous bullet and shell wounds ,  and was decorated with the Iron Cross 1st and 2nd Class .  Along with other demobilised officers ,  he then joined the Marinebrigade Ehrhardt (a Freikorps) .

*** "*page_ Florence_Griffith_Joyner" "*cat_ Deaths_from_asphyxiation" " Griffith was born in Los Angeles ,  California ,  seventh of eleven children born to Robert ,  an electrician and Florence Griffith ,  a seamstress . When Griffith was in elementary school ,  she joined the Sugar Ray Robinson Organization ,  running in track meets on weekends . Showing an early interest in fashion ,  Griffith persuaded the members of the track team to wear tights with their uniforms .   Griffith attended the California State University at Northridge ,  and was on the track team coached by Bob Kersee . Brown ,  Bolden ,  and Griffith qualified for the 100-meter final at the trials for the 1980 Summer Olympics (with Brown winning and Griffith finishing last in the final) .  Griffith also ran the 200 meters ,  narrowly finishing fourth ,  a foot out of a qualifying position . Griffith finished fourth in the 200-meter sprint at the first World Championship in Athletics in 1983 . After the 1984 Olympic Games ,  she spent less time running . She returned to athletics in April 1987 . Before the 1988 U . S .  Olympic Trials ,  Griffith-Joyner continued to work with her coach ,  and now brother in law ,  Kersee two days a week ,  but with her new husband coaching her three days a week . In the first race of the quarterfinals of the U . S .  Olympic Trials ,  she stunned her colleagues when she sprinted 100 meters in 10 . 49 seconds ,  a new world record by a margin of 0 . 27s over the previous record held by Evelyn Ashford . The 100m record was by far the largest improvement in the world record time since the advent of electronic timing ,  and still stands .  This extraordinary result raised the possibility of a technical malfunction with the wind gauge which read at 0 . 0m/s - a reading at odds with the windy conditions on the day ,  with high wind speeds being recorded in all other sprints before and after this race as well as the parallel long jump runway at the time of the Griffith-Joyner performance .  All scientific studies commissioned by the IAAF and independent organisations have since found there was an illegal tailwind of between 5m/s – 7m/s at the time .  The IAAF has not annulled the result ,  but since 1997 the International Athletics Annual of the Association of Track and Field Statisticians has listed it as """"probably strongly wind assisted ,  but recognized as a world record"""" .  Thompson-Herah clocked 10 . 54 seconds ,  officially the second fastest time in women's 100m history . Following the Olympic trials ,  in late July 1988 ,  Griffith-Joyner left coach Kersee saying she wanted a coach able to provide more personal attention .  Another contributing factor was her unhappiness with the lack of sponsorship and endorsement opportunities . By now known to the world as """"Flo-Jo"""" ,  Griffith-Joyner was the big favorite for the titles in the sprint events at the 1988 Summer Olympics .  In the 100-meter final ,  she ran a 10 . 54 ,  beating her nearest rival to the world record ,  Evelyn Ashford ,  by 0 . 30 seconds .  In the 200 meter semifinal ,  she set the world record of 21 . 56 seconds and then broke this record by 0 . 22 seconds in winning the final with a time of 21 . 34 seconds .  Like her 100m world record ,  this mark still stands . At the same Olympics ,  Griffith-Joyner also ran with the 4 × 100 m relay and the 4 × 400 m relay teams .  Her team won the 4 × 100 m relay and finished second in the 4 × 400 m relay . In February 1989 ,  Griffith-Joyner announced her retirement from racing . Griffith-Joyner's success at the 1988 Olympics led to new opportunities . Among the things she did away from the track was to design the basketball uniforms for the Indiana Pacers NBA team in 1989 . In 1996 ,  Griffith-Joyner appeared on Charlie Rose and announced her comeback to competitive athletics ,  concentrating on the 400-meter run .  On September 21 ,  1998 ,  Griffith-Joyner died in her sleep at home in the Canyon Crest neighborhood of Mission Viejo ,  California ,  at the age of 38 .  The unexpected death was investigated by the Orange County Sheriff-Coroner's office ,  which announced on September 22 that the cause of death was suffocation during a severe epileptic seizure . Griffith-Joyner was found to have had a cavernous hemangioma ,  a congenital vascular brain abnormality that made her subject to seizures .  "

He was sent to boarding school at age eleven ,  where the food was poor and discipline was harsh .  He sold a violin to pay for his train ticket home ,  and then took to his bed ,  feigning illness ,  until he was told he would not have to return . Göring joined the Prince Wilhelm Regiment (112th Infantry ,  Garrison :  Mülhausen) of the Prussian Army in 1912 .  The next year his mother had a falling-out with Epenstein .  The family was forced to leave Veldenstein and moved to Munich ;  Göring's father died shortly afterwards .  When World War I began in August 1914 ,  Göring was stationed at Mülhausen with his regiment .     "
*** "*page_ Dorothy_Hale" "*cat_ Female_suicides" " Hale was born Dorothy Donovan ,  the daughter of a real estate agent ,  in Pittsburgh . While she was studying sculpture in Paris ,  she married millionaire stockbroker Gaillard Thomas ,  son of the wealthy gynecologist T .  Gaillard Thomas ;  the brief marriage ended in divorce . She married Gardner Hale (1894–1931) in 1927 .  Gardner Hale was a fresco ,  mural ,  and society portrait artist ,  and the married Dorothy Hale continued moving in creative and expensive social circles .  During this West Coast period ,  she socialized with artists Miquel and Rosa Corvarrubias ,  Frida Kahlo ,  and photographer Nickolas Muray .   Hale's stage work was limited to several seasons in stock companies and some work as a dancer and Ziegfeld girl .  The evening of her death ,  Hale informally entertained some friends ;  she had told them that she was planning a long trip and invited them to a farewell party . After attending the theater ,  Hale returned to her home—a one-room studio apartment with a kitchenette on the 16th floor of Hampshire House—at about 1 : 15 am ,  leaving a large number of friends partying at the 21 Club .  She apparently spent the next four hours at the typewriter composing farewell notes to friends :  one to Baruch expressing regret at not taking his advice ; At 5 : 15 am on October 21 ,  1938 ,  Hale threw herself out of the window of her apartment .  She was found still wearing her favorite Madame X femme-fatale black velvet dress with a corsage of small yellow roses ,  given to her by Noguchi . Though The New York Times covered her death , In his interview for the Herrera book on Frida Kahlo ,  Noguchi would say of Hale : She was very beautiful girl ,  all my girls are beautiful .  I went to London with her in 1933 .  Bucky (Buckminster Fuller) and I were there the night before she did it .  I remember very well she said ,  'Well that's the end of the vodka .  There isn't any more . ' Just like that you know .  I wouldn't have thought of it much ,  except afterward I realized that that's what she was talking about .  Dorothy was very pretty ,  and she traveled in this false world .  She didn't want to be second to anybody ,  and she must have thought she was slipping . Hale's friend Clare Boothe Luce ,  an ardent admirer of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo ,  almost immediately commissioned Kahlo to paint a recuerdo (remembrance) portrait of their deceased mutual friend ,  so that in Kahlo's words :  """"her life must not be forgotten"""" . What Kahlo created was a graphic ,  narrative retablo ,  detailing every step of Hale's suicide .  It  depicts Hale standing on the balcony ,  falling to her death while also lying on the bloody pavement below .  She donated it anonymously to the Phoenix Art Museum ,  where it was eventually outed as a Luce donation .  The museum retains ownership ,  although the painting is frequently on tour in exhibitions of Kahlo's works . In 2010 ,  the painting was included in a """"sweeping view"""" of Noguchi's career in the “On Becoming an Artist :  Isamu Noguchi and His Contemporaries ,  1922-1960” show at the Noguchi Museum in Long Island City ,  Queens ,  New York City .

*** "*page_ Suicide_of_Ryan_Halligan" "*cat_ Bullying_and_suicide" " Halligan was born on December 18 ,  1989 , He was described by his father as a """"gentle ,  very sensitive soul , """" who experienced some developmental delays affecting speech and physical coordination in his early school years .  Although he overcame those difficulties by the fourth grade ,  """"He still struggled ;  school was never easy to him ,  but he always showed up with a smile on his face ,  eager to do his best , """" said his father . When Halligan was in 5th grade ,  he started to suffer bullying at the hands of a group of students at his school because of his learning disorder ,  his passion for music (drums and guitar) ,  and his love for drama .  His father said that when Halligan told him he was being picked on ,  his initial response was to ignore the boys ,  as they were just bullying him with words .  The family later said in a short documentary that Halligan enrolled in counseling ,  with little success .  After that he moved up to middle school ,  where the bullying continued when Halligan was in 7th grade . In December 2002 ,  Halligan told his father that the bullying had started again .  He asked for a Taebo Kick Boxing set for Christmas in order to learn how to defend himself .  At first ,  his father wanted to go to the school principal and sort things out ,  but Halligan insisted that he wanted to learn how to fight ,  believing that complaining to the school about the boys would make things worse .  After Christmas ,  Halligan and his father developed a routine of practicing downstairs in the basement for 2 hours every night .  After he had learned to defend himself ,  his father told him not to pick fights at school ,  but said that if any student ever touched him aggressively ,  Halligan had his father's permission to defend himself . In February 2003 ,  Halligan had a fight with a bully ,  which was broken up by the assistant principal ;  after that ,  the bully stopped bothering him .  Halligan's father said that he was proud of his son for sticking up for himself .  Toward the end of 7th grade ,  Halligan told his father that he and the bully had become friends .  His parents warned him to be careful about the friendship ,  because the bully had been harassing him for a long time .  The two boys were friends for a short amount of time .  After Halligan told the bully about an embarrassing examination required after he had stomach pains ,  he learned that the bully misused the story to spread a rumor that Halligan was gay . According to his father and news reports ,  during the summer of 2003 ,  Halligan spent much of his time online ,  particularly on AIM and other instant messaging services .  Halligan did not tell his parents about this .  During the summer ,  he was cyber-bullied by schoolmates who taunted him ,  thinking he was gay .  Halligan was also bullied at school about this ;  his father later learned that on one occasion ,  Halligan ran out of the classroom in tears .  According to an ABC Primetime report ,  she had once been his friend and defended him when the bullying first started ,  but as she became more popular ,  she left him behind .  He found out she only pretended to like him to gain personal information about him .  She copied and pasted their private exchanges into other IMs among his schoolmates to embarrass and humiliate him . After Ashley had called him a """"loser"""" ,  Halligan said ,  """"It's girls like you who make me want to kill myself . """" His father found out about this later because it was a matter of record with the local police .  Halligan's father also discovered some disturbing conversations between Halligan and a boy with a screen name he did not recognize .  Halligan began communicating online with a pen-pal about suicide and death ,  and told him he was thinking about suicide .  They had been exchanging information they had found on sites relating to death and suicide ,  including sites that taught them how to painlessly kill themselves .  The pen-pal answered """"Phew .  It's about fucking time , """" shortly after Halligan told him he was thinking about suicide ,  two weeks before he killed himself .  This was the last conversation he had with the pen-pal .  As Halligan's father found out ,  contrary to popular belief ,  Halligan's pen-pal was a boy he knew up until third grade ,  when the boy and his parents moved away .  When they found each other online ,  they reconnected . The pen-pal had ,  according to Halligan's father ,  turned into a very negative person with a bleak outlook on life .  Online ,  the boys discussed how much they hated their popular classmates and how they made them feel .  The pen-pal suggested suicide as a way out ,  writing ,  """"If you killed yourself you would really make them feel bad . """" Halligan's father said that the boy was the worst possible friend that Halligan could have had at that time . The parents acknowledged that Halligan had discussed some of his worries and brought up suicide .  He had told them his report card would be bad ,  and worried that his parents would be disappointed in him .  One night he asked his dad if he had ever thought of suicide ,  who responded that he had ,  but also said ,  """"Ryan ,  imagine if I did do that .  Look at all the things we would have missed out on as a family . """"On October 7 ,  2003 ,  Halligan's father was away on a business trip .  Early in the morning ,  when the other family members were still sleeping ,  Halligan hanged himself with a bathrobe tie that belonged to his older sister ,  who later found his body . Although Halligan left no suicide note ,  his father learned of the cyberbullying when he accessed his son's computer .  He checked his son's yearbook first and found the faces of the bullying group scribbled out .  Halligan had scribbled over the face of the ringleader (the same boy who bullied Halligan ,  befriended him ,  and then started the gay rumor) so aggressively he had torn the paper .  Halligan accessed his son's computer and first learned of the cyber-bullying when his son's friends told him . When he learned that Ashley was being blamed for Halligan's suicide ,  Halligan had her brought over to his house .  He reportedly said to her ,  """"You did a bad thing ,  but you're not a bad person . """" She appeared with Halligan on ABC's Primetime to speak out against bullying .   Although the Halligans moved out of Vermont ,  she still maintains contact with them . He later confronted the bully who had started the gay rumor after finding out that he made fun of how Halligan killed himself .  At first ,  he was so angry that he wanted to go to the boy's house and """"crush that little jerk , """" but had time to think about it while stuck in traffic .  Halligan reportedly said to the boy ,  """"You have no idea the amount of pain you caused my son .  And you're still bullying him now even when he's defenseless and you are still lying to your parents about it .  I refuse to believe that you are so cruel and that you don't have a heart . """" Shortly afterward the bully broke down in tears and repeatedly apologized for what he did . Halligan wanted to file charges against the bully but the police said there was no criminal law that covered the relevant circumstances .  Halligan forgave the boy as well as Ashley .  After learning the name of the pen-pal ,  Halligan's father went to his house and talked with his parents .  Halligan said that he did not want the pen-pal to use the conversations for """"something dark . """" While at the pen-pal's house ,  Halligan learned that the boy's father never received any hard copies of the conversations .  The pen-pal's mother came and pulled out the hard copies from under the sofa ,  showing them to the father for """"what appeared to be the first time . """" While the father was looking at the copies ,  the mother threw Halligan out .  Halligan said that he never got a satisfying response from the boy or his family .  He still visits the boy's website ,  which contains several references to death and suicide . Halligan soon began lobbying for legislation in Vermont to improve how schools address bullying and suicide prevention .  He has also given speeches to schools in various states about the story of his son and the devastating effects of cyber-bullying among teens . Vermont enacted a Bullying Prevention Policy Law in May 2004 and later adopted a Suicide Prevention Law (Act 114) in 2005 ,  closely following a draft submitted by Halligan's father .  The law provides measures to assist teachers and others to recognize and respond to depression and suicide risks among teens . Halligan's story was featured on a Frontline television program entitled """"Growing Up Online"""" ,  produced in January 2008 ,  by WGBH-TV in Boston and distributed nationwide over PBS .  In it ,  his father recounts his shock upon discovering the extent of the abuse his son endured ,  saying he believes that bullying on the internet """"amplified and accelerated the hurt and pain he was trying to deal with ,  that started in the real world . """" Halligan's story has also been featured on Oprah in a report they did on a rise in homophobic teasing in schools .  In addition ,  he presented his powerful assembly to many schools across the country . Halligan's story was also featured in Max Hechtman's 2018 documentary ,  Stories of Strength and Hope :  Preventing Youth Suicide ,  supported by an on-screen interview with John Halligan .  Today Halligan visits other schools to inform students about his son's death and how it has changed his life .     "

*** "*page_ Yegor_Sozonov" "*cat_ Suicides_by_poison" " He was born into the family of a wealthy timber merchant of the Old Believer faith .  Sozonov studied at the Ufa boys's gymnasium and then entered the Faculty of Medicine of the Imperial Moscow University in 1901 .  In the same year ,  Sozonov ,  who at the time was not involved in revolutionary activity ,  was one of the organizers of a student protest against the decision of the Imperial University ,  which expelled 183 students for anti-tsarist activities . Sozonov was himself expelled from the university and was sent to exile in Ufa .  In his exile he started to study socialist and democratic literature .  At the behest of his father he was released and later joined the Ural Union of Social Democrats and Socialist Revolutionaries .  Shortly after he was once again arrested and thus was exiled to Siberia . On March 16 (29) ,  1902 ,  in his family apartment ,  the police broke in with a search warrant .  Sozonov had time to tear some sheets from his personal notebook and chew them ,  only to realize that in his haste he had destroyed the wrong pages .  The police thus found the evidence of the existence in the city of clandestine activity coordinated by the Union .  He was held in the Ufa prison where he went on a hunger strike and was later transferred to Yakutsk . In July 1903 ,  on his way to Eastern Siberia ,  Sozonov fled and left for Switzerland .  Abroad ,  he finally joined the Combat Organization of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party .  With a fake passport and using a false name ,  Yegor Sozonov returned to Russia . Vyacheslav von Plehve ,  who was known for his ruthlessness ,  had already approved of the brutal suppression of many workers's strikes .  After the massacre of the Zlatoust miners which left over sixty dead and Plehve's approval of the measure taken by the Governor of Ufa ,  Nikolai Bogdanovich ,  this led to the decision of Grigory Gershuni ,  head of the SR Combat Organization to assassinate him . Under the leadership of Yevno Azef ,  Sozonov ,  Lev Sikorsky ,  Abram Borishansky and Ivan Kalyayev were sent to assassinate the minister .  On July 15 28th 1904 ,  Sozonov assassinated the Minister of the Interior after throwing a bomb at his carriage in Ismailovsky Prospekt in St .  Petersburg which killed him instantly .  The other two assassins ,  Sikorski and Kalyayev ,  did not use their bombs .  Sozonov himself was wounded by the explosion and was immediately arrested and beaten severely by the police . Sozonov was deprived of all rights and assigned to indefinite detention in a convict prison and was imprisoned in the Shlisselburg Fortress .  Then he was transferred to the Butyrka prison ,  from where he was sent to the Nerchinsk mines for forced labor .  The amnesty of 1905 limited Sozonov's stay in hard labor for a certain period . At the end of 1907 ,  he was transferred to the Zerentui convict prison .  The new head of the prison ,  I .  Vysotsky equated political prisoners with criminal ones and introduced corporal punishment for the first .  Having found fault for an insignificant reason ,  he ordered that political prisoners be flogged .  Yegor Sozonov took poison on December 10 ,  1910 ,  died and was initially buried at the place of death . After the February Revolution ,  on May 25 ,  1917 ,  Sozonov's ashes were brought to Ufa .  The reburial took place at the Sergievsky cemetery .  A monument was erected on the grave in 1917 .    At the end of 1907 ,  he was transferred to the Zerentui convict prison .

*** "*page_ Yegor_Sozonov" "*cat_ Suicides_by_poison" " He was born into the family of a wealthy timber merchant of the Old Believer faith .  Sozonov studied at the Ufa boys's gymnasium and then entered the Faculty of Medicine of the Imperial Moscow University in 1901 .  In the same year ,  Sozonov ,  who at the time was not involved in revolutionary activity ,  was one of the organizers of a student protest against the decision of the Imperial University ,  which expelled 183 students for anti-tsarist activities . Sozonov was himself expelled from the university and was sent to exile in Ufa .  In his exile he started to study socialist and democratic literature .  At the behest of his father he was released and later joined the Ural Union of Social Democrats and Socialist Revolutionaries .  Shortly after he was once again arrested and thus was exiled to Siberia . On March 16 (29) ,  1902 ,  in his family apartment ,  the police broke in with a search warrant .  Sozonov had time to tear some sheets from his personal notebook and chew them ,  only to realize that in his haste he had destroyed the wrong pages .  The police thus found the evidence of the existence in the city of clandestine activity coordinated by the Union .  He was held in the Ufa prison where he went on a hunger strike and was later transferred to Yakutsk . In July 1903 ,  on his way to Eastern Siberia ,  Sozonov fled and left for Switzerland .  Abroad ,  he finally joined the Combat Organization of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party .  With a fake passport and using a false name ,  Yegor Sozonov returned to Russia . Vyacheslav von Plehve ,  who was known for his ruthlessness ,  had already approved of the brutal suppression of many workers's strikes .  After the massacre of the Zlatoust miners which left over sixty dead and Plehve's approval of the measure taken by the Governor of Ufa ,  Nikolai Bogdanovich ,  this led to the decision of Grigory Gershuni ,  head of the SR Combat Organization to assassinate him . Under the leadership of Yevno Azef ,  Sozonov ,  Lev Sikorsky ,  Abram Borishansky and Ivan Kalyayev were sent to assassinate the minister .  On July 15 28th 1904 ,  Sozonov assassinated the Minister of the Interior after throwing a bomb at his carriage in Ismailovsky Prospekt in St .  Petersburg which killed him instantly .  The other two assassins ,  Sikorski and Kalyayev ,  did not use their bombs .  Sozonov himself was wounded by the explosion and was immediately arrested and beaten severely by the police . Sozonov was deprived of all rights and assigned to indefinite detention in a convict prison and was imprisoned in the Shlisselburg Fortress .  Then he was transferred to the Butyrka prison ,  from where he was sent to the Nerchinsk mines for forced labor .  The amnesty of 1905 limited Sozonov's stay in hard labor for a certain period . At the end of 1907 ,  he was transferred to the Zerentui convict prison .  The new head of the prison ,  I .  Vysotsky equated political prisoners with criminal ones and introduced corporal punishment for the first .  Having found fault for an insignificant reason ,  he ordered that political prisoners be flogged .  Yegor Sozonov took poison on December 10 ,  1910 ,  died and was initially buried at the place of death . After the February Revolution ,  on May 25 ,  1917 ,  Sozonov's ashes were brought to Ufa .

Although the three younger half-brothers were the sons of Anaxandrides' first wife and therefore had a better claim to the throne according to tradition ,  Cleomenes was the oldest son and succeeded his father around 519 BC . An early anecdote demonstrating Cleomenes' integrity is that when Maeandrius ,  the exiled but still wealthy tyrant of Samos ,  visited Sparta ,  he several times invited Cleomenes to his house and showed him some valuable goblets ;  when Cleomenes politely admired them ,  Maeandrius offered them to him as a gift .   Cleomenes rejected this thinly disguised bribe and arranged for Maeandrius to be expelled from Sparta .     "

In 1925 ,  he was among a select few students who traveled to Europe to continue their studies .  There ,  he initially went on to study engineering in Belgium ,  which he abandoned after a year to study architecture in France .  There he gave up architecture in turn to pursue dentistry .  In this period he became acquainted with Thérèse ,  a Parisian with whom he had a love affair  Hedayat subsequently devoted his whole life to studying Western literature and to learning and investigating Iranian history and folklore .  The works of Rainer Maria Rilke ,  Edgar Allan Poe ,  Franz Kafka ,  Anton Chekhov ,  and Guy de Maupassant intrigued him the most .  During his short literary life span ,  Hedayat published a substantial number of short stories and novelettes ,  two historical dramas ,  a play ,  a travelogue ,  and a collection of satirical parodies and sketches .  His writings also include numerous literary criticisms ,  studies in Persian folklore ,  and many translations from Middle Persian and French .  He is credited with having brought the Persian language and literature into the mainstream of international contemporary writing .  There is no doubt that Hedayat was the most modern of all modern writers in Iran .  Yet ,  for Hedayat ,  modernity was not just a question of scientific rationality or a pure imitation of European values . In his later years ,  feeling the socio-political problems of the time ,  Hedayat started attacking the two major causes of Iran's decimation ,  the monarchy ,  and through his stories ,  he tried to impute the deafness and blindness of the nation to the abuses of these two major powers .  He felt alienated by everyone around him ,  especially by his peers ,  and his last published work ,  The Message of Kafka ,  bespeaks melancholy ,  desperation ,  and the sense of doom experienced by those subjected to discrimination and repression . Hedayat traveled and stayed in India from 1936 until late 1937 (the mansion he stayed in during his visit to Bombay was identified in 2014) .  Hedayet spent time in Bombay learning the Pahlavi (Middle Persian) language from the Parsi Zoroastrian community of India .  He was taught by Bahramgore Tahmuras Anklesaria (also spelled as Behramgore Tehmurasp Anklesaria) ,  a renowned scholar and philologist .   "

*** "*page_ Heinrich_Himmler" "*cat_ Nazis_who_committed_suicide_in_prison_custody" " Heinrich Luitpold Himmler was born in Munich on 7 October 1900 into a conservative middle-class Roman Catholic family .  His father was Joseph Gebhard Himmler (17 May 1865 – 29 October 1936) ,  a teacher ,  and his mother was Anna Maria Himmler (née Heyder ;  16 January 1866 – 10 September 1941) ,  a devout Roman Catholic .  Heinrich had two brothers :  Gebhard Ludwig (29 July 1898 – 22 June 1982) and Ernst Hermann (23 December 1905 – 2 May 1945) . Himmler's first name ,  Heinrich ,  was that of his godfather ,  Prince Heinrich of Bavaria ,  a member of the royal family of Bavaria ,  who had been tutored by Gebhard Himmler . Himmler's diary ,  which he kept intermittently from the age of 10 ,  shows that he took a keen interest in current events ,  dueling ,  and """"the serious discussion of religion and sex"""" . Although many regulations that discriminated against non-Christians—including Jews and other minority groups—had been eliminated during the unification of Germany in 1871 ,  antisemitism continued to exist and thrive in Germany and other parts of Europe . In 1922 ,  Himmler became more interested in the """"Jewish question"""" ,  with his diary entries containing an increasing number of antisemitic remarks and recording a number of discussions about Jews with his classmates .  His reading lists ,  as recorded in his diary ,  were dominated by antisemitic pamphlets ,  German myths ,  and occult tracts . Himmler joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in August 1923 ,  receiving party number 14303 . In 1923–24 ,  Himmler ,  while searching for a world view ,  came to abandon Catholicism and focused on the occult and in antisemitism .  Germanic mythology ,  reinforced by occult ideas ,  became a religion for him .  Himmler found the NSDAP appealing because its political positions agreed with his own views .  Initially ,  he was not swept up by Hitler's charisma or the cult of Führer worship .  However ,  as he learned more about Hitler through his reading ,  he began to regard him as a useful face of the party , That same year ,  he joined the Schutzstaffel (SS) as an SS-Führer (SS-Leader) ;  his SS number was 168 . Around this time ,  Himmler joined the Artaman League ,  a Völkisch youth group .  There he met Rudolf Höss ,  who was later commandant of Auschwitz concentration camp ,  and Walther Darré ,  whose book The Peasantry as the Life Source of the Nordic Race caught Hitler's attention ,  leading to his later appointment as Reich Minister of Food and Agriculture .  Darré was a firm believer in the superiority of the Nordic race ,  and his philosophy was a major influence on Himmler .     "

*** "*page_ Peter_Warlock" "*cat_ Suicides_by_gas" " Heseltine was born on 30 October 1894 at the Savoy Hotel ,  London ,  which his parents were using at the time as their town residence . In March 1897 Arnold Heseltine died suddenly at the age of 45 .  Six years later ,  Bessie married a Welsh landowner and local magistrate ,  Walter Buckley Jones ,  and moved to Jones's estate ,  Cefn Bryntalch ,  Llandyssil ,  near Montgomery ,  although the London house was retained . In 1903 Heseltine entered Stone House Preparatory School in Broadstairs ,  where he showed precocious academic ability and won several prizes . Heseltine left Stone House in the summer of 1908 and began at Eton College that autumn .  His biographer Ian Parrott records that he loathed Eton ,  """"with its hearty adolescent bawling of Victorian hymns in an all-male college chapel"""" .  He was equally unhappy with other aspects of school life ,  such as the Officers' Training Corps ,  the suggestive homosexuality ,  and endemic bullying . In June 1911 Heseltine learned that Thomas Beecham was to conduct an all-Delius concert at London's Queen's Hall on the 16th of that month ,  at which the composer would be present ,  and his Songs of Sunset would be given its first performance .  Colin Taylor ,  a sympathetic Eton piano tutor ,  secured permission from the school for Heseltine to attend the event .  Prior to this ,  his mother had contrived to meet Delius in her London home ;  as a consequence ,  during the concert intermission Heseltine was introduced to the composer .  The next day he wrote Delius a long appreciative letter :  """"I cannot adequately express in words the intense pleasure it was to me to hear such perfect performances of such perfect music"""" . By the summer of 1911 ,  a year before he was due to leave the school ,  Heseltine had tired of life at Eton .  Without a clear plan for his future ,  he asked his mother if he could live abroad for a while .  His mother wanted him to go to university ,  and then either into the City or the Civil Service ,  but she agreed to his request with the proviso that he would resume his education later .  In October 1911 he proceeded to Cologne to learn German and to study piano at the conservatory . In March 1912 Heseltine returned to London and engaged a tutor to prepare for his university entrance examinations .  He spent time with Delius at that summer's Birmingham Festival , A female acquaintance at Christ Church described the 19-year-old Heseltine as """"probably about 22 ,  but he appears to be years older  .  .  .  6 feet high ,  absolutely fit  .  .  .  brilliant blue eyes  .  .  .  and the curved lips and highhead carriage of a young Greek God"""" . During Heseltine's four months at the Daily Mail ,  he wrote about 30 notices ,  mainly short reports of musical events but occasionally with some analysis . Heseltine spent much of the 1915 summer in a rented holiday cottage in the Vale of Evesham ,  with a party that included a young artist's model named Minnie Lucie Channing ,  who was known as """"Puma"""" because of her volatile temperament .  She and Heseltine soon entered into a passionate love affair . In February 1916 Heseltine returned to London ,  ostensibly to argue for exemption from military service .  However ,  it became clear that there had been a rift with Lawrence ;  in a letter to his friend Robert Nichols ,  Heseltine described Lawrence as """"a bloody bore determined to make me wholly his and as boring as he is"""" . An event of considerable significance in Heseltine's musical life ,  late in 1916 ,  was his introduction to the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren .  This friendship considerably influenced Heseltine ,  who for the rest of his life continued to promote the older composer's music . Puma bore a son in July 1916 ,  though there is confusion about the child's exact identity .  Most biographers assumed him to be Nigel Heseltine ,  the future writer who published a memoir of his father in 1992 .  However ,  in that memoir Nigel denied that Puma was his mother ;  he was ,  he says ,  the result of a concurrent liaison between Heseltine and an unnamed Swiss girl .  Subsequently ,  he was given to foster-parents ,  then adopted by Heseltine's mother . By April 1917 Heseltine had again tired of London life .  He returned to Cornwall where he rented a small cottage near the Lawrences ,  and made a partial peace with the writer .  By the summer of 1917 ,  as Allied fortunes in the war stagnated ,  Heseltine's military exemption came under review ;  to forestall a possible conscription ,  in August 1917 he moved to Ireland ,  taking Puma ,  with whom he had decided he was ,  after all ,  in love . In Ireland Heseltine combined studies of early music with a fascination for Celtic languages ,  withdrawing for a two-month period to a remote island where Irish was spoken exclusively . On 12 May 1918 Heseltine delivered a well-received illustrated lecture ,  """"What Music Is"""" ,  at Dublin's Abbey Theatre ,  which included musical excerpts from Bartók ,  the French composer Paul Ladmirault ,  and Van Dieren . When Heseltine returned to London at the end of August 1918 he sent seven of his new songs to Rogers for publication .  Because of the recent contretemps over Van Dieren ,  Heseltine submitted these pieces as """"Peter Warlock"""" .  They were published under this pseudonym ,  which he thereafter adopted for all his subsequent musical output ,  reserving his own name for critical and analytical writings . For the next few years Heseltine devoted most of his energy to musical criticism and journalism .  In May 1919 he delivered a paper to the Musical Association ,  """"The Modern Spirit in Music"""" ,  that impressed E . J .  Dent ,  the future Cambridge University music professor .  However ,  much of his writing was confrontational and quarrelsome .  He made dismissive comments about the current standards of musical criticism (""""the average newspaper critic of music  .  .  .  is either a shipwrecked or worn-out musician ,  or else a journalist too incompetent for ordinary reporting"""") which offended senior critics such as Ernest Newman .  He wrote provocative articles in the Musical Times ,  and in July 1919 feuded with the composer-critic Leigh Henry over the music of Igor Stravinsky . In a letter dated 17 July 1919 ,  Delius advised the younger man to concentrate either on writing or composing :  """"I  .  .  .  know how gifted you are and what possibilities are in you"""" . Heseltine had long nurtured a scheme to launch a music magazine ,  which he intended to start as soon as he found appropriate backing .  In April 1920 ,  Rogers decided to replace his semi-moribund magazine The Organist and Choirmaster ,  with a new music journal ,  The Sackbut ,  and invited Heseltine to edit it . With no regular income ,  in the autumn of 1921 Heseltine returned to Cefn Bryntalch ,  which became his base for the next three years .  He found the atmosphere there conducive to creative efforts ;  he told Gray that """"Wild Wales holds an enchantment for me stronger than wine or woman"""" . Heseltine's major literary work of this period was a biography of Delius ,  the first full-length study of the composer ,  which remained the standard work for many years . While visiting Budapest in April 1921 ,  Heseltine befriended the then little-known Hungarian composer and pianist Béla Bartók .  When Bartók visited Wales in March 1922 to perform in a concert ,  he stayed for a few days at Cefn Bryntalch .  Although Heseltine continued to promote Bartók's music ,  there are no records of further meetings after the Wales visit . In September and October 1923 Heseltine accompanied his fellow-composer E . J .  Moeran on a tour of eastern England ,  in search of original folk music .  Later that year he and Gray visited Delius at Grez . At Eynsford ,  with Moeran as his co-tenant ,  Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists ,  musicians and friends .  Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War ;  he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth . The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the """"Five Bells"""" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity .  These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery . In January 1927 ,  Heseltine's string serenade was recorded for the National Gramophonic Society ,  by John Barbirolli and an improvised chamber orchestra .  A year later ,  HMV recorded the ballad """"Captain Stratton's Fancy"""" ,  sung by Peter Dawson .  These two are the only recordings of Heseltine's music released during his lifetime . By November 1928 ,  Heseltine had tired of Cefn Bryntalch ,  and returned to London .  He sought concert reviewing and cataloguing assignments without much success ;  his main creative activity was the editing ,  under the pseudonym """"Rab Noolas"""" (""""Saloon Bar"""" backwards) ,  of Merry-Go-Down ,  an anthology in praise of drinking .  The book ,  published by The Mandrake Press ,  was copiously illustrated by Hal Collins . Early in 1929 Heseltine received two offers from Beecham which temporarily restored his sense of purpose .  Beecham had founded the Imperial League of Opera (ILO) in 1927 ;  he now invited Heseltine to edit the ILO journal . At a Promenade Concert in August 1929 ,  Heseltine conducted a performance of the Capriol Suite ,  the single public conducting engagement of his life . The final summer of Heseltine's life was marked by gloom ,  depression ,  and inactivity ;  ApIvor refers to Heseltine's sense of """"crimes against the spirit"""" ,  and an obsession with imminent death . In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea .  With no fresh creative inspiration ,  he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter ,  and made a solo version of """"Bethlehem Down"""" with organ accompaniment .  On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards .  According to Van Dieren ,  the visitors left at about 12 : 15a . m .  Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning .  When Peache ,  who had been away ,  returned early on 17 December ,  she found the doors and windows bolted ,  and smelled coal gas .  The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious ;  he was declared dead shortly afterwards ,  apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning . An inquest was held on 22 December ;  the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned . Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930 . In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs ,  in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son ,  born in July 1931 seven months after the composer's death .  Sewell's mother ,  private secretary Mary Jessica Perkins (who subsequently married Robert Sewell in 1936) ,  a Camden publican's daughter , Heseltine's surviving body of work includes about 150 songs ,  mostly for solo voice and piano .  He also wrote choral pieces ,  some with instrumental or orchestral accompaniment ,  and a few purely instrumental works .

*** "*page_ Peter_Warlock" "*cat_ Suicides_by_gas" " Heseltine was born on 30 October 1894 at the Savoy Hotel ,  London ,  which his parents were using at the time as their town residence . In March 1897 Arnold Heseltine died suddenly at the age of 45 .  Six years later ,  Bessie married a Welsh landowner and local magistrate ,  Walter Buckley Jones ,  and moved to Jones's estate ,  Cefn Bryntalch ,  Llandyssil ,  near Montgomery ,  although the London house was retained . In 1903 Heseltine entered Stone House Preparatory School in Broadstairs ,  where he showed precocious academic ability and won several prizes . Heseltine left Stone House in the summer of 1908 and began at Eton College that autumn .  His biographer Ian Parrott records that he loathed Eton ,  """"with its hearty adolescent bawling of Victorian hymns in an all-male college chapel"""" .  He was equally unhappy with other aspects of school life ,  such as the Officers' Training Corps ,  the suggestive homosexuality ,  and endemic bullying . In June 1911 Heseltine learned that Thomas Beecham was to conduct an all-Delius concert at London's Queen's Hall on the 16th of that month ,  at which the composer would be present ,  and his Songs of Sunset would be given its first performance .  Colin Taylor ,  a sympathetic Eton piano tutor ,  secured permission from the school for Heseltine to attend the event .  Prior to this ,  his mother had contrived to meet Delius in her London home ;  as a consequence ,  during the concert intermission Heseltine was introduced to the composer .  The next day he wrote Delius a long appreciative letter :  """"I cannot adequately express in words the intense pleasure it was to me to hear such perfect performances of such perfect music"""" . By the summer of 1911 ,  a year before he was due to leave the school ,  Heseltine had tired of life at Eton .  Without a clear plan for his future ,  he asked his mother if he could live abroad for a while .  His mother wanted him to go to university ,  and then either into the City or the Civil Service ,  but she agreed to his request with the proviso that he would resume his education later .  In October 1911 he proceeded to Cologne to learn German and to study piano at the conservatory . In March 1912 Heseltine returned to London and engaged a tutor to prepare for his university entrance examinations .  He spent time with Delius at that summer's Birmingham Festival , A female acquaintance at Christ Church described the 19-year-old Heseltine as """"probably about 22 ,  but he appears to be years older  .  .  .  6 feet high ,  absolutely fit  .  .  .  brilliant blue eyes  .  .  .  and the curved lips and highhead carriage of a young Greek God"""" . During Heseltine's four months at the Daily Mail ,  he wrote about 30 notices ,  mainly short reports of musical events but occasionally with some analysis . Heseltine spent much of the 1915 summer in a rented holiday cottage in the Vale of Evesham ,  with a party that included a young artist's model named Minnie Lucie Channing ,  who was known as """"Puma"""" because of her volatile temperament .  She and Heseltine soon entered into a passionate love affair . In February 1916 Heseltine returned to London ,  ostensibly to argue for exemption from military service .  However ,  it became clear that there had been a rift with Lawrence ;  in a letter to his friend Robert Nichols ,  Heseltine described Lawrence as """"a bloody bore determined to make me wholly his and as boring as he is"""" . An event of considerable significance in Heseltine's musical life ,  late in 1916 ,  was his introduction to the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren .  This friendship considerably influenced Heseltine ,  who for the rest of his life continued to promote the older composer's music . Puma bore a son in July 1916 ,  though there is confusion about the child's exact identity .  Most biographers assumed him to be Nigel Heseltine ,  the future writer who published a memoir of his father in 1992 .  However ,  in that memoir Nigel denied that Puma was his mother ;  he was ,  he says ,  the result of a concurrent liaison between Heseltine and an unnamed Swiss girl .  Subsequently ,  he was given to foster-parents ,  then adopted by Heseltine's mother . By April 1917 Heseltine had again tired of London life .  He returned to Cornwall where he rented a small cottage near the Lawrences ,  and made a partial peace with the writer .  By the summer of 1917 ,  as Allied fortunes in the war stagnated ,  Heseltine's military exemption came under review ;  to forestall a possible conscription ,  in August 1917 he moved to Ireland ,  taking Puma ,  with whom he had decided he was ,  after all ,  in love . In Ireland Heseltine combined studies of early music with a fascination for Celtic languages ,  withdrawing for a two-month period to a remote island where Irish was spoken exclusively . On 12 May 1918 Heseltine delivered a well-received illustrated lecture ,  """"What Music Is"""" ,  at Dublin's Abbey Theatre ,  which included musical excerpts from Bartók ,  the French composer Paul Ladmirault ,  and Van Dieren . When Heseltine returned to London at the end of August 1918 he sent seven of his new songs to Rogers for publication .  Because of the recent contretemps over Van Dieren ,  Heseltine submitted these pieces as """"Peter Warlock"""" .  They were published under this pseudonym ,  which he thereafter adopted for all his subsequent musical output ,  reserving his own name for critical and analytical writings . For the next few years Heseltine devoted most of his energy to musical criticism and journalism .  In May 1919 he delivered a paper to the Musical Association ,  """"The Modern Spirit in Music"""" ,  that impressed E . J .  Dent ,  the future Cambridge University music professor .  However ,  much of his writing was confrontational and quarrelsome .  He made dismissive comments about the current standards of musical criticism (""""the average newspaper critic of music  .  .  .  is either a shipwrecked or worn-out musician ,  or else a journalist too incompetent for ordinary reporting"""") which offended senior critics such as Ernest Newman .  He wrote provocative articles in the Musical Times ,  and in July 1919 feuded with the composer-critic Leigh Henry over the music of Igor Stravinsky . In a letter dated 17 July 1919 ,  Delius advised the younger man to concentrate either on writing or composing :  """"I  .  .  .  know how gifted you are and what possibilities are in you"""" . Heseltine had long nurtured a scheme to launch a music magazine ,  which he intended to start as soon as he found appropriate backing .  In April 1920 ,  Rogers decided to replace his semi-moribund magazine The Organist and Choirmaster ,  with a new music journal ,  The Sackbut ,  and invited Heseltine to edit it . With no regular income ,  in the autumn of 1921 Heseltine returned to Cefn Bryntalch ,  which became his base for the next three years .  He found the atmosphere there conducive to creative efforts ;  he told Gray that """"Wild Wales holds an enchantment for me stronger than wine or woman"""" . Heseltine's major literary work of this period was a biography of Delius ,  the first full-length study of the composer ,  which remained the standard work for many years . While visiting Budapest in April 1921 ,  Heseltine befriended the then little-known Hungarian composer and pianist Béla Bartók .  When Bartók visited Wales in March 1922 to perform in a concert ,  he stayed for a few days at Cefn Bryntalch .  Although Heseltine continued to promote Bartók's music ,  there are no records of further meetings after the Wales visit . In September and October 1923 Heseltine accompanied his fellow-composer E . J .  Moeran on a tour of eastern England ,  in search of original folk music .  Later that year he and Gray visited Delius at Grez . At Eynsford ,  with Moeran as his co-tenant ,  Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists ,  musicians and friends .

*** "*page_ Horacio_Quiroga" "*cat_ Suicides_in_Argentina" " Horacio Quiroga was born in the city of Salto in 1878 as the sixth child and second son of Prudencio Quiroga and Pastora Forteza ,  a middle-class family .  At the time of his birth ,  his father had been working for 18 years as head of the Argentine Vice-Consulate .  Before Quiroga was two and a half months old ,  on March 14 ,  1879 ,  his father accidentally fired a gun he was carrying in his hands and died as a result .   Quiroga was baptized three months later in the parish church of his native town . Quiroga finished school in Montevideo ,  the capital of Uruguay .  He studied at the National College and also attended the Polytechnic Institute of Montevideo for technical training .  From a very young age ,  he showed great interest in a variety of subjects and activities including literature ,  chemistry ,  photography ,  mechanics ,  cycling and country life .  Around this time he founded the Salto Cycling Club and achieved the remarkable feat of cycling from his home town to Paysandú ,  a distance of 120 kilometres (74½ miles)It was also around this time that he worked in a machinery repair shop ;  under the influence of the owner's son he became interested in philosophy ,  describing himself as a """"forthright and passionate foot soldier of materialism . """"At the age of 22 ,  Quiroga became interested in poetry ,  discovering the work of Leopoldo Lugones ,  with whom he would later become great friends ,  and of Edgar Allan Poe .  This led him to dabble in various forms and styles of poetic expression himself :  post-romanticism ,  symbolism and modernism .  He soon began to publish his poems in his home town .  While studying and working ,  he collaborated with publications such as La Revista and La Reforma ,  improving his style and making a name for himself . During the Carnival of 1898 ,  the young poet met his first love ,  a girl named Mary Esther Jurkovski ,  who would inspire two of his most important works :  Las sacrificadas (1920 ;  The Slaughtered) and Una estación de amor (1912 ;  A Season of Love) .  However ,  the young girl's Jewish parents disapproved of the relationship on the grounds that Quiroga was a Gentile ,  and the couple were forced to separate . In his home town ,  he founded a magazine titled Revista de Salto (1899) .   In the same year ,  his stepfather committed suicide by shooting himself ;  Quiroga witnessed the death .  With the money he received as inheritance he embarked on a four-month trip to Paris ,  which turned out to be a failure :  he returned to Uruguay hungry and disheartened . On his return Quiroga gathered together his friends Federico Ferrando ,  Alberto Brignole ,  Julio Jaureche ,  Fernández Saldaña ,  José Hasda and Asdrúbal Delgado ,  and with them founded the Consistorio del Gay Saber (The Consistory of The Gay Science) ,  a literary laboratory for their experimental writing ,  in which they found new ways to express themselves and their modernist goals .  In 1901 Quiroga published his first book ,  Los Arrecifes de Coral (Coral Reefs) ,  but the achievement was overshadowed by the deaths of two of his siblings ,  Prudencio and Pastora ,  who were victims of typhoid fever in Chaco .  That fateful year held yet another shocking event in store for Quiroga .   His friend Federico Ferrando had received bad reviews from Germán Papini ,  a Montevideo journalist ,  and challenged him to a duel .  Quiroga ,  anxious about his friend's safety ,  offered to check and clean the gun that was to be used .   While inspecting the weapon ,  he accidentally fired off a shot that hit Ferrando in the mouth ,  killing him instantly .  When the police arrived ,  Quiroga was arrested ,  interrogated and transferred to a correctional prison .  The police investigated the circumstances of the homicide and deemed Ferrando's death an accident ;  Quiroga was released after four days' detention .  He was eventually exonerated of blame . Racked with grief and guilt over the death of his beloved friend ,  Quiroga dissolved The Consistory and moved from Uruguay to Argentina .  He crossed the Río de la Plata in 1902 and went to live with María ,  one of his sisters .   In Buenos Aires Quiroga the artist reached professional maturity ,  which would come to full fruition during his stays in the jungle .  His sister's husband also introduced him to pedagogy and found him work as a teacher under contract to the board of examination for the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires .  He was appointed professor of Castilian at the British School of Buenos Aires in March 1903 . In June of that year Quiroga ,  already an experienced photographer ,  accompanied Leopoldo Lugones on an expedition ,  funded by the Argentine Ministry of Education ,  in which the famous Argentine poet planned to investigate some ruins of Jesuit missions in the province of Misiones .  The jungle of Misiones left a profound impression on Quiroga that marked his life forever :  he spent six months and the last of his inheritance (seven thousand pesos) on some land for cotton in Chaco province ,  located seven kilometers from Resistencia ,  next to the Saladito River .  The project failed ,  due to problems with his aboriginal workers ,  but Quiroga's life was enriched by experiencing life as a countryman for the first time .  His narrative benefited from his new knowledge of country people and rural culture ;  this permanently changed his style . Upon returning to Buenos Aires after his failed experience in the Chaco ,  Quiroga embraced the short story with passion and energy .  In 1904 he published a book of stories called The Crime of Another ,  which was heavily influenced by the style of Edgar Allan Poe .  Quiroga did not mind these early comparisons with Poe ,   and until the end of his life ,  he would often say that Poe was his first and principal teacher . Quiroga worked for the next two years on a multitude of stories ,  many were about rural terror ,  but others were delightful stories for children .  During this time he wrote the magnificent horror story ,  """"The Feather Pillow"""" .  It was published in 1907 by a famous magazine in Argentina ,  Caras y Caretas (""""Faces and Masks"""") ,  which went on to publish eight of his other stories that year .  Shortly after it was published ,  Quiroga became famous and his writings were eagerly sought by thousands of readers . In 1906 Quiroga decided to return to his beloved jungle .  Taking advantage of the fact that the government wanted the land to be used ,  Quiroga bought a farm (with Vincent Gozalbo) of 185 hectares (460 acres) in the province of Misiones ,  on the banks of the Upper Parana ,  and began making preparations ,  while teaching Castilian and Literature nearby .  He moved in during the winter of 1908 . Quiroga fell in love with one of his teenage students ,  Ana María Cires ,  to whom he would dedicate his first novel ,  entitled  History of a Troubled Love .  Quiroga insisted on the relationship despite the opposition of her parents ,  eventually garnering their permission to marry her and take her to live in the jungle with him .  Quiroga's parents-in-law were concerned about the risks of living in Misiones ,  a wild region ,  and that is why they decided to join their daughter and son-in-law ,  and live close by in order to help them .  So ,  Ana María's parents and a friend of her mother moved into a house near Quiroga . In 1911 ,  Ana María gave birth to the couple's first child ,  at their home in the jungle ;  they named her Eglé Quiroga .  During the same year ,  the writer began farming in partnership with his friend ,  fellow Uruguayan Vicente Gozalbo ,  and he was also appointed Justice of the Peace in the Civil Registry of San Ignacio .  This job was not the best fit for Quiroga who ,  forgetful ,  disorganized and careless ,  took to the habit of jotting down deaths ,  marriages and births on small pieces of paper and """"archiving"""" them in a cookie tin .  Later ,  a character in one of his stories was given a similar trait . The following year Ana María gave birth to a son ,  named Darío .  Quiroga decided ,  just as the children were learning to walk ,  that he would personally take care of their education .  Stern and dictatorial ,  Quiroga demanded that every little detail be done according to his requirements .  From a young age ,  his children got used to the mountains and jungle .  Quiroga exposed them to danger so that they would be able to cope alone and overcome any situation .  He even went as far as to leave them alone one night in the jungle ;  another time he made them sit on the edge of a cliff with their legs dangling into the void .  His daughter learned to breed wild animals and the son to use a shotgun ,  ride a bike and travel alone in a canoe .  Quiroga's children never objected to these experiences and actually enjoyed them .  Their mother ,  however ,  was terrified and exasperated by her husband's eccentric ways .  Elements of this upbringing appear in his short story ,  """"Hijo , """" (""""Son"""") written in 1935 and included in his collection Más allá . Between 1912 and 1915 the writer ,  who already had experience as a cotton farmer and herbalist ,  undertook a bold pursuit to increase the farming and maximize the natural resources of their lands .  He began to distill oranges and produce coal and resins ,  as well as many other similar activities .  Meanwhile ,  he raised livestock ,  domesticated wild animals ,  hunted ,  and fished .  Literature continued to be the peak of his life :  in the journal Fray Mocho de Buenos Aires Quiroga published numerous stories ,  many set in the jungle and populated by characters so naturalistic that they seemed real . But Quiroga's wife was not happy :  although she had become well-adapted to life in the jungle ,  the relationship between her and her husband was fraught with discord .  Clashes between the couple occurred frequently ,  and although the cause was usually trivial ,  their excessive arguments became daily setbacks .  These incidences ,  accentuated by Quiroga's volatile nature ,  disturbed his wife so greatly that she became severely depressed .  Ana María became a new tragedy in Quiroga's life when ,  after a violent fight with the writer ,  she ingested a fatal dose of """"sublimado , """" or Mercury(II) chloride .  Unfortunately ,  the poison did not kill her instantly ;  instead ,  she was forced to endure terrible agony for eight days before finally dying in her husband's arms on December 14 ,  1915 .  The tragedy of Ana María's painful death plunged Quiroga and his two children ,  five-year-old Eglé and four-year-old Darío ,  into dark despair . After this tragedy ,  Quiroga quickly left for Buenos Aires with his children where he became an Under-Secretary-General Accountant in the Uruguayan Consulate ,  thanks to the efforts of some of his friends who wanted to help .  Throughout the year 1917 Quiroga lived in a basement with his children on Avenue Canning ,  alternating his diplomatic work with setting up a home office and working on many stories ,  which were being published in prestigious magazines .  Quiroga collected most of the stories in several books ,  the first was  Tales of Love ,  Madness and Death  (1917) .  Manuel Galvez ,  owner of a publishing firm ,  had suggested that he write it and the volume immediately became a huge success with audiences and critics ,  consolidating Quiroga as the true master of the Latin American short story . The following year he settled in a small apartment on Calle Agüero ,  while he published Jungle Tales (1918 ,  a collection of children's stories featuring animals and set in the Misiones rainforest) .  Quiroga dedicated this book to his children ,  who accompanied him during that rough period of poverty in the damp basement . 1919 was a good year for Quiroga ,  with two major promotions in the consular ranks and the publication of his new book of stories ,  The Wild .  The next year ,  following the idea of """"The Consistory"""" ,  Quiroga founded the Anaconda Association ,  a group of intellectuals involved in cultural activities in Argentina and Uruguay .  His only play ,   The Slaughtered ,  was published in 1920 and was released in 1921 ,  when  Anaconda  was released (another book of short stories) .  An important Argentine newspaper ,  La Nación (The Nation) ,  also began to publish his stories ,  which by now already enjoyed impressive popularity .  Between 1922 and 1924 ,  Quiroga served as secretary of a cultural embassy to Brazil and he published his new book :   The Desert  (stories) . For a while the writer was devoted to film criticism ,  taking charge of the magazine section of """"Atlantis ,  The Home and The Nation"""" .  He also wrote the screenplay for a feature film (The Florida Raft) that was never filmed .  Shortly thereafter ,  he was invited to form a School of Cinematography by Russian investors ,  but it was unsuccessful . Quiroga then returned to Misiones .  He was in love again ,  this time with a 22-year-old Ana María Palacio .  He tried to persuade her parents to let her go to live in the jungle with him .  Palacio's parents' unrelenting rejection of this idea and the consequent failure of the relationship inspired the theme of his second novel ,   Past love (published later ,  in 1929) .  The novel contains autobiographical elements of the strategies he used himself to get the girl ,  such as leaving messages in a hollowed branch ,  sending letters written in code and trying to dig a long tunnel to her room with thoughts of kidnapping her .  Finally ,  the parents grew tired of Quiroga's attempts and took her away so he was forced to renounce his love . In the workshop in his house ,  he built a boat he christened Gaviota .  His home was on the water and he used the boat to go from San Ignacio downriver to Buenos Aires and on numerous river expeditions . In early 1926 ,  Quiroga returned to Buenos Aires and rented a villa in a suburban area .  At the height of his popularity ,  a major publisher honored him ,  along with other literary figures of the time such as Arturo Capdevila ,  Baldomero Fernandez Moreno ,  Benito Lynch ,  Juana de Ibarbourou ,  Armando Donoso and Luis Franco . A lover of classical music ,  Quiroga often attended the concerts of the Wagner Association .  He also tirelessly read technical texts ,  manuals on mechanics ,  and books on arts and physics . In 1927 ,  Quiroga decided to raise and domesticate wild animals ,  while publishing his new book of short stories ,   Exiles .  But the amorous artist had already set his eyes on what would be his last love :  María Elena Bravo ,  a classmate of his daughter Eglé ,  who married him that year ,  not even 20 years old (He was 49) . In 1932 Quiroga again settled in Misiones ,  where he would retire ,  with his wife and third daughter (María Elena ,  called Pitoca ,  who was born in 1928) .  To do this ,  he got a decree transferring his consular office to a nearby city .  He was devoted to living quietly in the jungle with his wife and daughter . Due to a change of government ,  his services were declined and he was expelled from the consulate .  To exacerbate Quiroga's problems ,  his wife did not like living in the jungle ,  so fighting and violent discussions became a daily occurrence . In this time of frustration and pain he published a collection of short stories titled Beyond (1935) .  From his interest in the work of Munthe and Ibsen ,  Quiroga began reading new authors and styles and began planning his autobiography . In 1935 Quiroga began to experience uncomfortable symptoms ,  apparently related to prostatitis or another prostate disease .   With the pain intensifying and difficulty urinating ,  his wife managed to convince him to go to Posadas ,  where he was diagnosed with prostate hypertrophy . But the problems continued for the Quiroga family :  his wife and daughter left him permanently ,  leaving him alone and sick in the jungle .  They went back to Buenos Aires ,  and the writer's spirits fell completely in the face of this serious loss .  When he could not stand the disease anymore ,  Quiroga traveled to Buenos Aires for treatment .  In 1937 ,  an exploratory surgery revealed that he suffered from an advanced case of prostate cancer ,  untreatable and inoperable .  María Elena and his large group of friends came to comfort him . When Quiroga was in the emergency ward ,  he had learned that a patient was shut up in the basement with hideous deformities similar to those of the infamous English Joseph Merrick (the """"Elephant Man"""") .  Taking pity ,  Quiroga demanded that the patient ,  named Vicent Batistessa ,  be released from confinement and moved into his room .  As expected ,  Batistessa befriended and paid eternal gratitude to the great storyteller . Feeling desperate about his present suffering and realizing that his life was over ,  he told Batistessa his plan to shorten his suffering and Batistessa promised to help .  That morning (February 19 ,  1937) in the presence of his friend ,  Horacio Quiroga drank a glass of cyanide that killed him within minutes of unbearable pain .  His body was buried in the grounds of the Casa del Teatro de la Sociedad Argentina de Escritores (SADE) ,  of which he was the founder and vice-president ,  although his remains were later repatriated to his homeland .     "
*** "*page_ Horacio_Quiroga" "*cat_ Suicides_in_Argentina" " Horacio Quiroga was born in the city of Salto in 1878 as the sixth child and second son of Prudencio Quiroga and Pastora Forteza ,  a middle-class family .  At the time of his birth ,  his father had been working for 18 years as head of the Argentine Vice-Consulate .  Before Quiroga was two and a half months old ,  on March 14 ,  1879 ,  his father accidentally fired a gun he was carrying in his hands and died as a result .   Quiroga was baptized three months later in the parish church of his native town . Quiroga finished school in Montevideo ,  the capital of Uruguay .  He studied at the National College and also attended the Polytechnic Institute of Montevideo for technical training .  From a very young age ,  he showed great interest in a variety of subjects and activities including literature ,  chemistry ,  photography ,  mechanics ,  cycling and country life .  Around this time he founded the Salto Cycling Club and achieved the remarkable feat of cycling from his home town to Paysandú ,  a distance of 120 kilometres (74½ miles)It was also around this time that he worked in a machinery repair shop ;  under the influence of the owner's son he became interested in philosophy ,  describing himself as a """"forthright and passionate foot soldier of materialism . """"At the age of 22 ,  Quiroga became interested in poetry ,  discovering the work of Leopoldo Lugones ,  with whom he would later become great friends ,  and of Edgar Allan Poe .  This led him to dabble in various forms and styles of poetic expression himself :  post-romanticism ,  symbolism and modernism .  He soon began to publish his poems in his home town .  While studying and working ,  he collaborated with publications such as La Revista and La Reforma ,  improving his style and making a name for himself . During the Carnival of 1898 ,  the young poet met his first love ,  a girl named Mary Esther Jurkovski ,  who would inspire two of his most important works :  Las sacrificadas (1920 ;  The Slaughtered) and Una estación de amor (1912 ;  A Season of Love) .  However ,  the young girl's Jewish parents disapproved of the relationship on the grounds that Quiroga was a Gentile ,  and the couple were forced to separate . In his home town ,  he founded a magazine titled Revista de Salto (1899) .   In the same year ,  his stepfather committed suicide by shooting himself ;  Quiroga witnessed the death .  With the money he received as inheritance he embarked on a four-month trip to Paris ,  which turned out to be a failure :  he returned to Uruguay hungry and disheartened . On his return Quiroga gathered together his friends Federico Ferrando ,  Alberto Brignole ,  Julio Jaureche ,  Fernández Saldaña ,  José Hasda and Asdrúbal Delgado ,  and with them founded the Consistorio del Gay Saber (The Consistory of The Gay Science) ,  a literary laboratory for their experimental writing ,  in which they found new ways to express themselves and their modernist goals .  In 1901 Quiroga published his first book ,  Los Arrecifes de Coral (Coral Reefs) ,  but the achievement was overshadowed by the deaths of two of his siblings ,  Prudencio and Pastora ,  who were victims of typhoid fever in Chaco .  That fateful year held yet another shocking event in store for Quiroga .   His friend Federico Ferrando had received bad reviews from Germán Papini ,  a Montevideo journalist ,  and challenged him to a duel .  Quiroga ,  anxious about his friend's safety ,  offered to check and clean the gun that was to be used .   While inspecting the weapon ,  he accidentally fired off a shot that hit Ferrando in the mouth ,  killing him instantly .  When the police arrived ,  Quiroga was arrested ,  interrogated and transferred to a correctional prison .  The police investigated the circumstances of the homicide and deemed Ferrando's death an accident ;  Quiroga was released after four days' detention .  He was eventually exonerated of blame . Racked with grief and guilt over the death of his beloved friend ,  Quiroga dissolved The Consistory and moved from Uruguay to Argentina .  He crossed the Río de la Plata in 1902 and went to live with María ,  one of his sisters .   In Buenos Aires Quiroga the artist reached professional maturity ,  which would come to full fruition during his stays in the jungle .  His sister's husband also introduced him to pedagogy and found him work as a teacher under contract to the board of examination for the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires .  He was appointed professor of Castilian at the British School of Buenos Aires in March 1903 . In June of that year Quiroga ,  already an experienced photographer ,  accompanied Leopoldo Lugones on an expedition ,  funded by the Argentine Ministry of Education ,  in which the famous Argentine poet planned to investigate some ruins of Jesuit missions in the province of Misiones .  The jungle of Misiones left a profound impression on Quiroga that marked his life forever :  he spent six months and the last of his inheritance (seven thousand pesos) on some land for cotton in Chaco province ,  located seven kilometers from Resistencia ,  next to the Saladito River .  The project failed ,  due to problems with his aboriginal workers ,  but Quiroga's life was enriched by experiencing life as a countryman for the first time .  His narrative benefited from his new knowledge of country people and rural culture ;  this permanently changed his style . Upon returning to Buenos Aires after his failed experience in the Chaco ,  Quiroga embraced the short story with passion and energy .  In 1904 he published a book of stories called The Crime of Another ,  which was heavily influenced by the style of Edgar Allan Poe .  Quiroga did not mind these early comparisons with Poe ,   and until the end of his life ,  he would often say that Poe was his first and principal teacher . Quiroga worked for the next two years on a multitude of stories ,  many were about rural terror ,  but others were delightful stories for children .  During this time he wrote the magnificent horror story ,  """"The Feather Pillow"""" .  It was published in 1907 by a famous magazine in Argentina ,  Caras y Caretas (""""Faces and Masks"""") ,  which went on to publish eight of his other stories that year .  Shortly after it was published ,  Quiroga became famous and his writings were eagerly sought by thousands of readers . In 1906 Quiroga decided to return to his beloved jungle .  Taking advantage of the fact that the government wanted the land to be used ,  Quiroga bought a farm (with Vincent Gozalbo) of 185 hectares (460 acres) in the province of Misiones ,  on the banks of the Upper Parana ,  and began making preparations ,  while teaching Castilian and Literature nearby .  He moved in during the winter of 1908 . Quiroga fell in love with one of his teenage students ,  Ana María Cires ,  to whom he would dedicate his first novel ,  entitled  History of a Troubled Love .  Quiroga insisted on the relationship despite the opposition of her parents ,  eventually garnering their permission to marry her and take her to live in the jungle with him .  Quiroga's parents-in-law were concerned about the risks of living in Misiones ,  a wild region ,  and that is why they decided to join their daughter and son-in-law ,  and live close by in order to help them .  So ,  Ana María's parents and a friend of her mother moved into a house near Quiroga . In 1911 ,  Ana María gave birth to the couple's first child ,  at their home in the jungle ;  they named her Eglé Quiroga .  During the same year ,  the writer began farming in partnership with his friend ,  fellow Uruguayan Vicente Gozalbo ,  and he was also appointed Justice of the Peace in the Civil Registry of San Ignacio .  This job was not the best fit for Quiroga who ,  forgetful ,  disorganized and careless ,  took to the habit of jotting down deaths ,  marriages and births on small pieces of paper and """"archiving"""" them in a cookie tin .  Later ,  a character in one of his stories was given a similar trait . The following year Ana María gave birth to a son ,  named Darío .  Quiroga decided ,  just as the children were learning to walk ,  that he would personally take care of their education .  Stern and dictatorial ,  Quiroga demanded that every little detail be done according to his requirements .  From a young age ,  his children got used to the mountains and jungle .  Quiroga exposed them to danger so that they would be able to cope alone and overcome any situation .  He even went as far as to leave them alone one night in the jungle ;  another time he made them sit on the edge of a cliff with their legs dangling into the void .

Through her writing ,  she tried to synthesize translated mystic literature and traditions from many cultures into a scholarly ,  distilled whole .  As a freethinker ,  she was elected Secretary of the Philadelphia chapter of the American Secular Union in 1889 .  Her mother responded by threatening to burn Craddock's papers ,  and unsuccessfully tried to have her institutionalized . Craddock moved to Chicago ,  and opened a Dearborn Street office offering """"mystical"""" sexual counseling to married couples via both walk-in counseling and mail order .   She dedicated her time to """"preventing sexual evils and sufferings"""" by educating adults ,  achieving national notoriety with her editorials in defense of Little Egypt and her controversial belly dancing act at the World's Columbian Exposition held in Chicago during 1893 .

Stevens appeared on television series ,  in commercials ,  and in plays until she received her big break in the film Man on Fire ,  starring Bing Crosby . Roles in major films followed ,  including a starring role opposite Harry Belafonte in 1959's The World ,  the Flesh and the Devil ,  but she achieved her greatest success in the television series The Farmer's Daughter (1963–1966) ,  with William Windom .  Previously ,  Stevens had appeared in episodes of Bonanza ,  Route 66 ,  The Alfred Hitchcock Hour ,  The Eleventh Hour ,  Sam Benedict and The Twilight Zone .

On the morning of April 30 ,  1970 ,  Stevens's sometime roommate and companion ,  Lola McNally ,  found her on the kitchen floor of her Hollywood Hills home .  According to McNally ,  when she called Stevens's name ,  she opened her eyes ,  lifted her head ,  and tried to speak ,  but was unable to make any sound .  McNally told police that she had spoken to Stevens the previous night and had seen no sign of trouble .  Stevens died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital .  On arrival ,  medics removed a small bandage from her chin that revealed a small amount of fresh blood oozing from a cut which appeared to have been a few hours old .

She was three or four years old and the family was just as upset about that as about the unusual name she was given .  Mama read the name in a book and that was that ;  as she would always say .  Mama was always being different ,  the family used to say ,  and who has a child christened in a garden? Ingrid wore a pretty white dress and there were cakes and tea and many people .

After the Jonker family left ,  Ingrid's friends threw flowers into the grave .  Cope tossed in a wreath of wild olive that he had picked on the slope above Clifton . André Brink chose not to attend the funeral ,  as he felt it would turn what deserved to be a private event into a public spectacle .

*** "*page_ Zhangsun_Wuji" "*cat_ Suicides_in_China" " It is not known when Zhangsun Wuji was born ,  but what is known is that he was older than his sister ,  the future Empress Zhangsun ,  who was born in 601 .   It was written that his ancestors traced their origin to the Xianbei dynasty Northern Wei's founding emperor Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei's 17th generation ancestor Tuoba Kuaili (拓拔儈立) — that their ancestor was Tuoba Kuali's third son ,  who took the surname Baba (拔拔) ,  eventually changed to Zhangsun when Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei changed Xianbei surnames to Han surnames in 496 . His father was the Sui Dynasty general Zhangsun Sheng (長孫晟) ,  and his mother was Zhangsun Sheng's wife Lady Gao ,  the daughter of the official Gao Jingde (高敬德) .   He had at least three older brothers—Zhangsun Sheng's oldest son Zhangsun Xingbu (長孫行布 ,  who was killed in 604 while resisting the rebellion of Emperor Yang of Sui's brother Yang Liang the Prince of Han) ,  Zhangsun Heng'an (長孫恆安) ,  and Zhangsun Anye (長孫安業) .   (Empress Zhangsun was also born of Lady Gao ,  while Zhangsun Anye was not ;  who Zhangsun Xingbu's and Zhangsun Heng'an's mothers were was not recorded in history . )  Zhangsun Sheng died in 609 ,  and Zhangsun Anye ,  instead of raising his younger brother and sister ,  expelled them ,  as well as his stepmother Lady Gao ,  from the Zhangsun household and sent them back to Lady Gao's brother Gao Shilian ,  and Gao Shilian raised them . It was said that Zhangsun Wuji was studious ,  and that he was both intelligent and full of strategies .   When his sister later married Li Shimin ,  the second son of the general Li Yuan ,  he and Li Shimin became great friends .   When Li Yuan ,  at Li Shimin's instigation ,  rose against the rule of Emperor Yang of Sui in 617 and attacked the capital Chang'an ,  Zhangsun Wuji went to meet Li Shimin ,  then serving as a major general of his father's ,  and he began to serve on Li Shimin's staff ,  often following Li Shimin on various campaigns .    By the beginning of 657 ,  the power of Empress Wu and her allies was so great that they began to retaliate hard against the authorities who opposed them .  By 659 ,  Empress Wu's position was secure ,  and she resented how Zhangsun and Yu had shown implicit disapproval of her ascension—and Xu ,  who had been repeatedly rebuked by Zhangsun over this matter ,  also resented Zhangsun .   Xu thereafter ,  when investigating a report of factionalism by the low level officials Wei Jifang (韋季方) and Li Chao (李巢) ,  manufactured evidence that Zhangsun had plotted treason with them .   Emperor Gaozong wanted to interrogate Zhangsun personally ,  but at Xu's suggestion—pointing out that Zhangsun had been experienced at quick reactions as demonstrated by his achievements—in summer 659 ,  suddenly stripped Zhangsun's posts and fief ,  and while he officially gave Zhangsun the title of commandant at Yang Prefecture ,  he instead exiled Zhangsun to Qian Prefecture (黔州 ,  modern southeastern Chongqing) under house arrest .   Zhangsun's sons were also exiled .   In fall 659 ,  Emperor Gaozong further reopened the investigations ,  putting Li Ji ,  Xu ,  Xin Maojiang ,  Ren Yaxiang ,  and Lu Chengqing in charge of investigating the alleged plot .   Xu took this opportunity to send Yuan Gongyu to Qian Prefecture ,  where Yuan by order of Empress Wu forced Zhangsun to commit suicide .   His wealth was confiscated .   (As part of the same reprisal transactions ,  Empress Wang's uncle Liu Shi was also executed in exile .   Members of the Zhangsun and Liu households ,  as well as those of Han's ,  were forced to hard labor ,  while several relatives of Zhangsun's were also executed . )  Later in Emperor Gaozong's reign ,  in 674 ,  Emperor Gaozong restored Zhangsun's titles posthumously and allowed Zhangsun's great-grandson Zhangsun Yi (長孫翼) to inherit the title of Duke of Zhao .   He also had Zhangsun's casket returned to Chang'an ,  to be buried near Emperor Taizong's tomb .  "

*** "*page_ B._S._Johnson" "*cat_ Suicides_in_London" " Johnson was born into a working-class family ,  the only child of a bookseller's stock-keeper ,  Stanley Wilfred Johnson (1908–1973) ,  and a waitress-cum-barmaid ,  Emily Jane (1908–1971 ,  née Lambird) ,  of Hammersmith ,  London . Johnson was evacuated from London twice during the war .  Having been educated at Flora Gardens Primary School ,  Hammersmith ,  he and his mother were moved to Chobham ,  Surrey in 1937 for two years ,  and he attended the village school .  After a brief return to Hammersmith ,  he was sent alone in 1941 to High Wycombe ,  Buckinghamshire ,  where he attended a local school .  Having failed the eleven plus examination ,  he was unable to enter Latymer School at Hammersmith and spent the last year of the war at Highfields Secondary Modern School .  On his return home ,  he attended Barnes County Secondary Modern School ,  before """"passing some sort of simple examination"""" allowing him to transfer to Kingston Day Commercial School ,  where """"they taught me shorthand ,  typing ,  and bookkeeping .  Useful . """" . Johnson left school at 16 to work variously as an accounting clerk for a building company and for a baker ,  as a bank junior and as a clerk at Standard Oil ,  but taught himself Latin in the evenings ,  attended a year's pre-university course at Birkbeck College ,  and with this preparation ,  managed to pass the university entrance exam for King's College London in 1956 .   After graduating with a 2 : 2 degree in 1959 ,  he worked as a private tutor and supply teacher in Surrey ,  while writing increasingly experimental and often acutely personal novels .  In his early years he collaborated on several projects with a close friend and fellow writer ,  Zulfikar Ghose ,  with whom he produced a joint collection of stories ,  Statement Against Corpses .  Like Johnson's early stories ,  at least superficially ,  his first two novels ,  Travelling People (1963) and Albert Angelo (1964) initially appear relatively conventional in plot terms .  However ,  the first uses several innovative devices and includes a section set out as a film script .  The second includes famously cut-through pages to enable the reader to skip forward .  His work became progressively even more experimental .  The Unfortunates (1969) was published in a box with no binding (readers could assemble the book any way they liked ,  apart from the chapters marked """"First"""" and """"Last"""" ,  which indicated preferred terminal points .  BBC producer Lorna Pegram employed him to talk about this creation for the TV series Release .  With barely any negotiation ,  the interview was complete months before the book was ready for publication .  He won the Eric Gregory Award in 1962 and the Somerset Maugham Award in 1967 . Johnson led and associated with a loose circle of experimental authors in 1960s Britain ,  who included Alan Burns ,  Eva Figes ,  Rayner Heppenstall ,  Ann Quin ,  Stefan Themerson ,  Wilson Harris and others .  Many contributed to London Consequences ,  a novel consisting of a palimpsest of chapters passed between a range of participating authors ,  edited by Margaret Drabble and Johnson .  Johnson also made numerous experimental films ,  published poetry ,  and wrote reviews ,  short stories and plays .  For some years he was poetry editor of Transatlantic Review . He is mentioned several times in Paul Theroux's account of his friendship with V .  S .  Naipaul ,  Sir Vidia's Shadow (1998) .   "

Johnson left school at 16 to work variously as an accounting clerk for a building company and for a baker ,  as a bank junior and as a clerk at Standard Oil ,  but taught himself Latin in the evenings ,  attended a year's pre-university course at Birkbeck College ,  and with this preparation ,  managed to pass the university entrance exam for King's College London in 1956 .   After graduating with a 2 : 2 degree in 1959 ,  he worked as a private tutor and supply teacher in Surrey ,  while writing increasingly experimental and often acutely personal novels .  In his early years he collaborated on several projects with a close friend and fellow writer ,  Zulfikar Ghose ,  with whom he produced a joint collection of stories ,  Statement Against Corpses .  Like Johnson's early stories ,  at least superficially ,  his first two novels ,  Travelling People (1963) and Albert Angelo (1964) initially appear relatively conventional in plot terms .  However ,  the first uses several innovative devices and includes a section set out as a film script .  The second includes famously cut-through pages to enable the reader to skip forward .  His work became progressively even more experimental .  The Unfortunates (1969) was published in a box with no binding (readers could assemble the book any way they liked ,  apart from the chapters marked """"First"""" and """"Last"""" ,  which indicated preferred terminal points .  BBC producer Lorna Pegram employed him to talk about this creation for the TV series Release .  With barely any negotiation ,  the interview was complete months before the book was ready for publication .  He won the Eric Gregory Award in 1962 and the Somerset Maugham Award in 1967 . Johnson led and associated with a loose circle of experimental authors in 1960s Britain ,  who included Alan Burns ,  Eva Figes ,  Rayner Heppenstall ,  Ann Quin ,  Stefan Themerson ,  Wilson Harris and others .  Many contributed to London Consequences ,  a novel consisting of a palimpsest of chapters passed between a range of participating authors ,  edited by Margaret Drabble and Johnson .  Johnson also made numerous experimental films ,  published poetry ,  and wrote reviews ,  short stories and plays .  For some years he was poetry editor of Transatlantic Review . He is mentioned several times in Paul Theroux's account of his friendship with V .  S .  Naipaul ,  Sir Vidia's Shadow (1998) .   "

*** "*page_ Robert_Hope-Jones" "*cat_ Suicides_by_gas" " Jones was born in Hooton ,  Cheshire ,  to William and Agnes Hope-Jones .  He was one of nine children . When fifteen he became voluntary organist and choir-master to the Birkenhead School Chapel .  Two or three years later he simultaneously held a similar office at St Luke's Church ,  Tranmere ,  where he trained a boy choir that became widely celebrated .  For this church he bought and set up a fine organ .  He subsequently served as churchwarden and was active in many other church offices .  He erected an organ in the Claughton Music Hall and organized and conducted oratorio performances in aid of various church funds ,  training a large voluntary chorus and orchestra for the purpose .  For psalms ,  whose verses are arranged in groups of three ,  he wrote what he called """"triple chants"""" ,  a form of composition later adopted by other church writers ;  he also composed canticles ,  kyries and other music for the services of the church . He became choirmaster and honorary organist of St John's Church ,  Birkenhead ,  doing similar work in connection with that institution .  It was at this church and in connection with this organ that Hope-Jones did his first great work in connection with organ-building .  The improved electric action ,  movable console and many other matters destined to startle the organ world ,  were devised and made by him there ,  after the day's business and the evening's choir rehearsals .  He had voluntary help from choirmen and boys ,  who worked far into the night ,  certain of these men and boys later occupying positions with the Hope-Jones Organ Company . As a child ,  he was sickly and was privately tutored .  He was sent to the South of France annually to improve his health . In connection with telephony he invented a multitude of improvements ,  some of which were later in universal use .  About this time he devised a method for increasing the power of the human voice ,  through the application of a relay furnished with compressed air .  The principle was later utilized in phonographs and other voice-producing machines .  He also invented the diaphone ,  later used by the Canadian Government for its fog signal stations and ,  in a modified form ,  also adapted to the church organ . About 1889 ,  he resigned from the telephone company to devote himself to improving the church organ ,  a subject which had occupied much of his spare time for years . When he became a rival and a competitor to those who had previously profited from his inventions ,  they became hostile and abusive .  For nearly twenty years he met concerted opposition – attacks in turn against his electrical knowledge ,  musical taste ,  voicing ability ,  financial standing ,  and personal character . Hope-Jones built more than 100 church organs in the United Kingdom before emigrating to the United States .    In 1914 ,  Hope-Jones committed suicide ,  age 55 ,  by inhaling gas fumes in a hotel in Rochester ,  New York ,  some months after leaving the Wurlitzer company .  He had written a suicide note stating that he had legal trouble and that a suit was pending .  This however was not the case and as a result the coroner declared his death """"suicide while insane .

*** "*page_ Jules_Pascin" "*cat_ Artists_who_committed_suicide" " Julius Mordecai Pincas was born in Vidin ,  Bulgaria ,  the eighth of eleven children , In December 1905 ,  Pascin moved to Paris becoming part of the great migration of artists to that city at the start of the 20th century .  In 1907 he met Hermine Lionette Cartan David ,  also a painter ,  and they became lovers .  In that same year he had his first solo exhibition at Paul Cassirer Gallery in Berlin . Pascin relocated to London at the outbreak of World War I to avoid service in the Bulgarian army and left for the United States on October 3 ,  1914 .  On October 31 ,  Hermine David sailed for the United States to join him .   Like Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec ,  Pascin drew upon his surroundings and his friends ,  both male and female ,  as subjects .  During the 1920s ,  Pascin mostly painted fragile petites filles ,  prostitutes waiting for clients ,  or models waiting for the sitting to end .  His fleetingly rendered paintings sold readily ,  but the money he made was quickly spent .  Famous as the host of numerous large parties in his flat ,  whenever he was invited elsewhere for dinner ,  he arrived with as many bottles of wine as he could carry .  He frequently led a large group of friends on summer picnics beside the River Marne ,  where their excursions lasted all afternoon . According to his biographer ,  Georges Charensol : Scarcely had he chosen his table at the Dôme or the Sélect than he would be surrounded by five or six friends ;  at nine o'clock ,  when we got up to dinner ,  we would be 20 in all ,  and later in the evening ,  when we decided to go up to Montmartre to Charlotte Gardelle's or the Princess Marfa's—where Pascin loved to take the place of the drummer in the jazz band—he had to provide for 10 taxis . Among Pascin's circle of Parisian friends was Ernest Hemingway ,  whose memoir A Moveable Feast includes a chapter titled """"With Pascin At the Dôme"""" ,  which recounts a night in 1923 when he met Pascin and two of his young models for drinks at the café .  Pascin struggled with depression and alcoholism .   """"On the day of Pascin's funeral ,  June 7 ,  1930 ,  thousands of acquaintances from the artistic community ,  and dozens of waiters and bartenders from the restaurants and saloons Pascin had frequented ,  all dressed in black ,  walked three miles behind his coffin ,  from his studio at 36 boulevard de Clichy to the Cimetière de Saint-Ouen .  A year later ,  Pascin's family had his remains re-interred at the more prestigious cimetière du Montparnasse .  "

As a child ,  he occasionally saw police raids to arrest black people who were illegally living in the area .  He said later that he questioned how his parents ,  a Catholic ,  """"liberal"""" family ,  could be what he described as 'lackadaisical' about fighting against apartheid . After high school ,  Carter dropped out of his studies to become a pharmacist and was drafted into the army .

*** "*page_ Kevin_Carter" "*cat_ Suicides_in_South_Africa" " Kevin Carter was born in Johannesburg ,  South Africa ,  and grew up in a middle-class ,  whites-only neighbourhood .  As a child ,  he occasionally saw police raids to arrest black people who were illegally living in the area .  He said later that he questioned how his parents ,  a Catholic ,  """"liberal"""" family ,  could be what he described as 'lackadaisical' about fighting against apartheid . After high school ,  Carter dropped out of his studies to become a pharmacist and was drafted into the army .  To escape from the infantry ,  he enlisted in the Air Force in which he served four years .  In 1980 ,  he witnessed a black mess-hall waiter being insulted .  Carter defended the man ,  resulting in him being badly beaten by the other servicemen .  He then went absent without leave ,  attempting to start a new life as a radio disc-jockey named """"David"""" .  This ,  however ,  proved more difficult than he had anticipated .  Soon after ,  he decided to serve out the rest of his required military service .  After witnessing the Church Street bombing in Pretoria in 1983 ,  he decided to become a news photographer and journalist .    On 27 July 1994 ,  Carter drove to Parkmore near the Field and Study Centre ,  an area where he used to play as a child ,  and died by taping one end of a hose to his pickup truck’s exhaust pipe and running the other end to the driver's side window .

*** "*page_ Kevin_Gilbert_(musician)" "*cat_ Deaths_from_asphyxiation" " Kevin Matthew Gilbert was born in Sacramento ,  California on November 20 ,  1966 ,  later living in Scotch Plains ,  New Jersey and San Mateo ,  California ,  where he attended Abbott Middle School and Junipero Serra High School .   Kevin Gilbert was an accomplished composer ,  singer ,  producer and instrumentalist who played keyboards ,  guitar ,  bass guitar ,  cello ,  and drums .  In 1984 he and Jason Hubbard released the eponymous No Reasons Given album .  Between 1984 and 1987 he self-released four albums as Kai Gilbert . He toured with Eddie Money before winning the 1988 Yamaha SOUNDCHECK International Rock Music Competition with his progressive rock group Giraffe .  Producer Patrick Leonard was impressed with Gilbert's performance at the competition and invited him to join him in forming a new band which became Toy Matinee .  During this time ,  Gilbert worked on the projects of several established pop musicians ,  including Madonna ,  Michael Jackson ,  and Keith Emerson ,  acting as producer for the latter's album Changing States . The lone Toy Matinee album was released in 1990 but effectively shelved by the record company ,  so Gilbert assembled a new backing band to promote it ,  eventually getting two successful singles released ,  """"The Ballad of Jenny Ledge"""" and """"Last Plane Out . """"Later ,  Gilbert was part of the songwriting collective """"The Tuesday Music Club"""" that met at producer Bill Bottrell's studio in Pasadena ,  California .  Gilbert introduced his then-girlfriend Sheryl Crow to Bottrell and his fellow Club musicians and the sessions allowed Crow to workshop new material ,  leading to the recording of her breakthrough debut album ,  Tuesday Night Music Club .  Gilbert co-wrote many of the songs on that album ,  including 1995 Grammy Record of the Year """"All I Wanna Do"""" .  Crow later acrimoniously split with most of the musicians in the collective and only producer Bottrell and drummer Brian MacLeod were involved in her follow-up album .  Meanwhile ,  the remainder of the collective worked with singer-songwriters Susanna Hoffs and Linda Perry on two more albums . Gilbert continued to work in television and movie soundtracks (under the name Matthew Delgado) ,  studio sessions ,  production ,  and eventually released his first solo album Thud (1995) as well as partially reforming Giraffe to perform the Genesis double album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway at Progfest '94 .  Gilbert's manager sent a copy of the recording to Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford who were searching for a new front man to replace Phil Collins .  Coincidentally ,  shortly after Gilbert's death ,  his manager ,  Jon Rubin of The Rubinoos ,  was contacted by Genesis's management to arrange an audition . On May 17 ,  1996 ,  Gilbert was found dead at his home just outside of Los Angeles .  The coroner listed the cause of death as ‘asphyxia due to partial suspension hanging’ and concluded the death was accidental and not a suicide .  This manner of death is known as autoerotic asphyxiation ,  and the Los Angeles County coroners’ office reports four or five such deaths a year . Several albums of Gilbert's music have been released posthumously ,  beginning in 1999 with the live album Kevin Gilbert & Thud – Live at the Troubadour (consisting primarily of songs from Thud) and a compilation of Giraffe material that he had been working on . Gilbert's second solo album ,  The Shaming of the True ,  (2000) was also released posthumously .  The album was largely incomplete ,  but Gilbert's estate asked Nick D'Virgilio (a former member of Thud ,  the Giraffe Progfest '94 gig ,  Spock's Beard drummer and close friend of Gilbert's) and producer/engineer John Cuniberti to complete it ,  based upon the extant tapes and the album planning notes left by Gilbert . In October 2009 ,  three new works were released ;  Nuts and Bolts (collectively a body of mostly unreleased songs and mixes ,  released as two individual CD albums) and Welcome to Joytown – Thud :  Live at The Troubadour ,  a DVD/CD which expanded on the original 1999 release .  A live performance from Gilbert's promotional group for Toy Matinee was made available in March 2010 ,  and late 2011 saw a deluxe expanded release of The Shaming of the True with additional orchestration and engineering by Mark Hornsby .  In 2012 ,  the two Giraffe albums and 1984's No Reasons Given were re-issued with complete re-mastering from the original analog tapes .  Late 2014 saw a similar expanded release of Thud and a one-time vinyl pressing .  A box set of the Giraffe albums and a DVD with video footage of the band and their performances was released in early 2021 ,  with a vinyl release of The Shaming of the True and a 4-CD box set of Gilbert's earlier work ,  Call me Kai ,  expected later in the year .

*** "*page_ Yukio_Mishima" "*cat_ LGBT-related_suicides" " Kimitake Hiraoka (平岡公威 ,  Hiraoka Kimitake) ,  later known as Yukio Mishima (三島由紀夫 ,  Mishima Yukio) ,  was born in Nagazumi-cho ,  Yotsuya-ku of Tokyo City (now part of Yotsuya ,  Shinjuku-ku ,  Tokyo) .  He chose his pen name when he was 16 . Mishima's early childhood was dominated by the presence of his grandmother ,  Natsuko ,  who took the boy and separated him from his immediate family for several years . Mishima returned to his immediate family when he was 12 .  His father Azusa had a taste for military discipline ,  and worried Natsuko's style of childrearing was too soft .  When Mishima was an infant ,  Azusa employed parenting tactics such as holding Mishima up to the side of a speeding train .  He also raided his son's room for evidence of an """"effeminate"""" interest in literature ,  and often ripped his son's manuscripts apart . When Mishima was 13 ,  Natsuko took him to see his first Kabuki play :  Kanadehon Chūshingura ,  an allegory of the story of the 47 Rōnin .  He was later taken to his first Noh play (Miwa ,  a story featuring Amano-Iwato) by his maternal grandmother Tomi Hashi (橋トミ) .  From these early experiences ,  Mishima became addicted to Kabuki and Noh .  He began attending performances every month and grew deeply interested in these traditional Japanese dramatic art forms . Mishima was enrolled at the age of six in the elite Gakushūin ,  the Peers' School in Tokyo ,  which had been established in the Meiji period to educate the Imperial family and the descendants of the old feudal nobility . In 1941 ,  at the age of 16 ,  Mishima was invited to write a short story for the Hojinkai-zasshi ,  and he submitted Forest in Full Bloom (花ざかりの森 ,  Hanazakari no Mori) ,  a story in which the narrator describes the feeling that his ancestors somehow still live within him .  The story uses the type of metaphors and aphorisms that became Mishima's trademarks . In order to protect him from potential backlash from Azusa ,  Shimizu and the other editorial board members coined the pen-name Yukio Mishima .  In the magazine ,  Hasuda praised Mishima's genius as follows : This youthful author is a heaven-sent child of eternal Japanese history .  He is much younger than we are ,  but has arrived on the scene already quite mature . Hasuda ,  who became something of a mentor to Mishima ,  was an ardent nationalist and a fan of Motoori Norinaga (1730–1801) ,  a scholar of kokugaku from the Edo period who preached Japanese traditional values and devotion to the Emperor .  At a farewell party thrown for Hasuda by the Bungei Bunka group ,  Hasuda offered the following parting words to Mishima :  I have entrusted the future of Japan to you . According to Mishima ,  these words were deeply meaningful to him ,  and had a profound effect on the future course of his life . Later in 1941 ,  Mishima wrote in his notebook an essay about his deep devotion to Shintō ,  titled The Way of the Gods (惟神之道 ,  Kannagara no michi) . On 9 September 1944 ,  Mishima graduated Gakushūin High School at the top of the class ,  and became a graduate representative . On 27 April 1944 ,  during the final years of World War II ,  Mishima received a draft notice for the Imperial Japanese Army and barely passed his conscription examination on 16 May 1944 ,  with a less desirable rating of """"second class"""" conscript .  He had a cold during his medical check on convocation day (10 February 1945) ,  and the young army doctor misdiagnosed Mishima with tuberculosis ,  declared him unfit for service ,  and sent him home . The day before his failed medical exam ,  Mishima wrote a farewell message to his family ,  ending with the words """"Long live the Emperor!"""" (天皇陛下万歳 ,  Tennō heika banzai) ,  and prepared clippings of his hair and nails to be kept as mementos by his parents . Mishima was deeply affected by Emperor Hirohito's radio broadcast announcing Japan's surrender on 15 August 1945 ,  and vowed to protect Japanese cultural traditions and help rebuild Japanese culture after the destruction of the war .  He wrote in his diary :  Only by preserving Japanese irrationality will we be able contribute to world culture 100 years from now . On 19 August ,  four days after Japan's surrender ,  Mishima's mentor Zenmei Hasuda ,  who had been drafted and deployed to the Malay peninsula ,  shot and killed a superior officer for criticizing the Emperor before turning his pistol on himself .  Mishima learned of the incident a year later and contributed poetry in Hasuda's honor at a memorial service in November 1946 . At the end of the war ,  his father Azusa """"half-allowed"""" Mishima to become a novelist .  He was worried that his son could actually become a professional novelist ,  and hoped instead that his son would be a bureaucrat like himself and Mishima's grandfather Sadatarō .  He advised his son to enroll in the Faculty of Law instead of the literature department . After Japan's defeat in World War II ,  the country was occupied by the U . S . -led Allied Powers .  At the urging of the occupation authorities ,  many people who held important posts in various fields were purged from public office .  The media and publishing industry were also censored ,  and were not allowed to engage in forms of expression reminiscent of wartime Japanese nationalism . Mishima had heard that famed writer Yasunari Kawabata had praised his work before the end of the war .  Uncertain of who else to turn to ,  Mishima took the manuscripts for The Middle Ages (中世 ,  Chūsei) and The Cigarette (煙草 ,  Tabako) with him ,  visited Kawabata in Kamakura ,  and asked for his advice and assistance in January 1946 . In 1946 ,  Mishima began his first novel ,  Thieves (盗賊 ,  Tōzoku) ,  a story about two young members of the aristocracy drawn towards suicide .  It was published in 1948 ,  and placed Mishima in the ranks of the Second Generation of Postwar Writers .  The following year ,  he published Confessions of a Mask (仮面の告白 ,  Kamen no kokuhaku) ,  a semi-autobiographical account of a young homosexual man who hides behind a mask to fit into society .  The novel was extremely successful and made Mishima a celebrity at the age of 24 .  Around 1949 ,  Mishima also published a literary essay about Kawabata ,  for whom he had always held a deep appreciation ,  in Kindai Bungaku (近代文学) . Mishima enjoyed international travel .  In 1952 ,  he took a world tour and published his travelogue as The Cup of Apollo (アポロの杯 ,  Aporo no Sakazuki) .  He visited Greece during his travels ,  a place which had fascinated him since childhood .  His visit to Greece became the basis for his 1954 novel The Sound of Waves (潮騒 ,  Shiosai) ,  which drew inspiration from the Greek legend of Daphnis and Chloe .  The Sound of Waves ,  set on the small island of """"Kami-shima"""" where a traditional Japanese lifestyle continued to be practiced ,  depicts a pure ,  simple love between a fisherman and a female pearl and abalone diver (海女 ,  ama) .  Although the novel became a best-seller ,  leftists criticized it for """"glorifying old-fashioned Japanese values"""" ,  and some people began calling Mishima a """"fascist"""" . Mishima made use of contemporary events in many of his works .  The Temple of the Golden Pavilion (金閣寺 ,  Kinkaku-ji) ,  published in 1956 ,  is a fictionalization of the burning down of the Kinkaku-ji Buddhist temple in Kyoto in 1950 by a mentally disturbed monk . In 1959 ,  Mishima published the artistically ambitious novel Kyōko no Ie (Kyōko's house) (鏡子の家 ,  Kyōko no Ie) .  The novel tells the interconnected stories of four young men who represented four different facets of Mishima's personality .  His athletic side appears as a boxer ,  his artistic side as a painter ,  his narcissistic ,  performative side as an actor ,  and his secretive ,  nihilistic side as a businessman who goes through the motions of living a normal life while practicing """"absolute contempt for reality"""" .  According to Mishima ,  he was attempting to describe the time around 1955 in the novel ,  when Japan was entering into its era of high economic growth and the phrase """"The postwar is over"""" was prevalent . Many of Mishima's most famous and highly regarded works were written prior to 1960 .  However ,  until that year he had not written works that were seen as especially political . Shortly after the Anpo Protests ended ,  Mishima began writing one of his most famous short stories ,  Patriotism (憂国 ,  Yūkoku) ,  glorifying the actions of a young right-wing ultranationalist Japanese army officer who commits suicide after a failed revolt against the government during the February 26 Incident . Mishima's newfound interest in contemporary politics shaped his novel After the Banquet (宴のあと ,  Utage no ato) ,  also published in 1960 ,  which so closely followed the events surrounding politician Hachirō Arita's campaign to become governor of Tokyo that Mishima was sued for invasion of privacy . In 1965 ,  Mishima wrote the play Madame de Sade (サド侯爵夫人 ,  Sado kōshaku fujin) that explores the complex figure of the Marquis de Sade ,  traditionally upheld as an exemplar of vice ,  through a series of debates between six female characters ,  including the Marquis' wife ,  the Madame de Sade .  At the end of the play ,  Mishima offers his own interpretation of what he considered to be one of the central mysteries of the de Sade story—the Madame de Sade's unstinting support for her husband while he was in prison and her sudden decision to renounce him upon his release . Mishima was considered for the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1963 ,  1964 ,  and 1965 , Mishima was also an actor ,  and starred in Yasuzo Masumura's 1960 film ,  Afraid to Die (からっ風野郎 ,  Karakkaze yarō) ,  for which he sang the theme song too (lyrics by himself ;  music by Shichirō Fukazawa) .  He performed in films like Patriotism or the Rite of Love and Death (憂国 ,  Yũkoku ,  directed by himself ,  1966) ,  Black Lizard (黒蜥蜴 ,  Kurotokage ,  directed by Kinji Fukasaku ,  1968) and Hitokiri (人斬り ,  directed by Hideo Gosha ,  1969) .  HMishima was featured as the photo model in photographer Eikoh Hosoe's book Bara-kei (薔薇刑 ,  Ba-ra-kei :  Ordeal by Roses) ,  as well as in Tamotsu Yatō's photobooks Young Samurai :  Bodybuilders of Japan (体道～日本のボディビルダーたち ,  Taidō :  Nihon no bodybuilder tachi) and Otoko :  Photo Studies of the Young Japanese Male (男 ,  Otoko) .  American author Donald Richie gave an eyewitness account of seeing Mishima ,  dressed in a loincloth and armed with a sword ,  posing in the snow for one of Tamotsu Yatō's photoshoots . In the men's magazine Heibon Punch ,  to which Mishima had contributed various essays and criticisms ,  he won first place in the """"Mr .  Dandy"""" reader popularity poll in 1967 with 19 , 590 votes ,  beating second place Toshiro Mifune by 720 votes . In 1955 ,  Mishima took up weight training to overcome the inferiority complex about his weak constitution ,  and his strictly observed workout regimen of three sessions per week was not disrupted for the final 15 years of his life .  In his 1968 essay Sun and Steel (太陽と鉄 ,  Taiyō to tetsu) , After briefly considering marriage with Michiko Shōda (正田美智子) ,  who later married Crown Prince Akihito and became Empress Michiko , While working on his novel Forbidden Colors (禁色 ,  Kinjiki) ,  Mishima visited gay bars in Japan . In February 1961 ,  Mishima became embroiled in the aftermath of the Shimanaka incident (嶋中事件 ,  Shimanaka Jiken) .  In 1960 ,  the author Shichirō Fukazawa (深沢七郎) had published the satirical short story The Tale of an Elegant Dream (風流夢譚 ,  Fũryũ Mutan) in the mainstream magazine Chūō Kōron .  It contained a dream sequence (in which the Emperor and Empress are beheaded by a guillotine) that led to outrage from right-wing ultra-nationalist groups ,  and numerous death threats against Fukazawa ,  any writers believed to have been associated with him ,  and Chūō Kōron magazine itself . In 1963 ,  the Harp of Joy Incident occurred within the theatrical troupe Bungakuza (文学座) ,  to which Mishima belonged .  He wrote a play titled The Harp of Joy (喜びの琴 ,  Yorokobi no koto) ,  but star actress Haruko Sugimura (杉村春子) and other Communist Party-affiliated actors refused to perform because the protagonist held anti-communist views and mentioned criticism about a conspiracy of world communism in his lines .  As a result of this ideological conflict ,  Mishima quit Bungakuza and later formed the troupe Neo Littérature Théâtre (劇団NLT ,  Gekidan NLT) with playwrights and actors who had quit Bungakuza along with him ,  including Seiichi Yashio (矢代静一) ,  Takeo Matsuura (松浦竹夫) ,  and Nobuo Nakamura (中村伸郎) .  When Neo Littérature Théâtre experienced a schism in 1968 ,  Mishima formed another troupe ,  the Roman Theatre (浪曼劇場 ,  Rōman Gekijō) ,  and worked Matsuura and Nakamura again . During the Tokyo Olympics in 1964 ,  Mishima interviewed various athletes every day and wrote articles as a newspaper correspondent . Mishima hated Ryokichi Minobe ,  who was a communist and the governor of Tokyo beginning in 1967 . Mishima was fond of manga and gekiga ,  especially the drawing style of Hiroshi Hirata (平田弘史) ,  a mangaka best known for his samurai gekiga ;  the slapstick ,  absurdist comedy in Fujio Akatsuka's Mōretsu Atarō (もーれつア太郎) ,  and the imaginativeness of Shigeru Mizuki's GeGeGe no Kitarō (ゲゲゲの鬼太郎) . Mishima was a fan of science fiction ,  contending that """"science fiction will be the first literature to completely overcome modern humanism"""" . Mishima traveled to Shimoda on the Izu Peninsula with his wife and children every summer from 1964 onwards . Mishima's nationalism grew towards the end of his life .  In 1966 ,  he published his short story The Voices of the Heroic Dead (英霊の聲 ,  Eirei no koe) ,  in which he denounced Emperor Hirohito for renouncing his own divinity after World War II .  He argued that the soldiers who had died in the February 26 Incident (二・二六事件 ,  Ni-Ni-Roku Jiken) and the Japanese Special Attack Units (特攻隊 ,  Tokkōtai) had died for their """"living god"""" Emperor ,  and that Hirohito's renunciation of his own divinity meant that all those deaths had been in vain .  Mishima said that His Majesty had become a human when he should be a God . In February 1967 ,  Mishima joined fellow authors Yasunari Kawabata ,  Kōbō Abe ,  and Jun Ishikawa in issuing a statement condemning China's Cultural Revolution for suppressing academic and artistic freedom . In September 1967 Mishima and his wife visited India at the invitation of the Indian government .  He traveled widely and met with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and President Zakir Hussain . In 1968 ,  Mishima wrote a play titled My Friend Hitler (わが友ヒットラー ,  Waga tomo Hittorā) ,  in which he depicted the historical figures of Adolf Hitler ,  Gustav Krupp ,  Gregor Strasser ,  and Ernst Röhm as mouthpieces to express his own views on fascism and beauty . That same year ,  he wrote Life for Sale (命売ります ,  Inochi Urimasu) ,  a humorous story about a man who ,  after failing to commit suicide ,  advertises his life for sale . Mishima was hated by leftists who said Hirohito should have abdicated to take responsibility for the loss of life in the war .  They also hated him for his outspoken commitment to bushido ,  the code of the samurai in The way of the samurai (葉隠入門 ,  Hagakure Nyūmon) ,  his support for the abolition of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution ,  and for his contention in his critique The Defense of Culture (文化防衛論 ,  Bunka Bōeiron) that preached the importance of the Emperor in Japanese cultures .  Mishima regarded the postwar era of Japan ,  where no poetic culture and supreme artist was born ,  as an era of fake prosperity ,  and stated in The Defense of Culture :  In the postwar prosperity called Shōwa Genroku ,  where there are no Chikamatsu Monzaemon ,  Ihara Saikaku ,  Matsuo Bashō ,  only infestation of flashy manners and customs in there .  Passion is dried up ,  strong realism dispels the ground ,  and the deepening of poetry is neglected .  That is ,  there are no Chikamatsu ,  Saikaku ,  or Basho now .  In other critical essays ,  In critical essays in 1969 ,  Mishima explained Japan's difficult and delicate position and peculiarities between China ,  the Soviet Union ,  and the United States .   To put it simply ,  support for the Security Treaty means agreeing with the United States ,  and to oppose it means agreeing with the Soviet Union or the Chinese Communist Party ,  so after all ,  it's only just a matter of which foreign country to rely on ,  and therein the question of """"what is Japan"""" is completely lacking .  If you ask the Japanese ,  """"Hey you ,  do you choose America ,  Soviet Union ,  or Chinese Communist Party?"""" ,  if he is a true Japanese ,  he will withhold his attitude .  In regards to those who strongly opposed the US military base in Okinawa and the Security Treaty :  They may appear to be nationalists and right-wingers in the foreign common sense ,  but in Japan ,  most of them are in fact left-wingers and communists . Throughout this period ,  Mishima continued to work on his magnum opus ,  The Sea of Fertility tetralogy of novels ,  which began appearing in a monthly serialized format in September 1965 . In August 1966 ,  Mishima visited Ōmiwa Shrine in Nara Prefecture ,  thought to be one of the oldest Shintō shrines in Japan ,  as well as the hometown of his mentor Zenmei Hasuda and the areas associated with the Shinpūren Rebellion (神風連の乱 ,  Shinpūren no ran) ,  an uprising against the Meiji government by samurai in 1876 .  This trip would become the inspiration for portions of Runaway Horses (奔馬 ,  Honba) ,  the second novel in the Sea of Fertility tetralogy .  While in Kumamoto ,  Mishima purchased a Japanese sword for 100 , 000 yen .  Mishima envisioned the reincarnation of Kiyoaki ,  the protagonist of the first novel Spring Snow ,  as a man named Isao who put his life on the line to bring about a restoration of direct rule by the Emperor against the backdrop of the League of Blood Incident (血盟団事件 ,  Ketsumeidan jiken) in 1932 . From 12 April to 27 May 1967 ,  Mishima underwent basic training with the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) . From June 1967 ,  Mishima became a leading figure in a plan to create a 10 , 000-man """"Japan National Guard"""" (祖国防衛隊 ,  Sokoku Bōeitai) as a civilian complement to Japan's Self Defense Forces .  He began leading groups of right-wing college students to undergo basic training with the GDSF in the hope of training 100 officers to lead the National Guard . Like many other right-wingers ,  Mishima was especially alarmed by the riots and revolutionary actions undertaken by radical """"New Left"""" university students ,  who took over dozens of college campuses in Japan in 1968 and 1969 .  On 26 February 1968 ,  the 32nd anniversary of the February 26 Incident ,  he and several other right-wingers met at the editorial offices of the recently founded right-wing magazine Controversy Journal (論争ジャーナル ,  Ronsō jaanaru) ,  where they pricked their little fingers and signed a blood oath promising to die if necessary to prevent a left-wing revolution from occurring in Japan . When Mishima found that his plan for a large-scale Japan National Guard with broad public and private support failed to catch on , On 25 November 1970 ,  Mishima and four members of the Tatenokai—Masakatsu Morita (森田必勝) ,  Masahiro Ogawa (小川正洋) ,  Masayoshi Koga (小賀正義) ,  and Hiroyasu Koga (古賀浩靖)—used a pretext to visit the commandant Kanetoshi Mashita (益田兼利) of Camp Ichigaya ,  a military base in central Tokyo and the headquarters of the Eastern Command of the Japan Self-Defense Forces .  Inside ,  they barricaded the office and tied the commandant to his chair .  Mishima wore a white hachimaki headband with a red hinomaru circle in the center bearing the kanji for """"To be reborn seven times to serve the country"""" (七生報國 ,  Shichishō hōkoku) ,  which was a reference to the last words of Kusunoki Masasue (楠木正季) ,  the younger brother of the 14th century imperial loyalist samurai Kusunoki Masashige (楠木正成) ,  as the two brothers died fighting to defend the Emperor .  With a prepared manifesto and a banner listing their demands ,  Mishima stepped out onto the balcony to address the soldiers gathered below .  His speech was intended to inspire a coup d'état to restore the power of the emperor .  He succeeded only in irritating the soldiers ,  and was heckled ,  with jeers and the noise of helicopters drowning out some parts of his speech .  In his speech Mishima rebuked the JSDF for their passive acceptance of a constitution that """"denies (their) own existence"""" and shouted to rouse them ,  """"Where has the spirit of the samurai gone?"""" In his final written appeal that Morita and Ogawa scattered copies of from the balcony ,  Mishima expressed his dissatisfaction with the half-baked nature of the JSDF :  It is self-evident that the United States would not be pleased with a true Japanese volunteer army protecting the land of Japan . After he finished reading his prepared speech in a few minutes' time ,  Mishima cried out """"Long live the Emperor!"""" (天皇陛下万歳 ,  Tenno-heika banzai) three times .  He then retreated into the commandant's office and apologized to the commandant ,  saying ,  We did it to return the JSDF to the Emperor .  I had no choice but to do this . Mishima then committed seppuku ,  a form of ritual suicide by disembowelment associated with the samurai .  Morita had been assigned to serve as Mishima's second (kaishakunin) ,  cutting off his head with a sword at the end of the ritual to spare him unnecessary pain .  However ,  Morita proved unable to complete his task ,  and after three failed attempts to sever Mishima's head ,  Koga had to step in and complete the task . According to the testimony of the surviving coup members ,  originally all four Tatenokai members had planned to commit seppuku along with Mishima .  However Mishima attempted to dissuade them and three of the members acquiesced to his wishes .  Only Morita persisted ,  saying ,  """"I can't let Mr .  Mishima die alone . """" But Mishima knew that Morita had a girlfriend and still hoped he might live .  Just before his seppuku ,  Mishima tried one more time to dissuade him ,  saying """"Morita ,  you must live ,  not die . """"This coup attempt is called The Mishima Incident (三島事件 ,  Mishima jiken) in Japan . Another traditional element of the suicide ritual was the composition of so-called death poems by the Tatenokai members before their entry into the headquarters .  Officer Kiyokatsu Yamamoto (山本舜勝) ,  Mishima's training teacher ,  explained further :  The officers had a trusty connection with the U . S . A . F . (includes U . S . F . J) ,  and with the approval of the U . S .  army side ,  they were supposed to carry out a security dispatch toward the Armed Forces of the Japan Self-Defense Forces .  However ,  due to the policy change (reversal) of U . S .  by Henry Kissinger who prepared for visiting China in secret (changing relations between U . S .  and China) ,  it became a situation where the Japanese military was not allowed legally . Mishima planned his suicide meticulously for at least a year and no one outside the group of hand-picked Tatenokai members knew what he was planning .  His friend Scott-Stokes ,  another biographer ,  says that """"Mishima is the most important person in postwar Japan"""" ,  and described the shackles of the constitution of Japan :  Mishima cautioned against the lack of reality in the basic political controversy in Japan and the particularity of Japan's democratic principles . Scott-Stokes noted a meeting with Mishima in his diary entry for 3 September 1970 ,  at which Mishima ,  with a dark expression on his face ,  said :  Japan lost its spiritual tradition ,  and materialism infested instead .  Japan is under the curse of a Green Snake now .  The Green Snake bites on Japanese chest .  There is no way to escape this curse .  Scott-Stokes told Takao Tokuoka in 1990 that he took the Green Snake to mean the U . S .  dollar .  Between 1968 and 1970 ,  Mishima also said words about Japan's future .  Mishima's senior friend and father heard from Mishima :  Japan will be hit hard .  One day ,  the United States suddenly contacts China over Japan's head ,  Japan will only be able to look up from the bottom of the valley and eavesdrop on the conversation slightly .  Our friend Taiwan will say that """"it will no longer be able to count on Japan"""" ,  and Taiwan will go somewhere .  Japan may become an orphan in the Orient ,  and may eventually fall into the product of slave dealers . Mishima's corpse was returned home the day after his death .  His father Azusa had been afraid to see his son whose appearance had completely changed .  However ,  when he looked into the casket fearfully ,  Mishima's head and body had been sutured neatly ,  and his dead face ,  to which makeup had been beautifully applied ,  looked as if he were alive due to the police officers .  They said :  """"We applied funeral makeup carefully with special feelings ,  because it is the body of Dr .  Mishima ,  whom we have always respected secretly . """" The commandant who was made a hostage said in the trial ,  I didn't feel hate towards the defendants at that time .  Thinking about the country of Japan ,  thinking about the JSDF ,  the pure hearts of thinking about our country that did that kind of thing ,  I want to buy it as an individual . The day of the Mishima Incident (25 November) was the date when Hirohito (Emperor Shōwa) became regent and the Emperor Shōwa made the Humanity Declaration at the age of 45 .  Researchers believe that Mishima chose that day to revive the """"God"""" by dying as a scapegoat ,  at the same age as when the Emperor became a human .  In addition ,  25 November is the day he began writing Confessions of a Mask (仮面の告白 ,  Kamen no kokuhaku) ,  and this work was announced as """"Techniques of Life Recovery"""" ,  """"Suicide inside out"""" .  Mishima also wrote down in notes for this work ,  This book is a will for leave in the Realm of Death where I used to live .  If you take a movie of a suicide jumped ,  and rotate the film in reverse ,  the suicide person jumps up from the valley bottom to the top of the cliff at a furious speed and he revives .  Writer Takashi Inoue believes he wrote Confessions of a Mask to live in postwar Japan ,  and to get away from his """"Realm of Death"""" ;  by dying on the same date that he began to write Confessions of a Mask ,  Mishima intended to dismantle all of his postwar creative activities and return to the """"Realm of Death"""" where he used to live .

*** "*page_ Yukio_Mishima" "*cat_ LGBT-related_suicides" " Kimitake Hiraoka (平岡公威 ,  Hiraoka Kimitake) ,  later known as Yukio Mishima (三島由紀夫 ,  Mishima Yukio) ,  was born in Nagazumi-cho ,  Yotsuya-ku of Tokyo City (now part of Yotsuya ,  Shinjuku-ku ,  Tokyo) .  He chose his pen name when he was 16 . Mishima's early childhood was dominated by the presence of his grandmother ,  Natsuko ,  who took the boy and separated him from his immediate family for several years . Mishima returned to his immediate family when he was 12 .  His father Azusa had a taste for military discipline ,  and worried Natsuko's style of childrearing was too soft .  When Mishima was an infant ,  Azusa employed parenting tactics such as holding Mishima up to the side of a speeding train .  He also raided his son's room for evidence of an """"effeminate"""" interest in literature ,  and often ripped his son's manuscripts apart . When Mishima was 13 ,  Natsuko took him to see his first Kabuki play :  Kanadehon Chūshingura ,  an allegory of the story of the 47 Rōnin .  He was later taken to his first Noh play (Miwa ,  a story featuring Amano-Iwato) by his maternal grandmother Tomi Hashi (橋トミ) .  From these early experiences ,  Mishima became addicted to Kabuki and Noh .  He began attending performances every month and grew deeply interested in these traditional Japanese dramatic art forms . Mishima was enrolled at the age of six in the elite Gakushūin ,  the Peers' School in Tokyo ,  which had been established in the Meiji period to educate the Imperial family and the descendants of the old feudal nobility . In 1941 ,  at the age of 16 ,  Mishima was invited to write a short story for the Hojinkai-zasshi ,  and he submitted Forest in Full Bloom (花ざかりの森 ,  Hanazakari no Mori) ,  a story in which the narrator describes the feeling that his ancestors somehow still live within him .  The story uses the type of metaphors and aphorisms that became Mishima's trademarks . In order to protect him from potential backlash from Azusa ,  Shimizu and the other editorial board members coined the pen-name Yukio Mishima .  In the magazine ,  Hasuda praised Mishima's genius as follows : This youthful author is a heaven-sent child of eternal Japanese history .  He is much younger than we are ,  but has arrived on the scene already quite mature . Hasuda ,  who became something of a mentor to Mishima ,  was an ardent nationalist and a fan of Motoori Norinaga (1730–1801) ,  a scholar of kokugaku from the Edo period who preached Japanese traditional values and devotion to the Emperor .  At a farewell party thrown for Hasuda by the Bungei Bunka group ,  Hasuda offered the following parting words to Mishima :  I have entrusted the future of Japan to you . According to Mishima ,  these words were deeply meaningful to him ,  and had a profound effect on the future course of his life . Later in 1941 ,  Mishima wrote in his notebook an essay about his deep devotion to Shintō ,  titled The Way of the Gods (惟神之道 ,  Kannagara no michi) . On 9 September 1944 ,  Mishima graduated Gakushūin High School at the top of the class ,  and became a graduate representative . On 27 April 1944 ,  during the final years of World War II ,  Mishima received a draft notice for the Imperial Japanese Army and barely passed his conscription examination on 16 May 1944 ,  with a less desirable rating of """"second class"""" conscript .  He had a cold during his medical check on convocation day (10 February 1945) ,  and the young army doctor misdiagnosed Mishima with tuberculosis ,  declared him unfit for service ,  and sent him home . The day before his failed medical exam ,  Mishima wrote a farewell message to his family ,  ending with the words """"Long live the Emperor!"""" (天皇陛下万歳 ,  Tennō heika banzai) ,  and prepared clippings of his hair and nails to be kept as mementos by his parents . Mishima was deeply affected by Emperor Hirohito's radio broadcast announcing Japan's surrender on 15 August 1945 ,  and vowed to protect Japanese cultural traditions and help rebuild Japanese culture after the destruction of the war .  He wrote in his diary :  Only by preserving Japanese irrationality will we be able contribute to world culture 100 years from now . On 19 August ,  four days after Japan's surrender ,  Mishima's mentor Zenmei Hasuda ,  who had been drafted and deployed to the Malay peninsula ,  shot and killed a superior officer for criticizing the Emperor before turning his pistol on himself .  Mishima learned of the incident a year later and contributed poetry in Hasuda's honor at a memorial service in November 1946 . At the end of the war ,  his father Azusa """"half-allowed"""" Mishima to become a novelist .  He was worried that his son could actually become a professional novelist ,  and hoped instead that his son would be a bureaucrat like himself and Mishima's grandfather Sadatarō .  He advised his son to enroll in the Faculty of Law instead of the literature department . After Japan's defeat in World War II ,  the country was occupied by the U . S . -led Allied Powers .  At the urging of the occupation authorities ,  many people who held important posts in various fields were purged from public office .  The media and publishing industry were also censored ,  and were not allowed to engage in forms of expression reminiscent of wartime Japanese nationalism . Mishima had heard that famed writer Yasunari Kawabata had praised his work before the end of the war .  Uncertain of who else to turn to ,  Mishima took the manuscripts for The Middle Ages (中世 ,  Chūsei) and The Cigarette (煙草 ,  Tabako) with him ,  visited Kawabata in Kamakura ,  and asked for his advice and assistance in January 1946 . In 1946 ,  Mishima began his first novel ,  Thieves (盗賊 ,  Tōzoku) ,  a story about two young members of the aristocracy drawn towards suicide .  It was published in 1948 ,  and placed Mishima in the ranks of the Second Generation of Postwar Writers .  The following year ,  he published Confessions of a Mask (仮面の告白 ,  Kamen no kokuhaku) ,  a semi-autobiographical account of a young homosexual man who hides behind a mask to fit into society .  The novel was extremely successful and made Mishima a celebrity at the age of 24 .  Around 1949 ,  Mishima also published a literary essay about Kawabata ,  for whom he had always held a deep appreciation ,  in Kindai Bungaku (近代文学) . Mishima enjoyed international travel .  In 1952 ,  he took a world tour and published his travelogue as The Cup of Apollo (アポロの杯 ,  Aporo no Sakazuki) .  He visited Greece during his travels ,  a place which had fascinated him since childhood .  His visit to Greece became the basis for his 1954 novel The Sound of Waves (潮騒 ,  Shiosai) ,  which drew inspiration from the Greek legend of Daphnis and Chloe .  The Sound of Waves ,  set on the small island of """"Kami-shima"""" where a traditional Japanese lifestyle continued to be practiced ,  depicts a pure ,  simple love between a fisherman and a female pearl and abalone diver (海女 ,  ama) .  Although the novel became a best-seller ,  leftists criticized it for """"glorifying old-fashioned Japanese values"""" ,  and some people began calling Mishima a """"fascist"""" . Mishima made use of contemporary events in many of his works .  The Temple of the Golden Pavilion (金閣寺 ,  Kinkaku-ji) ,  published in 1956 ,  is a fictionalization of the burning down of the Kinkaku-ji Buddhist temple in Kyoto in 1950 by a mentally disturbed monk . In 1959 ,  Mishima published the artistically ambitious novel Kyōko no Ie (Kyōko's house) (鏡子の家 ,  Kyōko no Ie) .  The novel tells the interconnected stories of four young men who represented four different facets of Mishima's personality .  His athletic side appears as a boxer ,  his artistic side as a painter ,  his narcissistic ,  performative side as an actor ,  and his secretive ,  nihilistic side as a businessman who goes through the motions of living a normal life while practicing """"absolute contempt for reality"""" .  According to Mishima ,  he was attempting to describe the time around 1955 in the novel ,  when Japan was entering into its era of high economic growth and the phrase """"The postwar is over"""" was prevalent . Many of Mishima's most famous and highly regarded works were written prior to 1960 .  However ,  until that year he had not written works that were seen as especially political . Shortly after the Anpo Protests ended ,  Mishima began writing one of his most famous short stories ,  Patriotism (憂国 ,  Yūkoku) ,  glorifying the actions of a young right-wing ultranationalist Japanese army officer who commits suicide after a failed revolt against the government during the February 26 Incident . Mishima's newfound interest in contemporary politics shaped his novel After the Banquet (宴のあと ,  Utage no ato) ,  also published in 1960 ,  which so closely followed the events surrounding politician Hachirō Arita's campaign to become governor of Tokyo that Mishima was sued for invasion of privacy . In 1965 ,  Mishima wrote the play Madame de Sade (サド侯爵夫人 ,  Sado kōshaku fujin) that explores the complex figure of the Marquis de Sade ,  traditionally upheld as an exemplar of vice ,  through a series of debates between six female characters ,  including the Marquis' wife ,  the Madame de Sade .  At the end of the play ,  Mishima offers his own interpretation of what he considered to be one of the central mysteries of the de Sade story—the Madame de Sade's unstinting support for her husband while he was in prison and her sudden decision to renounce him upon his release . Mishima was considered for the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1963 ,  1964 ,  and 1965 , Mishima was also an actor ,  and starred in Yasuzo Masumura's 1960 film ,  Afraid to Die (からっ風野郎 ,  Karakkaze yarō) ,  for which he sang the theme song too (lyrics by himself ;  music by Shichirō Fukazawa) .  He performed in films like Patriotism or the Rite of Love and Death (憂国 ,  Yũkoku ,  directed by himself ,  1966) ,  Black Lizard (黒蜥蜴 ,  Kurotokage ,  directed by Kinji Fukasaku ,  1968) and Hitokiri (人斬り ,  directed by Hideo Gosha ,  1969) .  HMishima was featured as the photo model in photographer Eikoh Hosoe's book Bara-kei (薔薇刑 ,  Ba-ra-kei :  Ordeal by Roses) ,  as well as in Tamotsu Yatō's photobooks Young Samurai :  Bodybuilders of Japan (体道～日本のボディビルダーたち ,  Taidō :  Nihon no bodybuilder tachi) and Otoko :  Photo Studies of the Young Japanese Male (男 ,  Otoko) .  American author Donald Richie gave an eyewitness account of seeing Mishima ,  dressed in a loincloth and armed with a sword ,  posing in the snow for one of Tamotsu Yatō's photoshoots . In the men's magazine Heibon Punch ,  to which Mishima had contributed various essays and criticisms ,  he won first place in the """"Mr .  Dandy"""" reader popularity poll in 1967 with 19 , 590 votes ,  beating second place Toshiro Mifune by 720 votes . In 1955 ,  Mishima took up weight training to overcome the inferiority complex about his weak constitution ,  and his strictly observed workout regimen of three sessions per week was not disrupted for the final 15 years of his life .  In his 1968 essay Sun and Steel (太陽と鉄 ,  Taiyō to tetsu) , After briefly considering marriage with Michiko Shōda (正田美智子) ,  who later married Crown Prince Akihito and became Empress Michiko , While working on his novel Forbidden Colors (禁色 ,  Kinjiki) ,  Mishima visited gay bars in Japan . In February 1961 ,  Mishima became embroiled in the aftermath of the Shimanaka incident (嶋中事件 ,  Shimanaka Jiken) .  In 1960 ,  the author Shichirō Fukazawa (深沢七郎) had published the satirical short story The Tale of an Elegant Dream (風流夢譚 ,  Fũryũ Mutan) in the mainstream magazine Chūō Kōron .  It contained a dream sequence (in which the Emperor and Empress are beheaded by a guillotine) that led to outrage from right-wing ultra-nationalist groups ,  and numerous death threats against Fukazawa ,  any writers believed to have been associated with him ,  and Chūō Kōron magazine itself . In 1963 ,  the Harp of Joy Incident occurred within the theatrical troupe Bungakuza (文学座) ,  to which Mishima belonged .  He wrote a play titled The Harp of Joy (喜びの琴 ,  Yorokobi no koto) ,  but star actress Haruko Sugimura (杉村春子) and other Communist Party-affiliated actors refused to perform because the protagonist held anti-communist views and mentioned criticism about a conspiracy of world communism in his lines .  As a result of this ideological conflict ,  Mishima quit Bungakuza and later formed the troupe Neo Littérature Théâtre (劇団NLT ,  Gekidan NLT) with playwrights and actors who had quit Bungakuza along with him ,  including Seiichi Yashio (矢代静一) ,  Takeo Matsuura (松浦竹夫) ,  and Nobuo Nakamura (中村伸郎) .  When Neo Littérature Théâtre experienced a schism in 1968 ,  Mishima formed another troupe ,  the Roman Theatre (浪曼劇場 ,  Rōman Gekijō) ,  and worked Matsuura and Nakamura again . During the Tokyo Olympics in 1964 ,  Mishima interviewed various athletes every day and wrote articles as a newspaper correspondent . Mishima hated Ryokichi Minobe ,  who was a communist and the governor of Tokyo beginning in 1967 . Mishima was fond of manga and gekiga ,  especially the drawing style of Hiroshi Hirata (平田弘史) ,  a mangaka best known for his samurai gekiga ;  the slapstick ,  absurdist comedy in Fujio Akatsuka's Mōretsu Atarō (もーれつア太郎) ,  and the imaginativeness of Shigeru Mizuki's GeGeGe no Kitarō (ゲゲゲの鬼太郎) . Mishima was a fan of science fiction ,  contending that """"science fiction will be the first literature to completely overcome modern humanism"""" . Mishima traveled to Shimoda on the Izu Peninsula with his wife and children every summer from 1964 onwards . Mishima's nationalism grew towards the end of his life .  In 1966 ,  he published his short story The Voices of the Heroic Dead (英霊の聲 ,  Eirei no koe) ,  in which he denounced Emperor Hirohito for renouncing his own divinity after World War II .  He argued that the soldiers who had died in the February 26 Incident (二・二六事件 ,  Ni-Ni-Roku Jiken) and the Japanese Special Attack Units (特攻隊 ,  Tokkōtai) had died for their """"living god"""" Emperor ,  and that Hirohito's renunciation of his own divinity meant that all those deaths had been in vain .  Mishima said that His Majesty had become a human when he should be a God . In February 1967 ,  Mishima joined fellow authors Yasunari Kawabata ,  Kōbō Abe ,  and Jun Ishikawa in issuing a statement condemning China's Cultural Revolution for suppressing academic and artistic freedom . In September 1967 Mishima and his wife visited India at the invitation of the Indian government .  He traveled widely and met with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and President Zakir Hussain . In 1968 ,  Mishima wrote a play titled My Friend Hitler (わが友ヒットラー ,  Waga tomo Hittorā) ,  in which he depicted the historical figures of Adolf Hitler ,  Gustav Krupp ,  Gregor Strasser ,  and Ernst Röhm as mouthpieces to express his own views on fascism and beauty . That same year ,  he wrote Life for Sale (命売ります ,  Inochi Urimasu) ,  a humorous story about a man who ,  after failing to commit suicide ,  advertises his life for sale . Mishima was hated by leftists who said Hirohito should have abdicated to take responsibility for the loss of life in the war .  They also hated him for his outspoken commitment to bushido ,  the code of the samurai in The way of the samurai (葉隠入門 ,  Hagakure Nyūmon) ,  his support for the abolition of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution ,  and for his contention in his critique The Defense of Culture (文化防衛論 ,  Bunka Bōeiron) that preached the importance of the Emperor in Japanese cultures .  Mishima regarded the postwar era of Japan ,  where no poetic culture and supreme artist was born ,  as an era of fake prosperity ,  and stated in The Defense of Culture :  In the postwar prosperity called Shōwa Genroku ,  where there are no Chikamatsu Monzaemon ,  Ihara Saikaku ,  Matsuo Bashō ,  only infestation of flashy manners and customs in there .  Passion is dried up ,  strong realism dispels the ground ,  and the deepening of poetry is neglected .  That is ,  there are no Chikamatsu ,  Saikaku ,  or Basho now .  In other critical essays ,  In critical essays in 1969 ,  Mishima explained Japan's difficult and delicate position and peculiarities between China ,  the Soviet Union ,  and the United States .   To put it simply ,  support for the Security Treaty means agreeing with the United States ,  and to oppose it means agreeing with the Soviet Union or the Chinese Communist Party ,  so after all ,  it's only just a matter of which foreign country to rely on ,  and therein the question of """"what is Japan"""" is completely lacking .  If you ask the Japanese ,  """"Hey you ,  do you choose America ,  Soviet Union ,  or Chinese Communist Party?"""" ,  if he is a true Japanese ,  he will withhold his attitude .  In regards to those who strongly opposed the US military base in Okinawa and the Security Treaty :  They may appear to be nationalists and right-wingers in the foreign common sense ,  but in Japan ,  most of them are in fact left-wingers and communists . Throughout this period ,  Mishima continued to work on his magnum opus ,  The Sea of Fertility tetralogy of novels ,  which began appearing in a monthly serialized format in September 1965 . In August 1966 ,  Mishima visited Ōmiwa Shrine in Nara Prefecture ,  thought to be one of the oldest Shintō shrines in Japan ,  as well as the hometown of his mentor Zenmei Hasuda and the areas associated with the Shinpūren Rebellion (神風連の乱 ,  Shinpūren no ran) ,  an uprising against the Meiji government by samurai in 1876 .  This trip would become the inspiration for portions of Runaway Horses (奔馬 ,  Honba) ,  the second novel in the Sea of Fertility tetralogy .  While in Kumamoto ,  Mishima purchased a Japanese sword for 100 , 000 yen .  Mishima envisioned the reincarnation of Kiyoaki ,  the protagonist of the first novel Spring Snow ,  as a man named Isao who put his life on the line to bring about a restoration of direct rule by the Emperor against the backdrop of the League of Blood Incident (血盟団事件 ,  Ketsumeidan jiken) in 1932 . From 12 April to 27 May 1967 ,  Mishima underwent basic training with the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) . From June 1967 ,  Mishima became a leading figure in a plan to create a 10 , 000-man """"Japan National Guard"""" (祖国防衛隊 ,  Sokoku Bōeitai) as a civilian complement to Japan's Self Defense Forces .  He began leading groups of right-wing college students to undergo basic training with the GDSF in the hope of training 100 officers to lead the National Guard . Like many other right-wingers ,  Mishima was especially alarmed by the riots and revolutionary actions undertaken by radical """"New Left"""" university students ,  who took over dozens of college campuses in Japan in 1968 and 1969 .  On 26 February 1968 ,  the 32nd anniversary of the February 26 Incident ,  he and several other right-wingers met at the editorial offices of the recently founded right-wing magazine Controversy Journal (論争ジャーナル ,  Ronsō jaanaru) ,  where they pricked their little fingers and signed a blood oath promising to die if necessary to prevent a left-wing revolution from occurring in Japan . When Mishima found that his plan for a large-scale Japan National Guard with broad public and private support failed to catch on , On 25 November 1970 ,  Mishima and four members of the Tatenokai—Masakatsu Morita (森田必勝) ,  Masahiro Ogawa (小川正洋) ,  Masayoshi Koga (小賀正義) ,  and Hiroyasu Koga (古賀浩靖)—used a pretext to visit the commandant Kanetoshi Mashita (益田兼利) of Camp Ichigaya ,  a military base in central Tokyo and the headquarters of the Eastern Command of the Japan Self-Defense Forces .  Inside ,  they barricaded the office and tied the commandant to his chair .  Mishima wore a white hachimaki headband with a red hinomaru circle in the center bearing the kanji for """"To be reborn seven times to serve the country"""" (七生報國 ,  Shichishō hōkoku) ,  which was a reference to the last words of Kusunoki Masasue (楠木正季) ,  the younger brother of the 14th century imperial loyalist samurai Kusunoki Masashige (楠木正成) ,  as the two brothers died fighting to defend the Emperor .  With a prepared manifesto and a banner listing their demands ,  Mishima stepped out onto the balcony to address the soldiers gathered below .  His speech was intended to inspire a coup d'état to restore the power of the emperor .  He succeeded only in irritating the soldiers ,  and was heckled ,  with jeers and the noise of helicopters drowning out some parts of his speech .  In his speech Mishima rebuked the JSDF for their passive acceptance of a constitution that """"denies (their) own existence"""" and shouted to rouse them ,  """"Where has the spirit of the samurai gone?"""" In his final written appeal that Morita and Ogawa scattered copies of from the balcony ,  Mishima expressed his dissatisfaction with the half-baked nature of the JSDF :  It is self-evident that the United States would not be pleased with a true Japanese volunteer army protecting the land of Japan . After he finished reading his prepared speech in a few minutes' time ,  Mishima cried out """"Long live the Emperor!"""" (天皇陛下万歳 ,  Tenno-heika banzai) three times .  He then retreated into the commandant's office and apologized to the commandant ,  saying ,  We did it to return the JSDF to the Emperor .  I had no choice but to do this . Mishima then committed seppuku ,  a form of ritual suicide by disembowelment associated with the samurai .  Morita had been assigned to serve as Mishima's second (kaishakunin) ,  cutting off his head with a sword at the end of the ritual to spare him unnecessary pain .  However ,  Morita proved unable to complete his task ,  and after three failed attempts to sever Mishima's head ,  Koga had to step in and complete the task . According to the testimony of the surviving coup members ,  originally all four Tatenokai members had planned to commit seppuku along with Mishima .  However Mishima attempted to dissuade them and three of the members acquiesced to his wishes .  Only Morita persisted ,  saying ,  """"I can't let Mr .  Mishima die alone . """" But Mishima knew that Morita had a girlfriend and still hoped he might live .  Just before his seppuku ,  Mishima tried one more time to dissuade him ,  saying """"Morita ,  you must live ,  not die . """"This coup attempt is called The Mishima Incident (三島事件 ,  Mishima jiken) in Japan . Another traditional element of the suicide ritual was the composition of so-called death poems by the Tatenokai members before their entry into the headquarters .  Officer Kiyokatsu Yamamoto (山本舜勝) ,  Mishima's training teacher ,  explained further :  The officers had a trusty connection with the U . S . A . F . (includes U . S . F . J) ,  and with the approval of the U . S .  army side ,  they were supposed to carry out a security dispatch toward the Armed Forces of the Japan Self-Defense Forces .  However ,  due to the policy change (reversal) of U . S .  by Henry Kissinger who prepared for visiting China in secret (changing relations between U . S .  and China) ,  it became a situation where the Japanese military was not allowed legally . Mishima planned his suicide meticulously for at least a year and no one outside the group of hand-picked Tatenokai members knew what he was planning .  His friend Scott-Stokes ,  another biographer ,  says that """"Mishima is the most important person in postwar Japan"""" ,  and described the shackles of the constitution of Japan :  Mishima cautioned against the lack of reality in the basic political controversy in Japan and the particularity of Japan's democratic principles . Scott-Stokes noted a meeting with Mishima in his diary entry for 3 September 1970 ,  at which Mishima ,  with a dark expression on his face ,  said :  Japan lost its spiritual tradition ,  and materialism infested instead .  Japan is under the curse of a Green Snake now .  The Green Snake bites on Japanese chest .  There is no way to escape this curse .  Scott-Stokes told Takao Tokuoka in 1990 that he took the Green Snake to mean the U . S .  dollar .  Between 1968 and 1970 ,  Mishima also said words about Japan's future .  Mishima's senior friend and father heard from Mishima :  Japan will be hit hard .  One day ,  the United States suddenly contacts China over Japan's head ,  Japan will only be able to look up from the bottom of the valley and eavesdrop on the conversation slightly .  Our friend Taiwan will say that """"it will no longer be able to count on Japan"""" ,  and Taiwan will go somewhere .  Japan may become an orphan in the Orient ,  and may eventually fall into the product of slave dealers . Mishima's corpse was returned home the day after his death .  His father Azusa had been afraid to see his son whose appearance had completely changed .  However ,  when he looked into the casket fearfully ,  Mishima's head and body had been sutured neatly ,  and his dead face ,  to which makeup had been beautifully applied ,  looked as if he were alive due to the police officers .  They said :  """"We applied funeral makeup carefully with special feelings ,  because it is the body of Dr .  Mishima ,  whom we have always respected secretly . """" The commandant who was made a hostage said in the trial ,  I didn't feel hate towards the defendants at that time .  Thinking about the country of Japan ,  thinking about the JSDF ,  the pure hearts of thinking about our country that did that kind of thing ,  I want to buy it as an individual . The day of the Mishima Incident (25 November) was the date when Hirohito (Emperor Shōwa) became regent and the Emperor Shōwa made the Humanity Declaration at the age of 45 .  Researchers believe that Mishima chose that day to revive the """"God"""" by dying as a scapegoat ,  at the same age as when the Emperor became a human .  In addition ,  25 November is the day he began writing Confessions of a Mask (仮面の告白 ,  Kamen no kokuhaku) ,  and this work was announced as """"Techniques of Life Recovery"""" ,  """"Suicide inside out"""" .  Mishima also wrote down in notes for this work ,  This book is a will for leave in the Realm of Death where I used to live .  If you take a movie of a suicide jumped ,  and rotate the film in reverse ,  the suicide person jumps up from the valley bottom to the top of the cliff at a furious speed and he revives .  Writer Takashi Inoue believes he wrote Confessions of a Mask to live in postwar Japan ,  and to get away from his """"Realm of Death"""" ;  by dying on the same date that he began to write Confessions of a Mask ,  Mishima intended to dismantle all of his postwar creative activities and return to the """"Realm of Death"""" where he used to live .

*** "*page_ Karyn_Kupcinet" "*cat_ Deaths_from_asphyxiation" " Kupcinet was born Roberta Lynn Kupcinet in Chicago ,  Illinois to Irv Kupcinet ,  a sportswriter for the Chicago Daily Times ,  and his wife ,  Esther """"Essee"""" Solomon Kupcinet .  She acquired the nickname """"Cookie"""" during her childhood .  She made her acting debut at age 13 in the Chicago production of Anniversary Waltz ,  and went on to attend Pine Manor College for a semester ,  eventually studying at the Actors Studio in New York City .   Kupcinet's interest in acting was encouraged by her mother , Kupcinet's last onscreen appearance was on Perry Mason in the role of Penny Ames ,  entitled ,  """"The Case of the Capering Camera"""" .  The episode aired on CBS on January 16 ,  1964 ,  nearly two months after her death .  On the last day of her life ,  Kupcinet had dinner with future Lost in Space cast member Mark Goddard and his wife ,  Marcia Rogers Goddard ,  at their house on Coldwater Canyon Drive in Beverly Hills (near Mulholland Drive) .  The Goddards also noticed that her pupils were constricted .  Mark Goddard told authorities that he confronted Kupcinet about her altered state during the meal ,  and she began to cry ,  putting her arm around him . Kupcinet apparently went straight home after dining with her friends .  She was visited by freelance writer Edward Stephen Rubin shortly afterward .  The two were then joined by actor Robert Hathaway around 9 : 30 pm .  They told detectives they watched TV ,  including The Danny Kaye Show ,  with Kupcinet .  They all drank coffee until she fell asleep ,  sitting next to them on the couch .  She awoke and went to her room .  The men either turned the TV set off or simply lowered the volume (three days later it was still playing with a low volume) ,  and made sure the door was locked behind them before departing at about 11 : 15 pm .  Hathaway said Rubin and he returned to his place and were later joined by Kupcinet's boyfriend ,  Andrew Prine ,  who was also Hathaway's neighbor .  The three young men watched television and talked until around 3 : 00 am . The Goddards went to Kupcinet's apartment on November 30 ,  after she failed to telephone the couple as promised .  Mark Goddard stated that he had a """"funny feeling"""" that something was wrong . Coroner Harold Kade concluded that due to a broken hyoid bone in her throat ,  Kupcinet had been strangled .  Her death was officially ruled a homicide . Investigators from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office determined that the story Kupcinet had told the Goddards about an abandoned baby on her doorstep ,  which she had also told Andrew Prine by telephone ,  was false . During the course of their investigation ,  the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department named Andrew Prine as one of their chief suspects .  When questioned by law enforcement ,  Prine said he had talked with Kupcinet twice by phone on Wednesday ,  the day before her murder ,  claiming he was trying to patch up a lover's quarrel between them .  Detectives considered it possible that after Prine learned the anonymous threat letters both he and Kupcinet had received had been created by Kupcinet herself ,  that and their unresolved argument gave him a motive for murder .  In addition ,  both Edward Rubin and Robert Hathaway ,  the two men who had possibly been the last to see her alive ,  were friends of Prine .  They were also eventually named as suspects . In 1988 ,  Kupcinet's father Irv published a memoir in which he revealed that he and his wife Essee believed that Andrew Prine had nothing to do with their daughter's murder . Kupcinet's death was first mentioned in connection with the John F .  Kennedy assassination in 1967 by researcher Penn Jones Jr .  in the self-published book Forgive My Grief II .  Jones cited an Associated Press wire service story about an unidentified woman who placed a phone call on November 22 ,  1963 ,  from the vicinity of Oxnard ,  California ,  about fifty miles northwest of Los Angeles ,  and Jones claimed this woman was Kupcinet . The woman ,  who dialed her local operator roughly twenty minutes before the shooting of the president in Dallas ,  stated that he was going to be shot .  Jones alleged that """"Karyn Kupcinet"""" was attempting to warn someone of the impending assassination .  Jones claimed that she was told of the imminent assassination by her father ,  who allegedly had been given advance notice by Oswald's killer Jack Ruby ,  whom Irv Kupcinet may have met in Chicago in the 1940s . Jones speculated Kupcinet had been murdered by representatives of the Italian-American Mafia who silenced her and sent a message to her father to remain silent about why President Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald had been shot and who was actually responsible . Irv Kupcinet denied that he or his daughter had prior knowledge of the shootings of the president or Oswald .  This was supported by  Kupcinet's friends ,  actor Earl Holliman ,  Holliman's then-girlfriend ,  and Karyn's boyfriend Andrew Prine ,  all of whom traveled to Palm Springs with Karyn on November 22 .  Kupcinet reportedly seemed upset and shocked about television and radio coverage of the shootings that she saw and heard in Palm Springs . In 2013 ,  the Ventura County Star commemorated the 50th anniversary of the JFK assassination with a long article about the unknown woman who had used a phone in the vicinity of Oxnard ,  50 miles away from Karyn Kupcinet's home ,  immediately before the assassination . Regarding Irv Kupcinet's alleged connection to Jack Ruby ,  the Dallas nightclub owner who fatally shot President Kennedy's accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald ,  the Warren Commission did not find any proof that Kupcinet had interacted with Ruby in Chicago before 1947 ,  when Ruby moved from Chicago to Dallas . During the production and subsequent release of Oliver Stone's film JFK ,  Irv Kupcinet attacked the movie and the theories surrounding it .  When the film's box-office success led to a wave of media attention about the JFK conspiracy ,  NBC's Today Show broadcast a list of mysterious deaths ,  including that of Karyn Kupcinet .  Irv Kupcinet responded to the Today broadcast in his column in the Chicago Sun-Times of February 9 ,  1992 :  The NBC Today Show on Friday On September 30 ,  1999 ,  an episode of E! True Hollywood Story ,  titled """"Death of a Dream :  Karyn Kupcinet"""" ,  detailed Kupcinet's life and theories regarding her death .  "

Once ,  when she was eight years old ,  her sisters went to the balcony to watch a group of horse-riding performers outside their house but Lady Zhen did not join in .  Her sisters were puzzled so they asked her ,  and she responded ,  """"Is this something a girl should watch?"""" When she was nine years old ,  she became interested in scholarly arts and started reading books and using her brothers' writing materials .  Her brothers told her ,  """"You should be learning what women traditionally do (such as weaving) .  When you picked up reading ,  were you thinking of becoming a female academician?""""

The common people suffered from poverty and hunger ,  and many wealthy households who owned expensive items such as jewellery offered to sell these valuables in return for food .  Lady Zhen's family had large stockpiles of grain ,  and they planned to take advantage of the situation to sell their grain in exchange for valuable items .

*** "*page_ Carole_Landis" "*cat_ Female_suicides" " Landis was born on January 1 ,  1919 ,  in Fairchild ,  Wisconsin ,  the youngest of five children of Clara (née Sentek) ,  a Polish farmer's daughter ,  and Norwegian-American Alfred Ridste ,  a drifting railroad mechanic who abandoned the family after Landis's birth . In 1923 ,  Landis's family moved to San Bernardino ,  California ,  where her mother worked menial jobs to support the family .   Landis made her film debut as an extra in the 1937 film A Star Is Born ;  she also appeared in various horse operas . Landis appeared in a string of successful films in the early 1940s ,  usually as the second female lead .  In a time when the singing of many actresses was dubbed in ,  Landis's own voice was considered good enough and was used in her few musical roles .  Landis landed a contract with Twentieth Century-Fox and began a sexual relationship with Darryl F .  Zanuck .  She had roles playing opposite fellow pin-up girl Betty Grable in Moon Over Miami and I Wake Up Screaming ,  both in 1941 .  When Landis ended her relationship with Zanuck ,  her career suffered and she was assigned roles in B-movies . Her final two films ,  Noose and Brass Monkey ,  were both made in Great Britain . In 1942 ,  she toured with comedian Martha Raye ,  dancer Mitzi Mayfair and actress Kay Francis with a USO troupe in England and North Africa .  Two years later ,  she entertained soldiers in the South Pacific with Jack Benny .   Benny later said that while many entertainers were reluctant to visit wounded men in camp hospitals ,  Landis would make a point of spending time with them ,  and she displayed tremendous empathy as she talked with them about their lives and families back home .  Landis traveled more than 100 , 000 miles during the war and spent more time visiting troops than any other actress .  Landis became a popular pin-up with servicemen during World War II . In 1945 she starred on Broadway in the musical A Lady Says Yes ,  with future novelist Jacqueline Susann in a small role .  Susann is said to have based the character of Jennifer North ,  from her best-selling novel Valley of the Dolls ,  in part on Landis . Landis wrote several newspaper and magazine articles about her experiences during the war ,  including the 1944 book Four Jills in a Jeep ,  which was later made into a movie costarring Kay Francis ,  Martha Raye ,  and Mitzi Mayfair .  She also wrote the foreword to Victor Herman's cartoon book Winnie the WAC .  Landis was reportedly crushed when Harrison refused to divorce his wife for her ;  unable to cope any longer ,  she committed suicide in her Pacific Palisades home at 1465 Capri Drive by taking an overdose of Seconal . The next afternoon ,  Harrison and Landis's maid discovered her on the bathroom floor .  Harrison waited several hours before he called a doctor and the police . Landis has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame ,  at 1765 Vine Street .  "

*** "*page_ Primo_Levi" "*cat_ Suicides_in_Italy" " Levi was born in 1919 in Turin ,  Italy ,  at Corso Re Umberto 75 ,  into a liberal Jewish family .  On their wedding day ,  Rina's father ,  Cesare Luzzati ,  gave Rina the apartment at Corso Re Umberto ,  where Primo Levi lived for almost his entire life . In 1921 Anna Maria ,  Levi's sister ,  was born ;  he remained close to her all her life .  In 1925 he entered the Felice Rignon primary school in Turin .  A thin and delicate child ,  he was shy and considered himself ugly ;  he excelled academically .  His school record includes long periods of absence during which he was tutored at home ,  at first by Emilia Glauda and then by Marisa Zini ,  daughter of philosopher Zino Zini . In September 1930 Levi entered the Massimo d'Azeglio Royal Gymnasium a year ahead of normal entrance requirements . In July 1934 at the age of 14 ,  he sat the exams for the Liceo Classico D'Azeglio ,  a Lyceum (sixth form or senior high school) specializing in the classics ,  and was admitted that year .  The school was noted for its well-known anti-Fascist teachers ,  among them the philosopher Norberto Bobbio ,  and Cesare Pavese ,  who later became one of Italy's best-known novelists . In 1937 ,  he was summoned before the War Ministry and accused of ignoring a draft notice from the Italian Royal Navy—one day before he was to write a final examination on Italy's participation in the Spanish Civil War ,  based on a quote from Thucydides :  """"We have the singular merit of being brave to the utmost degree . """" Distracted and terrified by the draft accusation ,  he failed the exam—the first poor grade of his life—and was devastated .  His father was able to keep him out of the Navy by enrolling him in the Fascist militia (Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale) .  He remained a member through his first year of university ,  until passage of the Italian Racial Laws of 1938 forced his expulsion .  Levi later recounted this series of events in the short story """"Fra Diavolo on the Po"""" . He retook and passed his final examinations ,  and in October enrolled at the University of Turin to study chemistry .  As one of 80 candidates ,  he spent three months taking lectures ,  and in February ,  after passing his colloquio (oral examination) ,  he was selected as one of 20 to move on to the full-time chemistry curriculum . In the liberal period as well as in the first decade of the Fascist regime ,  Jews held many public positions ,  and were prominent in literature ,  science and politics .  In 1929 Mussolini signed an agreement with the Catholic Church ,  the Lateran Treaty ,  which established Catholicism as the State religion ,  allowed the Church to influence many sectors of education and public life ,  and relegated other religions to the status of """"tolerated cults"""" .  In 1936 Italy's conquest of Ethiopia and the expansion of what the regime regarded as the Italian """"colonial empire"""" brought the question of """"race"""" to the forefront .  In the context set by these events ,  and the 1940 alliance with Hitler's Germany ,  the situation of the Jews of Italy changed radically . In July 1938 a group of prominent Italian scientists and intellectuals published the """"Manifesto of Race , """" a mixture of racial and ideological antisemitic theories from ancient and modern sources .  This treatise formed the basis for the Italian Racial Laws of October 1938 .  After its enactment Italian Jews lost their basic civil rights ,  positions in public offices ,  and their assets .  Their books were prohibited :  Jewish writers could no longer publish in magazines owned by Aryans .  Jewish students who had begun their course of study were permitted to continue ,  but new Jewish students were barred from entering university .  Levi had matriculated a year earlier than scheduled enabling him to take a degree . In 1939 Levi began his love affair with hiking in the mountains .  In June 1940 Italy declared war as an ally of Germany against Britain and France ,  and the first Allied air raids on Turin began two days later .  Levi's studies continued during the bombardments .  The family suffered additional strain as his father became bedridden with bowel cancer . Because of the new racial laws and the increasing intensity of prevalent fascism ,  Levi had difficulty finding a supervisor for his graduation thesis ,  which was on the subject of Walden inversion ,  a study of the asymmetry of the carbon atom .  Eventually taken on by Dr .  Nicolò Dallaporta ,  he graduated in mid-1941 with full marks and merit ,  having submitted additional theses on x-rays and electrostatic energy .  His degree certificate bore the remark ,  """"of Jewish race"""" .  The racial laws prevented Levi from finding a suitable permanent job after graduation . In December 1941 Levi received an informal job offer from an Italian officer to work as a chemist ,  under a clandestine identity ,  at an asbestos mine in San Vittore .  The project was to extract nickel from the mine spoil ,  a challenge he accepted with pleasure .  Levi later understood that ,  if successful ,  he would be aiding the German war effort ,  which was suffering nickel shortages in the production of armaments . In July 1943 ,  King Victor Emmanuel III deposed Mussolini and appointed a new government under Marshal Pietro Badoglio ,  prepared to sign the Armistice of Cassibile with the Allies .  When the armistice was made public on 8 September ,  the Germans occupied northern and central Italy ,  liberated Mussolini from imprisonment and appointed him as head of the Italian Social Republic ,  a puppet state in German-occupied northern Italy .  Levi returned to Turin to find his mother and sister in refuge in their holiday home  'La Saccarello' in the hills outside the city .  The three embarked to Saint-Vincent in the Aosta Valley ,  where they could be hidden .  Being pursued as Jews ,  many of whom had already been interned by the authorities ,  they moved up the hillside to Amay in the Col de JouxThe Italian resistance movement became increasingly active in the German-occupied zone .  Levi and some comrades took to the foothills of the Alps ,  and in October formed a partisan group in the hope of being affiliated to the liberal Giustizia e Libertà .  Untrained for such a venture ,  he and his companions were arrested by the Fascist militia on 13 December 1943 .  When told he would be shot as an Italian partisan ,  Levi confessed to being Jewish .  He was sent to the internment camp at Fossoli near Modena .  He recalled that as long as Fossoli was under the control of the Italian Social Republic ,  rather than Nazi Germany ,  he was not harmed . We were given ,  on a regular basis ,  a food ration destined for the soldiers"""" ,  Levi's testimony stated ,  """"and at the end of January 1944 ,  we were taken to Fossoli on a passenger train .  Our conditions in the camp were quite good .  There was no talk of executions and the atmosphere was quite calm .  We were allowed to keep the money we had brought with us and to receive money from the outside .  We worked in the kitchen in turn and performed other services in the camp .  We even prepared a dining room ,  a rather sparse one ,  I must admit . Fossoli was then taken over by the Nazis ,  who started arranging the deportations of the Jews to eastern concentration and death camps .  On the second of these transports ,  on 21 February 1944 ,  Levi and other inmates were transported in twelve cramped cattle trucks to Monowitz ,  one of the three main camps in the Auschwitz concentration camp complex .  Levi (record number 174517) spent eleven months there before the camp was liberated by the Red Army on 27 January 1945 .  Before their arrival ,  people were sorted according to whether they could work or not .  An acquaintance said that it would make no difference ,  in the end ,  and declared he was unable to work and was killed immediately .  Of the 650 Italian Jews in his transport ,  Levi was one of twenty who left the camps alive .  The average life expectancy of a new entrant at the camp was three to four months . Levi knew some German from reading German publications on chemistry ;  he worked to orient quickly to life in the camp without attracting the attention of the privileged inmates .  He used bread to pay a more experienced Italian prisoner for German lessons and orientation in Auschwitz .  He was given a smuggled soup ration each day by Lorenzo Perrone ,  an Italian civilian bricklayer working there as a forced labourer .  Levi's professional qualifications were useful :  in mid-November 1944 ,  he secured a position as an assistant in IG Farben's Buna Werke laboratory that was intended to produce synthetic rubber .  By avoiding hard labour in freezing outdoor temperatures he was able to survive ;  also ,  by stealing materials from the laboratory and trading them for extra food .  Shortly before the camp was liberated by the Red Army ,  he fell ill with scarlet fever and was placed in the camp's sanatorium (camp hospital) .  On 18 January 1945 ,  the SS hurriedly evacuated the camp as the Red Army approached ,  forcing all but the gravely ill on a long death march to a site further from the front ,  which resulted in the deaths of the vast majority of the remaining prisoners on the march .  Levi's illness spared him this fate . Although liberated on 27 January 1945 ,  Levi did not reach Turin until 19 October 1945 .  After spending some time in a Soviet camp for former concentration camp inmates ,  he embarked on an arduous journey home in the company of former Italian prisoners of war who had been part of the Italian Army in Russia .  His long railway journey home to Turin took him on a circuitous route from Poland ,  through Belarus ,  Ukraine ,  Romania ,  Hungary ,  Austria ,  and Germany .  In later writings ,  he noted the millions of displaced people on the roads and trains throughout Europe in that period . Levi was almost unrecognisable on his return to Turin .  Malnutrition edema had bloated his face .  Sporting a scrawny beard and wearing an old Red Army uniform ,  he returned to Corso Re Umberto .  The next few months gave him an opportunity to recover physically ,  re-establish contact with surviving friends and family ,  and start looking for work .  Levi suffered from the psychological trauma of his experiences .  Having been unable to find work in Turin ,  he started to look for work in Milan .  On his train journeys ,  he began to tell people he met stories about his time at Auschwitz . At a Jewish New Year party in 1946 ,  he met Lucia Morpurgo ,  who offered to teach him to dance .  Levi fell in love with Lucia .  At about this time ,  he started writing poetry about his experiences in Auschwitz . On 21 January 1946 he started work at DUCO ,  a Du Pont Company paint factory outside Turin .  Because of the extremely limited train service ,  Levi stayed in the factory dormitory during the week .  This gave him the opportunity to write undisturbed .  He started to write the first draft of If This Is a Man .  Every day he scribbled notes on train tickets and scraps of paper as memories came to him .  At the end of February ,  he had ten pages detailing the last ten days between the German evacuation and the arrival of the Red Army .  For the next ten months ,  the book took shape in his dormitory as he typed up his recollections each night . On 22 December 1946 ,  the manuscript was complete .  Lucia ,  who now reciprocated Levi's love ,  helped him to edit it ,  to make the narrative flow more naturally .  The social wounds of the war years were still too fresh ,  and he had no literary experience to give him a reputation as an author . Eventually Levi found a publisher ,  Franco Antonicelli ,  through a friend of his sister's .  Antonicelli was an amateur publisher ,  but as an active anti-Fascist ,  he supported the idea of the book . At the end of June 1947 ,  Levi suddenly left DUCO and teamed up with an old friend Alberto Salmoni to run a chemical consultancy from the top floor of Salmoni's parents' house .  Many of Levi's experiences of this time found their way into his later writing .  They made most of their money from making and supplying stannous chloride for mirror makers ,  delivering the unstable chemical by bicycle across the city .  The attempts to make lipsticks from reptile excreta and a coloured enamel to coat teeth were turned into short stories .  Accidents in their laboratory filled the Salmoni house with unpleasant smells and corrosive gases . In September 1947 ,  Levi married Lucia and a month later ,  on 11 October ,  If This Is a Man was published with a print run of 2 , 000 copies .  In April 1948 ,  with Lucia pregnant with their first child ,  Levi decided that the life of an independent chemist was too precarious .  He agreed to work for Accatti in the family paint business which traded under the name SIVA .  In October 1948 ,  his daughter Lisa was born . During this period ,  his friend Lorenzo Perrone's physical and psychological health declined .  Lorenzo had been a civilian forced worker in Auschwitz ,  who for six months had given part of his ration and a piece of bread to Levi without asking for anything in return .  In gratitude for his kindness in Auschwitz ,  Levi named both of his children ,  Lisa Lorenza and Renzo ,  after him . In 1950 ,  having demonstrated his chemical talents to Accatti ,  Levi was promoted to Technical Director at SIVA .  As SIVA's principal chemist and trouble shooter ,  Levi travelled abroad .  He made several trips to Germany and carefully engineered his contacts with senior German businessmen and scientists .  Wearing short-sleeved shirts ,  he made sure they saw his prison camp number tattooed on his arm . He became involved in organisations pledged to remembering and recording the horror of the camps .  In 1954 he visited Buchenwald to mark the ninth anniversary of the camp's liberation from the Nazis .  Levi dutifully attended many such anniversary events over the years and recounted his own experiences .  In July 1957 ,  his son Renzo was born ,  almost certainly named after his saviour Lorenzo Perrone . Despite a positive review by Italo Calvino in L'Unità ,  only 1 , 500 copies of If This Is a Man were sold .  In 1958 Einaudi ,  a major publisher ,  published it in a revised form and promoted it . In 1958 Stuart Woolf ,  in close collaboration with Levi ,  translated If This Is a Man into English ,  and it was published in the UK in 1959 by Orion Press .  Also in 1959 Heinz Riedt ,  also under close supervision by Levi ,  translated it into German .  As one of Levi's primary reasons for writing the book was to get the German people to realise what had been done in their name ,  and to accept at least partial responsibility ,  this translation was perhaps the most significant to him . Levi began writing The Truce early in 1961 ;  it was published in 1963 ,  almost 16 years after his first book .  That year it won the first annual Premio Campiello literary award .  It is often published in one volume with If This Is a Man ,  as it covers his long return through eastern Europe from Auschwitz .  Levi's reputation was growing .  He regularly contributed articles to La Stampa ,  the Turin newspaper .  He worked to gain a reputation as a writer about subjects other than surviving Auschwitz . In 1963 ,  he suffered his first major bout of depression .  At the time he had two young children ,  and a responsible job at a factory where accidents could and did have terrible consequences .  He travelled and became a public figure .  But the memory of what happened less than twenty years earlier still burned in his mind .  Today the link between such trauma and depression is better understood .  Doctors prescribed several different drugs over the years ,  but these had variable efficacy and side effects . In 1964 Levi collaborated on a radio play based upon If This Is a Man with the state broadcaster RAI ,  and in 1966 with a theatre production . He published two volumes of science fiction short stories under the pen name of Damiano Malabaila ,  which explored ethical and philosophical questions .  These imagined the effects on society of inventions which many would consider beneficial ,  but which ,  he saw ,  would have serious implications .  Many of the stories from the two books Storie naturali (Natural Histories ,  1966) and Vizio di forma (Structural Defect ,  1971) were later collected and published in English as The Sixth Day and Other Tales . In 1974 Levi arranged to go into semi-retirement from SIVA in order to have more time to write .  He also wanted to escape the burden of responsibility for managing the paint plant . In 1975 a collection of Levi's poetry was published under the title L'osteria di Brema (The Bremen Beer Hall) .  It was published in English as Shema :  Collected Poems . He wrote two other highly praised memoirs ,  Lilit e altri racconti (Moments of Reprieve ,  1978) and Il sistema periodico (The Periodic Table ,  1975) .  Moments of Reprieve deals with characters he observed during imprisonment .  The Periodic Table is a collection of short pieces ,  based in episodes from his life but including two short stories that he wrote while employed in 1941 at the asbestos mine in San Vittore .  Each story was related in some way to one of the chemical elements .  At London's Royal Institution on 19 October 2006 ,  The Periodic Table was voted onto the shortlist for the best science book ever written . In 1977 at the age of 58 ,  Levi retired as a part-time consultant at the SIVA paint factory to devote himself full-time to writing .  Like all his books ,  La chiave a stella (1978) ,  published in the US in 1986 as The Monkey Wrench and in the UK in 1987 as The Wrench ,  is difficult to categorize .  Some reviews describe it as a collection of stories about work and workers told by a narrator who resembles Levi .  Others have called it a novel ,  created by the linked stories and characters .  Set in a Fiat-run company town in Russia called Togliattigrad ,  it portrays the engineer as a hero on whom others depend .  The underlying philosophy is that pride in one's work is necessary for fulfillment .  The Piedmontese engineer Faussone travels the world as an expert in erecting cranes and bridges .  Left-wing critics said he did not describe the harsh working conditions on the assembly lines at Fiat .  It brought Levi a wider audience in Italy .  The Wrench won the Strega Prize in 1979 .  Most of the stories involve the solution of industrial problems by the use of troubleshooting skills ;  many stories come from the author's personal experience . In 1984 Levi published his only novel ,  If Not Now ,  When?— or his second novel ,  if The Monkey Wrench is counted .  It traces the fortunes of a group of Jewish partisans behind German lines during World War II as they seek to survive and continue their fight against the occupier .  With the ultimate goal of reaching Palestine to take part in the development of a Jewish national home ,  the partisan band reaches Poland and then German territory .  There the surviving members are officially received as displaced persons in territory held by the Western allies .  Finally ,  they succeed in reaching Italy ,  on their way to Palestine .  The novel won both the Premio Campiello and the Premio Viareggio . The book was inspired by events during Levi's train journey home after release from the camp ,  narrated in The Truce .  At one point in the journey ,  a band of Zionists hitched their wagon to the refugee train .  Levi was impressed by their strength ,  resolve ,  organisation ,  and sense of purpose . Levi became a major literary figure in Italy ,  and his books were translated into many other languages .  The Truce became a standard text in Italian schools .  In 1985 ,  he flew to the United States for a 20-day speaking tour .  Although he was accompanied by Lucia ,  the trip was very draining for him . In the Soviet Union his early works were not accepted by censors as he had portrayed Soviet soldiers as slovenly and disorderly rather than heroic .  In Israel ,  a country formed partly by Jewish survivors who lived through horrors similar to those Levi described ,  many of his works were not translated and published until after his death . In March 1985 he wrote the introduction to the re-publication of the autobiography of Rudolf Höss ,  who was commandant of Auschwitz concentration camp from 1940 to 1943 .  In it he writes ,  """"It's filled with evil  .   .   .  and reading it is agony . """"Also in 1985 a volume of his essays ,  previously published in La Stampa ,  was published under the title L'altrui mestiere (Other People's Trades) .  Levi used to write these stories and hoard them ,  releasing them to La Stampa at the rate of about one a week .  The essays ranged from book reviews and ponderings about strange things in nature ,  to fictional short stories . In 1986 his book I sommersi e i salvati (The Drowned and the Saved) ,  was published .  In it he tried to analyse why people behaved the way they did at Auschwitz ,  and why some survived whilst others perished .  In his typical style ,  he makes no judgments but presents the evidence and asks the questions .  For example ,  one essay examines what he calls """"The grey zone"""" ,  those Jews who did the Germans' dirty work for them and kept the rest of the prisoners in line .  He questioned ,  what made a concert violinist behave as a callous taskmaster?Also in 1986 another collection of short stories ,  previously published in La Stampa ,  was assembled and published as Racconti e saggi (some of which were published in the English volume The Mirror Maker) . At the time of his death in April 1987 ,  Levi was working on another selection of essays called The Double Bond ,  which took the form of letters to """"La Signorina"""" .  These essays are very personal in nature .  Approximately five or six chapters of this manuscript exist .  Carole Angier ,  in her biography of Levi ,  describes how she tracked some of these essays down .  She wrote that others were being kept from public view by Levi's close friends ,  to whom he gave them ,  and they may have been destroyed . In March 2007 Harper's Magazine published an English translation of Levi's story """"Knall"""" ,  about a fictitious weapon that is fatal at close range but harmless more than a meter away .  It originally appeared in his 1971 book Vizio di forma ,  but was published in English for the first time by Harper's . A Tranquil Star ,  a collection of seventeen stories translated into English by Ann Goldstein and Alessandra Bastagli was published in April 2007 . In 2015 ,  Penguin published The Complete Works of Primo Levi ,  ed .  Ann Goldstein .  This is the first time that Levi's entire oeuvre has been translated into English . Levi died on 11 April 1987 after a fall from the interior landing of his third-story apartment in Turin to the ground floor below .  The coroner ruled his death a suicide .  Three of his biographers (Angier ,  Thomson and Anissimov) agreed ,  but other writers (including at least one who knew him personally) questioned that determination . In his later life ,  Levi indicated that he was suffering from depression ;  factors likely included responsibility for his elderly mother and mother-in-law ,  with whom he was living ,  and lingering traumatic memories of his experiences . Several of Levi's friends and associates have argued otherwise .  The Oxford sociologist Diego Gambetta noted that Levi left no suicide note ,  nor any other indication that he was considering suicide .  Documents and testimony suggested that he had plans for both the short- and longer-term at the time .  In the days before his death ,  he had complained to his physician of dizziness due to an operation he had undergone some three weeks earlier .   After visiting the apartment complex ,  Gambetta suggested that Levi lost his balance and fell accidentally .

*** "*page_ Primo_Levi" "*cat_ Suicides_in_Italy" " Levi was born in 1919 in Turin ,  Italy ,  at Corso Re Umberto 75 ,  into a liberal Jewish family .  On their wedding day ,  Rina's father ,  Cesare Luzzati ,  gave Rina the apartment at Corso Re Umberto ,  where Primo Levi lived for almost his entire life . In 1921 Anna Maria ,  Levi's sister ,  was born ;  he remained close to her all her life .  In 1925 he entered the Felice Rignon primary school in Turin .  A thin and delicate child ,  he was shy and considered himself ugly ;  he excelled academically .  His school record includes long periods of absence during which he was tutored at home ,  at first by Emilia Glauda and then by Marisa Zini ,  daughter of philosopher Zino Zini . In September 1930 Levi entered the Massimo d'Azeglio Royal Gymnasium a year ahead of normal entrance requirements . In July 1934 at the age of 14 ,  he sat the exams for the Liceo Classico D'Azeglio ,  a Lyceum (sixth form or senior high school) specializing in the classics ,  and was admitted that year .  The school was noted for its well-known anti-Fascist teachers ,  among them the philosopher Norberto Bobbio ,  and Cesare Pavese ,  who later became one of Italy's best-known novelists . In 1937 ,  he was summoned before the War Ministry and accused of ignoring a draft notice from the Italian Royal Navy—one day before he was to write a final examination on Italy's participation in the Spanish Civil War ,  based on a quote from Thucydides :  """"We have the singular merit of being brave to the utmost degree . """" Distracted and terrified by the draft accusation ,  he failed the exam—the first poor grade of his life—and was devastated .  His father was able to keep him out of the Navy by enrolling him in the Fascist militia (Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale) .  He remained a member through his first year of university ,  until passage of the Italian Racial Laws of 1938 forced his expulsion .  Levi later recounted this series of events in the short story """"Fra Diavolo on the Po"""" . He retook and passed his final examinations ,  and in October enrolled at the University of Turin to study chemistry .  As one of 80 candidates ,  he spent three months taking lectures ,  and in February ,  after passing his colloquio (oral examination) ,  he was selected as one of 20 to move on to the full-time chemistry curriculum . In the liberal period as well as in the first decade of the Fascist regime ,  Jews held many public positions ,  and were prominent in literature ,  science and politics .  In 1929 Mussolini signed an agreement with the Catholic Church ,  the Lateran Treaty ,  which established Catholicism as the State religion ,  allowed the Church to influence many sectors of education and public life ,  and relegated other religions to the status of """"tolerated cults"""" .  In 1936 Italy's conquest of Ethiopia and the expansion of what the regime regarded as the Italian """"colonial empire"""" brought the question of """"race"""" to the forefront .  In the context set by these events ,  and the 1940 alliance with Hitler's Germany ,  the situation of the Jews of Italy changed radically . In July 1938 a group of prominent Italian scientists and intellectuals published the """"Manifesto of Race , """" a mixture of racial and ideological antisemitic theories from ancient and modern sources .  This treatise formed the basis for the Italian Racial Laws of October 1938 .  After its enactment Italian Jews lost their basic civil rights ,  positions in public offices ,  and their assets .  Their books were prohibited :  Jewish writers could no longer publish in magazines owned by Aryans .  Jewish students who had begun their course of study were permitted to continue ,  but new Jewish students were barred from entering university .  Levi had matriculated a year earlier than scheduled enabling him to take a degree . In 1939 Levi began his love affair with hiking in the mountains .  In June 1940 Italy declared war as an ally of Germany against Britain and France ,  and the first Allied air raids on Turin began two days later .  Levi's studies continued during the bombardments .  The family suffered additional strain as his father became bedridden with bowel cancer . Because of the new racial laws and the increasing intensity of prevalent fascism ,  Levi had difficulty finding a supervisor for his graduation thesis ,  which was on the subject of Walden inversion ,  a study of the asymmetry of the carbon atom .  Eventually taken on by Dr .  Nicolò Dallaporta ,  he graduated in mid-1941 with full marks and merit ,  having submitted additional theses on x-rays and electrostatic energy .  His degree certificate bore the remark ,  """"of Jewish race"""" .  The racial laws prevented Levi from finding a suitable permanent job after graduation . In December 1941 Levi received an informal job offer from an Italian officer to work as a chemist ,  under a clandestine identity ,  at an asbestos mine in San Vittore .  The project was to extract nickel from the mine spoil ,  a challenge he accepted with pleasure .  Levi later understood that ,  if successful ,  he would be aiding the German war effort ,  which was suffering nickel shortages in the production of armaments . In July 1943 ,  King Victor Emmanuel III deposed Mussolini and appointed a new government under Marshal Pietro Badoglio ,  prepared to sign the Armistice of Cassibile with the Allies .

In September 1947 ,  Levi married Lucia and a month later ,  on 11 October ,  If This Is a Man was published with a print run of 2 , 000 copies .  In April 1948 ,  with Lucia pregnant with their first child ,  Levi decided that the life of an independent chemist was too precarious .  He agreed to work for Accatti in the family paint business which traded under the name SIVA .  In October 1948 ,  his daughter Lisa was born . During this period ,  his friend Lorenzo Perrone's physical and psychological health declined .  Lorenzo had been a civilian forced worker in Auschwitz ,  who for six months had given part of his ration and a piece of bread to Levi without asking for anything in return .  In gratitude for his kindness in Auschwitz ,  Levi named both of his children ,  Lisa Lorenza and Renzo ,  after him . In 1950 ,  having demonstrated his chemical talents to Accatti ,  Levi was promoted to Technical Director at SIVA .  As SIVA's principal chemist and trouble shooter ,  Levi travelled abroad .  He made several trips to Germany and carefully engineered his contacts with senior German businessmen and scientists .  Wearing short-sleeved shirts ,  he made sure they saw his prison camp number tattooed on his arm . He became involved in organisations pledged to remembering and recording the horror of the camps .  In 1954 he visited Buchenwald to mark the ninth anniversary of the camp's liberation from the Nazis .  Levi dutifully attended many such anniversary events over the years and recounted his own experiences .  In July 1957 ,  his son Renzo was born ,  almost certainly named after his saviour Lorenzo Perrone . Despite a positive review by Italo Calvino in L'Unità ,  only 1 , 500 copies of If This Is a Man were sold .  In 1958 Einaudi ,  a major publisher ,  published it in a revised form and promoted it . In 1958 Stuart Woolf ,  in close collaboration with Levi ,  translated If This Is a Man into English ,  and it was published in the UK in 1959 by Orion Press .  Also in 1959 Heinz Riedt ,  also under close supervision by Levi ,  translated it into German .  As one of Levi's primary reasons for writing the book was to get the German people to realise what had been done in their name ,  and to accept at least partial responsibility ,  this translation was perhaps the most significant to him . Levi began writing The Truce early in 1961 ;  it was published in 1963 ,  almost 16 years after his first book .  That year it won the first annual Premio Campiello literary award .  It is often published in one volume with If This Is a Man ,  as it covers his long return through eastern Europe from Auschwitz .  Levi's reputation was growing .  He regularly contributed articles to La Stampa ,  the Turin newspaper .  He worked to gain a reputation as a writer about subjects other than surviving Auschwitz . In 1963 ,  he suffered his first major bout of depression .  At the time he had two young children ,  and a responsible job at a factory where accidents could and did have terrible consequences .  He travelled and became a public figure .  But the memory of what happened less than twenty years earlier still burned in his mind .  Today the link between such trauma and depression is better understood .  Doctors prescribed several different drugs over the years ,  but these had variable efficacy and side effects . In 1964 Levi collaborated on a radio play based upon If This Is a Man with the state broadcaster RAI ,  and in 1966 with a theatre production . He published two volumes of science fiction short stories under the pen name of Damiano Malabaila ,  which explored ethical and philosophical questions .  These imagined the effects on society of inventions which many would consider beneficial ,  but which ,  he saw ,  would have serious implications .  Many of the stories from the two books Storie naturali (Natural Histories ,  1966) and Vizio di forma (Structural Defect ,  1971) were later collected and published in English as The Sixth Day and Other Tales . In 1974 Levi arranged to go into semi-retirement from SIVA in order to have more time to write .  He also wanted to escape the burden of responsibility for managing the paint plant . In 1975 a collection of Levi's poetry was published under the title L'osteria di Brema (The Bremen Beer Hall) .  It was published in English as Shema :  Collected Poems . He wrote two other highly praised memoirs ,  Lilit e altri racconti (Moments of Reprieve ,  1978) and Il sistema periodico (The Periodic Table ,  1975) .  Moments of Reprieve deals with characters he observed during imprisonment .  The Periodic Table is a collection of short pieces ,  based in episodes from his life but including two short stories that he wrote while employed in 1941 at the asbestos mine in San Vittore .  Each story was related in some way to one of the chemical elements .  At London's Royal Institution on 19 October 2006 ,  The Periodic Table was voted onto the shortlist for the best science book ever written . In 1977 at the age of 58 ,  Levi retired as a part-time consultant at the SIVA paint factory to devote himself full-time to writing .  Like all his books ,  La chiave a stella (1978) ,  published in the US in 1986 as The Monkey Wrench and in the UK in 1987 as The Wrench ,  is difficult to categorize .  Some reviews describe it as a collection of stories about work and workers told by a narrator who resembles Levi .  Others have called it a novel ,  created by the linked stories and characters .  Set in a Fiat-run company town in Russia called Togliattigrad ,  it portrays the engineer as a hero on whom others depend .  The underlying philosophy is that pride in one's work is necessary for fulfillment .  The Piedmontese engineer Faussone travels the world as an expert in erecting cranes and bridges .  Left-wing critics said he did not describe the harsh working conditions on the assembly lines at Fiat .  It brought Levi a wider audience in Italy .  The Wrench won the Strega Prize in 1979 .  Most of the stories involve the solution of industrial problems by the use of troubleshooting skills ;  many stories come from the author's personal experience . In 1984 Levi published his only novel ,  If Not Now ,  When?— or his second novel ,  if The Monkey Wrench is counted .  It traces the fortunes of a group of Jewish partisans behind German lines during World War II as they seek to survive and continue their fight against the occupier .  With the ultimate goal of reaching Palestine to take part in the development of a Jewish national home ,  the partisan band reaches Poland and then German territory .  There the surviving members are officially received as displaced persons in territory held by the Western allies .  Finally ,  they succeed in reaching Italy ,  on their way to Palestine .  The novel won both the Premio Campiello and the Premio Viareggio . The book was inspired by events during Levi's train journey home after release from the camp ,  narrated in The Truce .  At one point in the journey ,  a band of Zionists hitched their wagon to the refugee train .  Levi was impressed by their strength ,  resolve ,  organisation ,  and sense of purpose . Levi became a major literary figure in Italy ,  and his books were translated into many other languages .  The Truce became a standard text in Italian schools .  In 1985 ,  he flew to the United States for a 20-day speaking tour .  Although he was accompanied by Lucia ,  the trip was very draining for him . In the Soviet Union his early works were not accepted by censors as he had portrayed Soviet soldiers as slovenly and disorderly rather than heroic .  In Israel ,  a country formed partly by Jewish survivors who lived through horrors similar to those Levi described ,  many of his works were not translated and published until after his death . In March 1985 he wrote the introduction to the re-publication of the autobiography of Rudolf Höss ,  who was commandant of Auschwitz concentration camp from 1940 to 1943 .  In it he writes ,  """"It's filled with evil  .   .   .  and reading it is agony . """"Also in 1985 a volume of his essays ,  previously published in La Stampa ,  was published under the title L'altrui mestiere (Other People's Trades) .  Levi used to write these stories and hoard them ,  releasing them to La Stampa at the rate of about one a week .  The essays ranged from book reviews and ponderings about strange things in nature ,  to fictional short stories . In 1986 his book I sommersi e i salvati (The Drowned and the Saved) ,  was published .  In it he tried to analyse why people behaved the way they did at Auschwitz ,  and why some survived whilst others perished .  In his typical style ,  he makes no judgments but presents the evidence and asks the questions .  For example ,  one essay examines what he calls """"The grey zone"""" ,  those Jews who did the Germans' dirty work for them and kept the rest of the prisoners in line .  He questioned ,  what made a concert violinist behave as a callous taskmaster?Also in 1986 another collection of short stories ,  previously published in La Stampa ,  was assembled and published as Racconti e saggi (some of which were published in the English volume The Mirror Maker) . At the time of his death in April 1987 ,  Levi was working on another selection of essays called The Double Bond ,  which took the form of letters to """"La Signorina"""" .  These essays are very personal in nature .  Approximately five or six chapters of this manuscript exist .  Carole Angier ,  in her biography of Levi ,  describes how she tracked some of these essays down .  She wrote that others were being kept from public view by Levi's close friends ,  to whom he gave them ,  and they may have been destroyed . In March 2007 Harper's Magazine published an English translation of Levi's story """"Knall"""" ,  about a fictitious weapon that is fatal at close range but harmless more than a meter away .  It originally appeared in his 1971 book Vizio di forma ,  but was published in English for the first time by Harper's . A Tranquil Star ,  a collection of seventeen stories translated into English by Ann Goldstein and Alessandra Bastagli was published in April 2007 . In 2015 ,  Penguin published The Complete Works of Primo Levi ,  ed .  Ann Goldstein .  This is the first time that Levi's entire oeuvre has been translated into English . Levi died on 11 April 1987 after a fall from the interior landing of his third-story apartment in Turin to the ground floor below .  The coroner ruled his death a suicide .  Three of his biographers (Angier ,  Thomson and Anissimov) agreed ,  but other writers (including at least one who knew him personally) questioned that determination . In his later life ,  Levi indicated that he was suffering from depression ;  factors likely included responsibility for his elderly mother and mother-in-law ,  with whom he was living ,  and lingering traumatic memories of his experiences . Several of Levi's friends and associates have argued otherwise .  The Oxford sociologist Diego Gambetta noted that Levi left no suicide note ,  nor any other indication that he was considering suicide .  Documents and testimony suggested that he had plans for both the short- and longer-term at the time .  In the days before his death ,  he had complained to his physician of dizziness due to an operation he had undergone some three weeks earlier .   After visiting the apartment complex ,  Gambetta suggested that Levi lost his balance and fell accidentally .

He studied chemistry at the universities of Jena ,  Bonn ,  and Münster .  He volunteered for the army on the outbreak of World War I in 1914 and spent two years in the artillery before training as an aerial artillery spotterAfter the war Ley returned to university ,  gaining a doctorate in 1920 .  He was employed as a food chemist by a branch of the giant IG Farben company ,  based in Leverkusen in the Ruhr .  Enraged by the French occupation of the Ruhr in 1924 ,  Ley became an ultra-nationalist and joined the Nazi Party soon after reading Adolf Hitler's speech at his trial following the Beer Hall Putsch in Munich .  Ley proved unswervingly loyal to Hitler ,  which led Hitler to ignore complaints about his arrogance ,  incompetence and drunkenness .  Ley's impoverished upbringing and his experience as head of the largely working-class Rhineland party region meant that he was sympathetic to those elements in the party who were open to socialism ,  but he always sided with Hitler in inner party disputes .  This helped him survive the hostility of other party officials such as the party treasurer ,  Franz Xaver Schwarz ,  who regarded him as an incompetent drunk .      "

Macfadyen initially operated from Madras and achieved considerable success .  He was nominated to the Madras Legislative Council for the terms 1874–75 and 1875–76 .  He was also elected as the President of the Madras Chamber of Commerce  in 1875 . In 1876 ,  Macfadyen was appointed to the newly established executive committee of management of the Madras School of Arts . Macfadyen traded in West Indian sugar and owned businesses in Java .  He even invested in railroads in the United States of America .  Based on his connections in Madras ,  Macfadyen established P .  Macfayden & Co .  ,  the London branch of the Arbuthnot Bank .  That firm is still remembered for the pooling arrangements in cross-border insolvencies .  Macfadyen committed suicide on Saturday ,  20 October 1906 ,  at age 65 ,  by walking into a railway tunnel in Shoreditch near the Old Street station as a train was approaching . Macfadyen was seen at the office until around 11 in the morning on Saturday .  Initially ,  witnesses stated that he was """"worried-looking when he left the bank"""" but there was no indication that he planned to harm himself ,  and his friends stated that they believed he wandered onto the train line absentmindedly .  None of the railway officials at the Old Street Station reported seeing him walk off the platform and into the tunnel . Ernest Wallace ,  manager of the firm ,  said he saw Macfadyen on the Saturday morning of his death ,  when he stopped by the office for approximately an hour .  He was greatly worried about business matters and left a letter for him that stated ,  """"October 20th  – Dear Mr .  Wallace ,  Enclosed from Arbuthnot and Co .  is the last straw .  I suppose must put down the catastrophe our endeavour to keep Arbuthnot and Co .  going .  Wills (solicitor) will advise you .

Several other business associates and old friends ,  including Sir Lewis McIver ,  testified at the inquest into Macfadyen's death with various stories about his recently distraught and altered behavior .  The judge delivered a verdict of suicide while of unsound mind . Macfadyen's suicide and the subsequent claims on his estate by creditors received significant coverage in the British media .  It was reported that his body was found """"cut in pieces"""" and he had been decapitated .  "

*** "*page_ Magda_Goebbels" "*cat_ Joint_suicides_by_Nazis" " Magda was born in 1901 in Berlin ,  Germany to unwed Auguste Behrend and building contractor and engineer Oskar Ritschel . In 2016 ,  it was reported that Friedländer may have been actually Magda's biological father ,  as stated in his residency card ,  found in the Berlin archives by writer and historian Oliver Hilmes . From 1908 until the outbreak of World War I ,  the family remained in Brussels .  At that time ,  all Germans were forced to leave Belgium as refugees to avoid repercussions from the Belgian people after the German invasion .    In late April 1945 ,  the Soviet Red Army entered Berlin ,  and the Goebbels family moved into the Vorbunker ,  connected to the lower Führerbunker under the Reich Chancellery garden . My beloved son! By now we have been in the Führerbunker for six days already—daddy ,  your six little siblings and I ,  for the sake of giving our national socialistic lives the only possible honourable end  .  .  .  You shall know that I stayed here against daddy's will ,  and that even on last Sunday the Führer wanted to help me to get out .  You know your mother—we have the same blood ,  for me there was no wavering .  Our glorious idea is ruined and with it everything beautiful and marvelous that I have known in my life .  The world that comes after the Führer and national socialism is not any longer worth living in and therefore I took the children with me ,  for they are too good for the life that would follow ,  and a merciful God will understand me when I will give them the salvation  .  .  .  The children are wonderful  .  .  .  there never is a word of complaint nor crying .  The impacts are shaking the bunker .  The elder kids cover the younger ones ,  their presence is a blessing and they are making the Führer smile once in a while .  May God help that I have the strength to perform the last and hardest .  We only have one goal left :  loyalty to the Führer even in death .  Harald ,  my dear son—I want to give you what I learned in life :  be loyal! Loyal to yourself ,  loyal to the people and loyal to your country  .  .  .  Be proud of us and try to keep us in dear memory  .  .  . Goebbels added a postscript to Hitler's last will and testament of 29 April stating that he would disobey the order to leave Berlin ,  """"Magda was among the last to see both Hitler and Eva Braun before they committed suicide on the afternoon of 30 April . Magda appears to have contemplated and talked about killing her children a month in advance .  According to her friend and sister-in-law (from her first marriage) Ello Quandt ,  she told her that they were all going to take poison . We have demanded monstrous things from the German people ,  treated other nations with pitiless cruelty .  For this the victors will exact their full revenge .  .  . we can't let them think we are cowards .  Everybody else has the right to live .  We haven't got this right—we have forfeited it .  I make myself responsible .  I belonged .  I believed in Hitler and for long enough in Joseph Goebbels .  .  . Suppose I remain alive ,  I should immediately be arrested and interrogated about Joseph .  If I tell the truth I must reveal what sort of man he was—must describe all that happened behind the scenes .  Then any respectable person would turn from me in disgust .  It would be equally impossible to do the opposite—that is to defend what he has done ,  to justify him to his enemies ,  to speak up for him out of true conviction .  .  . That would go against my conscience .  So you see ,  Ello ,  it would be quite impossible for me to go on living .  We will take the children with us ,  they are too good ,  too lovely for the world which lies ahead .  In the days to come Joseph will be regarded as one of the greatest criminals that Germany has ever produced .  His children would hear that said daily ,  people would torment them ,  despise and humiliate them .  They would have to bear the burden of his sins and vengeance would be wreaked on them .  .  .  It has all happened before .  You know how I told you at the time quite frankly what the Führer said in the Café Anast in Munich when he saw the little Jewish boy ,  you remember? That he would like to squash him flat like a bug on the wall .  .  . I couldn't believe it and thought it was just provocative talk .  But he really did it later .  It was all so unspeakably gruesome .  .  . Magda appears to have refused several offers ,  such as one by Albert Speer ,  to have the children smuggled out of Berlin and insisted that the family must stay at her husband's side .  In the Führerbunker she confided to Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge ,  that """"I would rather have my children die ,  than live in disgrace ,  jeered at .  My children stand no chance in Germany after the war"""" .  The last survivor of Hitler's bunker ,  Rochus Misch ,  gave this account of the events to the BBC : Straight after Hitler's death ,  Mrs .  Goebbels came down to the bunker with her children .  She started preparing to kill them .  She couldn't have done that above ground—there were other people there who would have stopped her .  That's why she came downstairs—because no-one else was allowed in the bunker .  She came down on purpose to kill them . Magda helped the girls change into long white nightgowns .  She then softly combed their hair .  Misch tried to concentrate on his work ,  but he knew what was going to happen . After their children were dead ,  Magda and Joseph Goebbels walked up to the garden of the Chancellery ,  where they committed suicide . The charred corpses were found on the afternoon of 2 May 1945 by Soviet troops .  Magda's face was unrecognizable compared to that of her husband .  "

While in the Marines ,  Manookian had supplied illustrations for Leatherneck Magazine and produced about 75 ink drawings for McClellan’s history of the United States Marine Corps ,  which was never published .  These drawings are now in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art .  His oil paintings are rare and highly valued based on their almost iconic status and scarcity due to his early death ,  by suicide ,  in 1931 .  Only 31 of his oil paintings are known to exist . In early 2010 a group of seven Manookian paintings owned by the Hotel Hana-Maui were removed from public display .  They were the only Manookian oil paintings known to be on public display anywhere in the world .   Two of the murals ,  Red Sails and Hawaiian Boy and Girl ,  are now on long-term loan to the Honolulu Museum of Art .

When he was 18 years old ,  he enlisted in the police .  He had been deemed physically unfit because of his small stature and low weight ,  but managed to enter the force thanks to a relative .  In 1973 ,  he fought against 15 demonstrators of the Juventud Peronista during a brawl downtown ,  in which he was hit with a glass bottle ,  leaving him a scar that would last for the rest of his life .  Two years after this ,  he killed Julio Alsogaray ,  a militant of Montoneros guerrilla faction ,  in a one-on-one confrontation .  He shot him with a FN FAL rifle .  During the Military Junta rule ,  he was suspended for two years and five months ,  after being accused by his superiors of the senseless use of lethal force .  In 1986 ,  after the return of democracy ,  he was prosecuted for the killing of the well known criminal Enrique """"Prode"""" Correa ,  but justice acquitted him for lack of evidence .  One year later ,  when he was the chief of Robos y Hurtos ,  (Robbery Division of the Police , ) he was involved in a shooting in the northern approaches to the city of San Miguel de Tucumán ,  in which two members of a prominent crime family were killed .  In 1988 ,  he was accused of the killing of another member of that same crime family ,  Daniel Carrizo ,  who had also been tortured in a cell of the Robbery Division's headquarters before his death .  He was again acquitted .  In January 1990 ,  he was named chief of the General Investigations Division ,  and two months later led a police strike against governor José Domato ,  which forced the Gendarmería Nacional Argentina to take the law enforcing duties in the province until the dispute was resolved in his favor .  This earned him the respect and affection of his co-workers .     He would spend the rest of his life living in his property in San Andrés ,  a few kilometers from his place of birth .  In 2008 ,  during the trials for crimes against humanity that took place during the Kirchnerism government ,  he was again prosecuted for crimes he had supposedly committed during the Dirty War .  On November 21 ,  Gendarmería Nacional was sent to his house to arrest him .  He climbed up a water tower and was followed by a TV camera crew from national news broadcaster Crónica TV .  As he saw he had been surrounded by about 20 policemen ,  and with no intention of going back to prison ,  he took a gun and shot himself in the head .  He had stated earlier that day that he would take any measure in order not to go to jail again .  When asked if he was capable of killing himself ,  he said he'd do """"Just like Hannibal"""" .  TV cameras captured this moment from a very close distance ,  as he was being interviewed and took this decision totally unexpectedly .  His death was broadcast to the whole nation .

In 1892 his parents took the family to his mother's native city ,  Przemyśl ,  Austria-Hungary (now Poland) ,  where they worked as innkeepers .  However ,  this venture also failed and his family never joined him in America . Instead Louis returned to Britain ,  and had his family join him in London in 1896 ,  when Marks' forename was anglicised as """"Mark"""" . From an early age Gertler showed signs of a great talent for drawing .  On leaving school in 1906 ,  he enrolled in art classes at Regent Street Polytechnic .  Unfortunately ,  due to his family's poverty ,  he was forced to drop out after a year ,  and in December 1907 began working as an  apprentice at Clayton & Bell ,  a stained glass company .  The application was successful .  Upon the advice of the prominent Jewish artist William Rothenstein ,  in 1908 he enrolled at the Slade School of Art in London .  During the four years he spent at the Slade ,  Gertler was a contemporary of Paul Nash ,  Edward Wadsworth ,  C .  R .  W .  Nevinson ,  Stanley Spencer ,  Isaac Rosenberg ,  and Morris Goldstein ,  among others . During his time at the Slade ,  Gertler met the painter Dora Carrington ,  whom he pursued relentlessly for many years .   Gertler's patron was Lady Ottoline Morrell ,  Gertler was soon enjoying success as a painter of society portraits ,  but his temperamental manner and devotion to advancing his work according to his own vision led to increasing personal frustration and the alienation of potential sitters and buyers .  As a result ,  he struggled frequently with poverty . In 1914 the polymath art collector Edward Marsh became Gertler's patron .  The relationship between the two men proved a difficult one ,  as Gertler felt that the system of patronage and the circle in which he moved were in direct conflict with his sense of self .  In 1916 ,  as World War I dragged on ,  Gertler ended the relationship due to his pacifism and conscientious objection (Marsh was secretary to Winston Churchill and patron to some of the war poets) .  Gertler's major painting ,  Merry-Go-Round ,  was created in the midst of the war years and was described by D .  H .  Lawrence as """"the best modern picture I have seen"""" . In 1913 Gertler met the author and poet Gilbert Cannan ,  who later described him as """"a small passionate man with green eyes"""" .  Cannan subsequently invited Mark to stay with him and his wife Mary at their Mill House in Cholesbury and the two men became good friends .  Gertler lived there on and off during 1915–16 ,  and painted Gilbert Cannan at his Mill (now on view in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford) .  The picture depicts Cannan outside the Mill with his two dogs .  The black and white one ,  Luath ,  had been the inspiration for the dog Nana in the stage production of J .  M .  Barrie's Peter Pan .  It was Cannan who was responsible for introducing Lady Ottoline Morrell to Gertler's paintings and encouraging her to support his work .  Cannan closely based the young Jewish character of his 1916 novel Mendel on Gertler's early life including his infatuation and affair with fellow artist Dora Carrington .  This relationship remained unfulfilled as Carrington spurned his numerous advances and instead declared her love for Lytton Strachey .  The friendship of Cannan and Gertler waned after 1916 ,  largely because of Cannan's increasingly unstable behaviour . Virginia Woolf recorded her impressions of Gertler after he came to visit her and her husband in Sussex in September 1918 .  As he left they cried , """"Good God ,  what an egoist!"""" We have been talking about Gertler to Gertler for some 30 hours ;  it is like putting a microscope to your eye .  One molehill is wonderfully clear ;  the surrounding world ceases to exist .  But he is a forcible young man ;  if limited ,  able & respectable within those limits ;  as hard as a cricket ball ;  & as tightly rounded & stuffed in at the edges .  We discussed—well ,  it always came back to Gertler .  """"I have a very peculiar character  .  .  .  I am not like any other artist  .  .  .  My picture would not have those blank spaces  .  .  .  I don't see that ,  because in my case I have a sense which other people don’t have  .  .  .  I saw in a moment what she had never dreamt of seeing  .  .  . """" & so on .  And if you do slip a little away ,  he watches very jealously ,  from his own point of view ,  & somehow tricks you back again .  He hoards an insatiable vanity .  I suspect the truth to be that he is very anxious for the good opinion of people like ourselves ,  & would immensely like to be thought well of by Duncan  .  His triumphs have been too cheap so far .  However this is honestly outspoken ,  & as I say ,  he has power & intelligence ,  & will ,  one sees ,  paint good interesting pictures ,  though some rupture of the brain would have to take place before he could be a painter . Gertler's later works developed a sometimes very harsh edge ,  influenced by his increasing ill health .  In 1920 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis ,  which forced him to enter a sanatorium on a number of occasions during the twenties and thirties .  Two of Gertler's close friends ,  D .  H .  Lawrence and Katherine Mansfield ,  succumbed to the disease . In 1930 Gertler married Marjorie Greatorex Hodgkinson ,  The marriage was often difficult ,  punctuated by the frequent ill health of both ,  and with Gertler often suffering from the same feelings of constraint that destroyed his relationships with a number of friends and patrons . During the 1930s he became a part-time teacher at the Westminster School of Art in order to supplement his intermittent income from painting . Gertler gassed himself in his London studio in 1939 ,  having attempted suicide on at least one occasion in 1936 .   He was suffering at the time from increasing financial difficulties ,  his wife had recently left him ,  he had held a critically derided exhibition at the Lefevre Gallery ,  he was still depressed over the death of his mother and Carrington's own suicide (both in 1932) ,  and he was filled with fear over the imminent world war .  He was buried at Willesden Jewish Cemetery .   "

However ,  this venture also failed and his family never joined him in America . Instead Louis returned to Britain ,  and had his family join him in London in 1896 ,  when Marks' forename was anglicised as """"Mark"""" . From an early age Gertler showed signs of a great talent for drawing .  On leaving school in 1906 ,  he enrolled in art classes at Regent Street Polytechnic .  Unfortunately ,  due to his family's poverty ,  he was forced to drop out after a year ,  and in December 1907 began working as an  apprentice at Clayton & Bell ,  a stained glass company .  The application was successful .  Upon the advice of the prominent Jewish artist William Rothenstein ,  in 1908 he enrolled at the Slade School of Art in London .  During the four years he spent at the Slade ,  Gertler was a contemporary of Paul Nash ,  Edward Wadsworth ,  C .  R .  W .  Nevinson ,  Stanley Spencer ,  Isaac Rosenberg ,  and Morris Goldstein ,  among others . During his time at the Slade ,  Gertler met the painter Dora Carrington ,  whom he pursued relentlessly for many years .   Gertler's patron was Lady Ottoline Morrell ,  Gertler was soon enjoying success as a painter of society portraits ,  but his temperamental manner and devotion to advancing his work according to his own vision led to increasing personal frustration and the alienation of potential sitters and buyers .  As a result ,  he struggled frequently with poverty . In 1914 the polymath art collector Edward Marsh became Gertler's patron .  The relationship between the two men proved a difficult one ,  as Gertler felt that the system of patronage and the circle in which he moved were in direct conflict with his sense of self .  In 1916 ,  as World War I dragged on ,  Gertler ended the relationship due to his pacifism and conscientious objection (Marsh was secretary to Winston Churchill and patron to some of the war poets) .  Gertler's major painting ,  Merry-Go-Round ,  was created in the midst of the war years and was described by D .  H .  Lawrence as """"the best modern picture I have seen"""" . In 1913 Gertler met the author and poet Gilbert Cannan ,  who later described him as """"a small passionate man with green eyes"""" .  Cannan subsequently invited Mark to stay with him and his wife Mary at their Mill House in Cholesbury and the two men became good friends .  Gertler lived there on and off during 1915–16 ,  and painted Gilbert Cannan at his Mill (now on view in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford) .  The picture depicts Cannan outside the Mill with his two dogs .  The black and white one ,  Luath ,  had been the inspiration for the dog Nana in the stage production of J .  M .  Barrie's Peter Pan .  It was Cannan who was responsible for introducing Lady Ottoline Morrell to Gertler's paintings and encouraging her to support his work .  Cannan closely based the young Jewish character of his 1916 novel Mendel on Gertler's early life including his infatuation and affair with fellow artist Dora Carrington .  This relationship remained unfulfilled as Carrington spurned his numerous advances and instead declared her love for Lytton Strachey .  The friendship of Cannan and Gertler waned after 1916 ,  largely because of Cannan's increasingly unstable behaviour . Virginia Woolf recorded her impressions of Gertler after he came to visit her and her husband in Sussex in September 1918 .  As he left they cried , """"Good God ,  what an egoist!""""

While still just a teenager ,  Marty was playing baseball for a local team ,  the Brookfields .  One of his teammates was Connie Mack ,  who would later manage the Philadelphia Athletics for 50 years .  Recognized as a great fielder ,  Bergen tended to obsess about minor problems and displayed an argumentative personality ,  traits that negatively affected his enjoyment of the game .    In January 1900 ,  at his home in North Brookfield ,  Massachusetts ,  the 28-year-old Bergen was found dead in a murder–suicide .  The medical examiner reported that Bergen killed his wife and two children with an axe ,  then used a straight razor to forcefully cut his own throat .  Bergen's father discovered the bodies .  According to The New York Times : The little boy In actuality ,  the razor cut likely would not have been able to sever enough ligaments to go deep enough to nearly sever Bergen's head ,  but it would have created a lot of blood from slicing the jugular vein and carotid artery ,  making it appear that the head had been nearly severed from the body . Following Bergen's death ,  media outlets reported that he had been subject to """"fits of melancholy"""" and had """"showed signs of insanity"""" in the fall of 1899 . His death ended Bergen's career after four seasons ,  during which he played in 344 major league games for the Beaneaters ,  337 of which came at the catcher position .  He had a career batting average of  . 265 with 180 runs scored ,  339 hits ,  69 extra base hits ,  10 home runs ,  and 176 RBI . Bergen and his wife and children were buried at Saint Joseph's Cemetery on Bell Street in North Brookfield ;  his grave remained unmarked for several years . The death of Bergen prevented him from ever playing against his brother Bill ,  who was also a major league catcher for the Cincinnati Reds and the Brooklyn Superbas from 1901 to 1911 .  "

In 1964 ,  Hartman was signed to play the ingénue lead in the comedy Everybody Out ,  the Castle is Sinking ,  which was not a success ,  however her performance was again positively received ,  and film producers took notice .   In 1964 ,  Hartman was screen-tested by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Warner Brothers .

She was said to have won over director Mark Robson ,  who had been enthralled with her performance in You're a Big Boy Now .  However ,  the following month ,  it was announced that Oscar-winner Patty Duke had signed on to play Neely ,  albeit against her agent's advice . Between the mid-1960s and early 1970s ,  Hartman appeared in three well-received films ,  two of which starred Broadway and Hollywood legend Geraldine Page ,  The Group (1966) ,  She was highly praised for the performance ;  however ,  this proved to be her last Hollywood film role .

*** "*page_ Mary_Kay_Bergman" "*cat_ Female_suicides" " Mary Kay Bergman was born on June 5 ,  1961 ,  in Los Angeles .  She was the only child of musicians David """"Dave"""" Bergman and Patricia Paris """"Pat"""" McGowan . Her parents performed as a singing duo at lounges and clubs in Reno and Las Vegas and in Los Angeles .  They settled in Los Angeles after her mother became pregnant . Bergman attended Le Conte Middle School and Hollywood High School ,  graduating in June 1978 with top academic honors .  Following in the steps of one of her idols ,  Carol Burnett ,  Bergman attended University of California ,  Los Angeles (UCLA)  After getting cast in an equity-waiver play outside of school ,  Bergman decided to leave UCLA .  Having started acting in high school plays , Bergman's next post was as a receptionist for the Boy Scouts of America .  She enjoyed the job and was pleased to work with the people of the organization .  Bergman commented ,  """"All the time I kept hearing ,  'Gosh ,  you have a lovely speaking voice .  You should do something with that . '""""The origins of Bergman's voice acting can be traced to when she attended a housewarming party at one of her co-workers' houses .  Someone brought a karaoke machine to the party and Bergman started """"going wild"""" ,  using several different voices .  One of the guests at the party was studying with voice-over coach Kat Lehman and suggested she take a class with his teacher ,  which she did . Bergman took many voice-over classes in order to do many different styles and voices .  Some specialized in animation ,  some in ADR/looping ,  and others in commercial and improvisation .  Bergman studied the voice of a character if she was matching a voice . In 1994 , After her first voice role as a frightened woman in a radio commercial for a small home security company on a local station in 1986 , Disney was pleased with her performance ,  but she agreed to accept future jobs only when Caselotti was unavailable .  She later learned that Disney had different plans . Bergman was the original voice for most of the female characters for South Park and the feature film South Park :  Bigger ,  Longer & Uncut (1999) .  Her characters included Liane Cartman ,  Sheila Broflovski ,  Shelly Marsh ,  Sharon Marsh ,  Carol McCormick and Wendy Testaburger .  She was originally credited as Shannen Cassidy (taken from stars Shannen Doherty and David Cassidy) out of concerns regarding possible conflicts with her continued work as Disney's official Snow White voice .  """"It was a conscious decision to be anonymous at first ,  because none of us knew the show would be a hit ,  and if anyone tells you they did ,  they're lying"""" ,  she said .  """"Then it did hit ,  and Shannen Cassidy was getting mail like Santa Claus ,  so we transitioned out of it . """" Bergman credited South Park for pulling her out of a typecasting rut .  """"I'm known for these sweet ,  cute little characters"""" ,  she said ,  noting her roles in various Disney films .  """"So I've been doing them forever .  My agents were trying to submit me on shows that are edgy ,  and they're laughing ,  'Mary Kay ,  are you kidding? No way!'"""" After Bergman's death ,  the two episodes """"Starvin' Marvin in Space"""" (the final episode for which she recorded original dialogue) and """"Mr .  Hankey's Christmas Classics"""" (the final episode in which her voice was used via archive footage) were dedicated in her memory . Bergman worked on over 400 television commercials ,  including the voice of Mrs .  Butterworth in Mrs .  Butterworth's syrup commercials .  She had roles in many Disney films ,  including Beauty and the Beast ,  as the Bimbettes ;  The Hunchback of Notre Dame ,  as Quasimodo's mother and Djali ;  Hercules ,  as several female characters ;  Mulan ,  as the female ancestors ;  and the posthumously released Toy Story 2 ,  in which she is credited under """"additional voices . """" Her appearances in video games included The Curse of Monkey Island . She worked on other series including Jay Jay the Jet Plane ,  Oh Yeah! Cartoons ,  The Fairly OddParents ,  and several female voices in The Tick animated series .  She also provided the voice of Gwen Stacy in the final episode of Spider-Man .  Bergman voiced the Scooby-Doo character Daphne Blake in Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island (1998) ,  Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost (1999) and Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders (2000) ,  this last one being a posthumous release and final film role ,  dedicated to her .  Her other film role was in Balto II :  Wolf Quest (2002) ,  released three years after her death ,  in which she voiced a vixen and a wolverine . Bergman contributed vocals to the """"Weird Al"""" Yankovic song """"Pretty Fly for a Rabbi"""" ,  alongside Tress MacNeille .  Al stated : Originally I had Mary Kay come in to sing the whole song .  I basically wanted her to do the voice of Kyle's mom from South Park .  Her agent wouldn't let her do it (thinking that it might get her in trouble with Comedy Central)—so Mary Kay wound up doing kind of a squeaky voice instead .  Later ,  I decided that the """"squeaky voice"""" thing really wasn't what I was looking for ,  so I called in my old friend Tress to do her Fran Drescher impersonation instead .  The part that you can still hear Mary Kay on is the line in the middle of the song where she does the very Gentile-sounding """"for a Rab-bi .  .  . """" .  Bergman suffered from bipolar and generalized anxiety disorders ,  which she hid from her family ,  friends and co-stars .  When her mother was diagnosed with cancer ,  Bergman's depression was mistaken as a reaction to her mother's illness along with job-related stress . Bergman had privately confessed to her husband that she was """"afraid of losing her talent , """" as sessions were not going well .  She was concerned that people would feel that her talent had gone ,  and that her career would come to an end . On the morning of November 11 ,  1999 ,  Bergman contributed to a radio program celebrating Disneyland's 45th anniversary .  She was last seen alive at 9 p . m .  ,  while she was talking to a friend on the phone .  An hour and 20 minutes later ,  her husband and his friend ,  John Bell ,  "
*** "*page_ Max_Linder" "*cat_ Joint_suicides" " Max Linder was born Gabriel Leuvielle near Saint-Loubès ,  Gironde .  He was called """"Max"""" from a young age .  His parents ,  Jean and Suzanne (née Baron) ,  were wealthy vineyard owners and expected Linder to take over the family business ;  his older brother Maurice  (28 June 1881 – 14 December 1959) had become a celebrated national rugby player . As a child ,  Linder fell victim to a severe case of cholera .  He survived by resting in the oven of the village baker .  The heat from the oven supposedly brought down the infection to a manageable level . In the spring of 1888 ,  the Leuvielle family's plantation was attacked by grape phylloxera .  Jean and Suzanne heavily considered emigrating to America ,  and embarked on a trip to New York in search for propitious offers .  During their trip ,  Max and Maurice remained in France with their grandmother Jeanne .  Nothing became of Jean and Suzanne's plans to emigrate ,  as it was discovered that the French vines could be replaced with American plants ,  which were sturdier and resistant to phylloxera . While in New York ,  Suzanne gave birth to Max's younger brother ,  Gérard .  They returned to France ,  and ,  two years later ,  a sister ,  Marcelle ,  was born .  Max developed a particular affection for her .  and Marcelle starred alongside Max in Max ,  The Heartbreaker (1917) . In 1899 ,  Linder enrolled in the Conservatoire de Bordeaux and quickly won awards for first prize in comedy and second prize in tragedy .  He continued to pursue a career in the theater and became a contract player with the Bordeaux Théâtre des Arts from 1901 to 1904 ,  performing in plays by Molière ,  Pierre Corneille and Alfred de Musset .  At the same time that he was performing in serious dramatic theater ,  he became friends with Charles le Bargy of the Comédie-Française .  Le Bargy encouraged Linder to audition for the Conservatoire de Paris in 1904 .  Linder was rejected and began appearing in less prestigious theaters such as the Olympia Theater and the Théâtre de l'Ambigu . By 1905 ,  he had adopted his stage name of Max Linder and used it in several theatrical performances .  Also during this period ,  Linder applied for work at Pathé Frères  in Vincennes at the suggestion of film director Louis Gasnier and began appearing in small bit parts ,  mostly in slapstick comedies .  Linder continued to appear on the stage for the next two years and was not a significant film star at first .  However ,  an often-told legend about the origins of Linder's film career is that French film producer Charles Pathé personally saw Linder on the stage and wrote him a note that read """"In your eyes lies a fortune .  Come and act in front of my cameras ,  and I will help make it . """"From 1905 to 1907 ,  Linder appeared in dozens of short comedy films for Pathé ,  usually in a supporting role .  His first noticeably larger film role was in The Young Man's First Outing in 1905 .  He also appeared in Georges Méliès-like fantasy films such as Serpentine Dances and The Legend of Punching ,  his first leading role .  His rise to stardom commenced in 1907 when Pathé's slapstick star René Gréhan left the company to join Éclair .  Gréhan's screen character was Gontran ,  whose persona included high-society clothing and a dandy-ish demeanor .  Linder was chosen to take over the characterization for Pathé ,  and the style of dress and personality of Gréhan's character became his trademark .  Film critic David Robinson described Linder's screen persona as """"no grotesque :  he was young ,  handsome ,  debonair ,  immaculate .  .  . in silk hat ,  jock coat ,  cravat ,  spats ,  patent shoes ,  and swagger cane . """" Linder made more than one hundred short films portraying """"Max"""" ,  a wealthy and dapper man-about-town frequently in hot water because of his penchant for beautiful women and the good life .  With this character ,  he had created one of the first identifiable motion-picture characters who appeared in successive situation comedies . Linder's first appearance as """"Max"""" was in The Skater's Debut in 1907 .  Lake Daumesnil in Paris had frozen over and director Louis Gasnier filmed Linder in his new attire ,  with Linder improvising the rest .  In the film ,  """"Max"""" falls about and does a rendition of """"the windmill routine"""" by spinning his cane around ,  predating Charlie Chaplin's version in The Rink by nine years .  Pathé was unimpressed with the film and re-shot parts of it ,  and it was not popular with audiences when released .  Soon afterwards ,  Gasnier left Pathé and moved to Italy ,  leaving Linder without a supporter at Pathé ;  he made few films in 1908 . By 1910 ,  Linder had proved himself to Pathé and was quickly becoming one of the most popular film actors in the world .  When Gasnier was sent to the United States later that year to oversee Pathé's productions there ,  Lucien Nonguet took over as Linder's director .  Together they made such films as Max Takes a Bath and the autobiographical Max Linder's Film Debut ,  which fictitiously recreates the legend of Linder's early film career and includes Charles Pathé as himself . By the end of the year ,  Linder had become the most popular film actor in the world .  Although actress Florence Lawrence is often referred to as """"The First Movie Star"""" in the United States ,  Linder appears to be the very first worldwide movie star with a major following .  In Russia ,  he was voted the most popular film actor ,  ahead of Asta Nielsen .  He also had a Russian impersonator ,  Zozlov ,  and a devoted fan in Czar Nicholas II .  Another professed fan was British playwright George Bernard Shaw .  The first feature film ever made in Bulgaria was a remake of one of Linder's earlier movies .  He was offered $12 , 000 to spend a month in Berlin making public appearances with his film screenings ,  but had to decline for health reasons .  In France ,  a Max Linder movie theater had opened in Paris . At the height of his fame ,  Linder ended 1910 with a serious illness .  He was forced to stop making films when appendicitis left him bedridden ,  and some newspapers reported that he had died .  He eventually recovered the following spring and began making films again in May 1911 . In 1911 ,  Linder returned to filmmaking and began co-directing his own films (with René LePrince) as well as writing the scripts .  By 1912 ,  he was the solo director of his films .  Gaining complete control over his own films brought positive results both critically and commercially ;  the films Linder made during this period are generally considered to be his best .  Max ,  Victim of Quinine is considered by film critic Jean Mitry to be """"his masterpiece . """"The universality of silent films brought Linder fame and fortune throughout Europe ,  making him the highest paid entertainer of the day ,  with a salary increase of 150 , 000 francs (the average monthly salary in France was 100 francs at the time) .  He began touring Europe with his films from 1911 to 1912 ,  including Spain ,  where he entertained thousands of fans at the Barcelona railway station ,  Austria ,  and Russia ,  where he was accompanied on piano by a young Dimitri Tiomkin .  In 1912 after the tour ,  Linder demanded and received a salary of one million francs a year ,  and Charles Pathé used the huge sum to generate publicity ,  with an ad reading """"We understand that the shackles which bind Max Linder have attained the value of one million francs a year .  .  . the imagination boggles at such a figure!""""The high point of Linder's career was from 1912 to 1914 .  His films were made with increased skill and """"Max"""" was at his funniest .  He made such films as Max Virtuoso ,  Max Does Not Speak English ,  Max and His Dog ,  Max's Hat and Max and the Jealous Husband .  His ensemble of actors included Stacia Napierkowska ,  Jane Renouardt ,  Gaby Morlay ,  and occasional performances from the young actors Abel Gance and Maurice Chevalier .  Linder had given Chevalier his start in movies ,  but the silent medium did not suit Chevalier ,  who stuck to the stage until the all-singing all-dancing features came in ,  many years later . The outbreak of World War I brought a temporary end to Linder's film career in 1914 ,  but not before he made the short patriotic film The Second of August that year . In 1916 ,  Linder was approached by American film producer George K .  Spoor ,  the president of the Essanay Film Manufacturing Company ,  to make twelve short films for him in the US at a salary of $5 , 000 a week .  Earlier that year ,  Charlie Chaplin ,  then the most popular comedian in the world ,  had left Essanay for more money and independence at Mutual Film and Spoor wanted to replace Chaplin with Max Linder ,  whose pantomime skills were arguably equally accomplished .  Linder was offered a new contract from Charles Pathé ,  but accepted Spoor's offer and moved to the United States to work for Essanay later that year .  Unfortunately his first few American-made """"Max"""" films were unpopular both critically and financially .  The first two ,  Max Comes Across and Max Wants a Divorce were complete failures ,  but the third film ,  Max and his Taxi was moderately successful .  The financially troubled studio may have been counting on Linder to restore its flagging fortunes and cancelled production of the remaining films on Linder's contract . Linder returned to France in 1917 and opened a movie theater ,  the Ciné Max Linder .  However ,  due to his depression and anxiety about the still ongoing war ,  he was unable to continue making films on a regular basis ,  and was often quoted by journalists about the horrors of the front lines .  After the Armistice in 1918 ,  Linder was able to regain his enthusiasm and agreed to make a film with director Raymond Bernard ,  the feature length The Little Café in 1919 .  In the film ,  Linder plays a waiter who suddenly becomes a millionaire ,  but simultaneously is tricked into a twenty-year contract to be a waiter by the cafe owner .  The film made over a million francs in Europe and briefly revived his career ,  but was financially unsuccessful in the US . Four years after failing to become a major star in the U . S .  ,  Linder made another attempt at filmmaking in Hollywood and formed his own production company there in 1921 .  His first film back in the U . S .  was Seven Years Bad Luck ,  considered by some to be his best film .  The film contains one of the earliest (though not the first) examples on film of the """"human mirror"""" gag best known in the scene between Groucho and Harpo Marx in Duck Soup twelve years later .  Linder next made Be My Wife later that year ,  but again neither films were able to find a major audience in the U . S . Linder then decided to dispense of the """"Max"""" character and try something different for his third (and final) attempt :  The Three Must-Get-Theres in 1922 .  The film is a satire of swashbuckling films made by Douglas Fairbanks and is loosely based on the plot of Alexander Dumas' The Three Musketeers .  The film was praised by Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin ,  but again failed at the box office .  At the films premiere ,  Linder had said to director Robert Florey """"You see ,  Bob ,  I sense that I'm no longer funny ;  I have so many preoccupations that I can no longer concentrate on my film character  .  .  .  The public is mildly amused by my situations ,  but this evening where were the explosions of laughter that we hear when Charlie's on the screen? .  .  . Make people laugh ,  its easy to say make people laugh ,  but I don't feel funny anymore . """"With his depression making it difficult for him to work ,  Linder returned to France in 1922 and shortly afterwards made a semi-serious film :  Au Secours!  (Help!) for director Abel Gance .  The film is essentially a horror film set in a haunted house ,  with occasional moments of comedy by Linder .  The film was released in England in 1924 and was critically praised ,  however the legal copyright of the film prevented it from being released in France or the US for several years .  Linder's last film was The King of the Circus directed by Édouard-Émile Violet (with pre-production collaboration from Jacques Feyder) and filmed in Vienna in 1925 .  In the film ,  """"Max"""" joins a circus in order to be closer to the woman that he loves .  The film includes such gags as a hungover """"Max"""" waking up in a department store and the film's plot is similar to the Charlie Chaplin film The Circus (1928) .  In late 1925 ,  Linder was working on pre-production for his next film Barkas le fol ,  which would never be made .     "

Linder returned to France in 1917 and opened a movie theater ,  the Ciné Max Linder .  However ,  due to his depression and anxiety about the still ongoing war ,  he was unable to continue making films on a regular basis ,  and was often quoted by journalists about the horrors of the front lines .  After the Armistice in 1918 ,  Linder was able to regain his enthusiasm and agreed to make a film with director Raymond Bernard ,  the feature length The Little Café in 1919 .  In the film ,  Linder plays a waiter who suddenly becomes a millionaire ,  but simultaneously is tricked into a twenty-year contract to be a waiter by the cafe owner .  The film made over a million francs in Europe and briefly revived his career ,  but was financially unsuccessful in the US . Four years after failing to become a major star in the U . S .  ,  Linder made another attempt at filmmaking in Hollywood and formed his own production company there in 1921 .  His first film back in the U . S .  was Seven Years Bad Luck ,  considered by some to be his best film .  The film contains one of the earliest (though not the first) examples on film of the """"human mirror"""" gag best known in the scene between Groucho and Harpo Marx in Duck Soup twelve years later .  Linder next made Be My Wife later that year ,  but again neither films were able to find a major audience in the U . S . Linder then decided to dispense of the """"Max"""" character and try something different for his third (and final) attempt :  The Three Must-Get-Theres in 1922 .  The film is a satire of swashbuckling films made by Douglas Fairbanks and is loosely based on the plot of Alexander Dumas' The Three Musketeers .  The film was praised by Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin ,  but again failed at the box office .  At the films premiere ,  Linder had said to director Robert Florey """"You see ,  Bob ,  I sense that I'm no longer funny ;  I have so many preoccupations that I can no longer concentrate on my film character  .  .  .  The public is mildly amused by my situations ,  but this evening where were the explosions of laughter that we hear when Charlie's on the screen? .  .  . Make people laugh ,  its easy to say make people laugh ,  but I don't feel funny anymore . """"With his depression making it difficult for him to work ,  Linder returned to France in 1922 and shortly afterwards made a semi-serious film :  Au Secours!  (Help!) for director Abel Gance .  The film is essentially a horror film set in a haunted house ,  with occasional moments of comedy by Linder .  The film was released in England in 1924 and was critically praised ,  however the legal copyright of the film prevented it from being released in France or the US for several years .  Linder's last film was The King of the Circus directed by Édouard-Émile Violet (with pre-production collaboration from Jacques Feyder) and filmed in Vienna in 1925 .  In the film ,  """"Max"""" joins a circus in order to be closer to the woman that he loves .  The film includes such gags as a hungover """"Max"""" waking up in a department store and the film's plot is similar to the Charlie Chaplin film The Circus (1928) .  In late 1925 ,  Linder was working on pre-production for his next film Barkas le fol ,  which would never be made .     "

Her father died of cancer in 1940 ,  causing her mother to take in a boarder ,  Renate Riemeck ,  to make money .  In 1946 ,  the family moved back to OldenburgIn 1952 ,  Meinhof took her Abitur at a school in Weilburg .  She then studied philosophy ,  sociology ,  education and German at Marburg ,  where she became involved with reform movements . In 1959 ,  Meinhof joined the banned Communist Party of Germany (KPD)On 2 June 1967 ,  Meinhof's exposure in konkret of German complicity in supporting the Pahlavi dynasty helped rally students to a demonstration in West Berlin against the visit of the Shah of Iran .  When Iranian counter-demonstrators ,  including agents of the Shah's intelligence service ,  attacked the students ,  the police joined the affray beating the demonstrator into side street where an officer shot and killed the student protestor Benno OhnesorgIn February 1968 ,  Meinhof was a participant in the International Vietnam Conference in West Berlin ,  which the authorities had permitted only in the face of large-scale protests .  She was co-signatory ,  along with intellectuals including Ernst Bloch ,  Noam Chomsky ,  Eric Hobsbawn ,  Ernest Mandel ,  and Jean Paul Sartre ,  of the final declaration .  This defined the U . S .  intervention in Vietnam as """"the Spain of our generation"""" and called for mobilisation against the """"extermination"""" (Vernichtung) of the Vietnamese people . In 1961 ,  Meinhof married the co-founder and publisher of konkret ,  Klaus Rainer Röhl .  Their marriage produced twins ,  Regine and Bettina ,  on 21 September 1962 .  Meinhof and Röhl separated in 1967 and divorced a year later .    The official verdict was Meinhof had committed suicide .  It was later discovered she had become increasingly isolated from other RAF prisoners .  Notes exchanged between them in prison included one by Ensslin ,  describing her as """"too weak"""" .  The official findings were not accepted by many in the RAF A second investigation was carried out by an international group .  The findings of the inquiry were published under the title Der Tod Ulrike Meinhofs .  Bericht der Internationalen Untersuchungskommission (The Death of Ulrike Meinhof .  Report of the International Investigation Committee) in 1979 . Meinhof's body was buried six days after her death ,  in Berlin-Mariendorf .  Her funeral turned out to be a demonstration of about 7 , 000 people .  Demonstrations took place across the country ,  social and political prisoners in Berlin and Hessen held a three-day hunger strike .  Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir in an open letter compared her death to the worst crimes of Nazi era . In late 2002 ,  following investigations by her daughter Bettina ,  it was discovered that Meinhof's brain had been retained (apparently without permission) following the autopsy performed as part of the investigation into Meinhof's death .  The original autopsy had found brain injury near the amygdala ,  resulting from successful surgery in 1962 to remove a (benign) cyst .  The unpublished autopsy results at the time stated that the brain injuries """"justified questions as to the culpability"""" of Meinhof .  Bernhard Bogerts ,  a psychiatrist at Magdeburg university ,  later re-examined the brain and also doubted that Meinhof was fully criminally responsible .  "

After leaving Haverstock School ,  he travelled in France for several months before returning home .  He went through various jobs ,  including being a building labourer and a trainee reporter .   He even had a brief spell as a clothes model ,  but he never felt comfortable doing that job .  He said :  """"I was as stiff as a board and I couldn’t overcome my sense of the ridiculous .  I was a clothes hanger ,  an object ,  not a person . """"  He joined the New Arts Theatre as a scenery mover ,  and became part of an amateur film a friend was making .  After landing the lead role ,  he was encouraged to take up the profession .  He attended evening classes at an actors' workshop whilst holding down a day job .  He was involved working in some of the first """"Lunchtime theatre"""" productions in the 1960s ,  from pub cellars to top floor spaces off St .  Martin's Lane .  His first television role was in an episode of Out of the Unknown in 1966 called """"The Machine Stops"""" .  He was then cast in Don Levy's film Herostratus in 1967 and Up the Junction in 1968 .  He then acquired a female following after taking a role as the villainous Mordaunt in the BBC's adaptation of Twenty Years After (Further Adventures of the Musketeers) .

I ain't either one . ' But the kid agreed to do it ,  without a double—he was that driven .  He had a lot of class and a lot of style .  Gordon (Hessler) came up with the idea of using an overhead cable to give that illusion of his walking up the cliff . """"He appeared in Ken Russell's 1971 horror film ,  The Devils ,  in which Gothard had a stand-out role as a fanatic witch-hunter and exorcist who defiles Vanessa Redgrave and tortures Oliver Reed .

He also played a fictionalised version of the 17th century assassin John Felton in Richard Lester's 1973 film of The Three Musketeers and its 1974 sequel ,  The Four Musketeers . He had a regular role as Kai opposite Oliver Tobias's King Arthur on the aforementioned Arthur of the Britons during the early 1970s .  He became known to a wider cinema audience for his menacing turn as the villainous (and non-speaking) Belgian henchman ,  Emile Leopold Locque ,  in the 1981 James Bond film ,  For Your Eyes Only .  Gothard was actually the one who suggested Locque's signature octagonal glasses in an effort to make the character more menacing . One of his last main appearances was in 1992s Christopher Columbus :  The Discovery . His final role was in David Wickes's Frankenstein ,  starring Patrick Bergin and Randy Quaid .  Gothard ,  who struggled with depression for much of his life ,  committed suicide by hanging on 2 December 1992 .  He was 53 years old .  "

He even had a brief spell as a clothes model ,  but he never felt comfortable doing that job .  He said :  """"I was as stiff as a board and I couldn’t overcome my sense of the ridiculous .  I was a clothes hanger ,  an object ,  not a person . """"  He joined the New Arts Theatre as a scenery mover ,  and became part of an amateur film a friend was making .

His first television role was in an episode of Out of the Unknown in 1966 called """"The Machine Stops"""" .  He was then cast in Don Levy's film Herostratus in 1967 and Up the Junction in 1968 .

Following Kell's business interests ,  the Hutchence family moved to Brisbane (where younger brother Rhett was born) and later to Hong Kong .  During the early years in Hong Kong ,  both boys attended Beacon Hill School in Kowloon Tong .  While in Hong Kong ,  Michael showed promise as a swimmer before breaking his arm badly .  He then began to show interest in poetry and performed his first song in a local toy store commercial .  Michael attended King George V School during his early teens . The family returned to Sydney in 1972 ,  buying a house in Belrose near the Northern Beaches .  Hutchence attended Davidson High School ,  where he met and befriended Andrew Farriss .  Around this time ,  Hutchence and Farriss spent a lot of time jamming in the garage with Andrew's brothers .  Farriss then convinced Hutchence to join his band ,  Doctor Dolphin ,  alongside classmates Kent Kerny and Neil Sanders .  Bass guitarist Garry Beers and drummer Geoff Kennelly from nearby Forest High School filled out the line-up . In 1977 ,  a new band ,  the Farriss Brothers ,  was formed with Tim Farriss on lead guitar ,  his younger brother Andrew as keyboardist ,  and youngest brother Jon on drums .  Andrew brought Hutchence on board as a vocalist and Beers on bass guitar ,  and Tim brought in his former bandmate Kirk Pengilly to play guitar and saxophone .   Hutchence ,  the Farriss brothers ,  Kerny ,  Sanders ,  Beers and Kennelly briefly performed as The Vegetables ,  singing """"We Are the Vegetables"""" . Hutchence became the main spokesperson for the band . According to Hutchence ,  most of the songs on the band's second album ,  Underneath the Colours ,  were written within a fairly short space of time :  """"Most bands shudder at the prospect of having 20 years to write their first album and four days to write their second .  For us ,  though ,  it was good .  It left less room for us to go off on all sorts of tangents"""" . In March 1985 ,  after Hutchence and INXS recorded their album The Swing (1984) ,  WEA released the Australian version of Dekadance ,  as a limited edition cassette only EP of six tracks including remixes from the album .  The cassette also included a cover version of Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood's hit """"Jackson"""" ,  which Hutchence sang as a duet with Jenny Morris ,  a backing singer for The Swing sessions .

In 1986 ,  Hutchence played Sam ,  the lead male role ,  in the Australian film Dogs in Space ,  directed by long-time INXS music video collaborator Richard Lowenstein .  Sam's girlfriend ,  Anna ,  was portrayed by Saskia Post as a """"fragile peroxide blonde in op-shop clothes"""" . Late in 1986 ,  before commencing work on a new INXS album and while supposedly taking an eight-month break ,  the band's management decided to stage the Australian Made tour as a series of major outdoor concerts across the country .

In 1987 ,  Hutchence provided vocals for Richard Clapton's album Glory Road ,  which was produced by Jon Farriss . INXS released Kick in October 1987 ,  and the album provided the band with worldwide popularity .  Kick peaked at No . 1 in Australia , In 1989 ,  Hutchence collaborated further with Olsen for the Max Q project ,  and was joined by members of Olsen's previous groups including Whirlywirld ,  No and Orchestra of Skin and Bone .

Hutchence and INXS went on a world tour to support the April 1997 release of Elegantly Wasted . On the morning of 22 November 1997 ,  Hutchence ,  aged 37 ,  was found dead in Room 524 at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Double Bay ,  Sydney . Geldof's police statements and evidence to the coroner indicated he did receive a call from Hutchence ,  who was """"hectoring and abusive and threatening"""" during their phone conversation .  The occupant in the room next to Hutchence's heard a loud male voice and swearing at about 5 am ;  the coroner was satisfied that this was Hutchence arguing with Geldof . At 9 : 54 am on 22 November ,  Hutchence spoke with a former girlfriend ,  Michèle Bennett ;  according to Bennett ,  Hutchence was crying ,  sounded upset ,  and told her he needed to see her .  Bennett arrived at his hotel room door at about 10 : 40 am ,  but there was no response .  Hutchence's body was discovered by a hotel maid at 11 : 50 am .  Police reported that Hutchence was found """"in a kneeling position facing the door .  He had used his snakeskin belt to tie a knot on the automatic door closure at the top of the door ,  and had strained his head forward into the loop so hard that the buckle had broken . """"On 6 February 1998 ,  after an autopsy and coronial inquest ,  New South Wales State Coroner ,  Derrick Hand ,  presented his report .

The family moved to Newtown Queens circa 1850 where his siblings were born :  brother Barnett (1852-) and a sister Delia (1855-) .   His paternal grandparents were Jeffery Hicks (1778-1829) and Mary Polly Hicks (1784-1854) .  His patrilineal great-grandparents were Jeffrey Hicks (1739 - 1790) who had been born in Flushing ,  and Mary Cornell (1745 - 1792) . Hick's relatives included famous Quaker and abolitionist Elias Hicks also of Hempstead ,  and Elias' son Valentine Hicks ,  who first settled the community of Hicksville ,  Long Island ,  and was later president of the Long Island Rail Road .   He was also a distant cousin of Quaker and painter Edward Hicks .   He is related Isaac Hicks ,  who founded Hicks Nursery in 1852 . Hicks served briefly in the 15th New York Infantry Regiment near the end of the American Civil War .   He began playing professional baseball in the National Association of Base Ball Players through 1871 ,  most notably for the Eckford of Brooklyn .  Hicks' pivotal role in the development of the curveball is seldom mentioned .  Most catchers of his era stood twenty to twenty-five feet behind the batter ,  which made it impossible to field a curveball .  It was Hicks' catching technique of standing directly behind the batter ,  that allowed Cummings to introduce his curveball .  The introduction of the curveball not only caused a revolutionary change in the way catchers fielded their position ,  but also radically changed pitching as well . He later moved on and spent most of his career playing in the National Association .  He joined the New York Mutuals in 1872 where he was reunited with Cummings ,  and became their everyday catcher .  He batted  . 306 that season as the Mutuals finished third . On July 24 ,  1873 ,  Bob Ferguson of the Brooklyn Atlantics was the umpire in a game between the New York Mutuals and the Baltimore Canaries which ended with the Mutuals scoring 3 runs in the bottom of the 9th inning for an 11-10 victory .  Ferguson and the Mutuals' Hicks got into a verbal altercation which ended with Ferguson breaking Hicks' arm by hitting him with a bat .  Ferguson required a police escort to leave the field and Hicks was out of action for 2 months . Hicks changed teams in 1874 ,  joining the Philadelphia White Stockings where he was once again reunited with Cummings ,  and enjoyed a bounce back season ,  batting  . 274 ,  and caught every game the team played .

Halliwell was seven years older than Orton ;  they quickly formed a strong relationship and became lovers . After graduating ,  both Orton and Halliwell went into regional repertory work :  Orton spent four months in Ipswich as an assistant stage manager ;  Halliwell in Llandudno ,  Wales .  Both returned to London and began to write together .  They collaborated on a number of unpublished novels (often imitating Ronald Firbank) with no success at gaining publication .  The rejection of their great hope ,  The Last Days of Sodom ,  in 1957 led them to solo works .  Orton wrote his last novel ,  The Vision of Gombold Proval (posthumously published as Head to Toe) ,  in 1959 .  He later drew on these manuscripts for ideas ;  many show glimpses of his stage-play style . Confident of their """"specialness , """" Orton and Halliwell refused to work for long periods .  They subsisted on Halliwell's money (and unemployment benefits) and were forced to follow an ascetic life to restrict their spending to £5 a week .  From 1957 to 1959 ,  they worked in six-month stretches at Cadbury's to raise money for a new flat ;  they moved into a small ,  austere flat at 25 Noel Road in Islington in 1959 .     "

*** "*page_ Dana_Plato" "*cat_ Female_suicides" " Plato was born Dana Michelle Strain on November 7 ,  1964 ,  in Maywood ,  California to Linda Strain ,  an unwed teenager who was already caring for an 18-month-old child .  In June 1965 ,  the seven-month-old Dana was adopted by Dean Plato ,  who owned a trucking company ,  and his wife Florine """"Kay"""" Plato .  Plato was raised in the San Fernando Valley .  When she was three ,  her adoptive parents divorced and she lived with her mother . In 1995 ,  during an appearance on The Marilyn Kagen Show alongside co-star Todd Bridges ,  she spoke of her childhood with her mother ,  commenting how she had not learned """"reality and life skills"""" . During her years on Diff'rent Strokes ,  Plato struggled with drug and alcohol problems .  She admitted to drinking alcohol ,  using cannabis and cocaine ,  and suffered an overdose of diazepam when she was 14 .   At a very young age ,  Plato began attending auditions with her mother ,  and from age seven appeared in over 100 commercials .  She made her television acting debut at the age of 10 ,  making a brief appearance on the television show The Six Million Dollar Man .  She then starred in the 1975 made for television film Beyond the Bermuda Triangle .  Plato made her film debut at the age of 13 ,  appearing as Sandra Phalor in the horror film Exorcist II :  The Heretic (1977) ,  for which she was uncredited .  She also starred as Evie Joe in the horror film Return to Boggy Creek (1977) in the same year ,  and earned accolades from the Academy Awards and the Golden Globe Awards . In addition to acting ,  Plato was an accomplished figure skater ,  and at one point she trained for a possible Olympic team spot .  In the season 8 episode that aired on January 17 ,  1986—Plato's final appearance on the show—Kimberly suffered from the effects of bulimia .  Plato was nominated for a Young Artist Award for her work on Diff'rent Strokes ,  and also was part of two TV Land Award nominations given to the cast of the show .  it gained popularity at the time of its premiere ,  particularly for its cast . In 1992 ,  Plato starred in the video game Night Trap ,  becoming one of the first celebrities to appear in a video game .  The game was a moderate success (the majority of the game's video content was actually filmed in 1987 and then shelved) ,  but is considered a pioneering title because it was the first to use live actors ,  one of whom was a well-known personality . After leaving Diff'rent Strokes ,  Plato attempted to establish herself as a serious actress ,  but found it difficult to achieve success .  She had breast implants and modeled for a June 1989 Playboy pictorial ,  but her career remained stagnant .  Consequently ,  she started taking roles in such B-movies as Bikini Beach Race (1989) and Lethal Cowboy (1992) . Toward the end of her career ,  Plato chose roles that were erotic ;  she appeared nude in Prime Suspect (1989) and Compelling Evidence (1995) ,  and in the softcore erotic drama Different Strokes :  The Story of Jack and Jill .  .  . and Jill (1998) ,  the title of which was changed after filming ,  in order to tie it to Plato's past .  Following her appearance in the film ,  in the same year ,  Plato appeared in a cover story of the lesbian lifestyle-magazine Girlfriends .  Her last works include Desperation Boulevard (1998) ,  in which she appears as herself ,  and which appears to be based on her life ;  Silent Scream (1999) ,  in which she appears as Emma Jones ;  and Pacino Is Missing (2002) ,  which was released after her death ,  in which she appears as an attorney .   On May 8 ,  1999 ,  Plato and Menchaca were returning to California and stopped at Menchaca's mother's home in Moore ,  Oklahoma ,  for a Mother's Day visit . In 2000 ,  Fox broadcast a television documentary based on Plato ,  titled After Diff'rent Strokes :  When the Laughter Stopped .  The film was focused on her life and work after the show ,  including her death .  It featured actors who at the time were unknown ,  as well as Todd Bridges ,  who made a cameo appearance . On what would have been Plato's 55th birthday ,  Bridges commented on Twitter about their friendship ,  leaving a tribute to Plato .  "

They divorced in 1955 ,  having had two daughters ,  Annamarie and Kathleen .   Price was a member of the Manhattan Project as a chemist looking into the characteristics of plutonium-235 .

This negative altruism was described in a paper published by W .  D .  Hamilton and is termed Hamiltonian spite . Price's 'mathematical' theory of altruism reasons that organisms are more likely to show altruism toward each other as they become more genetically similar to each other .  Thus ,  in a species that requires two parents to reproduce ,  an organism is most likely to show altruistic behavior to a biological parent ,  full sibling ,  or direct offspring .  The reason for this is that each of these relatives' genetic makeup contains (on average in the case of siblings) 50% of the genes that are found in the original organism .  So if the original organism dies as a result of an altruistic act it can still manage to propagate its full genetic heritage as long as two or more of these close relatives are saved .  Consequently ,  an organism is less likely to show altruistic behavior to a biological grandparent ,  grandchild ,  aunt/uncle ,  niece/nephew or half-sibling (each carry one-fourth of the genes found in the original organism) ;  and even less likely to show altruism to a first cousin (carrying one-eighth of the genes found in the original organism) .  The theory then asserts that the further genetically removed two organisms are from each other ,  the less likely they are to show altruism to each other . Price grew increasingly depressed by the implications of his equation .

These saw official release in 2001 by Polydor Records ,  titled Bootleg Series Volume 1 :  The Quine Tapes .  Though lo-fi in sound quality ,  the album is an important document of the group .  In the liner notes ,  Quine writes :  """"I got a lot of pleasure and inspiration from these performances .  As a guitar player ,  they were an important element in shaping what musical direction I wanted to take . """" While in St .  Louis ,  he performed in a band called Bruce's Farm that specialized in Byrds covers . Throughout his San Francisco years (coinciding with his attempts to pass the California bar exam) ,  Quine """"sort of began to come up with my own style , """" often performing under the influence of LSD ;  nevertheless ,  he disdained such psychedelic rock groups as Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead .

*** "*page_ Robert_Quine" "*cat_ Suicides_in_New_York_City" " Quine was born in Akron ,  Ohio ,  the son of Rosalie (née Cohen) and Robert Cloyd Quine .  Quine also enrolled at the Berklee School of Music at an indeterminate point without taking a degree .   In 1969 ,  Quine made a series of cassette recordings of the Velvet Underground performing live in St .  Louis and San Francisco ,  where he lived between late 1969 and 1971 .  These saw official release in 2001 by Polydor Records ,  titled Bootleg Series Volume 1 :  The Quine Tapes .  Though lo-fi in sound quality ,  the album is an important document of the group .  In the liner notes ,  Quine writes :  """"I got a lot of pleasure and inspiration from these performances .  As a guitar player ,  they were an important element in shaping what musical direction I wanted to take . """" While in St .  Louis ,  he performed in a band called Bruce's Farm that specialized in Byrds covers . Throughout his San Francisco years (coinciding with his attempts to pass the California bar exam) ,  Quine """"sort of began to come up with my own style , """" often performing under the influence of LSD ;  nevertheless ,  he disdained such psychedelic rock groups as Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead . After leaving Prentice Hall to focus on his musical career in the mid-1970s ,  he worked at the Greenwich Village bookstore Cinemabilia with Richard Hell and Tom Verlaine ,  the co-founders of the influential punk band Television .  Later ,  Hell invited him to join his new band The Voidoids .  Hell's two Voidoid albums feature Quine's distinctive guitar work ;  guitarist Marc Ribot once said about Quine that """"in terms of punk rock guitar soloing ,  After The Voidoids broke up ,  Quine recorded with Lydia Lunch ,  Jody Harris and Material .  From September 1979 to July 1980 ,  Quine and Harris recorded various guitar improvisations with a drum machine .  In 1981 ,  some of those experiments were released as the Harris/Quine album ,  Escape .   With Material bandmate Fred Maher ,  Quine recorded his only other solo album ,  Basic ,  released in 1984 . In the early 1980s ,  Lou Reed drafted Quine to join his group .  He appeared on The Blue Mask (1982) ,  widely regarded as one of Reed's best albums .  The Reed-Quine guitar work crafted interlocking duels that blur the lines between rhythm and leads .  Reed's 1983 album Legendary Hearts featured most of the same group ,  but Quine eventually quit due to tensions with Reed ,  exacerbated when Reed mixed down or entirely removed most of Quine's guitar parts on Legendary Hearts .  Quine claimed that when he got his advance copy of the album ,  he was so disgusted by this ,  he smashed the cassette into """"smithereens"""" with a hammer .  Reed persuaded Quine to rejoin for a world tour ,  which is documented on the video A Night with Lou Reed (1983) and the album Live in Italy (1984) ;  Quine disliked touring ,  but agreed to the tour for financial reasons .  He ended his partnership with Reed for good in 1985 .

*** "*page_ Robin_Williams" "*cat_ Suicides_by_asphyxiation" " Robin McLaurin Williams was born at St .  Luke's Hospital in Chicago ,  Illinois , Williams attended public elementary school in Lake Forest at Gorton Elementary School and middle school at Deer Path Junior High School . As both his parents worked ,  Williams was partially raised by the family's maid ,  who was his main companion .  When he was 16 ,  his father took early retirement and the family moved to Tiburon ,  California . In 1973 ,  Williams attained a full scholarship to the Juilliard School (Group 6 ,  1973–1976) in New York City .  He was one of 20 students accepted into the freshman class ,  and he and Christopher Reeve were the only two accepted by John Houseman into the Advanced Program at the school that year .  William Hurt and Mandy Patinkin were also classmates . Williams and Reeve had a class in dialects taught by Edith Skinner ,  who Reeve said was one of the world's leading voice and speech teachers ;  according to Reeve ,  Skinner was bewildered by Williams and his ability to instantly perform in many different accents .  Their primary acting teacher was Michael Kahn ,  who was """"equally baffled by this human dynamo"""" . During the summers of 1974 ,  1975 ,  and 1976 ,  Williams worked as a busboy at The Trident in Sausalito ,  California .   Williams began performing stand-up comedy in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1976 . Williams moved to Los Angeles and continued performing stand-up at clubs including The Comedy Store .  There ,  in 1977 ,  he was seen by TV producer George Schlatter ,  who asked him to appear on a revival of his show Laugh-In .  The show aired in late 1977 and was his debut TV appearance .  In England ,  Williams notably performed at The Fighting Cocks . With his success on Mork & Mindy ,  Williams began to reach a wider audience with his stand-up comedy ,  starting in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s ,  including three HBO comedy specials :  Off The Wall (1978) ,  An Evening with Robin Williams (1983) ,  and A Night at the Met (1986) . David Letterman ,  who knew Williams for nearly 40 years ,  recalls seeing him first perform as a new comedian at The Comedy Store in Hollywood ,  where Letterman and other comedians had already been doing stand-up .  """"He came in like a hurricane"""" ,  said Letterman ,  who said he then thought to himself ,  """"Holy crap ,  there goes my chance in show business . """"Williams said that partly due to the stress of performing stand-up ,  he started using drugs and alcohol early in his career .  He further said that he neither drank nor took drugs while on stage ,  but occasionally performed when hung over from the previous day .  During the period he was using cocaine ,  he said it made him paranoid when performing on stage . Williams once described the life of stand-up comedians : """"It's a brutal field ,  man .  They burn out .  It takes its toll .  Plus ,  the lifestyle—partying ,  drinking ,  drugs .  If you're on the road ,  it's even more brutal .  You gotta come back down to mellow your ass out ,  and then performing takes you back up .  They flame out because it comes and goes .  Suddenly they're hot ,  and then somebody else is hot .  Sometimes they get very bitter .  Sometimes they just give up .  Sometimes they have a revival thing and they come back again .  Sometimes they snap .  The pressure kicks in .  You become obsessed and then you lose that focus that you need . """" :  34–35 Some ,  such as the critic Vincent Canby ,  were concerned that his monologues were so intense it seemed as though at any minute his """"creative process could reverse into a complete meltdown"""" . Williams felt secure that he would not run out of ideas ,  as the constant change in world events would keep him supplied . During a Playboy interview in 1992 ,  Williams was asked whether he ever feared losing his balance between his work and his life .  He replied ,  """"There's that fear—if I felt like I was becoming not just dull but a rock ,  that I still couldn't speak ,  fire off or talk about things ,  if I'd start to worry or got too afraid to say something .  .  .  .  If I stop trying ,  I get afraid . """" While he attributed the recent suicide of novelist Jerzy Kosiński to his fear of losing his creativity and sharpness ,  Williams felt he could overcome those risks .  For that ,  he credited his father for strengthening his self-confidence ,  telling him to never be afraid of talking about subjects which were important to him . Williams's stand-up work was a consistent thread through his career ,  as seen by the success of his one-man show (and subsequent DVD) Robin Williams :  Live on Broadway (2002) .  In 2004 ,  he was voted 13th on Comedy Central's list """"100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time"""" . After the Laugh-In revival and appearing in the cast of The Richard Pryor Show on NBC ,  Williams was cast by Garry Marshall as the alien Mork in a 1978 episode of the TV series Happy Days ,  """"My Favorite Orkan"""" . Mork's appearance proved so popular with viewers that it led to the spin-off television sitcom Mork & Mindy ,  which co-starred Pam Dawber ,  and ran from 1978 to 1982 ;  the show was written to accommodate his extreme improvisations in dialogue and behavior .  Although he portrayed the same character as in Happy Days ,  the series was set in the present in Boulder ,  Colorado ,  instead of the late 1950s in Milwaukee .  Mork & Mindy at its peak had a weekly audience of sixty million and was credited with turning Williams into a """"superstar"""" . Mork became popular ,  featured on posters ,  coloring books ,  lunch-boxes ,  and other merchandise . Starting in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s ,  Williams began to reach a wider audience with his stand-up comedy ,  including three HBO comedy specials ,  Off the Wall (1978) ,  An Evening with Robin Williams (1983) ,  and A Night at the Met (1986) .  In 1986 ,  Williams co-hosted the 58th Academy Awards . Williams and Billy Crystal were in an unscripted cameo at the beginning of an episode of the third season of Friends . In 2010 ,  he appeared in a sketch with Robert De Niro on Saturday Night Live ,  and in 2012 ,  guest-starred as himself in two FX series ,  Louie and Wilfred . The first film role credited to Robin Williams is a small part in the 1977 low-budget comedy Can I Do It .  .  .  'Til I Need Glasses? .  His first starring performance ,  however ,  is as the title character in Popeye (1980) ,  in which Williams showcased the acting skills previously demonstrated in his television work ;  accordingly ,  the film's commercial disappointment was not blamed on his performance . His first major break came from his starring role in director Barry Levinson's Good Morning ,  Vietnam (1987) ,  which earned Williams a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor . Many of his subsequent roles were in comedies tinged with pathos . Other performances Williams had in dramatic films include Moscow on the Hudson (1984) ,  What Dreams May Come (1998) ,  and Bicentennial Man (1999) . His roles in comedy and dramatic films garnered Williams several accolades ,  including an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in Good Will Hunting ; Among the actors who helped him during his acting career ,  he credited Robert De Niro ,  from whom he learned the power of silence and economy of dialogue when acting .  From Dustin Hoffman ,  with whom he co-starred in Hook ,  he learned to take on totally different character types ,  and to transform his characters by extreme preparation .  Mike Medavoy ,  producer of Hook ,  told its director ,  Steven Spielberg ,  that he intentionally teamed up Hoffman and Williams for the film because he knew they wanted to work together ,  and that Williams welcomed the opportunity of working with Spielberg . Williams voiced characters in several animated films .  His voice role as the Genie in the animated musical Aladdin (1992) was written for him .  The film's directors said they had taken a risk by writing the role . Due to Disney breaking an agreement with Williams regarding the use of the Genie in the advertising for Aladdin ,  Williams refused to sign on for the direct-to-video sequel The Return of Jafar (1994) ,  where the Genie was instead voiced by Dan Castellaneta .  When Jeffrey Katzenberg was replaced by Joe Roth as Walt Disney Studios chairman ,  Roth organized a public apology to Williams . Williams continued to provide voices in other animated films ,  including FernGully :  The Last Rainforest (1992) ,  Robots (2005) ,  Happy Feet (2006) ,  and an uncredited vocal performance in Everyone's Hero (2006) .  He also voiced the holographic character Dr .  Know in the live-action film A . I .  Artificial Intelligence (2001) .  He was the voice of The Timekeeper ,  a former attraction at the Walt Disney World Resort about a time-traveling robot who encounters Jules Verne and brings him to the future . Years after the films ,  Janet Hirshenson revealed in an interview that Williams had expressed interest in portraying Rubeus Hagrid in the Harry Potter film series ,  but was rejected by director Chris Columbus due to the """"British-only edict"""" . Williams appeared opposite Steve Martin at Lincoln Center in an off-Broadway production of Waiting for Godot in 1988 . Williams hosted a talk show for Audible ,  which premiered in April 2000 and was available exclusively from Audible's website .  On August 11 ,  2014 ,  Williams committed suicide by hanging at his home in Paradise Cay ,  California .  His body was cremated at Monte's Chapel of the Hills in San Anselmo ,  and his ashes were scattered over San Francisco Bay the next day . The final autopsy report ,  released in November 2014 ,  concluded that he """"died of asphyxia due to hanging"""" . The Lewy Body Dementia Association (LBDA) clarified the distinction between the term used in the autopsy report ,  """"diffuse Lewy body dementia""""—which is more commonly called """"diffuse Lewy body disease"""" and refers to the underlying disease process—and the umbrella term """"Lewy body dementia""""—which encompasses both Parkinson's disease dementia (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) . Williams's death instantly became global news .  The entertainment world ,  friends ,  and fans responded to his death through social and other media outlets . President Barack Obama released a statement upon Williams's death : Robin Williams was an airman ,  a doctor ,  a genie ,  a nanny ,  a president ,  a professor ,  a bangarang Peter Pan ,  and everything in between  .  .  .  He arrived in our lives as an alien—but he ended up touching every element of the human spirit .  He made us laugh .  He made us cry .  He gave his immeasurable talent freely and generously to those who needed it most—from our troops stationed abroad to the marginalized on our own streets . Williams was scheduled to be the """"Blackmail"""" special guest for the final night of Monty Python's ten-date stage shows in London one month before his death—with one of his friends ,  Monty Python's Eric Idle—but cancelled ,  stating he was """"suffering from severe depression"""" at the time . At the United Nations Headquarters on August 12 ,  2014 ,  Robin Williams was celebrated during the opening of the International Youth Day .  In the presence of U . N .  Secretary General Ban Ki Moon ,  Assistant Secretary General Thomas Gass paid tribute to Williams by standing on the pulpit of the ECOSOC Chamber and quoting Keating's lines from the 1989 film Dead Poets Society :  """"Dare to look at things in a different way!""""Shortly after his death ,  Disney Channel ,  Disney XD ,  and Disney Junior all aired the original Aladdin commercial-free over the course of a week ,  with a dedicated drawing of the genie at the end of each airing before the credits . Fans of Williams created makeshift memorials at his star on the Hollywood Walk of FameDuring the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards on August 25 ,  2014 ,  close friend and fellow comedian Billy Crystal presented a tribute to Williams ,  referring to him as """"the brightest star in our comedy galaxy"""" .  Afterwards ,  some of Williams's best comedy moments were shown ,  including his first ever The Tonight Show appearance ,  indicating his great life in making people laugh . On September 9 ,  2014 ,  PBS aired a one-hour special devoted to his career , British heavy metal band Iron Maiden dedicated a song to Williams ,  titled """"Tears of a Clown"""" ,  on their 2015 album The Book of Souls .  The song looks into his depression and suicide ,  as well as how he attempted to hide his condition from the public . A tunnel ,  painted with a rainbow ,  on Highway 101 north of the Golden Gate Bridge was officially named the """"Robin Williams Tunnel"""" on February 29 ,  2016 . In 2017 ,  Sharon Meadow in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park ,  the home of the annual Comedy Day ,  was renamed Robin Williams Meadow . In 2018 ,  HBO produced a documentary about his life and career .  Directed by Marina Zenovich ,  the film ,  Robin Williams :  Come Inside My Mind ,  was also screened at the Sundance Film Festival . In August 2020 ,  Vertical Entertainment released a trailer for a new documentary ,  Robin's Wish ,  exploring Williams's battle with Lewy body dementia .  The film ,  directed by Tylor Norwood ,  was digitally released on September 1 ,  2020 .  "

*** "*page_ Jean-Marie_Roland_de_la_Platière" "*cat_ 18th-century_suicides" " Roland de la Platière was born and baptized on 18 February 1734 in Thizy ,  Rhône .  He was a studious child ,  who received a thorough education .  At the age of 18 years ,  Roland was offered the choice of becoming either a businessman or a priest .  But he declined both offers and took up studying manufacturing ,  leading him to the city of Lyons .  Two years later ,  a cousin and inspector of manufactures offered Roland a position in Rouen .  He gladly accepted the job .  Roland then was transferred to Languedoc ,  where he became an enthusiastic economist but soon became ill from overwork .  He was then offered the less stressful job of lead inspector of Picardy which was the third most important manufacturing province in France in 1781 . Later that year he married Marie-Jeanne Phlipon ,  better known simply as Madame Roland ,  the daughter of a Parisian engraver .  Madame Roland was just as involved in Jean-Marie's work as he was ,  editing much of his writing and supporting his political goals .  For the first four years of their marriage ,  Roland continued to live in Picardy and work as a factory inspector .  His knowledge of commercial affairs enabled him to contribute articles to the Encyclopédie Méthodique ,  a three volume encyclopedia of manufacturing and industry ,  in which ,  as in all his literary work ,  he was assisted by his wife .    Not long after he resigned as minister ,  the Girondins came under attack and Roland was denounced as well .  Roland fled Paris and went into hiding ;  in his absence ,  he was sentenced to death .  Madame Roland remained in Paris ,  where she was arrested in June 1793 and executed on 8 November .  When Roland learned belatedly of his wife's imminent death ,  he wandered away from his refuge in Rouen and wrote a few words expressing his horror at the Reign of Terror :  """"From the moment when I learned that they had murdered my wife ,  I would no longer remain in a world stained with enemies . """" He attached the paper to his chest ,  sat up against a tree ,  and ran a cane-sword through his heart on the evening of 10 November 1793 .  "

Her father died when she was young ,  and her mother brought her up working as a housemaid .   In 1926 ,  to help make ends meet ,  Ruan signed up for the prominent Mingxing Film Company .   She made her first film at the age of 16 .   The film ,  A Married Couple in Name Only (掛名的夫妻/挂名的夫妻) ,  was directed by Bu Wancang .  Her first big break came in Spring Dream of an Old Capital (故都春夢 or Reminiscences of Beijing ,  1930) which was a massive hit in China .  It was Ruan's first major work after signing with the newly formed Lianhua Studio in 1930 .  In it ,  she played a prostitute by the name of Yanyan . Thereafter ,  Ruan became Lianhua's major film star .  Her most memorable works came after 1931 ,  starting with the melodrama Love and Duty (directed by Bu Wancang) .  Ruan had by then gained popularity owing to a string of lead roles ,  and in 1933 she was voted second runner-up in a poll held by Star Daily (明星日報) for China's """"movie queen"""" .  (Hu Die emerged the winner and Chen Yumei was first runner-up) .  Beginning with Three Modern Women (1932) ,  Ruan started collaborating with a group of leftist Chinese directors . In Little Toys (1933) ,  a film by Sun Yu ,  Ruan played a long-suffering toy-maker .   Her next film ,  The Goddess (1934 ;  dir :  Wu Yonggang) ,  is often hailed as the pinnacle of Chinese silent cinema ;  Ruan sympathetically portrayed a prostitute bringing up a child .  Later that year ,  Ruan made her penultimate film ,  New Women (directed by Cai Chusheng) ,  in which she played an educated woman forced to death by an unfeeling society .  The film was based on the life of actress Ai Xia ,  who killed herself in 1934 .  Her final film ,  National Customs ,  was released shortly after her death . One of Ruan's earliest films ,  Love and Duty (1931) ,  directed by Bu Wancang ,  was discovered in Uruguay in 1994 .  Faced with her various public issues and intense private problems ,  Ruan committed suicide by using overdose of barbiturates in Shanghai on March 8 ,  1935 ,  at the age of 24 .  Her suicide note apparently contained a line which says """"gossip is a fearful thing"""" (人言可畏) ,  although recent researchers have doubted the note's authenticity as it appeared to have been forged by Tang Jishan . Recent researchers believe her deteriorating relationship with Tang Jishan and Zhang Damin's lawsuit were the cause to Ruan's death .  It was further intensified by the mob media of China after New Women was released ,  since the film depicted the life of actress Ai Xia ,  who committed suicide due to media rumors on her private life .  Ruan is also believed to have been physically abused on that evening when she died . Her funeral service at the Wanguo Funeral Home lasted for three days .  Several well-known film actors and actress attended her funeral ,  including Wang Renmei ,  Lin Chuchu and Liang Saizhen ,  and her pallbearers included some of the leading film directors like Lai Man-Wai ,  Fei Mu ,  Wu Yonggang and Cai Chusheng .  After the service ,  Ruan's casket was taken to a cemetery in Zhabei district . Her funeral procession was reportedly 3 miles (4 . 8km) long ,  with three women committing suicide during the event .  The New York Times called it """"the most spectacular funeral of the century"""" . Ruan Lingyu's tomb was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution which occurred from 1966 to 1976 .  "

*** "*page_ Sylvia_Plath" "*cat_ Suicides_in_London" " Sylvia Plath was born on October 27 ,  1932 ,  in Boston ,  Massachusetts . On April 27 ,  1935 ,  Plath's brother Warren was born . Otto Plath died on November 5 ,  1940 ,  a week and a half after Plath's eighth birthday , In 1950 ,  Plath attended Smith College ,  a private women's liberal arts college in Massachusetts .  She excelled academically .  While at Smith ,  she lived in Lawrence House ,  and a plaque can be found outside her old room .  She edited The Smith Review .  After her third year of college ,  Plath was awarded a coveted position as a guest editor at Mademoiselle magazine ,  during which she spent a month in New York City . She was furious at not being at a meeting the editor had arranged with Welsh poet Dylan Thomas—a writer whom she loved ,  said one of her boyfriends ,  """"more than life itself . """" She hung around the White Horse Tavern and the Chelsea Hotel for two days ,  hoping to meet Thomas ,  but he was already on his way home .  A few weeks later ,  she slashed her legs to see if she had enough """"courage"""" to kill herself . She survived this first suicide attempt ,  later writing that she """"blissfully succumbed to the whirling blackness that I honestly believed was eternal oblivion . """" Her stay at McLean Hospital and her Smith Scholarship were paid for by Olive Higgins Prouty ,  who had successfully recovered from a mental breakdown herself .  Plath seemed to make a good recovery and returned to college . In January 1955 ,  she submitted her thesis ,  The Magic Mirror :  A Study of the Double in Two of Dostoyevsky's Novels ,  and in June graduated from Smith with an A . B .  summa cum laude . She obtained a Fulbright Scholarship to study at Newnham College ,  one of the two women-only colleges of the University of Cambridge in England ,  where she continued actively writing poetry and publishing her work in the student newspaper Varsity .  At Newnham ,  she studied with Dorothea Krook ,  whom she held in high regard . Plath first met poet Ted Hughes on February 25 ,  1956 .  In a 1961 BBC interview (now held by the British Library Sound Archive) ,  Plath describes how she met Hughes : I'd read some of Ted's poems in this magazine and I was very impressed and I wanted to meet him .  I went to this little celebration and that's actually where we met .  .  .  Then we saw a great deal of each other .  Ted came back to Cambridge and suddenly we found ourselves getting married a few months later .  .  .  We kept writing poems to each other .  Then it just grew out of that ,  I guess ,  a feeling that we both were writing so much and having such a fine time doing it ,  we decided that this should keep on .  Plath described Hughes as """"a singer ,  story-teller ,  lion and world-wanderer"""" with """"a voice like the thunder of God . """"The couple married on June 16 ,  1956 ,  at St George the Martyr ,  Holborn in London (now in the Borough of Camden) with Plath's mother in attendance ,  and spent their honeymoon in Paris and Benidorm .  Plath returned to Newnham in October to begin her second year . In June 1957 ,  Plath and Hughes moved to the United States ,  and from September ,  Plath taught at Smith College ,  her alma mater .  She found it difficult to both teach and have enough time and energy to write , Both Lowell and Sexton encouraged Plath to write from her experience and she did so .  She openly discussed her depression with Lowell and her suicide attempts with Sexton ,  who led her to write from a more female perspective .  Plath began to consider herself as a more serious ,  focused poet and short-story writer . Plath and Hughes traveled across Canada and the United States ,  staying at the Yaddo artist colony in Saratoga Springs ,  New York in late 1959 .  Plath says that it was here that she learned """"to be true to my own weirdnesses"""" ,  but she remained anxious about writing confessionally ,  from deeply personal and private material . In February 1961 ,  Plath's second pregnancy ended in miscarriage ;  several of her poems ,  including """"Parliament Hill Fields"""" ,  address this event . In 1961 ,  the couple rented their flat at Chalcot Square to Assia Wevill (née Gutmann) and David Wevill .  Hughes was immediately struck with the beautiful Assia ,  as she was with him . Beginning in October 1962 ,  Plath experienced a great burst of creativity and wrote most of the poems on which her reputation now rests ,  writing at least 26 of the poems of her posthumous collection Ariel during the final months of her life .  In December 1962 ,  she returned alone to London with their children ,  and rented ,  on a five-year lease ,  a flat at 23 Fitzroy Road—only a few streets from the Chalcot Square flat .  William Butler Yeats once lived in the house ,  which bears an English Heritage blue plaque for the Irish poet .  Plath was pleased by this fact and considered it a good omen . The northern winter of 1962–1963 was one of the coldest in 100 years ;  the pipes froze ,  the children—now two years old and nine months—were often sick ,  and the house had no telephone . Before her death ,  Plath tried several times to take her own life . In January1963 ,  Plath spoke with John Horder ,  her general practitionerHorder prescribed her an anti-depressant ,  a monoamine oxidase inhibitor , The nurse was due to arrive at nine on the morning of February 11 ,  1963 ,  to help Plath with the care of her children .  Upon arrival ,  she could not get into the flat but eventually gained access with the help of a workman ,  Charles Langridge .  They found Plath dead with her head in the oven ,  having sealed the rooms between her and her sleeping children with tape ,  towels and cloths . Plath's intentions have been debated .  That morning ,  she asked her downstairs neighbor ,  a Mr . Thomas ,  what time he would be leaving .  She also left a note reading """"Call Dr . Horder , """" including the doctor's phone number .  It is argued Plath turned on the gas at a time when Thomas would have been able to see the note . An inquest was held on February 15 and gave a ruling of suicide as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning . The daughter of Plath and Hughes ,  Frieda Hughes ,  is a writer and artist .  On March 16 ,  2009 ,  Nicholas Hughes ,  their son ,  hanged himself at his home in Fairbanks ,  Alaska ,  following a history of depression .     "

Due to the family's poor financial situation ,  Hamada did not wear pants ,  and had to attend physical education using pants provided by the school staff .  He also never wore sneakers or boots ,  and on sunny days wore straw sandals .  Hamada later claimed that one of his teachers would always give him a bento after classes ,  a kind act that made him work harder than others .  While he only attended three of the six years of elementary school ,  Hamada excelled at math and the soroban ,  always scoring 100 points at the latter and competing solo in tournaments with it . Immediately after graduating elementary school in March 1939 ,  Hamada's uncle got him a job at a kamaboko store in Ōmuta .  There ,  he would often drive a trike to go buy ice cream ,  and was often entrusted with work related to the soroban or books ,  but not long after the Pacific War began ,  he was drafted to serve in the army . On October 20 ,  1943 ,  he was sent to work at a Kyushu Hikoki factory based behind what is now Minami-Fukuoka Station ,  and on weekends ,  he was engaged in airplane assembly work while simultaneously continuing working at the kamaboko store .  In July 1945 ,  Hamada was informed that he was going to be transferred to the Fujisawa Navy Air Corps in Kanagawa Prefecture as a maintenance engineer on September 1 ,  but this was prematurely cut short due to the end of the war . After the end of the war ,  Hamada found employment at the Japanese National Railways at the recommendation of his older brother ,  where he worked along railroad crossings ,  but abruptly quit not long after . After leaving the Japanese National Railways ,  Hamada found work at the Toyobo factory in Yamaguchi Prefecture ,  where he worked alongside people from his hometown .  One day ,  after being invited by a friend to have lunch ,  he abruptly quit ;  it was later discovered that he had been stealing supplies from the employees' dormitory . Hamada was arrested for the crime in August 1946 ,  and tried to explain himself to the arresting officer by claiming that the victim """"did not deserve compensation because After briefly working as a coal miner in Saga Prefecture ,  he returned to his previous job at the kamaboko store . Despite the fact that he was expecting a child soon ,  Hamada continued stealing .  He was eventually arrested after he was caught stealing wires from a nearby paddy field ,  which he planned to sell to buy clothing for the newborn .     "

*** "*page_ Henning_von_Tresckow" "*cat_ Suicides_by_explosive_device" " Tresckow was born in Magdeburg into a noble family from the Brandenburg region of Prussia with 300 years of military tradition that provided the Prussian Army with 21 generals . He received most of his early education from tutors on his family's remote rural estate ;  from 1913 to 1917 ,  he was a student at the Gymnasium in the town of Goslar .  He joined the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards as an officer cadet at age of 16 and became the youngest lieutenant in the Army in June 1918 .  In the Second Battle of the Marne ,  he earned the Iron Cross 2nd class for outstanding courage and independent action against the enemy .  At that time Count Siegfried von Eulenberg ,  the commander of the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards ,  predicted that """"You ,  Tresckow ,  will either become chief of the General Staff or die on the scaffold as a rebel . """"  After World War I ,  Tresckow stayed with the famed Infantry Regiment 9 Potsdam and took part in the suppression of the Spartacist movement in January 1919 ,  but resigned from the Weimar Republic Reichswehr Army in 1920 in order to study law and economics .  He worked in a banking house and embarked on a world journey visiting Britain ,  France ,  Brazil and the eastern United States in 1924 before he had to abandon it to take care of family possessions back home .  Like members of many prominent Prussian families ,  Tresckow married into another family with long-standing military traditions .  In 1926 ,  he married Erika von Falkenhayn ,  only daughter of Erich von Falkenhayn ,  the chief of the General Staff from 1914 to 1916 ,  and returned to military service ,  being sponsored by Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg .  Nevertheless ,  he was not a typical Prussian officer .  He wore his uniform only when it was absolutely required and disliked the regimentation of army life . In 1934 ,  Tresckow began General Staff training at the War Academy and graduated as the best of the class of 1936 .  He was assigned to the General Staff's 1st Department (Operations) ,  where he worked in close contact with Generals Ludwig Beck ,  Werner von Fritsch ,  Adolf Heusinger and Erich von Manstein . Later in 1939 and into 1940 ,  he served as the second general staff officer of Army Group A under Gerd von Rundstedt and Erich von Manstein ,  culminating in the invasion of France in the spring of 1940 .  Tresckow played a role in the adoption of the Manstein Plan ,  which proved to be so successful in the French campaign .  Tresckow's former regimental comrade Rudolf Schmundt was Hitler's chief military aide ,  and it was through the Tresckow-Schmundt channel that Manstein's plan ,  after being rejected by Army High Command ,  was brought to Hitler's attention . From 1941 to 1943 ,  he served under Field Marshal Fedor von Bock ,  his wife's cousin ,  and later Field Marshal Günther von Kluge as chief operations officer of the German Army Group Centre in Operation Barbarossa ,  the invasion of the Soviet Union .  Subsequently ,  in October and November 1943 ,  he served in combat as the commanding officer of  Grenadier Regiment 442 ,  defending the western bank of the Dnieper River in Ukraine .  From December 1943 until his death in 1944 ,  he served as Chief of Staff of the 2nd Army ,  in areas which are now Belarus and eastern Poland .  When the assassination attempt on Hitler and the following coup in Berlin (the 20 July plot) had failed ,  Tresckow decided to commit suicide at the front in Królowy Most near Białystok on 21 July .  His parting words to Schlabrendorff were :  The whole world will vilify us now ,  but I am still totally convinced that we did the right thing .  Hitler is the archenemy not only of Germany but of the world .  When ,  in few hours' time ,  I go before God to account for what I have done and left undone ,  I know I will be able to justify what I did in the struggle against Hitler .  God promised Abraham that He would not destroy Sodom if only ten righteous men could be found in the city ,  and so I hope for our sake God will not destroy Germany .  No one among us can complain about dying ,  for whoever joined our ranks put on the shirt of Nessus .  A man's moral worth is established only at the point where he is ready to give his life in defense of his convictions .  To protect other conspirators ,  he staged an appearance of partisan attack by firing his pistols and then dispatched himself by holding a hand grenade below his chin and detonating it .  He was buried in the family home in Wartenberg .  When the Nazis learned about his connections to Operation Valkyrie in late August ,  his body was exhumed and taken to the crematorium in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp .  His wife was arrested on 15 August ,  and her children taken away under the Nazi policy of Sippenhaft (shared family guilt) ;  however ,  early in October she was released and survived the war .  "

His family were descended from a French Protestant family who fled to England from Gascony in the 16th century to escape religious persecution .  A branch of the family settled in Dublin in the 17th century .  Theobald's father ,  Peter Tone ,  was a coach-maker who had a farm near Sallins ,  County Kildare and belonged to the Church of Ireland .  His mother came from a Catholic merchant family who converted to Protestantism after Theobald was born . He was baptised as Theobald Wolfe Tone in honour of his godfather ,  Theobald Wolfe of Blackhall ,  County Kildare ,  a first cousin of Arthur Wolfe ,  1st Viscount Kilwarden .  However ,  it was widely believed that Tone was the son of Theobald Wolfe ,  which ,  if true ,  made him a half-brother of the poet Charles Wolfe .  After his death ,  he was widely referred to as Wolfe Tone . In 1783 ,  Tone found work as a tutor to Anthony and Robert ,  younger half-brothers of Richard Martin MP of Galway ,  a prominent supporter of Catholic emancipation ,  at Dangan ,  the Martin family home . He studied law at Trinity College Dublin ,  where he became an active member in the College Historical Society debating club and was elected its auditor in 1785 .  He graduated BA in February 1786 . As a student ,  he eloped with Martha Witherington ,  daughter of William and Catherine Witherington (née Fanning) of Dublin . Disappointed at finding no support for a plan that he had submitted to William Pitt the Younger ,  to found a military colony in Hawaii ,  Tone initially planned to enlist as a soldier in the East India Company ,  but applied too late in the year ,  when no more ships would be sent out until the following spring .    When the prisoners were landed a fortnight later ,  Sir George Hill recognised Tone in the French adjutant-general's uniform in Lord Cavan's privy-quarters at Letterkenny . Recognising that the court was certain to convict him ,  he asked that """"the court should adjudge me to die the death of a soldier ,  and that I may be shot"""" .  Reading from a prepared speech ,  he defended his view of a military separation from Britain (as had occurred in the fledgeling United States) and explained his motives : I entered into the service of the French Republic with the sole view of being useful to my country .   To contend against British Tyranny ,  I have braved the fatigues and terrors of the field of battle ;  I have sacrificed my comfort ,  have courted poverty ,  have left my wife unprotected ,  and my children without a father .

*** "*page_ Wu_Zixu" "*cat_ Ancient_people_who_committed_suicide" " Wu Zixu was the second son of Wu She ,  the Grand Tutor of the crown prince Jian of the state of Chu .  In 522 BC ,  Fei Wuji ,  a corrupt official was sent to Qin to select a bride for the prince .  King Ping of Chu received a princess from the state of Qin as a bride for his son ,  but decided to keep her for himself upon seeing her beauty .  Fei Wuji ,  having gained favour from the King ,  convinced King Ping that Wu She and the crown prince himself would start a rebellion due to the bride being from Qin ,  and persuaded the king to execute Wu She .  Before his death ,  Wu She was forced ,  under duress ,  to send a letter to his sons ,  Wu Shang (伍尚) and Wu Zixu ,  which asked them to join him in the capital .  While both realized that this was a trap ,  Wu Shang decided to go to the capital to die with his father .  Wu Zixu ,  promising revenge ,  fled to the state of Wu . Wu Zixu ,  along with Prince Jian's son ,  Prince Sheng ,  hoped to flee to the state of Wu .  Wu Zixu ,  however ,  was a wanted man .  He and the young prince were constantly pursued by soldiers .  King Ping also ordered a very tight controls over the state's borders to catch Wu Zixu .  As Wu Zixu approached Zhaoguan (昭关) ,  the last pass to the state of Wu ,  he sought the help of the physician Donggao Gong (东皋公) ,  who recognized him as Wu She's son .  Donggao Gong felt deep sympathy for Wu Zixu's plight and offered to help him escape across the border . According to legend ,  Donggao Gong gave refuge to Wu Zixu in his home for a week .  Under enormous stress ,  Wu Zixu's hair turned completely white and his facial features aged greatly .  The change was a blessing in disguise as Wu Zixu's changed appearance helped him to escape and head to the state of Wu . In the state of Wu ,  Wu Zixu became a trusted advisor of Prince Guang and helped him assassinate his uncleIn 506 BCE ,  during the reign of King Zhao of Chu ,  King Helü decided to invade Chu .   The king personally led the army ,  along with his younger brother Fugai ,  Wu Zixu ,  as well as Sun Tzu ,  author of The Art of War .   Although Chu had a strong army led by Nang Wa and Shen Yinshu ,  it suffered a heavy defeat at the Battle of Boju .   King Zhao of Chu fled to Sui and the Wu army captured Ying ,  Chu's capital .   After entering Ying ,  Wu Zixu exhumed King Ping's corpse ,  and gave it 300 lashes to exact vengeance . The military victory led to Wu Zixu's elevation to Duke of Shen and his alias Shenxu . Bo Pi ,  whose grandfather had also been unjustly killed in Chu ,  arrived in the state of Wu .  Despite warnings about Bo Pi's character ,  Wu Zixu recommended him to the king of Wu ,  who made Bo Pi a minister . After the death of King Helü ,  Wu Zixu did not earn the trust of King Fuchai ,  the new monarch of Wu .  Wu Zixu saw the long-term danger of King Goujian of Yue and advised the king to conquer that state .  The King ,  however ,  listened instead to Bo Pi ,  who had been bribed by the Yue state .  Concerned with the safety of the kingdom ,  Wu Zixu pleaded with the king to take action against Yue but was ignored .  The King gave Wu Zixu a sword and ordered him to commit suicide on the justification that his behaviour amounted to sabotage .  Before he committed suicide ,  Wu Zixu asked King Fuchai to remove his eyes after his death and hang them on the city gate so that he could watch the capture of the Wu capital by the Yue army . Ten years after Wu Zixu's death ,  as Wu Zixu had predicted ,  King Goujian of Yue conquered the state of Wu .  Faced with the demise of his state ,  King Fuchai committed suicide .  He lamented that he did not heed the counsel of Wu Zixu and covered his face as he died because he dared not face Wu in the afterlife .

He was first raised by Consort Kang ,  and after she adopted his eldest brother Zhu Youxiao ,  he was raised by Consort Zhuang . All of the Taichang Emperor's sons died before reaching adulthood except for Zhu Youxiao and Zhu Youjian .  Zhu Youjian grew up in a relatively lonely but quiet environment .  After the Taichang Emperor died in 1620 ,  Zhu Youjian's elder brother Zhu Youxiao succeeded their father and was enthroned as the Tianqi Emperor .  He granted the title """"Prince of Xin"""" (信王) to Zhu Youjian and posthumously honoured Zhu Youjian's mother ,  Lady Liu ,  as """"Consort Xian"""" (賢妃) .  Fearing the court eunuch Wei Zhongxian ,  who controlled the Tianqi Emperor ,  Zhu Youjian avoided attending imperial court sessions under the pretext of illness until he was summoned to court by his brother in 1627 .  At the time ,  the Tianqi Emperor was gravely ill and wanted Zhu Youjian to rely on Wei Zhongxian in the future .    In April 1644 ,  the Ming imperial court finally ordered Wu Sangui to move his army south from his fortress at Ningyuan to Shanhai Pass .  Word reached Beijing that Shun rebels were approaching the capital through Juyong Pass ,  and the Chongzhen Emperor held his last audience with his ministers on 23 April .  Li Zicheng offered the emperor an opportunity to surrender ,  but the negotiations produced no result .  Li commanded his forces to attack on 24 April .  Rather than face capture by the rebels ,  the Chongzhen Emperor gathered all members of the imperial household except his sons .  Using his sword ,  he killed Consort Yuan and Princess Zhaoren ,  and severed the arm of Princess Changping .  On 25 April ,  the Chongzhen Emperor was said to have walked to Meishan ,  a small hill in present-day Jingshan Park .  There ,  he either hanged himself on a tree ,  The emperor was buried in the Ming tombs . The Manchus were quick to exploit the death of the Chongzhen Emperor :  by claiming to """"avenge the emperor , """" they rallied support from loyalist Ming forces and civilians .  The Shun dynasty lasted less than a year with Li Zicheng's defeat at the Battle of Shanhai Pass .  The victorious Manchus established the Shunzhi Emperor of the Qing dynasty as ruler of all China .  Because the Chongzhen Emperor had refused to move the court south to Nanjing ,  the new Qing government was able to take over a largely intact Beijing bureaucracy ,  aiding their efforts to displace the Ming . After the Chongzhen Emperor's death ,  loyalist forces proclaimed a Southern Ming dynasty in Nanjing ,  naming Zhu Yousong (the Prince of Fu) as the Hongguang Emperor .  In 1645 ,  however ,  Qing armies started to move against the Ming remnants .  The Southern Ming ,  again bogged down by factional infighting ,  were unable to hold back the Qing onslaught ,  and Nanjing surrendered on 8 June 1645 .  Zhu Yousong was captured on 15 June and brought to Beijing ,  where he died the following year .  The dwindling Southern Ming were continually pushed farther south ,  and the last emperor of the Southern Ming ,  Zhu Youlang ,  was finally caught in Burma ,  transported to Yunnan ,  and executed in 1662 by Wu Sangui .
