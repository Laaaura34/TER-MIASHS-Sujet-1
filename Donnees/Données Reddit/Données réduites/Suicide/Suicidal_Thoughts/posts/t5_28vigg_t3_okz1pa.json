I have dayvisions, i call them because i don\u2019t want it to seem like i enjoy them, about vicious crimes to commit to people or animals. \n\nBut what contradicts what i just said is that, i\u2019ve recently hurt someone  who would give me the world and i am sad about it but at the same time i\u2019m not i don\u2019t care at all. but i do because i\u2019ve relapsed not because of them, i would never blame someone for that, i did mainly because i over reacted. \n\nWhat i\u2019m trying to say is that I have scary thoughts of hurting people and i\u2019m not as guilty as i say i am for having them. Ive had overwhelming thoughts of ending my parents life and sometimes it\u2019s all i think about.
