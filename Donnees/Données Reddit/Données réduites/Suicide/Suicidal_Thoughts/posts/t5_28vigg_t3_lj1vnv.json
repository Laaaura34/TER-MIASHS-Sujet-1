I nearly hung myself a year ago. Sometimes now I\u2019m frustrated I\u2019m better now than I was then. Further away from the end goal. What is the point of being \u201cbetter\u201d though? Just well enough to not do it. Even the cool shit isn\u2019t *that* cool. Feels like a big fucking waste of time. Even if I *could* manage to carve out a decent life it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s worth all the struggle. There\u2019s too much bullshit. Ugly ass world. Ugly country. Ugly people. Ugly surroundings. Hideous. Ugly ugly ugly polluted everything blip nothing irrelevant anyway. Why bother? God damn it someone put me out of my misery. I add nothing to the world and the maybe 3 people that would care are also as good as dead themselves. We\u2019re only here for a second anyway and it\u2019s still too long if you ask me. Dust in the wind pieces of shit. I\u2019m the biggest piece of shit of all!!!!!!!!!!!! \ud83d\udc51 This doesn\u2019t make sense. I still feel all of this yet now I cant see myself committing suicide? I got that one shred of hope that ruined all my logic. Pisses me off honestly. Obviously. I. Should.
