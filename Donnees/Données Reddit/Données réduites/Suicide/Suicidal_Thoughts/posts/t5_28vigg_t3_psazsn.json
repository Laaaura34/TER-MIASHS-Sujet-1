(I am korean American, white side of my family neglected and abused me, so I tended to favor my Korean side more and I want to be there where the people I love once lived.) I will graduate there and live a normal life, but if I am still not happy I will jump off the bridge of life in Seoul (Mapo bridge) and if I die then that\u2019s that but If I live then.. I am not sure. Maybe I will keep trying or I will just try again..", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/psazsn/i_made_a_suicide_plan_what_do_you_think/", "title": "I made a suicide plan, what do you think?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "akim787", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 19, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632196783, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/psazsn/i_made_a_suicide_plan_what_do_you_think/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635428708.2759483, "replies_charged": false}
