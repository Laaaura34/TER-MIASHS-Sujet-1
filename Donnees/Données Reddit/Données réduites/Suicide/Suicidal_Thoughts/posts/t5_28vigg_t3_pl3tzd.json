I hate talking about it, I find it super embarrassing and I don\u2019t want to bother people by whining constantly. I used to get by but now I don\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s gotten so bad and so intense. I\u2019m so alone. I just don\u2019t seem to feel good enough for anyone. I hate the way I look, the way I speak, what I say who I am. I hate it. I have so much guilt and rage in me but I don\u2019t know how to express it. I keep crying I can never stop it\u2019s so pathetic I just want to be a normal girl. I attempted suicide of January last year and it was one of the most horrific times in my life. I hate being vulnerable in front of people. My friends don\u2019t seem to really care. But I\u2019m so clingy and I can\u2019t handle change, I wouldn\u2019t dare make new ones. I used to be so outgoing. I just feel empty. And im considering ending it. I feel dirty all the time. Im so sick of it. People only seem to care when it\u2019s suicide. But it\u2019s becoming a dull ache every day. No one sees it. I wish thoughts like these weren\u2019t all that was in my head. But I can\u2019t think of anything else and it\u2019s draining me so much. It\u2019s never been this bad", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pl3tzd/i_dont_know_what_to_do/", "title": "I don\u2019t know what to do", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "siiopiip", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631212900, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pl3tzd/i_dont_know_what_to_do/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428841.7818756, "replies_charged": false}
