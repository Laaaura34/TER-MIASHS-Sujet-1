I'm feeling like pushing everyone away, so i can end my suffering in peace. \n\nI have always been depressed, even as a little child. At first it was just an empty feeling but the hole grew bigger and bigger till i was no longer really existent. \n\nI feel like i'm drowning and i am tired of asking for help and fighting, i am barely holding in and i want to give up.
