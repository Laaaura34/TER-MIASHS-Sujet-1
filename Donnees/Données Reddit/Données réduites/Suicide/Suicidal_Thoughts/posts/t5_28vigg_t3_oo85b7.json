Or wish that you're smart enough to figure out how to create an actual working time machine.\n\nFck life, I hate this world. I hate how I took my schooling for granted because I just had one major breakdown from expecting too much of myself and constantly studying. Had I not been selfish I could've finished my degree already. I could have gotten a job to help put food on the damn table. I fucked up and I'd rather die now. I'm too much of a burden already. I'm doing what I can but nothing's happening. I applied for multiple jobs already, Jobs that I'm way qualified of (Fast food crew, Cashier, etc.) but I never get that \"You're hired\" call. I can't go back to school, I can't afford it yet and I can't possibly burden my parents for it again. I can't go on anymore. My life sucks and I don't want my family's life to suck just because of me. Yeah they might feel sad about my passing but I'm a lot more helpful to them when I no longer exist.\n\nI just need to get this off my chest. I know there's plenty of people out there who probably have the same problems as I do, maybe some even have it worse but are still able to see the silver lining. I ain't seein' it, I'm seein' ashes in a jar.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/oo85b7/uselessly_stupid_that_is_i/", "title": "Uselessly Stupid, That is I", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "damnrovhul", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626806240, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/oo85b7/uselessly_stupid_that_is_i/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429265.9387074, "replies_charged": false}
