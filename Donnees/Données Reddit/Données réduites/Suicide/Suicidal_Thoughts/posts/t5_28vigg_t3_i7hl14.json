My story that I have to tell is long but I will keep it short. It already startet at the age of 11 when my Father died because of an car accident. My classmates started to bully me until the end of school (end of the 10th grade). Thought out the following years after the accident I had my first suicide attempt at the age of 16, 2 years later another one. Now I am 23 and everything I witnessed until today got stuck in my head. I started running from my problems and hide myself behind a smiling face while I am dead inside. Constantly thinking about to leave this shit show so called life. I just recently lost my GF too because I couldn't tell her what's really going through my head, I am about to loose another job (2nd apprenticeship) as well because I can't tell anyone how I really feel without getting smiled at while just trying to hide myself again.\nI've falling into a deep depression because of the loss and the mental abuse over the years. \nI can't sleep at night anymore\nEverything just feels wrong.\n\nI am sorry if I wrote anything confusing I am native German and I am currently not really able to find the right words for how I feel at the moment \nThank you for any help in advice", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/i7hl14/i_am_looking_for_help/", "title": "I am looking for help", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "xJunki3", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1597106499, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/i7hl14/i_am_looking_for_help/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429618.2995496, "replies_charged": false}
