He blamed all his mental health on me because he didn\u2019t wanna take the responsibility for it so he made me carry it on top of my own issues and I let him just dump all his problems on me until it cost me my education nd I was kicked out of my school because of his parents threatened to make a load of stuff up to get them in trouble if they didn\u2019t get rid of me and I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore, I\u2019ve been clean of SH for months now but I\u2019m ngl I think ima gonna relapse nd it\u2019s been over a year since my last attempt nd all the feelings are coming back. I met this guy and he\u2019s so fucking nice nd amazing nd I rly like him nd he likes me but I keep pushing him away because I don\u2019t wanna get hurt again and I can\u2019t control myself because I just wanna hug him nd let it all out but I can\u2019t bring myself to do it. I\u2019m sorry if your going through suicidal thoughts and I hope you get the support you need no one should have to feel such intense pain \ud83e\udd7a", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jr42vc/is_it_me_or_is_anyone_else_so_lonely_atm_that/", "title": "Is it me or is anyone else so lonely atm that they feel like there the only person in the world...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SyncmXemzy69", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1604949193, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jr42vc/is_it_me_or_is_anyone_else_so_lonely_atm_that/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429624.601326, "replies_charged": false}
