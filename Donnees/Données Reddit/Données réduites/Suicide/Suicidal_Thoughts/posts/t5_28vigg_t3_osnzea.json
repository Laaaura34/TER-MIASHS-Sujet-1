However, due to family issues, personal struggles with low self esteem and honestly, my future look in life is bleak.\n\nI\u2019m currently in the hospital, surrounded by doctors, nurses, and pills. Lots of them. Don\u2019t they realise I can just keep them hidden and accumulate enough of these so called \u201chappy pills\u201d until I can OD on them? \n\nI don\u2019t even know what to do, i don\u2019t think I\u2019m making sense anymore. I just feel like I\u2019m a burden for everything and that I can\u2019t just keep staying alive if I\u2019m not going to be a good attribution to society. \n\nI guess I just need a place to vent. I suppose there\u2019s still \u201chope\u201d for me or whatever but honestly I\u2019d really just like to leave and do everyone the favour of not being here anymore.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/osnzea/i_want_to_die/", "title": "I want to die", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Rare-Carpenter-198", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627396372, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/osnzea/i_want_to_die/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428848.438845, "replies_charged": false}
