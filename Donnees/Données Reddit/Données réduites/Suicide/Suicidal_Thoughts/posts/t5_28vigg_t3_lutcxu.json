I'm sorry if my english is bad, i'm french. I don't really know where to start. First of all, i don't think i'm depressed, i just have a lot of mood-swinging and i feel embarassed when someone say that i am depressed because i feel like i'm discrediting people that are really sick and ill. I'm a 16 teen and i'm doing my last class of middle school for the second time . I feel like a fucking idiot because of this. I feel empty almost all the time and there is no reason for this : i have close and good friends, i have a girlfriend and loving parents. But i feel lonely. I went through a \"depression\" when i was 8, because of school. I really hate school and i know i can't escape this shit. I hate humans  because they are fucking stupid (i mean most of them). My futur is uncertain and i know it'll be shit. I have seen myself dead multiple time and sometime, i wish i'll be dead and cold. I'm lost. I only feel happy when i'm high or when i listen to music.\n\ni apologize for stealing your time like i did and i hope you'll have a good night or day, reader :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/lutcxu/written_with_the_heart_i_guess/", "title": "Written with the heart , i guess", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "_ron-", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614553916, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/lutcxu/written_with_the_heart_i_guess/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429010.1576786, "replies_charged": false}
