I have been dealing with depression, anxiety and suicidal thought for as long as I can remember. Recently a very important Person in my life cut ties with me, he was the only reason I was still trying to be alive. Always when I was going to hurt MYSELF I always thought of him. He also was the only Person in my life who accepted me, saw me as a real boy. Now he\u2019s not here anymore and I dont see anything worth of living anymore. I dont know what to do anymore. I feel like getting MYSELF drunk tonight and finally do it, end it all.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/o9990a/i_cant_keep_on_anymore/", "title": "I can\u2019t keep on anymore", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "elikk_1", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624840353, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/o9990a/i_cant_keep_on_anymore/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429220.569066, "replies_charged": false}
