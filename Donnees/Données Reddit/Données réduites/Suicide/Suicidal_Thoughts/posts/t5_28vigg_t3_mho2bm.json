I obviously don\u2019t wanna die but I just wish I wasn\u2019t alive. I\u2019m 18 and in college but I hate school. I can\u2019t stand it. I feel like it\u2019s the only path in life I can take and I don\u2019t want to disappoint my parents. They expect so much from me but I don\u2019t feel like I can do it. \n\nI can\u2019t stand just sitting down and doing hours of homework for multiple classes. I hate going to class because of my social anxiety and because of COVID everything feels even more limited. More online work and I just feel so overwhelmed. \n\nI love what I want to study, yet I don\u2019t see myself reaching that goal. \n\nI\u2019m not suicidal or have ever harmed myself other than just punching myself. Yet these thoughts just constantly invade my mind, \u201cwhat if I didn\u2019t exist\u201d\u201d \u201cwhat if I just died,\u201d \u201cwhat if I just disappeared\u201d and I don\u2019t know what to do.
