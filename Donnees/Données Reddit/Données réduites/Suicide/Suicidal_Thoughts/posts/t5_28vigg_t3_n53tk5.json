Every single one of my accomplishments have been to please my family. I got my degree in biomedical engineering for my mom, i got a boyfriend for my mom, i pretend like everything is fine for my mom.\n\n I plan to kill myself the day after my mom passes. it will be easier that way, people can mourn for two at the same time instead of separately. I cannot make her suffer anymore than i already have, that's why I won't do it before hand. But i am also tiered of suffering, it is inhumane to force me to stay alive.\n\nAntidepressants do the job keeping me alive. the longer I take them the more I feel the emptiness inside, but the smile still comes out and no one knows.  The suffering is easier to handle, although deep down inside I know the \"happiness\" is false. But like i said, it does the job until then. I've been taking them since I was 16.... I'm 34. they are the only thing keeping me alive. and i only take them for my mom.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/n53tk5/it_is_inhumane_to_force_me_to_stay_alive/", "title": "it is inhumane to force me to stay alive", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "an0n1m0u5_", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1620177803, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/n53tk5/it_is_inhumane_to_force_me_to_stay_alive/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429242.52604, "replies_charged": false}
