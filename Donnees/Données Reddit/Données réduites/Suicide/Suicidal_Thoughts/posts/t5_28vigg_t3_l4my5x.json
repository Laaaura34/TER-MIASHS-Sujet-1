I've been trying, really trying desperately to find a reason to want to live, just one reason that can make me strong enough to endure all the shit I'm facing, but I can't. I just can't. Every time I get my hopes up and it fails, all it does it push me closer to the end. Every day, just one step closer. Everything that can go wrong has been going wrong day by day. It makes me feel like the world itself is encouraging me to do it, despite all the basic \"You can do it, life will get better\" words I've been hearing. I tell the same thing to the people I care about but in my heart, I don't believe in those words myself. Reality keeps slapping me awake from my delusions, and I think this time I've finally made my decision. I know a few places where people won't come by easily. A few places where no one can see from the outside, no one can smell anything from the outside and my body will be left to bleed to death. This time next Monday, I'm going to stab myself in the throat, to prevent myself from screaming for help even if I change my mind once I do it due to the pain. If there's a afterlife, if hell exists, I'm heading there anyways. It's just a matter of time, and sooner is better than later if it means I won't have to endure more of this fked up life and world.\n\nThis will be my final desperate attempt at finding a reason.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/l4my5x/next_week/", "title": "Next week", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ZutomayoiSG", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1611577823, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/l4my5x/next_week/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429513.3362308, "replies_charged": false}
