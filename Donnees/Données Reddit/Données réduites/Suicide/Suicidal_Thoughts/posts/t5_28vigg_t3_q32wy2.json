I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d make it past my junior year of highschool but I\u2019m 19 right now. Signing leases with people I\u2019ve met over the years. As much as I try to love life there\u2019s always something sucking me to the other side. I try to make new hobbies and habits but I always end up with new cuts on my arm. For me I bring myself to the point of suicide. Sitting at the top of a bridge just waiting on the intuition to jump. How do you guys deal with it ? Do you guys just try to become the person you want to be to suppress the past or do you guys do the same ?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q32wy2/hello/", "title": "Hello", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Great-Preference3881", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633587611, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q32wy2/hello/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429583.8031256, "replies_charged": false}
