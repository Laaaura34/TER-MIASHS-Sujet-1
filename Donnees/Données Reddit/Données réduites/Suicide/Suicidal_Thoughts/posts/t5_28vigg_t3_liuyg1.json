I have endured a great deal of abuse and trauma up until I was 20. I\u2019m conventionally pretty, am a well liked and social person. \nI think about suicide almost daily. I\u2019ve been admitted 6 times now, the last being a month ago, for suicidal ideation. It didn\u2019t help at all. If anything, that stay made me want to stop seeking help. I had to strip naked twice, bend over and cough like I was going to jail. The experience of being in a hospital setting alone traumatized me. I don\u2019t ever want to experience that again. But I do know I wouldn\u2019t be here without that stay. Better things can be possible, if I make the conscious choice every day to choose life. \nI\u2019m still struggling with a therapist, and I\u2019m on Effexor, lamictal, hydroxyzine, and trazodone. They won\u2019t give me \u201cas needed\u201d prescriptions because of my history of drug abuse. \nCan you relate? I can\u2019t let it end because I\u2019m the legal guardian of my disabled brother.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/liuyg1/at_the_end_of_my_rope/", "title": "At the end of my rope", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Mysterious-Exit-2900", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613197436, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/liuyg1/at_the_end_of_my_rope/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429405.6084833, "replies_charged": false}
