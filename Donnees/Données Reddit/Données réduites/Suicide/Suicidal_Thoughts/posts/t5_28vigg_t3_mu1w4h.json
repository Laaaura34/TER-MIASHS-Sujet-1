I just want you to know it is possible to want to live again. It's not an easy journey and sometimes it's hard finding the right help but I know that you can do it too if I could. Please don't hesitate to reach out to people who can help. I know it sucks sometimes having all of these suicidal thoughts and not being able to do much about them, but you can get better with the right meds and therapy. Obviously, I know not everyone can afford treatment or have access to State subsidized healthcare. Just please don't give up on yourself there is stuff to live for and the way I look at it tomorrow could be worse or it could be better but you won't know if you're dead. The only way for things to get better is to live another day and try again. \n\nTake care all!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mu1w4h/a_note_after_getting_help/", "title": "A note after getting help", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bigBlueRandomBall", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618842763, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mu1w4h/a_note_after_getting_help/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428999.380149, "replies_charged": false}
