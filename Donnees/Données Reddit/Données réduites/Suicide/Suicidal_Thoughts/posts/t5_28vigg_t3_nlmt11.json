Also this is just another suicidal rant so lots of cussing.\n\nI\u2019ve been fucked up as long as I can remember. I\u2019ve had 3 past suicide attempts and have been \u201crehabilitated\u201d twice. I am seriously mentally ill. In my search for reasons to live, I find nothing. All these asshats with their \u201cyou are loved\u201d, \u201cyou matter\u201d, \u201cthe world needs you\u201d...they think those empty words mean shit to a person who can barely find a reason to wake up? Everyone thinks their a mental health \u201cadvocate\u201d just for saying these shitty little sayings. I\u2019m so desensitized to positive sensations. I can\u2019t even find joy in food, hobbies are just me wasting money and time, work is unfulfilling and sucks away my time. I\u2019m beyond depressed, my PTSD makes it so I can\u2019t even interact with my partner like a normal person, and people have their little two cents to add at every turn. \n\n\u201cJust exercise and get outside\u201d -okay sure, it\u2019s that easy. Let me just put that on the list of things I\u2019m too depressed to make myself do. I can barely manage to motivate myself to wake up, but if I just exercise and go outside I\u2019ll be chipper. Fuck off as if I could afford to take days off and still eat. \n\nMy personal favorite, \u201cGod doesn\u2019t give us more than we can handle\u201d -First off, don\u2019t impose your religious beliefs on MY suffering. Fuck you and your God. If he\u2019s so pure and holy why the fuck did he make rapists? What\u2019s his point of existing? So I can worship him and feed his atrocious ego? \n\n\u201cSomeone loves you\u201d -Maybe they do, maybe they don\u2019t. Personally I feel like no one gives a single shit and my dead phone is just proof of that. I don\u2019t give a shit about some random on the internet saying they love me. A bot can do it too. I have no family and no friends, just my partner. As a social creature it\u2019s something that\u2019s devastating.\n\n\u201cYou matter\u201d -Okay so I matter? Matter for what? My minimum wage job? Heaven forbid they just immediately hire a new person. To my family? They never reach out to me and when I reach out to them it\u2019s radio silence. Oh that\u2019s right, you just don\u2019t want me to kill myself because it\u2019s upsetting to YOU. Not because you genuinely care about ME.\n\n\u201cYou have so much to live for\u201d -Like working the same dead end job, no time to do anything (not that I could afford to) and eternal emptiness? What\u2019s the point in living the same day over and over again? I can\u2019t even enjoy eating and nothing gives me serotonin or a sense of fulfillment. Easy to say I have something to live for when you can actually enjoy living. \n\n\u201cSee a therapist, medications aren\u2019t bad\u201d -This one is hit or miss. But for me, it\u2019s a huge fucking miss. I\u2019ve tried what feels like dozens of different medications for the following mental illnesses: PTSD, MDD, ADHD, and Generalized Anxiety disorder. Not a single one made me feel \u201cbetter\u201d. The side affects alone made me want to die. Most of them just made me feel hollow and numb. Which I guess in big pharma is the perfect solution to feeling like a deep pit of nothing. Therapy just felt embarrassing and did nothing but deconstruct my feelings and tell me why I feel and act the way I do. Guess what Dr. Nguyen, I already fucking know that being raped and mentally/emotionally abused is causing these feelings and actions, so here is my $60 copay to see you. \n\nAll I can think about is how much easier it is to not exist at all. People die every second of every day, if anyone watches the news you can tell people don\u2019t care about people. I don\u2019t know, to the 5 people that read this post that are probably suicidal too, what has a shitty \u201cadvocate\u201d said to you that just made you feel worse? It\u2019d be nice to know that I\u2019m not the only suicidal maniac.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/nlmt11/you_are_loved_bs_effort_by_bs_people/", "title": "\u201cYou are loved\u201d, BS effort by BS people", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "PrincessaWeed", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 22, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622050840, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/nlmt11/you_are_loved_bs_effort_by_bs_people/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635428990.6965914, "replies_charged": false}
