I have depression and really intense Anxiety and it catches me off guard all the time. I had one good relationship with a girl named Destani, and I really wish she wouldn\u2019t have, but she went behind my back, I left her, rejected when she begged, than later on I begged, and she\u2019s doing the same to me. Also my stepdad is super Verbally abusive to me. He recently got arrested for it, and it made me feel better, but than again, I just genuinely don\u2019t want to live anymore. Yet I don\u2019t have the balls to break my mother\u2019s heart like that. I wanna join the military and die for my country so that I won\u2019t have to take ownership of the fact that I died. I just lay in my room till fucking 4:45 AM and I can\u2019t sleep bc I do nothing but listen to depressing rap and metal while thinking of ways I could kill myself if I was brave enough", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/gwyfpp/my_father_influenced_me/", "title": "My father influenced me", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dig_bick_energy3", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1591334495, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/gwyfpp/my_father_influenced_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429582.4565907, "replies_charged": false}
