I\u2019ve been suicidal before but this feels soooo different. Half the time I blame my child for my misery ( I know, I fucking suck clearly ) the other half, I love him beyond words. It\u2019s like Myself is battling the mom in me or something. Idk, can barely put half this shit I to words. Im just tired of doing this alone.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pjdhno/wish_i_could_die_without_leaving_my_son_feel_as/", "title": "Wish I could die without leaving my son \ud83d\ude12 feel as hopeless as it gets", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Big-Friendship-9791", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630979756, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pjdhno/wish_i_could_die_without_leaving_my_son_feel_as/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429147.2566574, "replies_charged": false}
