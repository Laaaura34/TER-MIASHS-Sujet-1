I've changed jobs for what I thought was a better opportunity. For me. For my family. I was very wrong. 2 weeks in and I'm already trying to go back to my old job. So a failure I've become at work too. Every time I walk past a mirror I get sick at the sight of myself. I think about leaving this world behind more often than I already did. I also think about how much of a coward I am. People would be devastated if I was to go. They would also quickly get over it. Or at least one or two of them would. Couldn't I just go to sleep and not wake? That would be awesome. I'm sure that's a common theme here. But it absolves us from any wrong doing. Any blame. Mentally, I'm done. Gone. Physically, I'm still here.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mumqlc/im_still_here/", "title": "I'm still here", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "BCTrob", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618911669, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mumqlc/im_still_here/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429353.487103, "replies_charged": false}
