I ask how f##ked up are these families who stick these memorial Shrines at the locations of their lost loved ones?\nI pass one everyday to work on a motorway bridge... in memorial of Raven known for swearing at old drivers, laughing at people falling over, watching porn in the school library and oh yeah jumping of this bridge landing on the motorway below before getting splatted by a truck... nice here some dead flowers which have been stuck for weeks with duct tape, a childhood teddy weathered and losing an eye and missing a foot, thanks to the teenagers who passed by and left thier half chewed flavour less gum squashed on the hand rail multiple colors and sizes and thanks to the poem left by mother covered in cling film or a ring binder sleeve that has overcome to the rain and disintegrated the paper within. All in proximity to a photo of me when I was in high school cause that was the last time he actually smiled in a photograph ha I still had hair back then.\nYeah I'd rather have a hole in the ground thanks.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/m8uyw1/memorial_shrines/", "title": "Memorial Shrines", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "rogueraven81", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616199094, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/m8uyw1/memorial_shrines/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429022.318893, "replies_charged": false}
