I had clinically diagnosed depression for 2 years and probably many more years before and after that. I took medically prescribed anti-depressants. The key is finding someone who loves you or who would care if you disappeared.  I understand its hard sometimes, if you cant find that I recommend setting goals. Very simple but helpful. Examples being; I will do this this week, I will make it through this week, I will find a friend today etc. Suicide and depression are found far and wide. Social media doesnt help, it hurts. Remove yourself from it for a while and see how you feel. I hope this helped, and always remember the hotlines are open and help is available. I love you all and thank you for reading.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jou0ce/please_dont_do_it/", "title": "Please dont do it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "aSH1TYoutuber", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 0, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1604620057, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jou0ce/please_dont_do_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429634.5070183, "replies_charged": false}
