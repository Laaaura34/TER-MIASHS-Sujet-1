I was born into a broken home, had pretty shitty chances to start. Mom tried to kill herself shortly after I started getting sexually abused because of mental illness, moved in with my grandparents and things seemed to be going well. Well no, lost my virginity to rape, had multiple abusive relationships, one of which almost killed me multiple times, and just recently one trying to get me in legal trouble for things HE did to ME... I'm in my 20's and already divorced, can't have kids, live alone, leaving the army after 5 years and I feel like everything just going downhill even more. I'm so tired of feeling like a punching bag and pin cushion. I wish I was treated like an actual person by the people I have attachments to... it's so hard for me to let people go, no matter how toxic, no matter how much they hurt me or suck me dry of my happiness. I can't stop thinking about killing myself, and I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to stick around. I haven't eaten in a week, can't keep anything down, and haven't been able to sleep unless I drink myself there. I wish I wouldn't wake up from my next sleep...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q0g392/my_whole_life_has_been_a_trainwreck/", "title": "My whole life has been a trainwreck", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "massvegas", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633261240, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q0g392/my_whole_life_has_been_a_trainwreck/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428967.2257636, "replies_charged": false}
