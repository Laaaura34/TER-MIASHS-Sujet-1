I\u2019m trying so fucking hard to not end it (method 1 is an ever present siren song, method 2 is sitting on the counter but requires research so I\u2019m avoiding the research, method 3 is out there but also requires research), but\u2026 is this just thoughts or am I really finally about to do it? \n\nI can\u2019t catch a break, been suicidal for over a year after a trauma that I\u2019m forced to relive daily, and getting away requires positive energy and focus that I\u2019m too beaten down to have. I know I gotta escape if I\u2019m to survive, but the siren song of oblivion is damn strong. I should be focused on escape, but I\u2019m focused on suicide. Is this for real?
