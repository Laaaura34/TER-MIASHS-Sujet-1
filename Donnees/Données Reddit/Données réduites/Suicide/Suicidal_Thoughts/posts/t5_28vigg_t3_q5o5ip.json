Though when I get in an argument and angry and upset I find myself always going to suicide and it gets to the point where I am genuinely going to go through with it but I end up getting scared with a bottle of pills in my hand. Does anyone have any tips for dealing with this? In the moment I try to think about what everyone I love would do but then I convince myself that they don\u2019t care, I try watching videos or listening to music and it doesn\u2019t block out the feeling. It worries me that one day I might just get so overwhelmed I don\u2019t second guess myself and I just go through with it. So yeah I was just wondering if other people have some things that help them come down from that edge so to speak.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q5o5ip/tips_for_calming_down_when_upset/", "title": "Tips for calming down when upset?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "OddParanoia", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633926553, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q5o5ip/tips_for_calming_down_when_upset/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428849.092359, "replies_charged": false}
