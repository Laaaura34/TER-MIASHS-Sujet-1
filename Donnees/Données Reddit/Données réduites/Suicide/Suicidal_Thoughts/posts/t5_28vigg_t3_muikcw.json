I drank a bottle of wine and almost jumped from my balcony tonight.  I am so sad. I literally am a basket case and am lucky my fiance kept me from jumping. I feel so pathetic bc I'm unemployed, applying for grad school, can barely adult, and just feel like I'm not making any progress.  I was so close tonight to ending it all.

I have been crying for hours and legit don't know what to do with myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/muikcw/im_really_having_trouble/", "title": "I'm really having trouble", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "coccoL", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618892719, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/muikcw/im_really_having_trouble/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429286.5203474, "replies_charged": false}
