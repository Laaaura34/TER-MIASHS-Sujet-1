Basically I have a friend on Discord, he told me that he \"done something terrible\" and said \"I taken pretty much a lethal dose of medication. The medication has a 50 Percent chance of being placebo. I'll wake up tomorrow or not wake up at all.\" I said to him he needs to get medical attention right now but he went offline and isn't answering my calls or anyone else's for that matter.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jw4qje/what_do_i_do/", "title": "What do I do???", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "sbuxthrowaway2001", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1605657406, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jw4qje/what_do_i_do/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429456.5012634, "replies_charged": false}
