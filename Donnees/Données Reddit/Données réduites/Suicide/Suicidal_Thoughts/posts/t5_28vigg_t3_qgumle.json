I literally told to 3 of my friends how i've been feeling, and i think i hurt them. I could see in their eyes that they were sad, worried, terrified.. i fucking screwed up. I'm scared that they will leave me and i'll be alone because of that. But i just can't, i've been feeling so bad mentally and i can't do anything anymore, i just want things to end.. i'm tired, i wanna be the best to the people i love but i can't even do that. I hate myself so much for having these problems why couldn't i just be normal and not care about the bad things in my life like everyone else.. i feel like i'm just being toxic to people by opening up too much.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/qgumle/im_hurting_people_around_me/", "title": "I'm hurting people around me", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "no_thank_you420", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635334530, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/qgumle/im_hurting_people_around_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429127.2439775, "replies_charged": false}
