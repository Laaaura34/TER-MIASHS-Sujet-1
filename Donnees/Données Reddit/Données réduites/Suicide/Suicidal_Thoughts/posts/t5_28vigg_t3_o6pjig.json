I have a job that I'm throwing down the toilet because I'm too anxious to log in and letting down my team and it feels like I'm always a burden on my S/O. I'm such a spoiled brat, and I can't stop just being a drain on everyone. The people I love would be better off if I was dead -- sure, they'd be sad for awhile, but they deserve not to be taken advantage of. The only thing stopping me is my cat -- he's so good, but I don't know if cats would understand. Would he think I abanded him? He dserves so much better.
