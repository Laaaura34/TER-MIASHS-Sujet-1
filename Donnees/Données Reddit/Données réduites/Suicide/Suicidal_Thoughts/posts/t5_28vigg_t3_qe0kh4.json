Always battled with being bipolar & depressed for years but lately I just can\u2019t stop it from getting worse. I just am so close to giving up & I genuinely don\u2019t see anyway for my life and especially the lives of people around, to get any better until I\u2019m out of the equation. Only things that make me feel alive anymore are things that hurt me or hurt the others around me and I think it\u2019s getting to the time where I just need to make the decision to make everyone else happier and stop wasting my time trying to act like things will ever get better. This is mostly me just venting and me not sure where else to put it or who to say it to. Thank you to whoever reads this & was there to listen to me for just a little bit. I think it\u2019s time to be done but if not I\u2019ll come back to this one day and hopefully tell all of you that things did get better.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/qe0kh4/just_not_sure_what_to_do_anymore/", "title": "Just not sure what to do anymore", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Justsomethrowaway999", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634976040, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/qe0kh4/just_not_sure_what_to_do_anymore/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635428837.939345, "replies_charged": false}
