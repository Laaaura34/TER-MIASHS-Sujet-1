It\u2019s just not one specific thing it\u2019s everything. I\u2019ve been self harming again lately & no matter how hard I try to push these thought down they just don\u2019t go anywhere. I think about driving off the highway. Crashing my car. Drowning myself. Overdosing. Everything. I just want it all to end. I\u2019m so tired. I\u2019m tired of everything. I feel like I\u2019m drowning and no one can see me gasping for air. I don\u2019t know who to talk to about this bc i don\u2019t want to be a burden to my friends and my family doesn\u2019t believe in mental health. I\u2019m tired of people telling me to pray more. I\u2019m tired of it all & I wish I didn\u2019t wake up. I already feel so dead being alive that being dead I might actually be at peace.
