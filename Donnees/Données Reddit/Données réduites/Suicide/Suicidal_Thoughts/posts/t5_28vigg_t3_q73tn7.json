It always feels like I can\u2019t control when they come on or fade away, as if someone else besides me is flipping a switch I have no control of. As of lately my self harm thoughts have been the same.. I\u2019ve only harmed myself on three separate occasions last year for the first time, but last week, about 3-4 days ago the thoughts were so loud that I acted on them and cut my thigh up.. I always feel like I\u2019m running out of time and options. Don\u2019t really know why I\u2019m posting this, but maybe I think I just want to feel seen or heard. I feel alone, and definitely don\u2019t feel ready to go see a professional about it, everytime I feel like I am anxiety rushes in and I kinda get scared.. any advice?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q73tn7/suicidal_thoughts_self_harm/", "title": "Suicidal thoughts & self harm", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "CrazyGlizzy", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634100559, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q73tn7/suicidal_thoughts_self_harm/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428711.06008, "replies_charged": false}
