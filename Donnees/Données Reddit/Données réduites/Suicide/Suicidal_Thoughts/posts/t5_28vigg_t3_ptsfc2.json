I was constantly suicidal between the ages of 5 and 21 and did my first attempt at 9, my last at 21. Now I'm 24 and while struggling with suicidal thoughts during my depressions, I usually don't. Now seasonal depression is kicking in. And the anxiety is unbearable. I can't laugh for real anymore. Everything hurts. I know this will pass but being bipolar I know it'll always come back sooner or later. And I'm so sick of it. So FUCKING sick of it. I don't know where to turn. I don't want to burden my friends but I also can't stand going through this on my own...\n\nI'm trying to fight it. I don't want this to be me anymore. I hate myself for not being free from it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ptsfc2/i_want_to_die_but_i_dont_want_to_want_to_die/", "title": "I want to die but I don't want to want to die", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "observendespise", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632393460, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ptsfc2/i_want_to_die_but_i_dont_want_to_want_to_die/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428849.3564155, "replies_charged": false}
