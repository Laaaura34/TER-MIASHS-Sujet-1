Dad doesn't know what I'm doing yet, and I'm able to lie myself through, but he's catching on. I sound like a little whiny bitch but I don't know how much more I can take of this world. I'm so young but I feel so worthless. I'm ready to end it all and get it over with. A part of me wants to stop being a burden to dad, but another part knows I'll just cause him more pain, especially after mom died. It hurts, I'm so, so tired. I just can't keep up and I know when I'm older I'll just become a useless sex doll with feelings..I don't know how much more I can take", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/k5txwl/god_im_so_so_tired_nsfw/", "title": "God I'm so, so tired (NSFW?)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "StarGirly7002", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 23, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1606986729, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/k5txwl/god_im_so_so_tired_nsfw/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635429137.2132456, "replies_charged": false}
