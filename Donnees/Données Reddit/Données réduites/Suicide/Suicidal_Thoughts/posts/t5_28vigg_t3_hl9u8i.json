I hit a low key mood and everything bad that's ever happened to me starts hitting me. It started with just me crying myself to sleep then later iI would puke sometimes, get a little dizzy too. Now I sometimes hit a point where I wanna kill myself. I have such loving people in my life, they are the only reason why I don't take the final step. Lately it's affecting my relationship with them too. It just keeps getting worse.
