I'm tired of letting people foolish enough to care about me down. I'm tired of feeling alone in crowds. I don't\u00a0 feel scared or sad anymore I just feel numb. I want my life to stop for a minute so I can catch my breath. I'm a mess and there's no way out.\u00a0 I can't cope with this anymore. I have constant thoughts about dying and the only thing stopping me is the overwhelming white noise of responsibilities in my end. Everyone would be so much better off without me.
