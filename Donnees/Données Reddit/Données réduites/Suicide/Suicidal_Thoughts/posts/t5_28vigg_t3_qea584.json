You\u2019re awesome for caring, but the only thing that heals me is quality time IRL or real loving touch IRL. Literally suicidal and no one thinks I need a hug, a part on the back or head, or any of the warm touches I see others around me get. I\u2019m so touch deprived I\u2019m dying, and massages (that I pay for) only go partway deep. The touch I need can\u2019t be begged for, bought or stolen. Just in a really bad spot.
