I tell myself I will and I truly want it to happen but I always chicken out when I think about leaving (some) people. Whenever anything doesnt go my way I'll joke about it, and it's a cry for help from someone, anyone. But all of my friends are so used to it they just laugh along. I need help, I really do. I have a therapist currently, but she only helps me deal with my parents splitting and court (custody reasons, I'm a minor whose parents are fighting for custody) and I dont feel comfortable telling her. I cant tell her anything because I'm positive my mother will find out somehow and thats the worst case scenario. I want help, so so bad. I want to be able to appreciate the good in life without seeing one second of bad and considering taking my own life.
