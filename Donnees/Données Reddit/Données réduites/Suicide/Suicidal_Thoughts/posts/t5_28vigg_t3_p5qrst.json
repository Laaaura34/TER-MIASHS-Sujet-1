I\u2019m scared my best friend is getting tired of me. My boyfriend recently went to basic training for the army and I\u2019ve been feeling more and more down everyday because I have no one who gets me to listen to me anymore. Every night I sleep alone, the nightmares become more intense every night playing on my fears and anxieties. I truly want my life to be over, I\u2019m tired of the pain I feel. I\u2019m all alone and I\u2019m tired of it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p5qrst/the_endless_void/", "title": "The endless void.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "catfishkid011", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629153016, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p5qrst/the_endless_void/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429217.3940706, "replies_charged": false}
