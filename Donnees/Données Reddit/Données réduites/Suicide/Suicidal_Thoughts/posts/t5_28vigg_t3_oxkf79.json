I have a history of childhood trauma and have been diagnosed with PTSD. I have also been in a depressive episode. I am twenty-one and have had passive suicidal thoughts almost daily since I was a teenager - things like \"I wish I were dead.\" \"I should kill myself\" that I thought whenever I was upset with myself + just became part of my internal voice. In the past few days, I've been contemplating suicide more concretely, and have been researching things about it. I even counted out how much extra-strength Tylenol I had. I don't plan on acting on my thoughts, but it is also unnerving to know that a part of me is considering it. Do you have any advice on how to broach this with my therapist?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/oxkf79/suicidal_ideation/", "title": "Suicidal Ideation", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Soph475", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628049359, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/oxkf79/suicidal_ideation/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428725.9711108, "replies_charged": false}
