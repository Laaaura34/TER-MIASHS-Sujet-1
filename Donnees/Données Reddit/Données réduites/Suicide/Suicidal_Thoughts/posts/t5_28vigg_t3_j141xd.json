I\u2019ve been open about most things but he doesn\u2019t know about my suicidal thoughts or how bad it\u2019s gotten. How do I go about talking about it with him without him pink slipping me? I told the original evaluation woman that I had suicidal thoughts but had no plan and so she said she wasn\u2019t putting it down because she didn\u2019t want them committing me. The past two weeks have been really bad and I\u2019ve almost gone through with it multiple times but I don\u2019t want in patient treatment because of other responsibilities I have. My Bf has almost called for help a few times fearing for my life. I want to tell my therapist but don\u2019t want committed but I know if I tell him truly how bad it is, he won\u2019t let me leave \ud83d\ude23", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/j141xd/therapy_discussion_suicidal_thoughts_pink_slipping/", "title": "Therapy discussion, suicidal thoughts, pink slipping", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ArtofDying99", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1601260842, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/j141xd/therapy_discussion_suicidal_thoughts_pink_slipping/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429422.5005991, "replies_charged": false}
