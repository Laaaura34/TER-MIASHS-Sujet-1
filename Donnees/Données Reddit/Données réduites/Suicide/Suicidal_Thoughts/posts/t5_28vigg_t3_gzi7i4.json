And I still love her and want her to be happy. The person I could trust the most (my youth pastor, he was the dad I wish I had instead) left me, left me so alone in December so I couldn't talk to him about this. I only told one person I had cut and it wasn't even him, he doesn't even know. I've failed everyone I've ever known and met. I've failed as a boyfriend, a son, a musician, a member of the church, a mentor to my friends who need to see the good in the world, nobody knows that I've given up this much. I've held on all I could, but I know I'm committing suicide soon. As soon as school starts back up. I just need my story to be told. I want everyone to know that I tried my best, that I gave it my all. But I just didn't have the strength anymore. And that I was sorry. \n\nThat's all everyone. You just don't give up like I have.
