My parents neglected me as a kid. Alcoholic mom, left our family, dad always at work, not emotionally available. I always took care of myself and my brother. As I got older, I became the one who everyone goes to for help and advice. I started studying psychology to be a therapist because all I've ever known is just helping others. I'm currently a mental health case manager and soon getting my MSW for therapy. All I've ever wanted is to be taken care of. I take care of my cats, myself, my house, bills, my friends, my girlfriend, my clients. I just want to breathe and have someone do things for me for once. I'm sure this sounds spoiled, I know this is adulthood, and life. I'm just so tired of it all. I want to be a fucking baby again or something. My mental health is shit on top of everything. Honestly just suicidal at this point. I just want it all to be over.
