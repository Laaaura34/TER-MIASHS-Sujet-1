I have no dreams anymore and I am such a failure I never got mental help as a teen and failed all of middle and high school and my mother thought it was just a \"rebellious teen phase\" with that being said I haven't accomplished a single thing other than gaining weight, lowering my self esteem terribly low and alienating myself from everyone and everything... I feel like such a miserable fuck up what is the God damn point? I just don't see it getting better I don't see having pills or a psychologist helping me as I'm always upset or hurt with something in my life... I've been in a bad depressive spot for the past year and I've failed to clean most of the year and now my personal family ridicule me (I get they want me to try or to even pretend) but sometimes I'm just so tired and can't sleep until exhaustion takes over.... I feel like everyone is sick of me and are just waiting on me to die or to finally end it all or to overdose or something... with everything g being said whenever someone im related to or love and appreciate calls me useless I truly do feel useless already then when I hear someone else confirm my own thoughts it just drags me to a dark place where my heart hurts and when every goosebumps and swallow of the lump in my throat feels like being ripped open with daggers... I just wish I was normal and wanted like every one else seems to be... help me someone please", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/orj21m/idek_what_to_do_anymore/", "title": "Idek what to do anymore", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Geezus-Franko_4", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627244230, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/orj21m/idek_what_to_do_anymore/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429339.7510772, "replies_charged": false}
