I have friends, family, kids, my dog. But since I was in elementary school I thought of ending my life, I\u2019ve tried different attempts throughout the years and I feel like I\u2019m always brought back. I know I need to live for my kids, but at this point I don\u2019t think they truly need me. I can\u2019t stop thinking of ways to kill myself, I can\u2019t stop thinking of how things will be better when I\u2019m gone. I\u2019m a bad mom, I\u2019m not a good friend anymore, I hate me, I have accomplished nothing, I am a waste of space ultimately. I\u2019m so tired of living and physically feeling the way I do. And it\u2019s been years of this\n\nI don\u2019t want to tell anyone that knows me because I don\u2019t want to scare them. But I really feel like I won\u2019t be here much longer, I\u2019ve been trying to prepare everything for my kids and family, I don\u2019t want to make anyone\u2019s life harder by me not being here so I have looked into arrangements. \n\nI do want to do it in a less painful way then what I have done before if anyone knows, a gun is the only thing I can think of", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q29axf/getting_worse/", "title": "Getting worse", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "alexandranichole0", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633480016, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q29axf/getting_worse/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635428965.0765202, "replies_charged": false}
