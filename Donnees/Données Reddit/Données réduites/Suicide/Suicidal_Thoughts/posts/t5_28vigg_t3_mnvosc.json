So for 7 months she talked to no one and she finally smuggled a phone and added me on snapchat randomly, we hung out the next night, I planned on going through the window but it was second story, so she jumped and I caught her we stole my grandpas ladder to get her back in, 3 days later we dated and we did the whole window ladder thing everyniht for a month, I half lived there secretly and I'd hide in the closet for hours. She eventually could see 1 friend but she lied and came with me a few days a week on top of sneaking out at night, but she got caught at my house and got in a ton if trouble her family was calling me a pedophile and all want to fight me for no reason, all I want is to make her happy in any way, so she went to her sisters and they treated her like shit too, shes been mentally and verbally abused her whole life and it never stopped when she moved, so I could see her every other day and they would talk down on me and her to our faces so she left and ran away, with me of course and we made it 3 weeks, the best 3 weeks of my life we were happy and lived like adults and a real mature couple, we had money and food at all times, but we came back and her sister just barged into my house and grabbed her by the throat and dragged her out her heels were dragging, I talked to the cops cuz I called them and they said theres no way her dad would get custody and he did, so I haven't talked to or seen her in a month, I still believe were together and I bet she does too, but what if she doesnt go through with  us talking about waiting till shes 18 if we have too, I get were young and that's a long time but I'm waiting no matter what and I hope she does too, all I want is her I dont want anything else, nothing else makes me happy, I barely eat or sleep without her, I cry everyday and night thinking about her and how happy we were, I'm buying her thousands in birthday presents whether I can give them too her or not, i need advice shes been suicidal before and I'm very worried about her please someone help theres no resources for her in her position", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mnvosc/i_have_a_history_of_addiction_depression_and/", "title": "I have a history of addiction depression and suicide but it's been way worse lately due to the following", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "5-17_7-2", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 0, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618019747, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mnvosc/i_have_a_history_of_addiction_depression_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428829.0129247, "replies_charged": false}
