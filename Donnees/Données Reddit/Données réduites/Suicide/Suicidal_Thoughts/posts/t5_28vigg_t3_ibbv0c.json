I am scared of these ideas. I isolate myself. I can trust anyone even myself. In september,  I will study in university for the second year (my first one was a complet disaster). I will not repeat the same mistake. I decided to push my friends away because I am tired of being scared of what they would think of me. I look at the world and I see people having much worst than I. I feel invalid.\nLife is good in my opinion but I don't think I deserve to have one.\n\nI told myself this : \n\nThe next year of study is the most important, I will have to prove to myself that I can be better. If I win this year, I will have more hope about me et my futur. \nIf I fail this year, I will live long enough to see myself as an eternal failure in the eyes of everyone around me, there is a risk i can kill someone with this self hatred. Something I can't accept .\n\nThat is why I will  end my life in this case of scenario.\nI am meant to be a lonely person, paranoid and aggressive. But it doesn't mean my fate is failure.\nWish me luck !\nHope the Best for you guys :)\n\n[Sorry for bad english]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ibbv0c/a_big_bet/", "title": "A big bet", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "V-M-Hector", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1597661280, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ibbv0c/a_big_bet/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429372.22381, "replies_charged": false}
