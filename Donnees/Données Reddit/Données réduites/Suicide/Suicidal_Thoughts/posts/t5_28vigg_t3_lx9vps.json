I know I'm not crazy and it's something that may be able to be controlled but these years and every single day I'm more motivated to live. Some days I just wanna die because it's so hard but those few days or hours I don't wanna die is the best times because I see the truth in this stupid life. life, this world is hard with everything that happens but we are here for a reason and YOU picked to live this life so please don't give up. The world is dark ass place but it can be worth it. Some things are just so beautiful and some people are so beautiful and if your ready to leave and go you haven't found what truly makes you want to keep fighting or you did and your just tired. Depression may never fully go away but we can be survirors and help other and find the reason or reasons why it's worth it to keep fighting. I may want to die every single day but spirituality I am not ready to die and want to leave something good in this world, even if it's just a little bit of life but I wanna see something good come out of my existence or I won't be happy. That's my motivation so far, please if you can find a motivation too because life is so much more then suffering.
