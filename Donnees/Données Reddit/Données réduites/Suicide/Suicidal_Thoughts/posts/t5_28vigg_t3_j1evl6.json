It\u2019s honestly a shame. I have tried almost every way to hurt myself, I have tried almost every way to help myself. I\u2019m over it. I\u2019m not sure what else to do. Maybe turn to heavy drugs? Run away? I\u2019m so sick of living like this. I\u2019m 19 and I\u2019m supposed to be living life to the fullest in \u201cthe best years of my life.\u201d But in reality I\u2019m just a loser girl who can\u2019t keep friendships, has no family, no motivation to do well in school, and no hope. At this point I\u2019m just going to do everything I\u2019ve ever been afraid to do, then end my life in a way I know will work. It never got better for me, I\u2019m afraid it never will.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/j1evl6/chronically_suicidal/", "title": "Chronically suicidal", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Srirachasydney", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1601309287, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/j1evl6/chronically_suicidal/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429019.354208, "replies_charged": false}
