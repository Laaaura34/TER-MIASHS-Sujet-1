I've made it though alright for the most part, I've never made a real attempt to kill myself and i dont cut, I just want to die all the time. Because I've been dealing with this so long it became my new \"normal\" and I dont really ask for help when I should. I have a therapist but I'm not very good at being honest with him about when my suicidal thoughts get really bad because he doesn't understand that there are different levels of severity for suicidal thoughts for me and I dont carry many of the hallmarks of a regular suicidal person as mentioned. Helplines dont work for me either in this particular situation since its caused by the whole situation with the virus and some other things that i cant change. I have been to the hospital once when I couldnt stop crying or do much of anything but that was a medication malfunction and I dont feel that way. \n\nI cant tell if my suicidal thoughts are bad enough to warrant medical intervention because if I were going to kill myself i would do it in a way that no one could stop me so its hard to know when i \"really\" need help since im either dead or not dead. \n\nMy question is: at what point in my suicidal thoughts should I seek help? Because once I start wanting to die I'm not going to ask for help anymore but i dont want to drag on the already overextended medical system. thank you for your time.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/fx0v8n/should_i_get_more_help/", "title": "Should I get more help?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Lulu28816", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1586325526, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/fx0v8n/should_i_get_more_help/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429640.210026, "replies_charged": false}
