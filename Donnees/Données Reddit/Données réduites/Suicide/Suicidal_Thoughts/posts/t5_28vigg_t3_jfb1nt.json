Some times it's in the back of my mind and I'm fine. Other times I've had panic attacks multiple times a day, self harming,too depressed to move, binge eating disorders, trying to overdose but stopping before taking enough, trying to hang myself but saving myself before I die, trying to drown myself but panicking and taking my head out of the water. I'll stay awake at night crying and unable to sleep, or sleep for 2 or 3 days straight, only taking time to use the bathroom, drink and eat and I know it sounds bad compiled like this but I feel like I'm just being dramatic. Everytime I talk myself into teaching out to the GP to see about therapy or meds, the voice in my head is telling me I'm fine and just being dramatic and I'll go to the doctors and they'll look at me confused like I'm fine \n\nLike how bad does sadness have to be to be depression\nHow far does a suicide attempt have to go to be classed as a suicide attempt \nHow bad does anxiety have to be to be a panic attack\n\nNow I've written it, it seems so obvious that I need help but my brain is telling me otherwise and I can't convince myself properly one way or the other", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jfb1nt/how_bad_does_it_have_to_be_to_be_valid/", "title": "How bad does it have to be to be valid?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lesalou", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1603279788, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jfb1nt/how_bad_does_it_have_to_be_to_be_valid/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429617.8975167, "replies_charged": false}
