I\u2019m self-sabotaging my relationship by going through his phone twice now. This ruined his trust in me. I work so much, i don\u2019t sleep. I started hearing things that aren\u2019t there. \n\nHe is so upset i went through is phone. It\u2019s the second time and we\u2019ve been together for a year. He lost his trust in me. I didn\u2019t find anything but still was upset. \n\nAfter all of this, it\u2019s so hard for me to want to go on. What is the point? Talking to a therapist isn\u2019t going to change how i feel, I\u2019ve tried. I have a good job, and still can\u2019t afford an apartment. My mom had cancer and i have to take care of her. She\u2019s toxic in and of herself. I have no options.
