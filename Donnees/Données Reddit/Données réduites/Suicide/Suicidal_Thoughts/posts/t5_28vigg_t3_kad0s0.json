Was it because I was born between two major holidays?, was it because I didn\u2019t like the thought of having a day where I\u2019m celebrated?, or was it because I didn\u2019t like being in the spot light?. I\u2019ve come to the conclusion, that was quite obvious actually, I\u2019m not happy. No matter how I try to feign being happy for my friends and family, I can\u2019t. This isn\u2019t even about my birthday, it\u2019s about my friends and family being happy while I\u2019m not. Not that I want them to be like me, all sad and shite, but I want to be happy. But the steps to that seem too far and too steep for me to traverse. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore and it seems easier for me and others if I just, leave. If I can\u2019t appreciate what I have and what I\u2019ve gone through to get to this point then why am I here. I keep telling myself next year will get better but it\u2019s been seven years already and nothing seems to be going right. I only get this way around the holidays. It\u2019s the only time when I truly don\u2019t feel happy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/kad0s0/seasonal_depression/", "title": "Seasonal depression", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Responsible-Key3137", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1607595891, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/kad0s0/seasonal_depression/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428845.0565832, "replies_charged": false}
