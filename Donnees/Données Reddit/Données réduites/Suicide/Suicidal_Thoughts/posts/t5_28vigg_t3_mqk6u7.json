I no longer am able to accurately understand how I am feeling and I have lost all motivation to do anything. I have attempted before but didn\u2019t follow through. I am considering jumping off a bridge.\n\nI am 25 years old, recently graduated from a private university with a shitty degree. Had a variate college experience as the first year was about doing a lot of drugs and the last few were about making up for those mistakes.\n\nHaven\u2019t used in years and really there isn\u2019t much temptation. But the suicidal ideation is daunting. I feel like I\u2019ve lost the ability to communicate with people in addition to losing trust in myself. I\u2019ve hardly gotten out of bed over the last year and a half and am currently house sitting for a friend who\u2019s staying in a different state for a few months. I am trying to get my shit together but I am sometimes overwhelmed by my mind and the thoughts. I can\u2019t seem to handle thoughts. Maybe this will be the end.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mqk6u7/reaching_out/", "title": "Reaching out", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "marcmarcalexander", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618379007, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mqk6u7/reaching_out/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429404.9030423, "replies_charged": false}
