I have really bad anxiety to the point where i can even speak to new people so reaching out is a nightmare so for the sake of my friends and family i have acted happy for at least 3 years, but i can feel my facade slipping away and im terrified of the ensuing conversation that i will be forced into if my family finds out i am depressed.\n\n\nMy family is split into two sides and they refuse to tell me why so i cant help but feel like it's my fault. I have been seriously considering hanging myself. Does anyone who has been through a similar situation know if i am being irrational or dramatic? My whole life I've always tried to make others feel happy so i hate to think what will happen if i kill myself, but at this point i dont care i just want to disappear from the world. So anyways some wisdom would be welcome but you dont have to if you dont want to.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/j5eaqy/in_need_if_advice/", "title": "In need if advice", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "oofwithmaxreverb", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1601877969, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/j5eaqy/in_need_if_advice/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429227.6311502, "replies_charged": false}
