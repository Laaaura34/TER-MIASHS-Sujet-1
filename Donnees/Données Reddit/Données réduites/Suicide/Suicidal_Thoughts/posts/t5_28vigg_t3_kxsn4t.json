In all actuality there is no such thing as a painless death because there\u2019s only the certainty of pain. Because there\u2019s no way to actually tell if a method is painless because the subject dies and then there\u2019s nothing to tell from the body besides it\u2019s mutilation. And that\u2019s the only reason why I\u2019m not going through with it. \nBecause the way I leave my body is gonna show how much pain I was in in my final moments and the fact that I\u2019ll be hurting my mom in the process. She\u2019s really the only one who\u2019s keeping me here, like if I lost everyone besides her I believe I\u2019d still be here. Does that make me a bad friend? I do care about my friends and their wellbeing but I don\u2019t think I truly care for them. Damn, not sure why I\u2019m like this. Things were going well. It\u2019s also interesting to see who comments on peoples posts on here. Some serious posts talking about taking their lives almost never get a comment, while something like this post, maybe, would get a comment of encouragement. Like people pick and choose who they feel can be saved. And that\u2019s some melancholy horse sh*t, everyone can be saved, it just takes time effort and patience. The world is, beautiful, there\u2019s no denying that, it just gets to be too much most of the time, overwhelming. Like, I have anger management issues, partial OCD, depression, anxiety, and a superiority complex. I have no drive to live, or dreams to pursue. I\u2019m not really sure why I\u2019m here. Also, if you have an empath problem here\u2019s a trick I used to help myself: the Egg Theory. Basically all of us share the same soul and we live out every life on earth. Everyone on earth is ourselves. And thinking about that and analyzing people really helps me be empathic and might help you too. Doesn\u2019t excuse peoples heinous actions or anything but it\u2019s just really interesting. Aaaaand this is how I get through my depressing thoughts. I talk until I calm down.
