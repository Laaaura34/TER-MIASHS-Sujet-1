I'm sane, I'm healthy, and I have a perfectly good family.\n\nI just recently have started to think about what happens if I die. It didn't come out of nowhere. Recently, my assistant principal from high school, died due to a brain tumor in his head. It was horrific and cancer is truly no joke. While we hadn't talked in a while, seeing everyone sort of pay tribute and discuss the effect to which he had on their life was truly heartbreaking and the outpouring of support was humbling.\n\nThat being said, I kind of realize that my life is not the same. I have no friends, I am unemployed, and I have yet to move out of my folks home. I have long hair, because I'm afraid of growing bald, and I have yet to experience any of the joys of life.\n\nI kind of wish I wasn't alive, but I'm not stupid enough to kill myself. So I've been thinking, what if I just magically dropped dead? I'm not actively trying to kill myself, nor am I trying to. I just feel weird, in a state of limbo I can't express.\n\nI wish I wasn't alive, but I'm not stupid enough to kill myself.\n\nI wish I was more towards the end of my life, as opposed to the beginning.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/n3eeby/does_anyone_else_wish_they_were_dead_but_is/", "title": "Does anyone else wish they were dead, but is afraid of suicide?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "10pumpsclassic", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 26, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619985129, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/n3eeby/does_anyone_else_wish_they_were_dead_but_is/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428985.779841, "replies_charged": false}
