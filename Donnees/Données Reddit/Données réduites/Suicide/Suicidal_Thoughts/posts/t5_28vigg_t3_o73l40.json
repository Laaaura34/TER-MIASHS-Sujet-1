It's relieving and I've finally found my peace. I don't feel like crying anymore and I don't feel tired. I'm just excited to leave this earth. There's no point anymore in forcing things. If you're gonna convince me not to, I've made up my mind. I'm 26 and this has been a constant thought since I was 12. \n\nIf anyone can recommend a painless way to go in the Philippines, please let me know. \n\nAny tips before I leave? Finances, insurance, possessions, etc? Also, burial/cremation and funeral costs? Can I prepay and choose a plan with a funeral home that has the entire package? I want to put my family to the least hassle as much as possible.\n\nI've met many amazing people in this world though, can't deny that. And the sceneries are great. \n\nP.S.
