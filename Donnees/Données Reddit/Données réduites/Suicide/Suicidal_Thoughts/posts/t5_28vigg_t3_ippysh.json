I\u2019m a dick head and I expect people to like but why would they. Lol I\u2019m a dickhead. Everything I do, everything I feel, everything that I get is well deserved. How could I possibly feel like I should be someone\u2019s first choice even tho I\u2019m a dick. I actually just thought about this a while ago. I\u2019m everyone\u2019s last choice. Lol I have friends but it\u2019s funny cus I never talk to them and they never talk to me. I\u2019m alone. Honestly, I promise you my name never pops up in their head ever. I don\u2019t know what to do but I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m everyone last choice and it\u2019s funny cus I\u2019ve always been but I\u2019m just now realizing that.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ippysh/im_getting_tired_of_this/", "title": "Im getting tired of this", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Cursedfate_", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1599688058, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ippysh/im_getting_tired_of_this/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429156.667554, "replies_charged": false}
