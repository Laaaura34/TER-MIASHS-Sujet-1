I am so sorry for myself for being so worthless, talentless, and a burden. I've been feeling this way for quite some time now but just recently did the thoughts of offing myself resurface. These thoughts I've already had two years ago and I was so close to actually doing it but then the guilt settled in. I felt guilty of what will happen to my parents after I die. I felt guilty of leaving my friends behind. And  I felt guilty of the fact that I'm somehow looking forward to it. \n\nAnd now their back. Back then, I was able to voice out my thoughts to my friend but now... I've cut almost all my friends off and have been silently living on my own little bubble. And I feel so bad. I feel like I should do something but it somehow seems like it's too late.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pk9nw9/i_pity_myself/", "title": "I pity myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "spineless_loser", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631104691, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pk9nw9/i_pity_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428896.0597534, "replies_charged": false}
