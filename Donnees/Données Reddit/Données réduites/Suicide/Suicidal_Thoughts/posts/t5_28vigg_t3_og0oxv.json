I am not happy and I\u2019ve been depressed & suicidal since I was 13 years old. That\u2019s a long time to be so sad. I\u2019m so tired of being sad. I\u2019ve attempted suicide 2 times where I failed and I think I failed on purpose because my mom found me and knew I wasn\u2019t coherent and made me fess up and took me to the hospital. \nIt hurt her so terribly which really holds me back from doing it. I\u2019ve done numerous treatment programs and nothing helps. I know implementing the things you learn is important and I would but it didn\u2019t help. \nNothing is even particularly wrong with my life. I just hate myself and i am so fucking depressed. I\u2019ve been on different medications too which have given me awful health problems  along with them and they didn\u2019t even work either.  I have bipolar 2 disorder I don\u2019t get manic to often but I get extreme depressive episodes on top of being already depressed but it hits me like train. I wake up and I\u2019m just like why am I still breathing, I\u2019m exhausted I want to die. & I literally can\u2019t think about anything else other then dying for days straight and it\u2019s so sad. \nI try journaling and taking walks.. \nI just am hopeless & I am tired. I don\u2019t want to live anymore. I don\u2019t want a future anymore. But my mom said if I ever died she would die to. And she\u2019s not lying, I am her whole world. She would not want to live without me wether i died from an accident or suicide. I also am so sad to ever leave my doggy behind he is like my actual baby. But I just am so tired so exhausted. I am 24 years old anddd I really want to die. I am so done. I don\u2019t want a future I don\u2019t want to breathe another day. \nI am so so sad. I feel like my brain is broken.\nI am defeated.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/og0oxv/i_want_to_kill_myself/", "title": "I want to kill myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Livbug_", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625721779, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/og0oxv/i_want_to_kill_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428948.903343, "replies_charged": false}
