Everyone around me is doing better , most of my friends are talking sh\\*t about me behind me and they think I'm not concerned about it . All I have right now is my fam and one friend. As I previously said everyone is doing better than me IN EVERYTHING. I have no one to talk and whoever I previously tried to speak to is now turnt against me for some reason or thought I was kidding .I'm  15 yo and lowkey done w/ my life . I\u2019 d have committed suicide but I don\u2019t want my parents to feel that they didnt knew about my mental health or that they are the ones in charge because they were unable to help. Lately the only things that help me are music and sleep because I can\u2019t feel nothing or I listen to it . I\u2019m out of ideas and have a little amount of people that I don\u2019t want to speak with them about it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/f1e0pi/i_got_suicidal_thoughts_for_the_last_2_weeks/", "title": "i got suicidal thoughts for the last 2 weeks", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lifeisrigged_", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1581278086, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/f1e0pi/i_got_suicidal_thoughts_for_the_last_2_weeks/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429424.7580001, "replies_charged": false}
