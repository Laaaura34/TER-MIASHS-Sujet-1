I have family but again they don\u2019t really care, apart from my Nan who adores me and I do feel guilty thinking about her suffering without me.\nI\u2019ve lost the love of my life because I\u2019m a horrible person who ruins everything.\nI\u2019ve been depressed since I was about 13 years old. It\u2019s not getting better, it won\u2019t get better so please don\u2019t try and tell me that. \nI just need a way out, something quick and painless and easy. \nAny help or tips on how to do it would really help. I thought about sleeping pills but I\u2019m struggling to get hold of any.
