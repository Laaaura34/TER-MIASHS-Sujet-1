I can\u2019t find it in me to live anymore I have a son and I can\u2019t pretend to be present anymore when all my thoughts are on my own demise.\nI have NO friends absolutely no one hits me up or talks to me I reach out to people and the conversations go flat and they never reach out it\u2019s always me. No girls like me or want me I\u2019m ignored. The only people who talk to me are my parents and I\u2019m 31 I don\u2019t want them to be the only people who text me or call me it\u2019s so sad going over there and hanging out with them cause they are the only people who want to do anything with me. I can\u2019t spend another day living my life with this isolation and being deprived of any connection what so ever I haven\u2019t felt another persons touch in so long. This is turning me into a monster I hate seeing other people happy or seeing people in relationships especially when they\u2019re ugly I would take a ugly or fat girl (not to sound shallow, I literally think everyone is attractive in a way) at this point just someone who gave a shit about me. I spend all my time alone in my room if I\u2019m not with my son. And when I\u2019m with him he\u2019s so demanding of me and my attention I just feel like I\u2019m his personal toy I feel like I have no identity and I just want to die. I tried believing in god and watching a lot of inspirational videos and I just get nothing it\u2019s like my life is just one big rain cloud I want to get struck by lightning but that would take some kind of divine intervention and I already know that god has no interest in showing me mercy even if it did exist. My life is pathetic I am sad I am angry my eyes feel like they are boiling and my heart feels like it\u2019s on fire.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/fn9fmz/feel_my_pain/", "title": "Feel my pain", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "atmwannadie", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1584919116, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/fn9fmz/feel_my_pain/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429324.405864, "replies_charged": false}
