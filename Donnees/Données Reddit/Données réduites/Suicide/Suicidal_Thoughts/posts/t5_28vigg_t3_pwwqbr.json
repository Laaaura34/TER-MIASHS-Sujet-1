I don't know if that's actually true for him, I kinda doubt it, but still.\n\nWhat if it is true? and what would stop it from being true for me? What if it's all just rebounce until I actually manage to kill myself?\n\nor even worse if I don't manage to do that, if just keep on half living, with one foot in the grave and the other outside, trying to make connections but unable to express what goes on inside of me\n\nI just hate this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pwwqbr/a_question/", "title": "A question", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Ishpettore", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632796707, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pwwqbr/a_question/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428967.5412347, "replies_charged": false}
