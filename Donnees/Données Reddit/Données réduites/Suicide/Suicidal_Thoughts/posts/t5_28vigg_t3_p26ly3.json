I went to go see a few friends and have some fun it was great. I was supposed to go to the store and get some NyQuil and ibuprofen but someone had my keys with them.  They were gone for a while. \nI was supposed to die a few days ago but I didn't. It was supposed to be my last day on Earth I know it feels like I missed opportunity.  only one person knew what I was going to do. \nI wonder will I survive the year. I feel so bad and so sad everyday because that's just what anxiety is... \nEverything is so bad all the time\nThat's my secret.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p26ly3/my_birthday_was_supposed_to_be_my_last_day/", "title": "My birthday was supposed to be my last day", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "RosesPinkhair", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 15, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628659329, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p26ly3/my_birthday_was_supposed_to_be_my_last_day/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429216.787989, "replies_charged": false}
