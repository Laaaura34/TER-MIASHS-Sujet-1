I've been crying since 3 hours and just came back to my room after an hour long lecture from dad about how I should take jokes and how my parents are the only ones who actually care for me\nI don't want to live here.. I just want to die\n\nThey were telling me how I should be mature and start waking up early.. dad threatened to stop me from going to the gym because today I came back at 9:20.. I'm a fucking failure\nI can't even use proper punctuation and I hate myself\n\nI just wish I die so that all this can end...\nI just... I can't figure out if I actually have issues or if my parents are right and if all the fault is actually in me\n\nI don't know what I've done wrong... I honestly... really don't know how to get validation from my parents\n\nI just want them to tell me that they love me.. just once\nBut I know that's never going to happen\n\nI don't know if I will ever be able to make them proud of me.. so what's even the point of trying? \n\nI just.. I don't want to do anything.. I can't think of anything I can do\n\nI really wish I could just disappear\n\nI don't have the courage to go through with suicide, but I really wish someone would just kill me", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/k9b0yu/i_know_my_parents_dont_want_me_to_die_but_i_dont/", "title": "I know my parents don't want me to die, but I don't want to live with them", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "vampire314", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1607455593, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/k9b0yu/i_know_my_parents_dont_want_me_to_die_but_i_dont/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429367.2214158, "replies_charged": false}
