It\u2019s the thought that it\u2019s really people in the world that aren\u2019t lonely, that don\u2019t have toxic families, that have friends, that live without anxiety etc. Like i feel like I\u2019m trapped in this body in this life that I don\u2019t want anymore. I question why did this happen to me like what did I do to deserve this life where I\u2019m trapped in my room all the time with nobody to tell how I feel. I hate it here.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/osk1x1/unsatisfied/", "title": "Unsatisfied", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Independent-Dig-6129", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627380757, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/osk1x1/unsatisfied/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429219.7024162, "replies_charged": false}
