And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire\u2019s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It\u2019s not desiring the fall; it\u2019s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling \u2018Don\u2019t!\u2019 and \u2018Hang on!\u2019, can understand the jump. Not really. You\u2019d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p4kaie/please_take_the_time_to_read_this_by_david_foster/", "title": "Please take the time to read this -By David Foster.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ParticularFile7347", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628990680, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p4kaie/please_take_the_time_to_read_this_by_david_foster/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428854.3750937, "replies_charged": false}
