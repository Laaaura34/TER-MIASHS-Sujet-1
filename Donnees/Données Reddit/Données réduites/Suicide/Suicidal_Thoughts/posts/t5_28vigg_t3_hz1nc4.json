I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t make it to 13. Here I still am 4 years later. I feel as if I am doing myself a great disservice by putting myself through all this when the answer is right there. Every day that I stay I get attached to people who give me some momentary happiness. But I\u2019ve noticed these people leave your life swiftly. Nothing\u2019s permanent, but for someone like me with anxiety and apparently some moderate OCD, I\u2019d prefer things to be permanent and sure. \nHere\u2019s where my fear of doing is comes in. I want to do it in a way that will 100% make sure I die. But where I live we don\u2019t have access to things like guns which I think would be the most accurate way. I don\u2019t like the idea of bleeding out, I feel like it\u2019d be painful. I don\u2019t want my last moments to be painful. I\u2019ve access to plenty of prescription drugs which I could use but from what I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s not 100% sure fire way to die. On top of this I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s slow and painful. Don\u2019t try and say this is a sign that I don\u2019t want to do it pls. I know I do, I\u2019m just scared of pain and failure. \nRecently I\u2019ve noticed that my suicidal thought  and tendencies are becoming less impulsive and more of an all the time thing, they\u2019re starting to get more and more inescapable. \nI\u2019ve told my mother all that I feel comfortable telling her but she ignores it. All the clear signs, everything. I\u2019ve social anxiety but she forces me into socialising with people. I have to make a bunch of sacrifices to appease her but the minute I ask her to compromise for the sake of my mental health she calls me selfish and rude. I can\u2019t. My sister is verbally abusive and has s been for the past 4 years and my mother does nothing despite me telling her time upon time. \nI\u2019ve written suicide not after suicide note but she simply discards them. I used to feel she was a reason to stay, but I\u2019m rapidly beginning to realise I have only myself in this world. \nI just really feel like I\u2019m worth nothing tbh. All I had was my intelligence but I feel like that\u2019s dissipating too. There really is nothing here for me.\nSometimes I do like looking at what I could do with my future but idk it all seems so distant and unobtainable for me. Idk.\nRight now the most probable way of me doing it is going to be OD on the aforementioned prescription drugs. \nI think I\u2019m ready tbh. \nI get back some important exam results in 3 weeks and a couple days. I\u2019m feeling that if those don\u2019t go well I\u2019ll be done here. \nI have some amazing friends, don\u2019t get me wrong, but at the end of the day they\u2019re just temporary like everyone and everything else in this world. I have already them a final letter. I hope they will understand. \nAnyways thank you for stopping by.\nRemember, don\u2019t rage quit the game of life :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/hz1nc4/scared_of_doing_it_idk/", "title": "Scared of doing it idk?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "jongyeons_debit_card", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1595886419, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/hz1nc4/scared_of_doing_it_idk/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429366.454179, "replies_charged": false}
