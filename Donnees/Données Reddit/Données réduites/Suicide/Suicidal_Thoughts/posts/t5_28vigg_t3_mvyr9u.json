I just feel this constant numbness and the only way I can feel anything is if I feel physical pain or if I'm high. I just wish I didn't exist. I've been thinking about suicide for years and have attempted four times, I've been hospitalized once for a week, and the only reason I can't seem to succeed is that I don't know how drugs mix with each other. I don't want to be here and not do anything with this life that I didn't ask for. i often think that I'm no more suicidal than any other person my age, but I have been told the normal amount is none. Nothing works out, everything falls through and I just can't do this anymore.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mvyr9u/the_end_is_nigh/", "title": "The End is Nigh", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "pessemistic", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619072522, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mvyr9u/the_end_is_nigh/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429621.7782419, "replies_charged": false}
