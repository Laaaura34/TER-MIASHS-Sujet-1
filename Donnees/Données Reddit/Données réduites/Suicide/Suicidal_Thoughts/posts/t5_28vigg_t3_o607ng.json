I'm still asking myself why I choose to take pill instead of killing myself with gun or jumping from a high place. My life worse then before. I moved another town to make a new start but it didn't go well. I'm asking myself why am I living. I don't believe afterlife. I believe we are going to feel nothing after death pain. I didn't feel anything couple of months. It won't change anything in my life. I take meds after my first attempt but it won't work on me. Tonight I went outside to think why my life is shit. I couldn't find anything. My life is a pretty average. It's not bad not good. But I don't want to live anymore. I bought hydrogen sulfide from industrial site of my current city. It's 175 ppm and enough to kill myself. I'm waiting universty exam to commit suicide. I don't feel anything about myself but I think others. I don't want to affect somebody bad. After that I will be gone.   \n\n\nTake care of yourself guys.
