I\u2019m sure this is the case since I\u2019m not in my right mind and am very lame and stupid. Please help me refine this!\nMy plan in chronological order:\n\nTime- 0:00- Prepare a lethal dosage of fentanyl in a syringe then take 40mg of alprazolam (powder form)w/ 2 grams of fentanyl and anti-nausea pills orally on an empty stomach \n\nTime - 0:15- I \u201cplug\u201d another 2 grams of fentanyl\u2026.you know where. This is so even if I throw up some of the other drugs this will make up the difference\n\nTime- 0:20- I climb a ladder, wrap a noose around my neck, then sit and slam my favorite whiskey for 15 minutes\n\nTime- 0:35- Bang the lethal dosage of fentanyl in my veins and hold on for dear life so that hopefully when I pass out and subsequently fall I won\u2019t feel the noose and lack of oxygen\n\nOverkill I know, but just want to make sure I get the job done. Obviously I\u2019ll make small adjustments to times if I feel the onset of drugs are starting quicker/slower than planned.
