When the only thing I do is try that my condition does not influence to my friends and family , she goes and tells me that, she tells me that if at some point I need to vent that I should not go to her because she is not going to support me, I think karma has  returned to her and has given her an anxiety attack of the host recently and now she is the one who is with issues and I have to support her, she seem very hypocritical to me , I know that I should not care about what she told me and I would have to support her anyway, but I'm very spiteful and what she told me hurt a lot when she found out about my suicidal thoughts that I didn't even tell her, she just found out from someone else, I don't know what think about her idk", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/lnvn1i/what_do_u_think_about_this/", "title": "What do u think about this?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "sxrxiero", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613783773, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/lnvn1i/what_do_u_think_about_this/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429226.90308, "replies_charged": false}
