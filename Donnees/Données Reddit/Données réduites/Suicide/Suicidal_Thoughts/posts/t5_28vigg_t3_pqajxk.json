I like to tell people that if I could do it all again, my mistakes, failures, the trauma, the pain, that I won't change a thing. But that's a lie. I wish I could go back and fix all of it. I love my girlfriend, and she's the only thing keeping me from going through with it. I can't afford therapy or medication.
