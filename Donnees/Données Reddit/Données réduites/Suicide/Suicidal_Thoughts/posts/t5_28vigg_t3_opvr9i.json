When I see myself jumping in front of a train at the station. When whenever I see a knife I instantly think of dragging it down my arms. When all that happens in my life is trauma, frustration, panic, triggering, hate, bullying, ignorance... This life is not worth fighting for it cause as soon as I drag my ass up to work on myself I get beaten down, judged or my head shuts down. I dont fucking know what people mean by \"keep fighting\" cause my fight means get up, go to work, get laughed at and asked \"what those marks are\" by kids, get judged by adults because I am fat and I should do more sports and I am too sassy. Then get home and hearing everyone fighting, falling into bed at 5 everyday and sleeping till 7 in the morning. I CANT HANDLE MY SHIT ANY LONGER I NEED PIECE AND SILENCE and I've been at this point 4 times this year but I think this time I wont survive... This time I'll just give up. Judge me one last time but fighting means dying inside...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/opvr9i/how_the_fuck_am_i_supposed_to_keep_fighting_tw/", "title": "How the fuck am I supposed to \"keep fighting\" (TW its kinda graphic and intrusive)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "littlechili02", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627018193, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/opvr9i/how_the_fuck_am_i_supposed_to_keep_fighting_tw/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429261.0699701, "replies_charged": false}
