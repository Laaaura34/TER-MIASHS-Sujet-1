I don\u2019t want to die because my life is horrible or because no one loves me. I\u2019m just sad all the time for no reason, and the only way to silence my thoughts is to end it. My family and friends should be more sad that I\u2019m here suffering and relieved that I\u2019ll finally be free from my constant, overwhelming, sadness. Is there any way I can explain this to them? I don\u2019t want to commit suicide because I don\u2019t have any other options. Death seems like the ideal thing for me and I want to welcome it with open arms. The only reason I haven\u2019t is bc my family would be devastated and I hate making them sad.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/lprz06/suicidal_isnt_always_a_cry_for_help/", "title": "Suicidal isn\u2019t always a cry for help", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "angetheman01", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 21, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614009619, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/lprz06/suicidal_isnt_always_a_cry_for_help/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429283.3439245, "replies_charged": false}
