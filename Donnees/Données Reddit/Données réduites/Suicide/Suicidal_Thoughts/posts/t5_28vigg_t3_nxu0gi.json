The fucks the point of keeping this up. Like, sure, I have family, my sis, my two very young cousins, and I also work with my family and one family friend. But I still wanna fucking die. I try all these things to feel better but it never works. Therapy is shit. My therapist makes a call like every 2 weeks and now it\u2019s 3 weeks cuz of some change but even right after the calls I still feel like ass because it actually makes me think about my problems making it worse when it\u2019s supposed to make it better lmaoooo. And I feel bad for my mom cuz like she pays for it and it prolly lots of money even though it don\u2019t do shit. My psychiatrist on the other hand, is just religious and always recommends fucking religion even though I tell her I really don\u2019t care about religion (I try to be nice though) but she still insist. And school is just ass. I feel so fucking trapped. I don\u2019t wanna go to school, it just makes me feel worse, it makes the things I enjoy (learning, science, math, etc) so much fucking worse. And then it\u2019s so funny how I try to feel better (alcohol, failed suicide attempts, therapy, games, etc.) just makes me feel worse at the end. I don\u2019t think u should live. And of course I feel bad for my dad, my mom, my step-parents, etc. But like, with the time I\u2019ve spent on this earth, I\u2019ve learned that sometimes, you *should* be selfish, you *should* do what you wanna do. Thing is, I don\u2019t wAnt my family to do the same, I don\u2019t want my sis to do the same, she does suffer from anxiety and shit and I just don\u2019t want her to feel sad about it. The same for my 5 and 1 yr old cousins. I fucking hate this life but I love some of the people in it. I don\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s not like life can get better. But at the same time, it\u2019s never gonna be enough. What? Imma live like a drunkard everyday in order to feel good? I don\u2019t want that life. I don\u2019t want a life at all. But I feel guilty about killing myself. Plus, music n shit is cool. Idk it\u2019s just like lame. And then there\u2019s also a girl, like, she\u2019s just so ducking awesome but I can\u2019t help but think she doesn\u2019t like be no more. I mean she did say it but like. There\u2019s. O point on having hope /she don\u2019t like me. And I think she\u2019s soo fucking great. But theni m also squeamish and like I don\u2019t like stabbing and blood shit. So I don\u2019t wanna die painfully Cauich I\u2019ve tried multiple times and they obviously fUled bro. DMn, thanks apur\u00f3 corect. Ok maybe not there but jeez what the hello like I just want someone to come out of nowhere and save me, but I know that\u2019s never gonna happen. But I want it to happen.
