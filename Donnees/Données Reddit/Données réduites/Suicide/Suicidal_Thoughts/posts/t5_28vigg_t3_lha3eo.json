You have hobbies, you have friends, family, likes, but still there's a lack of success deep inside you. Yes, you have skills, no, you dont feel like getting a job out of any of them, yes, you have friends, but never tell them about all that shit, yes you got a lover, but you cannot feel the same for they, you dont know what love truly is. Yet you can pretend to be happy for some days to cope the feeling, but all eventually comes again. Insecurities, depression, anxiety. I hate my face, my nose, my eyes, my voice, my height, my sex, my body. And mentally I'm weak, a crybaby, and still, sometimes, an evil person. I hate my self so much, yet I'm writting this so relaxed cuz im used to think that of myself. I want to kill myself so badly, just to reborn in the body i want, being the person i want to be, and sure of what I want in life. I tried to comitte suicide 4 times by now, but I know my family would be sad, but I'm way worst, everyday I wanna cry bcs of all that shit, nothing amazing is ever going to happen in my life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/lha3eo/i_wanna_kill_myself_and_im_way_too_relaxed_with/", "title": "I wanna kill myself and Im way too relaxed with that", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Stuckinmyshit", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 24, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613008669, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/lha3eo/i_wanna_kill_myself_and_im_way_too_relaxed_with/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429225.802263, "replies_charged": false}
