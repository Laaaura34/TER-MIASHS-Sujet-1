But I also don't want to stick around and Continue making my life shitty. The fucked up thing is, they know I'm depressed and they're just making it worse. Ahhh! Whenever I say decide, okay that's it, I just think about them crying and stuff. It also pisses me off because they'll blame me for everything bad that happens after. And yeah, maybe it is my fault but not all of it. If they got their shit together instead of being contempt with making their kids miserable maybe we would be one happy family.
