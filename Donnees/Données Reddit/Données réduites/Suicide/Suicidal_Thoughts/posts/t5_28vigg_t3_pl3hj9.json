I'm not cut out for this world. I'm so broke I can't even afford a 80p loaf of bread and haven't eaten in days. Doesn't matter though bc I don't even want to. Going to asphyxiate myself using a bag since I don't have any rope or place to hang myself. Rough way to go but I can't even afford drugs to OD like I want to. Got no friends or family so I have to write this here as the only marker of proof that I've ever existed.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pl3hj9/last_days/", "title": "Last days", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "donttellmenotto_", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631211834, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pl3hj9/last_days/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429148.510495, "replies_charged": false}
