My great grandma passed away last week and even before she was gone I felt numb. I just feel even more empty now and it's getting hard to keep pretending.\nMy mom keeps saying thank you because I basically paid for a lot of the stuff for my Nanny's funeral but I don't think she should thank me. I won't need money when I'm dead so I don't see a point in her thanking me.\n\nDoes that make me a bad person?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mxy2ng/is_there_something_wrong_with_me/", "title": "Is there something wrong with me?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Weekly_Gas4585", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619315017, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/mxy2ng/is_there_something_wrong_with_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429005.5265548, "replies_charged": false}
