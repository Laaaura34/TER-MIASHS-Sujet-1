I have so much on my plate with school and everything, it\u2019s horrible because i feel embarrassed to talk to my psychologist about what\u2019s happening deep in my mind and how hurt i feel because i feel she won\u2019t get me like everyone else, i don\u2019t trust anyone close to me anyone who is there to help me no one. it\u2019s horrible as i know my psychologist is there for that purpose but i don\u2019t feel safe with her sage to share my thoughts, worrying she will tell my mum and then i\u2019ll be worried about that fear of embarrassment of her telling my dad my sisters my brother. I cant even talk to my best friend, i used to be able to but right now i don\u2019t know if i can trust her which breaks me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/l29qro/tired_of_feeling_this_way/", "title": "Tired of feeling this way.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Anonymoustyper6", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1611268967, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/l29qro/tired_of_feeling_this_way/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429152.2750134, "replies_charged": false}
