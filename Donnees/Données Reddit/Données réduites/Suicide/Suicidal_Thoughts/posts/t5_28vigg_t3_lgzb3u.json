Triggers are physical and sexual abuse.\n\n\nI\u2019m a 29f and have thought about nonexistence since I was 9 (writing I wish I was dead in multiple journals). I\u2019ve done therapy, antidepressants and have hobbies - I\u2019m one of those \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t know it\u201d people as I am strong, attractive and extroverted on the outside but my inner thoughts never reflect this. It\u2019s like I\u2019m faking it to the world. \n\nIt never got better, things have only taken a downward turn the older I get. I have epilepsy and was diagnosed at 15 which was so bad at one point, I had to drop out of college and I continually have bouts of not being able to do anything due to my seizures and have missed out on a lot of different experiences because of it. I try and tell people I don\u2019t let it hold me back, but it constantly does, just with side effects alone, but most people when I complain to them or back out of stuff for fear of having a seizure gets people calling me lazy, whiny or just uh-huh me to move onto the next topic. \n\nMy first serious relationship was with a physically abusive man who sent me to the hospital for a concussion. My second relationship was with a man who ended up sexually assaulting me and also groped me while having a seizure (who know how many times that happened before I found out) who I tried telling friends what happened years later and most didn\u2019t believe me so I lost a lot of \u201cfriends\u201d and my third serious relationship was a very close friend who developed a serious drinking problem while dating me. He changed completely. When we broke up and I left the city, he told me that he was doing much better without me around. He was my only real love I\u2019ve had. Moving to this new city has been absolutely terrible. The people are mean, drivers are insane, snow is awful and I\u2019ve been in a car accident (no injuries), got my car stuck in the snow twice and have been having zero luck with my art (something I did well in before moving), zero luck in meeting people (of course it\u2019s covid but it still hurts) and the only people I hang around are my roommates who are very supportive and helpful, but not enough that the benefits of suicide outweighs the negatives. For everyone. I know those negatives are very trivial things but it\u2019s just a reflection on my lack of feeling this will be a new start, just a \u201cI still don\u2019t have a place to feel comfortable and at home.\u201d\n\nSo...it never has gotten easier for me. When I look at \u201chappy\u201d times in my life, it was all superficial stuff that showed I was outwardly happy but not genuine happiness (besides with the recent ex who I loved, but even then I just wished I could die). I constantly think about ways to die - get a gun, drive my car into something, overdose, but I\u2019ll never be brave enough to do that. I also know my family would be heartbroken, but I also know they would eventually be ok because I am the \u201cfailure\u201d child. I had a lot of promise in me where a lot of pressure was put on me to succeed and get a degree because I was so great in school, and now that I did not live up to that, it\u2019s even another thing. \n\nPeople say if you\u2019re an abuse victim that it isn\u2019t your fault, it\u2019s the persons fault. But I clearly stressed my exes enough to turn to alcoholism (the first two were extremely heavy drinkers) and I don\u2019t even have close friends. \n\nI don\u2019t have hope anymore. I don\u2019t have questions. I just wish it was easier to kill myself and even therapy doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019m exhausted and tired of continually finding a new rock bottom. It hasn\u2019t gotten better in 20 years, what makes me hopeful it\u2019ll get better as I age, where my health will get worse and worse. \n\nSorry, just a rant I needed out. I\u2019m slowly losing it and mainly just want to crawl into a hole.
