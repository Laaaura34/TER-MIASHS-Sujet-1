Lost my mom to suicide in 2008, then lost my dad to a motorcycle crash in 2016. On top of that, I had three beautiful kids before I turned 26. I love them with everything in me, but damn is it hard raising three kids with absolutely no help. Their mother is the best mom they could have, and I pride myself in being an amazing father. But sometimes, that just doesn\u2019t matter to me. I\u2019m financially in a very deep rut. No matter how much I make, it\u2019s never enough and it\u2019s gone immediately. It doesn\u2019t seem like it will ever end. I understand that this is strictly self inflicted. I think about suicide multiple times a day, but not in the conventional \u201cwho would care\u201d type of way. I feel like I\u2019m obligated to not die because of my kids, bills, work, etc. I know this is no way to live, but I\u2019m at my wits end and have no idea what to do. I\u2019m severely addicted (more mentally than physically) to marijuana and feel like it is the only thing keeping me slightly sane. And when I don\u2019t have it, it\u2019s an existential crisis. I completely understand that I need to drop this habit, but it feels like if I do, I will lose the battle to myself. Those 2-3 weeks after quitting that everyone says are the worst, seems like decades to me. I don\u2019t want to die. I want to live and see my babies grow into the strong young adults I\u2019ve raised them to be. But I\u2019m so exhausted and ready to rest. My relationship has hit rock bottom. Me and my \u201cgirlfriend\u201d haven\u2019t been close for over a year now. I can see that I\u2019m starting to take a toll on our relationship. She seems to not want to be with someone who has mental trauma, or like it\u2019s becoming a \u201cyour trauma isn\u2019t my trauma\u201d type situation. This is just me making an uneducated observation. But either way, my brain is telling me she wants nothing to do with me and is going to leave as soon as she has the chance. Life just seems to take a liking to kicking me when I\u2019m down, or when I\u2019m finally trying to get back up again. I just feel cornered. It feels like I\u2019m being held up by strings. Some good, some bad. But when I decide to cut a bad string, it feels as if three good strings are cut as well. I\u2019m not sure if that makes any sense to anyone but me. Basically, I\u2019m scared to start doing the right things, because all the right things come with bad side effects. I know this post is super non-sensical, but sometimes I feel like a have absolutely no one to talk to about these things, so ranting to a bunch of strangers seems to be the one thing that makes me feel like a very small minute weight has been lifted off my chest.
