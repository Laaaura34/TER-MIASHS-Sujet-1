It is almost impossible to heal from npd\n2. Living like this makes no sense, I manipulate, I lie without control and study, laughing, crying is so difficult for me, not like for my classmates\n3. I don't love life, I see all people as fucking robots\nMaybe I'm writing this post only because of a narcissistic impulse; I don't know what the truth is.\nLiving like this is not life.\nThe only thing holding me back from suicide is that I don't know how ...\nI could take painkillers first and then throw myself out the window, or I could cut my veins but it would be too painful. I just wish I wasn't born.\nAnyway, it will still be some time before I do, so don't tell me that my life matters too, who things will get better or other bullshit like this because I'm not writing this post panicked but serious and sober.
