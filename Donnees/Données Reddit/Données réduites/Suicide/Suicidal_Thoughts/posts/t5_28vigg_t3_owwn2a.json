My mother treats me like shit. She abuses me and my 11 year old sister verbally and physically. I\u2019m ready to tolerate it cuz I have been tolerating this nonsense since I was little. But I can\u2019t let my lil sis go through the same. It\u2019s not okay that someone is used to abuse . My dad can\u2019t say anything to her cuz then she puts fake allegations and yes this has happened before. I try so hard to keep my family together. I feel so lost. Why can\u2019t it be a normal family . Why is everything so hard. And my friends- they won\u2019t understand. Heck, there are just 2 friends who am I even kidding and both of them have \u2018normal\u2019 families. Just not me- \nMy mother doesn\u2019t even make breakfast for us . I\u2019ve learnt to do everything on my own but would it kill her to talk to me nicely. How can someone curse their daughters so much. And she acts like everything is fine in front of extended family and friends. It\u2019s heartbreaking. I always have to keep a fake smile to keep my dad and sis happy. 2 years ago, I tried to kill myself by overdosing on sleeping pills but it didn\u2019t work and neither did my family realised I need a therapist. Their behaviour has only gotten worse since then. I often think of doing it again but I can\u2019t leave my dad and sis alone. Ion have the energy to go through that kinda Pain again . I can\u2019t leave em behind. What do I do? Ion even have someone to make eye contact with-\nMy mom doesn\u2019t hug me like other moms. There\u2019s no one to give me their blessing. My grandma was the only one who understood me ; who\nKept everyone together but even she\u2019s not here. I can\u2019t even explain how I cry myself to sleep every night without making noise .", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/owwn2a/so_tired_of_trying/", "title": "So tired of trying", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "stfubitchumf", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627967984, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/owwn2a/so_tired_of_trying/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635429110.0005248, "replies_charged": false}
