I blame myself for his death and I feel I could have prevented it if I just called him more often... I regret the final goodbye I said to him, because i was a naive fool and I thought I'd see him again the next week. Now I feel like I'm just a burden for my family... I'm 19, I have no job, and no drive. I've promised my best friend that I'd live till I'm 38 at the very least but its hard to maintain that promise. I don't want to let him down, but at the same time I have no purpose. I'm trying to find a job but its been hard as well. I guess I just needed to vent it out...
