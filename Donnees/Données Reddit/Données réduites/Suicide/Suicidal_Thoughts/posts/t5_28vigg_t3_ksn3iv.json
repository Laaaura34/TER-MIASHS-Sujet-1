I have constant thoughts of failure. My fears are constantly in mind. I fear that I\u2019ll never find the love that I need. And that I\u2019ll be alone forever. I\u2019m a senior in high school and have no idea what I\u2019m going to do. My parents are disappointed. I don\u2019t often feel much else but embarrassment, anger and sadness. \n\nIs it all pointless? I don\u2019t know. I feel my life has plenty of open paths, but none seem good. I\u2019ve started to want death much more recently. I feel like I should give up. Because why bother? Nothing will fit my expectations. Life isn\u2019t perfect; neither am I.
