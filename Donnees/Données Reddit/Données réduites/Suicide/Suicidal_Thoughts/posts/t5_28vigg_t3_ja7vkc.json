I\u2019ve also had issues with my body image and self esteem since forever. I thought I was over it when I started becoming more independent and confident in the last couple years. Recently i\u2019ve been dealing with probably my worst bout of depression since I was a teenager. No one knows. my best friend, my mom, and my boyfriend are the closest people to me and have no idea what\u2019s going on with me. I do a really good job at hiding it. \n\nI think i\u2019m VERY good at hiding when i\u2019m going through tough times but it hurts that no one is there for me at all. I feel I always try to be there for everyone around me and I have no one like that for me. no one I can depend on or talk to about my emotional and mental issues. and it makes me wonder how different they would act if they knew what was going through my mind everyday for the last few weeks.\n\nHow would their behavior change if they knew I was having suicidal thoughts almost daily? Would my boyfriend pick less fights with me? Would my best friend start answering my calls and texts? Would my family stop getting on my case about going back to school and having kids soon? \n\nI don\u2019t think i\u2019ve had serious suicidal thoughts in the last few years until now and it sucks that i\u2019m getting so bad again. Don\u2019t worry though I know I won\u2019t do it. there are two things stopping me: I don\u2019t want anyone to have to deal with the trauma of finding my body and I don\u2019t wanna leave my dog with anyone else. I know no one else will love him or take care of him like I do. He\u2019s the most important thing in my life. No one knows my dog is saving my life. \n\nsorry this is all over the place and thanks for reading. I just really wanna get this off my chest. i\u2019m looking into talking to a psychologist again soon and getting on antidepressants if I can. I was too nervous to ask for them last time I went through a bad depression but I feel I need them now to get me through the rest of my life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ja7vkc/i_wonder_how_everyone_close_to_me_would_change_if/", "title": "I wonder how everyone close to me would change if they knew what was really going through my head", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "rro32", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1602569661, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ja7vkc/i_wonder_how_everyone_close_to_me_would_change_if/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428938.6299458, "replies_charged": false}
