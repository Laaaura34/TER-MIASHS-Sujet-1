Was suicidal \\~7 years, been mostly not suicidal the past \\~2 months. Of course the thoughts started to come back within a month or less of finally finding hope. In a really twisted way, I kinda take comfort in knowing I will probably die at my own hands. I wouldn't consider myself suicidal anymore(maybe diet suicidal?? lol)but it's at the top of my list of how I'll probably die, just about how, the method, and what I've done with my life before it happens.  \nOn a side note, am I the only one who has attempted a lot of times but never left a letter? Maybe I've been scared I'd fail and they'd see it and I'd have to deal with it, or maybe it's because bro I'm having a breakdown and/or have no reason to live, why would I write a letter when I'm probably crying???   \nanyways just kinda a brain dump....", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pavmo7/hahaha_isnt_that_great/", "title": "hahaha isn't that great", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "KAI_IS_FINE", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629837086, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pavmo7/hahaha_isnt_that_great/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429620.2501616, "replies_charged": false}
