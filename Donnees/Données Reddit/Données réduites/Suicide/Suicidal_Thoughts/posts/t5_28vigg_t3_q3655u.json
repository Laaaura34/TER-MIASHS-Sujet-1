I'm literally only half as crazy as I was before. I'm in a bad life situation right now. I'm homeless and I have to live with family members who made me homeless before. But I only blame myself because when I should of been focusing in school to get a good career I was trying to be cool and met some evil people. I got really burnt out in college and been struggling with intense depression and anxiety every since. I just can't seem to catch a break. I'm really going to do it.
