I've exhausted all of my savings, and I've been living off $400 per week of unemployment, which isn't enough to keep up with expenses. I'm constantly overdrafted, and I always have to call my bank to schedule later date payments, because sometimes, unemployment checks come late. I'm going on 6 months without employment. I'm incredibly depressed, and without insurance or funds to seek any sort of mental health aide for my issues (C-PTSD, anxiety, OCD, eating disorders, depression), I told myself at the beginning of the month that I'd commit suicide if I didn't find a job by the end of the month. It is now mid-October. \n\nI was an idiot and truthfully told my employer during one-on-ones that while I'm open to working from home if the need arises (due to COVID-19), I'd prefer working onsite because my internet at home isn't the best (landlord has the cheapest package that always falters). I got fired the next day, during the start of the Stay At Home order at my state. Every job opportunity that has come my way either pulled out due to budgeting issues, or lowballed me to minimum wage and low hours, despite my 7 years of experience within my field. \n\nThe only things that held me back from carrying out my plans were the fact that I couldn't find a bridge tall enough to jump from, and because of my boyfriend, whom I love very much. I've vented to him and he's willing to help me financially until I get back on my feet, but I'd honestly prefer to die than be a burden, because I   know he deserves better than a failure like myself, who's full of emotional baggage stemming from childhood trauma, as well as unemployment. Financial aide is nothing but a band-aid, and I am not a freeloader. From that experience, I've learned that the best way for me to carry it out is to no longer tell him about it, because I don't want to see him cry. He'll be sad for a while when I go away, but I know he'll move on with someone better deserving of him eventually. As for the bridges...well I remembered I can't swim. So, I plan to drown myself at a nearby lake. I'll probably tie some weights to my ankles, like bags of dirt or something of the sort, so that I can't come up. \n\nI get it, this pandemic creates unusual circumstances for job seekers. A lot of people say it's a temporary problem. My suicidal tendencies have been with me since age 17, when I started remember all of the trauma  that my mind repressed since age 4.  My family told me I was crazy, that my whole purpose of being adopted was so that I can be a human ATM for them, that I should think more about them, and that it's what I get for becoming an atheist. They also gaslighted me and told my adoptive parents a completely different story; my adoptive parents think I'm also crazy. Therapy and medication helped me extend my life by 10 years, but not without any hiccups. If I die, I'll no longer be a burden to my boyfriend, my family won't have to worry any crazy atheists in their family line, and best of all, I won't have to deal with constant mental health issues anymore that I can't do anything about due to lack of funds.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jaszei/i_might_actually_kill_myself_this_month/", "title": "I might actually kill myself this month", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Suyin-0908", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 20, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1602646107, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jaszei/i_might_actually_kill_myself_this_month/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429230.4059427, "replies_charged": false}
