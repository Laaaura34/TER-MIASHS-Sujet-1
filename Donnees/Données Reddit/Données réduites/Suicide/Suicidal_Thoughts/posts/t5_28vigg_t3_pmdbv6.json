I thought I was getting better but I guess not.  I don\u2019t know what to do as I\u2019ve tried everything.  People only seem to fuck me up right now.  The ones I need to care no longer do.  I don\u2019t know what happened but I\u2019m lonely again.  Meds never helped, no matter how many therapy sessions I had they just never seemed to do the trick.  if you have any advice or experience of what you did to get through those long lonely nights please share", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pmdbv6/how_do_you_truly_get_past_your_depression/", "title": "how do you truly get past your depression?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "srdoz", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631387020, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pmdbv6/how_do_you_truly_get_past_your_depression/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428825.1901598, "replies_charged": false}
