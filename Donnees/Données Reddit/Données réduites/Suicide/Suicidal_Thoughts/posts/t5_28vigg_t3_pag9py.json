Maybe\u2026 I do wonder, does hell really exist? Will I be succumbing myself to an eternity of torture? Or is that just  something religion tells you to scare you? Will I be set free? Will I be trapped? I can\u2019t get any more trapped than I feel right now, can I?\n\nI\u2019ve always felt so deeply sad and alone.. Spending my life just drifting by. As a child, a teenager, and now as an adult.. The background person, the last option, the one that no one really wanted to be with, unless I had something to offer them. From school to jobs, friendships to relationships. \n\nI\u2019ve spent half my life taking care of others\u2026 and all I have really longed for, was for someone to take care of me in return.. Was that really too much to ask for? A hug? A shoulder to cry on? Or even a \u201cHey are you okay?\u201d But\u2026 instead it\u2019s just.. silence..   \n\nMy attempts to reach out have been\u2026 unsuccessful to say the least. \u201cIt will get better.\u201d When though? I\u2019ve tried so hard to escape my dark thoughts. To tell people I\u2019m not okay. To beg for help. But\u2026 once again\u2026 silence. \n\nI\u2019ve wasted my life, and abused myself. I ruined my mind, and my body. The fat, the scarred skin, and even my teeth. I\u2019m beyond repair.. I know it\u2019s no ones fault but my own. I can\u2019t even stand to look at myself in the mirror anymore\u2026 I don\u2019t recognize the reflection staring back at me. \n\nBumpy, crater face. Yellow, cavity filled teeth. Sagging breasts. Loose stretch marked skin. Self inflicted scars. Disgusting. No wonder my significant other is no longer attracted to me. I\u2019m not even attractive to myself.. \n\nTouch deprived. Love deprived. After all, who could possibly want this? My fucked up mind, and busted body.. I knew it was too good to be true. I\u2019ve known my entire life no one could ever want me, and love me for me. How could that be possible, when I have never even liked myself?   \n\nHow is this not hell? I wake up everyday with this sinking feeling of dread.. This feeling like there is a gaping hole in my chest that nothing ever seems to fill..  I can\u2019t ignore it anymore... My soul physically hurts.
