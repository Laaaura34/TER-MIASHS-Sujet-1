The world would be much better if I left it forever. The butterfly effect of positivity would be great. But yet I still curse the earth with my existence. I'm sorry, yall. I just can't do it. I wish I could. Suicidal thoughts comfort me greatly. One day I'll free everyone of myself either through a permanent end or isolation. Maybe for those who don't prefer my death I'll think of them and opt for isolation.\n\nSorry ignore me. No one deserves to deal with me. No one deserves to be brought low by me. I hope everyone reading this somehow has hope or sees a dog today. Yall deserve it, I promise. Yall keep going.
