I fantasize about it daily. Friends around me are so confident and full of life, I get stuck comparing myself to  other women all the time. I have a husband (ignores me) and a child. I know I can't leave him without a mother. I had an affair and it was the only time ever in my life that I felt someone really wanted me, but then he wanted someone else, someone better, younger, more intelligent and more beautiful than me. I have a history of getting rejected or ignored. I don't know how to be happy. I don't know why I hate myself so much, I have been told what an ugly stupid person I am my whole life. So, now I just go through the day and wait to go to sleep. I look at my kids little face and think, you deserve so much better than this. Then I imagine disappearing. I have so much anger that it eats me alive, I am a door mat, I don't know how much more I can take.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ilikt3/i_hate_myself/", "title": "I hate myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Jet_girl-1377", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1599090874, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ilikt3/i_hate_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429310.916408, "replies_charged": false}
