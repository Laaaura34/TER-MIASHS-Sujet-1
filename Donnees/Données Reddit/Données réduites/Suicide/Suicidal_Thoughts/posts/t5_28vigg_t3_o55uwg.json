(she was kicked out and mom told her to come back a week later) my mom always chose her and her married with kids boyfriend over me since i was in elementary school. i was the scapegoat. i was just the worst kid. she never enabled me to pursue any of passions as a kid she sabotaged me while my sis was given every chance. i was the one that looks and acts like my dad. her boyfriend came before us and she did what he said. she gave me silence treeatment for months few times in a year. she simply cease communication for stuff that i dont even remember. im so mad at her for choosing to be my worst enemy over a mom. i will not fully recover from the stress and the pain she put me under since young age. i feellike im having trouble building healthy relationships with people i\u2019m insecure and depressed 24/7. i dont remember genuinely enjoying my life and always think of ways of killing myself but im scared. she couldnt even give me valid reason for kicking me out. last thing i heard from her was i wasno longer her daughter and will never come her back home. i\u2019m with dad in another city with no friends. im not allowed go outside. he would even let me eat meals freely but forces me to cut my food as he wishes so i back to y room crying all day.  i wish they were all dead so icould finally live happy and free. i miss my friends my cat my room back at my mom\u2019s house but im filled with hatred and anger. i have never told about the things i have been through to anyone. so everyobe consideres im the problematic one when my mom phones everyobe she knows to tell about how a bad person i am. my mom also became friends with his long term boyfriends wife and even welcoemd her in our house where they could cheat on her. i feel like she is sociopath though she believes that she is nice persob and \u2018spiritual\u2019 and portrays herself as the victim. there are so many details about what she has done. i went out with a male friend and asked if we were dating and i panicked and said he was gay, he actually is but i was scared that she would snitch to my dad and she didn\u2019t talk to for days bc i had a gay friend. and told my dad abouf it and they force me to stop being friends with him bc they were afraid that i was a lesbian and and eveyobe would think that i am a lesbian and my father threatend me with beating him. and snitchied to his parents. they are so homophobic and dont know how to react right to any situation so im always embarrassed bc of them. i always dream of leaving them and having my own family but im scared ending up like mom and being a bad mom so i always get stressed though im not even in relationship and im in college. i feel no love for any of family members i cant even stand them existing bc of the years of resentment. i crave love and genuine connection with a human being. i have adhd and really in a bad mood right now i cant really put words together and all the text may not make sense to u but that was tje only form i could ever open up to people. if u read it thank u", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/o55uwg/i_feel_like_im_never_gonna_heal_yet_too_scared_to/", "title": "i feel like im never gonna heal yet too scared to kill myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "kittycutiexox", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624310366, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/o55uwg/i_feel_like_im_never_gonna_heal_yet_too_scared_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428949.8241513, "replies_charged": false}
