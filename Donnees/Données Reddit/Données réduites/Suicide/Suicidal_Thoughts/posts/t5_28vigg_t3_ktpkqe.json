Cold, dark, and socially isolated. Sounds like a recipe for loneliness and depression. I normally get SAD every winter but this one feels more severe. My anxiety is through the roof,  I think I feel trapped and hopeless not knowing when it's gonna end. I feel the thoughts of death and suicide pop up whether I like it or not. It's like I need a way out to stop the pain and there's no option but death but I don't want to die. This might be the first time in my life I've ever experienced suicidal thoughts.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ktpkqe/i_think_the_winter_pandemic_is_giving_me_feelings/", "title": "I think the winter pandemic is giving me feelings of suicide but I don't want to kill myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "alamurda510", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1610193042, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ktpkqe/i_think_the_winter_pandemic_is_giving_me_feelings/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428953.5267875, "replies_charged": false}
