Basically for context, my hometown burned down in the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in CA a few years ago. Luckily all my friends and family survived, but we lost everything and it was extremely traumatizing. The fires are gonna be starting back up in CA again and every time a new fire starts I get so triggered and get these horrible panic attacks, anxiety, depression etc. I\u2019ve been wanting to leave CA for a long time but idk where to go. My family and all my friends still live here, and they\u2019re pretty much my only source of happiness at this point so I don\u2019t want to be too far away from them.\n\nRecently, my dad suddenly died a few weeks ago. We were not close. He was abusive. He said and did things that made me want to kms when I was a kid, and through I never really tried, I definitely self harmed and developed an eating disorder.\n\nHe never apologized for the things he did. Even though part of me is glad he is gone because he will no longer hurt anyone else or struggle with the pain he experienced in life, I can\u2019t stop thinking about death. I feel like I\u2019m obsessed with it. I don\u2019t really have hope for the future. I believe the planet and humanity is fucked, so what\u2019s the point of living? I have experienced some moments of beauty and happiness in life, but most of it has been pain and suffering. I can\u2019t keep telling myself it\u2019s going to get better when I truly fear that it\u2019s only going to get worse.\n\nI\u2019m on SSRIs (prozac) and I know I need to get help (counseling) and talk to someone about all this, but I\u2019ve been doing it my whole life and it\u2019s such a pain in the ass for something I\u2019m not even sure really helps in the long run.\n\nAny advice on how to deal with this??
