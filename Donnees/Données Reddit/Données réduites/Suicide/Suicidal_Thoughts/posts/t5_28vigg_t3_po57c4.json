During a breakdown I've said to my only friend that he knows someone other, because I've lied so much and invented a new personality.\nObviously now, he doesn't talk to me and I feel bad talking to him but the problem is that he is my classmate and I see him every single day.\nI've always thought to suicide but never like nowadays. Now I'm contemplating suicide and while I'm sitting on the sofa or doing something I watch the window and I hear like a voice that tells me to jump. I don't know what to do. And I can't even say it to my psychotherapist 'cause i feel like it's wrong being like this and having these thoughts", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/po57c4/suicidal_contemplation/", "title": "Suicidal contemplation", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "_noonenowhere_", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631633851, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/po57c4/suicidal_contemplation/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635428721.7786877, "replies_charged": false}
