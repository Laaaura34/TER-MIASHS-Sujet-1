I feel literally empty, that no-one is there for me,that no-one understands me, that I'm invisible, that I've got no purpose in life. The only things I think are about how useless I am and how the fuck I ended up like this while im just 17. And the sad part is that I don't have any easy answer for why I feel like this since I was never getting bullied and I've always got \"friends\". My mind is just full of negative thoughts and I'm afraid I may hurt me. The only reason I haven't is because I don't wanna cause chaos into my family and the little people that care about me. \n\n\nThank you for reading this, I'm not asking for attention or anything like that,I just wanted to share somewhere my thoughts.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/lgcvq5/depression/", "title": "Depression", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "letsjerk14", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612903224, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/lgcvq5/depression/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428840.5530422, "replies_charged": false}
