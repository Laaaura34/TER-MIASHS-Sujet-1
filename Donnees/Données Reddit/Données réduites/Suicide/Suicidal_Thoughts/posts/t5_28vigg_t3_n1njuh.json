I never really thought I would have so many regrets at this point in my life. Nothing really feels meaningful to me anymore. Nobody really understands me the way I want them to. I feel like I\u2019m constantly falling but nobody\u2019s there to catch me. I have so much guilt. I wish I could just start over. I wish I was a kid again. It was never meant to be this way. I wish I never lost that innocence, that beautiful, beautiful innocence. Nothing matters anymore and I don\u2019t know how much longer I can hold on. If anyone is reading this it would mean a lot to talk to someone, anyone.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/n1njuh/pain/", "title": "Pain", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Plenty-Editor-3745", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619762315, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/n1njuh/pain/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429074.1435676, "replies_charged": false}
