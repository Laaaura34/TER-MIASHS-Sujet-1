The last time I tried to die, the rope snapped, so I just lay on the floor. now I cant even try for two more months. I dont even think I have the guts to do it again anyways. I really want to die, but I dont want my family to thing horribly about me or mourn me or hurt because they feel like they've failed as being my parents. But I cant wait 70 years to die of old age, that is way to far away, and living for that long in a miserable life is not my idea of having a good time. death is the only way out, but I guess I'll just have to wait until my family die. Sometimes I wish we'd get in a car accident or something, so that they wouldn't have to see the dissapointing end to their son's life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ojkpe0/there_is_no_other_way_out/", "title": "There is no other way out", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "HalfGiraffe44", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626198116, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ojkpe0/there_is_no_other_way_out/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429242.3174686, "replies_charged": false}
