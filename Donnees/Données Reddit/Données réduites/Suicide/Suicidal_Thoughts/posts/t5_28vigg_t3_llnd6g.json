I was waiting till 18 since that's the time I'm actually considered an adult. It's pretty crazy on how much you can trick people to think you're not really suicidal, my parents know I have anxiety and somewhat \"depression\" but no one in real life knows that I actually wanna die. I've thought it through I've waited for four years and now I'm almost at my due date.  I don't even think I deserve to have a life sometimes. I'm currently looking at part time jobs that don't really involve talking with others except co-workers and such. I feel really pathetic, Why did my life even turn out like this? I always feel ignored and like all I do won't even change, everyone always leaves me in the dust while I wilt away in a room. I just wanna give up I'm always a downer Truly like my whole life truly a Killjoy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/llnd6g/what_have_i_been_doing/", "title": "What have I been doing", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SeniorBopo", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613541053, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/llnd6g/what_have_i_been_doing/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429227.9627225, "replies_charged": false}
