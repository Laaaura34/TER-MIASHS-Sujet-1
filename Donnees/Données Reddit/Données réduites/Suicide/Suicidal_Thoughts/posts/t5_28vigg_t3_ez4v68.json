I am a mental health worker that specializes in crisis work. I often de-escalate others who are on the verge of attempting suicide, or I get there once they already have. I have had my fair share of mental health problems in my own life including an eating disorder, severe depression and anxiety. I go through these cyclical patterns of having intense suicidal thoughts. I\u2019ve half assed attempted in the past with ODing on Barbiturates. Every time I get to the peak I get so worried about who will find me, how it will affect them. I\u2019ve seen the grief that family and friends experience after losing a loved one to suicide. Those thoughts just make me feel so trapped and even more hopeless. \n\nI feel stupid and selfish for feeling this way. Life is actually going right for a bunch of reasons(I love my job, newly married, etc) but I can\u2019t shake these feelings. I think about it almost every night and feel like I get closer to it each day and then I think about the people who would be affected and I just get angry. I feel so stuck. I feel ridiculous for feeling this way when life is \u201cgood.\u201d I really struggle with the \u201cothers have it worse concept.\u201d It feels good to get this off my chest but I want it so bad.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ez4v68/struggling/", "title": "Struggling", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "PrisonIntern", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1580882600, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ez4v68/struggling/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429059.8174503, "replies_charged": false}
