I feel bad that I even want to commit suicide, because I haven't got any good reason to, I'm always told that I'm fortunate, but I don't feel that way. I feel too cowardly to do anything about it. My family and peers expect me to do well in life, because I go to a grammar school, and they've all done very well so far in their lives, so I feel like I'm always letting them down. I can't tell anyone because I feel like they would be ashamed in me or think that I'm making it up since being suicidal is \"emo\" or smth now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/od85b9/why_do_i_feel_like_this/", "title": "Why do I feel like this?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DogLover10000000", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625352601, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/od85b9/why_do_i_feel_like_this/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429576.11864, "replies_charged": false}
