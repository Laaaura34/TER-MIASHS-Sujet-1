So my father who was drunk that night asked me to tell him what was going on. I never told anyone what i was going through and it was annoying him to the point where he told me himself that he would punch or slap me on my face if i continue to \"act\" like this. My older sister (one of my triggers) was making everything worse and so is my second sister. This afternoon i'm planning to commit suicide again and i hope that it will stop their problems and heavy feeling in this house. I've had enough and i'm really tired of acting strong infront of them and to myself. thank you for all those people who stayed and understood me just a little and thank you for my dog who never left my side while i'm like this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/l39kq3/ive_had_enough/", "title": "i've had enough", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tiredexpletives", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1611396528, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/l39kq3/ive_had_enough/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429230.8340576, "replies_charged": false}
