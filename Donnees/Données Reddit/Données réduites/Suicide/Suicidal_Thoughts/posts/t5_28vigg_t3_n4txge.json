I always have this kind of thoughts and it's getting worse since the covid has begun. \n\nI tried to see the psychiatrist, but it didnt work well.\nPlus I live in the country that the public health sucks. I've been trying to talk to someone, but it seems no one understand me.\n\nI'm bored of living life, of everything.\nEverything here in my country's making me sick every single day.\n\nI'm struggling to live life the day by day, but I'm not sure how long I can live in this situation.\n\nIf anyone here has any suggestion, please advise me.\n\nThank you \nPs.
