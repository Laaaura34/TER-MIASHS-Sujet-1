It's the second week of school and it's the worst thing in my life. My professor's make me feel dumb and I'm the only color person in my class. I could just feel the stares behind my back. I'm deciding not show up for some of my classes. I have no one. Literally no one. I had mental breakdown with a friend and she laughed saying she sucks at comforting people. I could just feel worse. On top of that, I already signed my apartment lease and I can't go back to live in my town. I'm really devastated. I have no passion anymore. I thought it would come back since it had gone away a year ago. I eat 10 gummies of melatonin. I'm sorry. My teacher keeps calling me out and I feel so fucking dumb when I get things wrong. Sometimes they just give me a stare like wtf. It doesn't help and it's making feel worse. I deleted my social media and I'm about to throw away everything that once love like my drawings, family pictures, and more.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pctv7t/im_suicidal/", "title": "I'm suicidal", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SellTraditional4240", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630091300, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pctv7t/im_suicidal/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428723.500347, "replies_charged": false}
