Sometimes i feel i should give up my life, and the funny part is i have no clue why i feel like that.\nI have supportive family, it's just I don't have good relationship with my father. I hate him  because he is abusive, he mentally tortures his children, constantly complaint about things and one second he is fine and then he is abusing. This is something that angers me and make me feel sad. Financially I'm sound, no problem as such, but still I have suicidal thoughts every now and then. Deep down in my brain, one day I want to give up everything and get lost forever. I want to figure out a reason why I feel that way!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/nxq50z/suicidal_thoughts_now_and_then/", "title": "Suicidal thoughts now and then", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tintinwhiskey", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623445288, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/nxq50z/suicidal_thoughts_now_and_then/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429287.3405135, "replies_charged": false}
