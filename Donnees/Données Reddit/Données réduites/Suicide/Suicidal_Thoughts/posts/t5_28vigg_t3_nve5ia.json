Last time I was happy and haven\u2018t had any bad thoughts in the nights was like 2 years ago. I wish that there was more support from the people I love, for example my girlfriend, at some days she just get\u2018s my mood up a lot but most of the time she downs me even more than I already am. She always says that I\u2018m not there for her, but that\u2018s not true, I\u2018m always trying my best but she never let\u2018s me help her. Sometimes I feel like that she isn\u2018t even paying attention to my problems. I\u2018m trying to be strong for her but I can\u2018t anymore. I\u2018m having mental breakdowns once or twice a week now and I don\u2018t know what to do anymore.
