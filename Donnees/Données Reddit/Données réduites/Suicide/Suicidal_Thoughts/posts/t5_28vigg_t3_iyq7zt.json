I need to make a will, find an executor, make sure everything is in order. I'm so sorry. I have so much love for everyone. I'm sorry I'm not strong enough to live like this, it's a shame I have to remove this person of this world. I could've done great things. I hope y'all find yourselves and love yourselves as much as I love everyone. I wish I could love me like I love all of you billions of other humans.
