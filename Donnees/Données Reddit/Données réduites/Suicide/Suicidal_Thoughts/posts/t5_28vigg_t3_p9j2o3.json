I know it doesn\u2019t make sense, but I have an exciting backpacking trip planned that I\u2019m secretly thinking \u201cif somehow I die that\u2019s fine\u201d but if I mention that to someone they\u2019ll get all worried and keep their eyes on my movements. I want to be left alone by the people who love me, I want to talk about how I\u2019m walking into the wilderness with a slight death wish, how it\u2019s getting me through the fear of following my dreams knowing that if I stay home I\u2019ll just die at home by my own hand. I\u2019m not actively trying to die, but if death came for me in the woods, I\u2019d welcome it, u know? \n\n Im not out there jumping off cliffs, but I want to die, and I wish I could talk about it and get a Viking\u2019s reaction, someone to slap me on the back and nod and say \u201cyou\u2019ll make it out alive, and if you don\u2019t then you were brave and I\u2019m proud.\u201d I am brave because I feel the fear and I continue and maybe I\u2019ll die, but I\u2019d be a coward if I let my thoughts chase me down in a house in the fucking suburbs. \n\nI want to tell people I\u2019m scared of my own thoughts, without having them call the cops or raise the alarms. I want them to believe me without making them cause a ruckus about. \n\nI am depressed, I am suicidal, I don\u2019t want anyone to know because that\u2019s when everyone pretends to care and I don\u2019t have the energy to keep telling them I\u2019ll figure it out. And by figure it out I mean let me die if I want to, let me heal if I can.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p9j2o3/let_nature_take_me/", "title": "Let nature take me", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mary_w3b", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629660393, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p9j2o3/let_nature_take_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428856.9421065, "replies_charged": false}
