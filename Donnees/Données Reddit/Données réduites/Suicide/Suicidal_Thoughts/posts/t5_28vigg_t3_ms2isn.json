My anxiety keeps me from killing myself, and as much as I can rationalize it, I can\u2019t bring myself to do it. I think about my kids and how much better they would hypothetically be if I\u2019m gone, me being selfish, but in reality they need a father and that\u2019s what keeps me around. \n\nI\u2019ve started driving without a seatbelt and putting myself in a position where hopefully a car t bones me and can kill me since I can\u2019t kill myself. Lately with all these mass shootings, I find myself jealous that I\u2019ve missed them. \n\nI work 5am-10pm 6 days a week and come home to a wife that wants to decompress with me. I can\u2019t be anything for them other than a financial resource and it\u2019s taking it\u2019s toll. My existence is checking boxes and breathing air, in front of people I put on that smile and act like it\u2019s all ok, literally the life of the party, but behind closed doors, or any time I can steal 5 minutes I break down and cry and dig my nails as hard  as I can into my skin to try and feel anything. I think I need a friend because my life stresses me out too much idfk. \n\nI\u2019m tired of feeling like I\u2019m on a treadmill going nowhere at 2.0 mph. \n\nWhy is it so hard to end things when it seems like the only option?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ms2isn/complicated/", "title": "Complicated", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "anxiety_breathe", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618577660, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ms2isn/complicated/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428996.208381, "replies_charged": false}
