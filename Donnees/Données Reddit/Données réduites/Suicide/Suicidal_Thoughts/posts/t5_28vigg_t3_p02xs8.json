The way I've explained it to a couple close friends is that when you actually attempt suicide, a part of your brain breaks that never can be fixed, and you're stuck with the thoughts and urges forever.  Do any of you feel the same way?  \n\nSo my last attempt was May 2019.  Stopped self harming in June 2019 too.  But the thoughts... The thoughts have never gone away.  I think about killing myself every day.  I don't think I will but you never know.  But the thoughts and the urges are relentless some days, and they just never fucking stop.  I thought they would have gone away by now.  \n\nI also work in a place surrounded by death, and I'm responsible for it myself too.  I work in a wildlife hospital and often animals that are brought in are far too broken to be saved and must be euthanized, which I became licensed to do earlier this year.  \n\nI had a particularly hard day today and I'm really stuggling.  \n\nTLDR:  Do suicial thoughts ever go away after you've attempted, or are they with you forever?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p02xs8/does_it_ever_stop/", "title": "Does it ever stop?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "erink67", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628375726, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p02xs8/does_it_ever_stop/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429618.8315935, "replies_charged": false}
