I don't have a social life, i dont have my mother in my life, i have no will to get up. i have \"friends\" that don't care about me. they only care when they need something or are bored. i don't have anything to do but write, and thats becoming horrible because I'm to clouded to write anything. I've been used in relationships for \"showing off\" because my looks are what people care about. my last relationship ended because she used me as a \"bet\". I knew her for a year. I've been bullied at school half my life because I was never \"normal\". i was never really anyone's friend because im \"hard to deal with\". im not the worse case in the world with this stuff, but this fucking sucks. i dont think this is what im supposed to be feeling like.I spent 2 years in therapy to help with anger/anxiety and multi personality issues. and it helped myself but not the view people had on me.  this is my last attempt at trying to find cope.\n \nim sorry if this is wierd this is my 1st post, I just really need some advice or help", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/gvopo6/i_dont_know_if_this_is_right/", "title": "i dont know if this is right", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "driftingintonothing", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1591166473, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/gvopo6/i_dont_know_if_this_is_right/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429319.021263, "replies_charged": false}
