I think I started to be what you may call \"depressed\" when I was 12/13 (never had a professional diagnosis though), and things got worse with high school. I kept going with the hope that things would eventually get better: they didn't.  I'm not good at anything in particular, I don't have any close friend, never had a girlfriend, I'm not particularly brilliant. I've always contemplate suicide but I've never tried it. Things now are getting to a point where they seems unbearable for me, I can't physically, emotionally and psychologically deal with this. Now, to the important part: in thinking about suicide, I stumbled upon what I consider the major issue. I'd ruin the lives of my parents, my brother, my relatives. Isn't this unfair? I have to keep going when clearly there are no reasons, only because some others egoistically will be sad otherwise. Obviously I care about them, and I don't want to doom their lives. It's strange because every feeling will cease, but at the same time what I feel now prevent me from feeling better (or nothing). I'm stuck in a position where every action I do, even doing nothing, worsen things.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jtr32f/its_not_fair/", "title": "It's not fair.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "jackvescovi", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1605309999, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/jtr32f/its_not_fair/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429514.2809749, "replies_charged": false}
