I had an abusive hisband for 10 years, but am now remarried to a wonderful man. We have a beautiful 18 mo. I have 2 amazing children with  my ex. He is a violent, abusive narcissist. This week he parentally kidnapped them. Im so depressed. His attorney lied, threatened and terrorized me. The police cant take them back bc we technically share \"legal custody\". Dcf is on him for 10th time but cant do removal unless there \"imminent danger\". I tried to reach out to my narc abuse group, and the mod will not let me post it, and is being nasty about it. I feel like everyone hates me, no one will help me and the only ppl who would understand I cant talk to now. Im not someone who wants to die, but I feel like I dont even exist. No one cares or will listen. Im in so much pain. I guess it is me whos the bad one. Maybe my ex was right and the world would be better off w o out me. Idk what to do. Everywhere I turn everyome treats me like garbage-besides my family. But everyone thinks Im a difficult b, but Im just trying to protect my kids. I feel hollow and hated. Anyone else ever feel like this? Like if even a mod on an abuse recovery group hates you, is that a sign you dont belong anymore? Maybe Im just not right for the world. My ex used to tell me everyoned be better if I just died", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/iawc5t/nowhere_to_turn/", "title": "Nowhere to turn", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Valuable-Marsupial71", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1597598571, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/iawc5t/nowhere_to_turn/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429050.301189, "replies_charged": false}
