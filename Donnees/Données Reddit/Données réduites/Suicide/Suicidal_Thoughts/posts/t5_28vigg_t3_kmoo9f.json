I\u2019m good at faking like I\u2019m okay at times but I\u2019m really not. \n\nMy kids don\u2019t deserve to deal with it all or see it and I try to hide away when I\u2019m crying but having 3 children in a very small home it\u2019s almost impossible for them not to see me cry. \n\nAnd I\u2019m just so mad at the world. Everything sets me off... everything. I just wish I had an easy way to end it all. \n\nI could get some fentanyl or heroin and do it that way but I don\u2019t want to be remembered as someone who lost their battle with addiction because that\u2019s not true, I\u2019ve beat those demons just not my mental health ones. \n\nDamn I\u2019m lonely. Even with people around me... always so damn lonely. Why do so many feel like this?\n\nI love my children more than anything and they deserve to have a mom who isn\u2019t so sad or upset all the time.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/kmoo9f/if_im_not_mad_im_sad_its_exhausting/", "title": "If I\u2019m not mad I\u2019m sad, it\u2019s exhausting.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "RavenMarceline", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1609281255, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/kmoo9f/if_im_not_mad_im_sad_its_exhausting/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429254.0605342, "replies_charged": false}
