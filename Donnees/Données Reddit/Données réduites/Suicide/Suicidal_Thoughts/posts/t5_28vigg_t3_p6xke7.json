Sometimes I do have good moments, which feels like short breaks from all the stress and anxiety. Sleep is the best part of my day. I feel like I'm living somewhere else in some other life or fantasy and it all feels so real. When I wake up, even if I saw a nightmare I'd rather live there. Worst is when I'm not able to sleep. Like I'm trying my best to fall asleep but it just won't work. Slowly my anxiety just starts to rise and I think about all the fragments of memories my brain forced me to forget. When I try to remember, all I see are black clouds. If I think too long, this hell I'm living in feels perpetually haunting, and it feels as if it is consuming me. I don't know if I'm still living in a memory which my brain will force me to forget in the future. I don't know when I'll get anxious again with the sharp pain in my chest. I don't know when all those horrible period of time I've been through will come rushing back as memories. I just want to sleep and conclude my day, in the hope that when I wake up, this hell will disappear.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p6xke7/i_just_want_to_sleep/", "title": "I just want to sleep", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "girlinvoid", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 24, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629312703, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p6xke7/i_just_want_to_sleep/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429215.8654628, "replies_charged": false}
