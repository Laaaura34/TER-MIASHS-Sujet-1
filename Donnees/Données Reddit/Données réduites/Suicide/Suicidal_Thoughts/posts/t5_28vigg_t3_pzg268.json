A partner and I parted ways and ever since that happened I can\u2019t seem to function right or think right. Everytime I speak to them it just hurts, everytime they needed me I was there for them and it hurts a lot. I\u2019ve recently attempted to take the easy way out but I was hesitant, the longer I keep going on the more tempting it feels. I cannot say I moved on or anything because I know I have not but I just don\u2019t think I can take it anymore it just hurts too much to even wake up. \n\nI\u2019ve cried myself to sleep so many nights I couldn\u2019t sleep nor eat, everytime I go to work it feels daunting because I feel super weak. I just feel super tired of feeling like i\u2019m not worth it or worth the patience. They meant the world to me and now I cannot see life without them. Which is one of the reasons I feel like I cannot carry on anymore. I don\u2019t just have thoughts about the easy way out I feel like I want it more than ever. \n\nI feel like I cannot keeping fighting my anxiety and depression anymore and I want to give in to them and let them take their toll on me. Maybe this way it\u2019s easier? Maybe I won\u2019t have to feel anything when it happens. I just hate everything I used to love nowadays and don\u2019t see any point in carrying on anymore.\n\nAm I wrong for this? Because I feel like everything is my fault.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pzg268/feeling_overwhelmed/", "title": "Feeling\u2026 overwhelmed", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "F4ppingP3ngu1n", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633118974, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/pzg268/feeling_overwhelmed/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428845.9845405, "replies_charged": false}
