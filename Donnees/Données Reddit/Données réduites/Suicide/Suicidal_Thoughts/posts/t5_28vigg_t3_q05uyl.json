Yet somehow, that ONE dark little thought still overpowers every single good thing. Like a vine. It grows around and embeds itself in every thought. No matter how happy it is. \n\nSometimes, rarely, I find myself in a moment where it\u2019s not RIGHT there. But then I take a step back and there it is, tapping. Tapping at my window, begging to come back in. Guilt tripping me. Reminding me of all the shitty things I\u2019ve done. Telling me I don\u2019t deserve any of the good things. \n\nThere are even times it isn\u2019t present for days, or weeks, and  I think it\u2019s gone for good. Jokes on me though, that pesky little FUCK is always lying dormant, like a cancer.  Everything is great. No signs of it. I have no idea anything is wrong. \nThen one day, boom. I collapse and suddenly it\u2019s embedded in every fiber of my thoughts. \n\nI know nobody cares and it probably sounds pretty stupid but FUCK. It\u2019s like im swimming and barely touching the ground because the waves are big, not too much to handle. I can deal with it for the first moment. Im fully capable. But then the waves get too big. I lose control and I\u2019m drowning if I don\u2019t jump at just the right time. \n\nI guess what I\u2019m saying here is,\n\nI\u2019m losing the strength to keep jumping the big waves, and there\u2019s not a lifeguard anywhere in sight.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q05uyl/i_think_i_finally_found_the_words_for_what_goes/", "title": "I think I finally found the words for what goes through my fucked up head", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "happydaze_", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633217093, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/q05uyl/i_think_i_finally_found_the_words_for_what_goes/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429066.8771784, "replies_charged": false}
