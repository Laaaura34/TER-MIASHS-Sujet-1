But if no one chose to exist and being here is fucking paralyzing, why is it a problem to commit suicide? Like everyone says the same damn thing, \"what about family? What about friends? And your pets? What would happen to them?\" I can answer all of these and still be perfectly okay with the thought of suicide. The only thing that really held me down was my ex. But obviously she's an ex, so at this point what the fuck is left? Well I guess my cats are now my grounding. I could easily give them to family or friends that I trust, but I do not wish for anybody else to be companions with my cats, so I guess that's one thing. But honestly in 8 or 9 years when they pass away will I have anything else to hold me down? If not I think I may just end it then. But for now I'll stick to this disgusting, sorry ass excuse of a planet we call Earth. Should've called it trash cause besides the nature, that's all thats here.\n\nEdit: I'm not gonna commit suicide so dont worry. I got my cats grounding me for right now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/oghi61/if_nobody_chose_to_exist_why_is_it_a_problem_that/", "title": "If nobody chose to exist, why is it a problem that I want to choose to not exist anymore?
