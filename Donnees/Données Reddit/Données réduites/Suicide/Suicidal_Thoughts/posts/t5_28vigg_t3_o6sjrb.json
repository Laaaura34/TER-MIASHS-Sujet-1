Its such a joke, anyways my whole life has been sad, i tried, i really did, its the end of my time unfortunately, and the sadder fact is nobody will remember me as i didnt have too much connections, im just a lost soul, my love didnt love me back, but i hope she lives a good life, my family was never healthy, i hope they change, my friends never cared about me, i hope they remember me, im just a washed up anxious boy, nothing but pain and frustration in my life..", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/o6sjrb/i_just_wanted_to_be_happy/", "title": "I just wanted to be happy", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Beginning_College292", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624505032, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/o6sjrb/i_just_wanted_to_be_happy/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428921.0421767, "replies_charged": false}
