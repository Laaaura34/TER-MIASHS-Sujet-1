And then I'm gonna keep walking and looking around me. I love animals, plants, bugs. I am going to have a wonderful day seeing things I want to see. Then I am going to tie myself to a tree and simply lean forward and enjoy the asphyxiation. I love being choked so goddamn much I'm convinced I can do it this way. If it doesn't work, well I'll actually hang myself instead. Thinking about this makes me happy in ways nothing else has in so fucking long. I am going to go through my things and pack up boxes of my shit to send to friends and family. Things I think they'll like to have. I am going to end this torture.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ndbugy/heres_the_plan_when_will_it_happen/", "title": "Here's the plan.
