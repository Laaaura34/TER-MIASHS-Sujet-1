In the beginning I loved the idea of being home all day. (I was laid off from my job and it has been torture trying to even find something else) Anyway, the last two months or so have been absolutely awful. There has been this overwhelming fear of impending doom. I\u2019m sure a lot of people are feeling that, but it consumes me everyday. So many times I wake up in the middle of the night, constantly searching for good news. Obsessing over transmission rates and positivity rates in my town, something that I never worried about before. I think the longer this goes on the more I fear it will never end. It\u2019s ruining my relationship and my friendships and even my parents are agitated at my constant seeking of reassurance. I just need to know everything will be okay, even though logically nobody knows. When I\u2019m left alone I\u2019m obsessing over these intrusive thoughts of seeing the people I love most getting sick and succumbing to this virus. Most people I know are cautious and concerned, and living in Massachusetts we have been doing extremely well at trying to control the spread in comparison to some other states. Yet, my intense paranoia continues. Fearing the second wave, fearing that if I decide to let my guard down and see a friend I will get it and pass it on to my loved ones. My mother had a small outdoor birthday party for me just invited my grandmother, my brother, niece and two friends of mine. Everyone else was just the people in my household. Yet the fear of catching it at my own party scared me so much I wanted to escape the fear and enjoy a normal day for once. After all it was my birthday. Well, it went down hill so fast. I decided to try and find comfort in an edible. I have been smoking weed for many years and consider myself to be an experienced user of marijuana. Well, this time the edible didn\u2019t provide the once familiar comfort it used to. What I experienced was something you hear happening after someone dropped too much acid. The high came on slow, but long story short by the end of the night when I was supposed to be blowing out my candles and smiling for pictures opening presents I had what I\u2019m sure is some type of psychotic episode.  I became convinced it was my fault of what was happening in the world because I didn\u2019t listen and decided to smoke weed. That it was my fault for the pandemic because I never listened. I was screaming in fear that I was dying and if I went in my room that I would die and the world would collapse and that some greater being was about to pull the plug on \u201cthe simulation\u201d. I was consumed in this delusion for HOURS. I scared my friends and they left haven\u2019t heard from them since. I\u2019m pretty sure my boyfriend is secretly mad or disgusted deep down. I feel like a failure. I feel like it\u2019s not just a result from the edible but that I\u2019m slowly losing my mind. I feel like I\u2019m deteriorating and that this is what my future holds. To become paranoid, delusional, and psychotic. I\u2019m upset that I let this pandemic get to me like this. I wish I could be more balanced like my friends. I wish I wasn\u2019t consumed by fear. I just want to live my life. I want to work and have a happy relationship with my boyfriend but I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s meant for me. I feel like I should just die before I have to see the world get any worse. I can\u2019t take the paranoia and anxiety anymore and I think they\u2019d all be better off without me. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going with this, but I\u2019m so sad and scared I don\u2019t know who I can talk to.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/itkp78/i_feel_like_im_a_loser_and_ive_wasted_my_life/", "title": "I feel like I\u2019m a loser and I\u2019ve wasted my life.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Zealousideal-Cost-87", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1600214564, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/itkp78/i_feel_like_im_a_loser_and_ive_wasted_my_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429371.3865669, "replies_charged": false}
