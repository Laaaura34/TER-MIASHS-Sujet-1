It's all I think about the moment I wake up and before I cry myself to sleep. I'm extremely unsatisfied with my life. I can't even picture myself in the future. Every day is a struggle; I'm so sick of online classes; I hate having to continue pursuing my degree when I know damn well I've lost my passion for it; I get extremely anxious leaving our house but I also feel very trapped in here, feeling everyone's judgment and gazes; I want to die so bad and I couldn't care less about anyone else's opinion on my choice, but the thought of my mom going crazy over my death, and the people around us gossiping behind her back and mocking her scares me. I love her, but I also have so much hate for her, yet I cannot bear the thought of her going through a cycle of guilt and shame and pain. \n\nI'm so fucking tired.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p5e5yv/im_so_desperate_to_die_but_id_never_do_it/", "title": "I'm so desperate to die, but I'd never do it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ako-na-na-naman", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629113276, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/p5e5yv/im_so_desperate_to_die_but_id_never_do_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429067.890077, "replies_charged": false}
