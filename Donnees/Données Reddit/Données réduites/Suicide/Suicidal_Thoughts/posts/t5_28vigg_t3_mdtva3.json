What's the point of even being alive if it only gets worse and worse. Nobody will ever love me , my own parents didn't even love me. Everyone just leaves and abandons me. The future seems bleak and painful and like it'll be the same shit. The same depressing lonely road that I've walked my whole life. Everyone else got a childhood and got to be happy , I didn't even get that. Everything sucks. Literally everything. I hate being here. I just want to be loved. What did I do wrong that it always has to hurt like this. I don't wanna be here anymore. What's the easiest way to kill yourself? I need to make a plan. I've had enough of this shit. I fought for 4 years because \"It gEtS bEtTeR\".
