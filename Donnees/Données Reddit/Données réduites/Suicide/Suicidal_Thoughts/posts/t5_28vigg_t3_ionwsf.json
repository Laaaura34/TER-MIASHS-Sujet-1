When I wasn\u2019t work bombed by my job. It\u2019s like love bombing, only furloughing and let going. It\u2019s been back to the job market for me, and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just scarier now knowing there\u2019s no backup. No money coming in. Rent is passed due along with other bills. There\u2019s no food, but the dog has food and that\u2019s what I care about. The other night a friend was nice enough to get me some weed when we hung out. It\u2019s a relaxer for me. Calms down my anxiety about life. About finding a new job and never getting that guy you liked. All in a happy mood because I just smoked a bowl. \n\nI\u2019m in a happy flow. I\u2019m feeling the vibe of the YouTube video I\u2019m watching. I\u2019m writing down an idea I had from a previous picture I just looked at while watching this video. I start writing it down. There\u2019s noise down below my Studio. I can\u2019t find my pen. There\u2019s movement up the steps, someone walking with a dog, I hear the sniffing. There a bark from the other side of the door. My dog barks and I call him over, he doesn\u2019t come over. I call him over again and he comes over, but doesn\u2019t stop barking. I call my dog up and he sits. He and I have a moment. I don\u2019t look good, but I love my dog and I take this opportunity as a photo op with him. He\u2019s showing a lot of attention to me for once. I decide to take a video and tell him how much I love him which turns into how much I failed him. Which turned into how much I failed my mother. That got me back to thinking a lot. Which leads me back to being penniless and jobless. Which led me to looking up easy ways to kill yourself, from where I passed the prevention hotline number and when straight to Wikipedia which I proceed to scroll down. Then my phone dies.\n\nI took out pictures of my mother and had an emotional breakdown. The biggest one I\u2019ve ever had, while people are moving in upstairs. I didn\u2019t show shame. I cried. \n\nGuess tomorrow is another day... to live.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ionwsf/covid_depression/", "title": "Covid Depression", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "HarleyWGolightly", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1599542924, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/ionwsf/covid_depression/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428854.1013348, "replies_charged": false}
