I live in london, 20M and have had type 1 diabetes for 3yrs as well as gastritis,ibs,acid reflux,candida and esophagitis. None of those conditions made me feel suicidal at all. I managed to take 2yrs of university and really focus on my health. I managed to cure all my gut problems however I have a ton of physical issues that I really want to commit suicide. I literally thought I could start university not having to worry about my health but here we go with these problems. I've jammed four fingers that hurt,have a bunch of tendonitis,carpal tunnel in both hands and thoracic outlet syndrome and small fiber neuropathy. I can't do normal activities without being in pain. My family dont understand and I feel hopeless. I really don't know what to do. Getting all the tests to diagnose me will take so long. If anyone can speak to me over the phone I'd very much appreciate it. I dont want to have surgery to fix all these problems.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/n16sfg/i_need_help/", "title": "I need help", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Silver-Fullbuster", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619709911, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/n16sfg/i_need_help/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429578.46313, "replies_charged": false}
