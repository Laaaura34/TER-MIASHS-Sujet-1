I can\u2019t do anything right, I can\u2019t even do simple tasks anymore, I have to fake being happy cause honestly I don\u2019t want to bother anyone. I just want to disappear, but I know it will hurt my family so much so I just keep hurting in silence at 3am alone in my room cause honestly what else can I do. Nothing motivates me, I have so much unresolved issues from my childhood all the way through my teen years and even now. I wish I could say sorry to myself for how badly I treat myself, I wish I could say sorry to that 6 year old. I was loud, obnoxious, happy little boy and I grew up with people always calling me annoying that now I hate to hear my mom say \u201cwhat happened to my little boy who was a leader\u201d well now I just like to stay in the backround. I wish I could protect him from being assaulted so young and growing up thinking it was something that happened to all boys. I just want to disappear I feel like a disappointment, everything I do is shit I just feel like complete fucking shit I just want to disappear so badly, but sadly I can\u2019t go not yet I don\u2019t want to pain my family.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/n59mpa/idk/", "title": "Idk", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mikerinas", "subreddit": "Suicidal_Thoughts", "subreddit_path": "r/Suicidal_Thoughts/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1620197518, "permalink": "/r/Suicidal_Thoughts/comments/n59mpa/idk/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635429276.354083, "replies_charged": false}
