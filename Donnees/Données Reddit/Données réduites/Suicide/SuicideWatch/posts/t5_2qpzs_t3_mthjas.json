I have bipolar disorder I and I am heavily medicated for it. I don't know if it's the bp or the meds but I haven't experienced \"joy\" or \"fun\" etc. for over a year now. I've gained 70lbs as well. I can't switch meds or I have intense manic/mixed episodes where I destroy what little I have left in my life. I already dropped out of an ivy I worked so hard to get into, lost like every friend I've ever had...Now I'm on SSI in my hometown. \n\nEvery time I look at a ceiling fan I picture my body hanging lifeless from it. I'm miserable. I won't go back to fucking inpatient hell either. I'm addicted to weed because it makes me sort of \u00f6kayish with the abject boredom. Life is no longer worth living. Anhedonia is a fucking nightmare. I would trade anything to not be bipolar -- but magical trades like that don't actually fucking exist. Currently listening to Don't Fear the Reaper over and over while I stare at my ceiling fan and fantasize.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mthjas/life_is_a_bleak_frozen_landscape_all_i_can_feel/", "title": "Life is a bleak frozen landscape.
