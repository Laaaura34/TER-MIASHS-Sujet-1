He died but I escaped pretty much unharmed. This has been seriously haunting me and I know it will haunt me the rest of my life. I feel like suicide is my only option at this point. I don\u2019t really wanna die but I don\u2019t see my life ever getting better and I feel like I owe it to my brother to finish our suicide pact. Therapy and medication don\u2019t help at all. Should I kill myself? I\u2019ve been drinking to work up the courage. Should I just send it?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ahqc8x/i_need_your_approval/", "title": "I need your approval", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Harry_5796", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1547932426, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ahqc8x/i_need_your_approval/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427720.7543714, "replies_charged": false}
