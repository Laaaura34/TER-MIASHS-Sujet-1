There\u2019s a chance that those users were faking it but there\u2019s also a chance that they weren\u2019t.\n\nI look back on my attempts to make them feel better and I realise I most likely didn\u2019t help them at all. I had no idea what to say to them so I just said whatever I could think of. Compliments, good things to appreciate in life, my own experiences feeling sad, anything. As I\u2019m writing this I\u2019m crying because I\u2019m pretty sure those old internet friends are dead now, and I was one of the many reasons why. I didn\u2019t understand, and so I couldn\u2019t help.\n\nI have 2 old vent drawings somewhere in one of my sketchbooks. One is of me crying behind a wall of glass looking into a room filled with corpses.\n\nThe other is of me in a dark room filled with other people. I\u2019m the only one in the spotlight, alive and well. The others are in the dark, suffering or dead.\n\nThose drawings were representations of how I felt. I found myself frantically begging and pleading my friends to live behind my screen but was ultimately powerless to stop them. It seemed to me that I was the only one who could be considered happy, and because of that I couldn\u2019t offer any help at all.\n\nI feel guilty and afraid. What do I do if I make a new friend in real life and I find out they were suicidal? What do I say? I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll make the same mistakes I made back then.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pprkk1/dealing_with_the_guilt/", "title": "Dealing with the guilt", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "UsefulEnthusiasm7651", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631846014, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pprkk1/dealing_with_the_guilt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426178.8987954, "replies_charged": false}
