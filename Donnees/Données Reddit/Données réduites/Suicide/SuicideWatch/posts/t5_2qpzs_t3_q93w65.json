I am always thinking about it and it is exhausting. It has become an obsession. I have taken extreme measures to keep it under control but it is hard to deal with it no matter what. I have non-regurgitative bulimia. In this case I sometimes eat twice or even thrice as many calories as I should in one day and then fast for the next two. Since I felt I was losing control over it I decided to move out on my own to a small house where I had no access to food or money. I've just turned 18, meaning I have it very easy since I still do not earn any money and can stay at home for days at a time. I'm terrified of ingesting more calories than I should and even at the right amount of 2100 calories a day I feel dissatisfied with my measurements. I have a hormonal problem thanks to a chromosomal abnormality I was born with and because of it all the fat goes to my legs, hips, love handles as well as my butt. I am a man. I should not have this type of body and it makes me incredibly uncomfortable if I'm not wearing the right clothes to shape my body in a way I'm okay with. I feel trapped in life and I am considering being institutionalized because I simply do not have the energy to study and carry on with life and at the same time control my eating disorder; both because of the anxiety and depression or dysthymia I present. I do not want to live with this body. And there are no hopes for normality in my life, so If I choose to live I will have to get institutionalized at some point, and if I want to stop having to deal with this---and thereby exhaust my energy---,that will have to be done rather sooner than later. I have tried to throw up after eating but I haven't got to that extreme yet because I don't want to end up with digestive or dental problems. So I did not do it in the end. But I just cannot take it for much longer and of course it is not usual for a man to have an eating disorder and this is not something I love sharing because I just feel so anxious and preoccupied about it. I am a mostly careless individual and so this is not my natural state of affairs. My parents and relatives do not think it is as serious, but that is only because they're not in my mind all the time and because they are afraid to admit their son has this hugely problematic disorder. Perhaps as well because I am at a normal, healthy weight. But all that means is that I try my best not to let myself fall.\nI am tired of this. I like food and I find so much happiness in consuming it. Few things make me as euphoric. I want this to stop but I feel the emptiness of life and the anxiety of the time that passes and which keeps leaving me behind and so I eat because I feel pleasure but my biggest dream in life is to be okay with my body and get rid of this problem. The only sure way to do that would be getting INSTITUTIONALIZED at a center or place where they would ration my meals and not allow me to eat more than 1500 calories or so a day. I don't have what's necessary to exercise when it comes to mood. And even back when I used to exercise, (I would walk 4 hours 6 days a week,---around 20km per day---, do light calisthenics and weight lifting) things were not noticeably better. Maybe only a 2kg difference that is barely significative and not fully worth the effort. I cannot run. I feel dead. I like to walk but I cannot do other stuff. At least not right now. Soon I'll have a major surgery (a kidney transplant) and then I will be free to start my life as an adult but I just lament the fact that I will not be entirely free since I must get institutionalized. How will that even work? I want to get married. I want to study. Sure you can study online and that is not too bad, but what about my marriage?  \n\nI know myself and am realistic about my situation. I know I need serious help. I cannot get out of this on my own since the reason for my ED is always there and will never fully go away (it's in my genes and this is my reality.)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q93w65/i_either_do_this_or_the_next_best_option_is_to/", "title": "I either do this or the next best option is to end it.
