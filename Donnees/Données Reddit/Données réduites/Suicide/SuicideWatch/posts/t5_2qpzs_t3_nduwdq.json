I\u2019ve hit this calm where I could do it now if I wanted to, and I really want to, but the guilt of the mess that I\u2019ll leave behind for others holds me back. I feel embarrassed that I\u2019m even thinking of these. It feels like I\u2019m not even trying hard enough at suicide. That my plans are less real, less valid, less concerning because the guilt has power over me to force me to hesitate. That I\u2019m a coward who wants to die, but only talks too much and never does the thing that\u2019s being said.\n\n- Guilt over how my parents will have to spend money on a funeral, or if I fail, hospitalisation charges. What if me doing this pushes them into financial debt?\n\n- Guilt over money spent on me for the new house. My family spent around $3000 for my room specifically for renovations, not yet counting all of the other stuff like flooring and blinds and the ceiling fan. We move in in two weeks. How ungrateful do I have to be to never make it to the new house? They spent money on me, yet I may never sleep in it. \n\n- Guilt over school fees. I\u2019m at the tail end of my first semester of university. My exams are this and next week. If I do it before my exams, that\u2019s another $2500 wasted because of me deciding to be an inconvenience even by not existing. \n\n- Guilt over work. My job exists purely as a means of taking on some of the portfolio that my boss has. She\u2019s the only other person in this department. All of the work she has managed to offload onto me will fall back on her again once I\u2019m gone. \n\n- I\u2019m supposed to be a witness for my best friend\u2019s registration of marriage, because her parents don\u2019t want to come as they hate her boyfriend. She will have to find someone else. I\u2019d ruin a happy event for her by simply ceasing to exist. \n\n- My other best friend is getting married this year too. I\u2019m supposed to be her bridesmaid. I\u2019ll ruin her wedding too because I\u2019d be gone. \n\nIt\u2019s so hard to know with my mind and body that I don\u2019t want to be alive anymore, yet have all of this guilt holding me back and making me feel worse about wanting to end my life to make the pain stop, which all the more makes me want to make it stop hurting. It\u2019s a never ending cycle.\n\nHow do I get the guilt to stop being so overpowering, so that I can finally leave?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nduwdq/guilt/", "title": "Guilt", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ennaxanne", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1621190690, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nduwdq/guilt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426189.7875628, "replies_charged": false}
