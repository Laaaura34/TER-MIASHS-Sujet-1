Since then he hasn\u2019t been able to assimilate into society. He is an asshole, very narcissistic, very immature, doesn\u2019t take responsibility, and is constantly starting problems. Because of this he hasn\u2019t been able to make friends and I don\u2019t like to bring him around my friends. He hadn\u2019t been exhibiting suicidal behaviors again until recently. These include asking for money and other things and then becoming very upset when he doesn\u2019t receive them. He also is refusing to get any sort of counseling. I want to know if anyone has any experience with this and if someone can tell me what i can do to help. I don\u2019t frequent this subreddit so let me know if theres a better place for this. Im extremely worried about him as he\u2019s living on his own now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ptdlcf/help_with_suicidal_brother/", "title": "Help with Suicidal Brother", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "HumanMeeting94", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632334805, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ptdlcf/help_with_suicidal_brother/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425245.229487, "replies_charged": false}
