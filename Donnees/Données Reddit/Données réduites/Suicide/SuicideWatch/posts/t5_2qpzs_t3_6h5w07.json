It's affected my self-esteem my entire life. I am not comfortable in my body like a lot of other girls, who can just wear whatever they want. I don't even compare to them. I watch them from the sidelines and am in awe of how they can move so freely in the world. I have always had an inhibited and restrained personality and a major fear of risk-taking, and I feel it stems from this disease. I am so desperate for affection but it's not accessible to me because I am too withdrawn to let anybody in, not that anybody wants to be with someone who looks like me. I am so tired of being let down by life over and over again. I'm sitting by my computer and trying so hard not to scratch myself until I bleed. It's really fucking hard not to. I have a huge exam coming up and I am completely unprepared since I can't focus on anything but how I look and how lonely I am. I want to just end it all and not have to deal with any of this anymore.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/6h5w07/my_body_is_gross/", "title": "My body is gross", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "badhartburn", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 30, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1497423663, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/6h5w07/my_body_is_gross/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426440.0894213, "replies_charged": false}
