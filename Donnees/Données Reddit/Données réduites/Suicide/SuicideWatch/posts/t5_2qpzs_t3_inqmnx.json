My family is incredibly psychologically abusive and neglectful. My school year is a mess. I've relapsed with my bulimia. I have no adults I can speak to/trust. I have no guidance from anyone. When I try speak to people about how I am feeling they are dismissive and push away my topics for their own. I have tried so hard to find people to talk to. I've phoned suicide hotlines for counselling but I never really stay okay. I am proud of myself for staying away from bad coping mechanisms but I doubt that's going to continue for much longer.\n\nI feel so miserable all the time. I've been going through this nonsense for like 4 years. I am so tired of trying and pushing through everything. I am exhausted from it. I am so drained. I don't want to continue living like this. I can't seem to care about the thought that oneday things will get better, because I know the next year or so are going to be awful. I just really don't have the strength to do this anymore.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/inqmnx/everything_is_going_down_hill/", "title": "Everything is going down hill", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ThrowRA_22394", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 22, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1599415137, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/inqmnx/everything_is_going_down_hill/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422933.7577593, "replies_charged": false}
