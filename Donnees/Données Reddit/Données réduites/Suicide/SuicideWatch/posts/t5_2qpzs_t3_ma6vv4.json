I've been consistently depressed for over six years now, suicidal for almost 10 months, literally nothing brings me joy and i simply dont go through with suicide solely because im terrified of surviving, as suicide in my country is very taboo and typically happens extremely rarely, so i do not even wanna think of my life after attempting.  My parents know i have ridiculously high stress yet don't even talk to me about it, despite me trying, i only have one friend who is aware of my situation but there's only so much one friend can do. I spent two whole months fantasizing about dying, always in the same spot of my city with different methods and i thought i would be fine when the imaginations stopped but i somehow just keep becoming all the more tired w/ living, increasingly suicidal and sad. I don't know what to do, i simply do not wish to keep living like this but the only other ways out are antidepressants which i would never be able to get my hands on or killing myself which im too much of a pussy to go through with anyways.. I just wish life got easier, but it really doesn't and it's driving me insane", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ma6vv4/i_cant_keep_going/", "title": "i cant keep going", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwaway54755", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616362854, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ma6vv4/i_cant_keep_going/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428456.5429556, "replies_charged": false}
