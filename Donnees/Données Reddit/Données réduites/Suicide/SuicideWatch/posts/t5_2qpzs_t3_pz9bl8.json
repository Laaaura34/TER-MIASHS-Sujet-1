It's jarring to compare how people treated me at school/my family at home from then to now. While everyone already looked at me or talked to me with a sense of pity, I feel that it's been amplified ten-fold Everyone feels obligated to talk to me, usually on the topic of my mental health. It's as if talking to me was like walking on eggshells. Like one wrong word/phrasing of a sentence would have me hanging from a tree the next day. I'd rather they ignore me completely much like they did ages ago. It's pathetic that I have to have an illness for people to pay attention to me and validate me. I could've used that years ago and now as a result I'm an asocial, pretentious asshole. I don't even feel like a person anymore. I would be better off dead if my life is going to continue on like this because the experience would be exactly the same. At least when I'm dead I wouldn't be aware of my pitiful existence.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pz9bl8/mental_illness_is_so_dehumanising/", "title": "mental illness is so dehumanising", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "h0tsingleiny0urarea", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633098982, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pz9bl8/mental_illness_is_so_dehumanising/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423151.4821482, "replies_charged": false}
