I *really* don\u2019t want to go back to my lowest point. I already got used to faking happiness, my usual coping mechanism, but that hasn\u2019t been helping in this case. \n\nFuck man why couldn\u2019t I just be a normal kid and not this uninteresting socially inept piece of shit. I feel like I\u2019m way too young to be having these thoughts interfere with my life (or lack thereof). Maybe because I\u2019m 14 I\u2019m too idiotic to make the correct decisions to help myself. I\u2019ve never told anyone I know about my depression and I don\u2019t think I will any time soon. Hopefully this is only seasonal depression. I just hope I can get my self together soon.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jfwhuw/does_anyone_else_not_have_insomnia_but_still_stay/", "title": "Does anyone else not have insomnia, but still stay up on your phones to distract yourself from the suicidal thoughts?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Seno_", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1603359216, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jfwhuw/does_anyone_else_not_have_insomnia_but_still_stay/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426530.5274296, "replies_charged": false}
