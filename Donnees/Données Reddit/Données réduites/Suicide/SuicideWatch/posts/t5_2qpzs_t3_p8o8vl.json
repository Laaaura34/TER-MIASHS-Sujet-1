I don't want to burden them. \n\nThey have jobs, family, loved ones and things to do. Me telling them my problem felt like a shitty thing to do. \n\nAnd what else they can do? Tell me not to kill myself? I don't want to hear that. \n\nFuthermore how awkward would it be when I met them in the future? \n\n\"hey dude, nice knowing you don't kill urself yet, keep it going buddy.\" \n\nAnd what if after I told them, I ended up killing myself anyway? Would that hurt them so much more? \n\nI rather when the news hit them, they will be more like \"oh!\" than \"I should have done better\" \n\nI don't want them to felt this unnecessary guilt \n\nI don't know.. Its a burden that I don't anyone else to bear.
