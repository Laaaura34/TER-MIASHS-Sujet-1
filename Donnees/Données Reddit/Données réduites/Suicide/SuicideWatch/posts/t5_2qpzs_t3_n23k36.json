layer of shit piled on top of the rest, wrapping around my heart, where it stays forever. releasing its toxins into me. impeding my ability to think. taking away any semblance of feeling that was left. i can get so badly hurt and i still don't have the motivation to kill myself or even go outside. i'm just stuck in honey. unable to move or progress, i give in to the comfort of staying completely stagnant. each day is indistinguishable from the last; it's a meaningless, repetitive cycle. my brain tells me so many horrible, awful things. it just bombards me with problem after problem till i give in again and overthink it. then i'm stressed out for the rest of the day, because of course it never feels resolved. i can't even think. i don't have any new ideas. i've gotten less mature since i was 17. less creative, more boring, more generic, more obnoxious, more childish, more mean, less ambitious, less fun, less funny, less talented, less empathetic, less patient. and i thought i was miserable then. who the fuck am i. i don't even feel sad, i just feel empty. i used to be all sad and emotional when i was like 15. what i'd give to go back and kill myself back then, tears running down my cheeks, full of melancholy. bittersweet. now it's not even bitter. it's just boring. i don't especially care if i kill myself or not. and i'm not motivated to get better either. i just sit here on the edge of this cliff, waiting for someone to nudge me off. but i'm so stuck that nothing even hurts enough to motivate me. i want to feel again. i got banned out of a discord server i'd been in for months, for no reason. basically my entire social life, gone. my daily cycle i've grown so comfortable with is deeply disrupted. but even that wasn't enough of a nudge to even get me to go outside and take in the night's atmosphere, much less make it to home depot. i'm that stuck. i couldn't even let the sadness sink in for a while. it was there, then it quickly left. i had about 20 minutes to feel some mild sadness again. that should've fucking been what broke me. nothing hurts like it should anymore. all i could muster was this miserable wall of text you're reading now. i want something to hurt. i want something to cut deep, and let the insides of my heart pour out crying again. but my mind has built up a shield from me, to protect me from everything but itself. my mind and its stress get full access to me. 24/7. even my dreams aren't safe anymore. i don't get a fucking break. the only thing motivating me to kill myself anymore is how miserable and uneventful everything is. how my life has become a collection of stress. but it's not enough to get me to go out and do it, so i just sit here stewing. my feelings and i go nowhere. barely existing. fading away. i'm becoming a ball of anger and tension. it takes nothing to set me off. i yell at people so much it's probably abusive. and i sit here on my ass doing nothing for anyone. my existence contributes nothing but the negativity i bring into people's lives. including my own. i'm a beacon of misery and i won't shut up. i hope something drives me to kill myself sooner than later. i resist everyone's good advice. i don't even like the thought of a happy, successful future, or the peaceful life i actually wanted for myself. nothing sounds appealing. why bother helping someone so unwilling to change or do any better for himself. i don't look to the future. i get stuck in wishing the past was different. wishing my parents were normal. wishing i had had a secure home. wishing i had irl friends. wishing i'd been born female. oh yeah there's that too. i know i'm on reddit so everyone will tell me that i really am a girl and all my depression will magically disappear if i transition, but i really doubt it. i was so sure i was trans before. for six months i was just completely fixated on that thought. that i was a real girl, waiting to be brought to the surface. i've had dysphoria all my life, i don't doubt that. i remember being like 7 years old and being so jealous that the girls in my dance class had gotten their own, different training. it got to me so bad that i stopped taking dance seriously after years of training. i didn't know what i was feeling back then, or the countless other times that type of feeling came up, but it's so crystal clear now. i yearned to be a girl. and transitioning offered me such an ideal answer. i *am* a girl. i always *have been*. but therein lies the problem. i'm not a girl. i'm a boy who wishes he was a girl. my personality is irreversibly a boy's personality. i'm not even masculine, i'm just clearly a boy. it's so frustrating. it kills me. every little detail, the way i walk, my tone of voice, my choices, my entire way of thinking, it's all unmistakably male. my symptoms of depression even, they're all in line with the male symptoms, and not in line with the female ones. it hurts. it hurts so, so bad. i came out to my mom and i thought i was gonna be so happy. but in her efforts to accept me as a girl, she systematically found everything i'd overlooked, every reason i was *not* a girl. she couldn't talk to me like a girl, or treat me as her daughter. i wasn't living up to it at all. and i didn't seem to be on my way to adjusting either. and realistically, i'm the type who would've ended up putting in zero effort besides taking the estrogen, disregarding everything else and probably ending up looking hideous. i at least look okay enough that i don't turn attention to myself as it is now. and at least i'm not living full-time as a fraud, spending every moment trying to get\nas close to becoming something i'll never truly be. i don't know who the fuck i am anymore. i don't know what personality to put on to be my genuine self anymore. absolutely everything feels like a mask. even when i'm away from other ppl, lying in my bed with my thoughts. nothing is real anymore. i'm not real. the real me doesn't exist anymore. i faded into obscurity, and no one noticed. and not even i could manage to care.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n23k36/so_so_stuck_wall_of_text_deluxe/", "title":
