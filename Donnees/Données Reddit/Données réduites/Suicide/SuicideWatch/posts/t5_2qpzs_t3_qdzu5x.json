I've been in a depressive episode for a while so I'm really behind with work so much so I've fucked it up for everyone, boss yelled at me just now because of it. \n\nMy mom is resigning from her job because her boss forced her to and now she has a month left with that company before i become the primary breadwinner. My dad didnt care when I told him I'm stressed out about this (parents live separately) so now I feel shitty that i fucked up at work and i just cant bear with handling my narcissistic mother any longer.\n\nI think i'll be making arrangements soon on who gets what in terms of my stuff. I'll be writing my will tonight just in case.\n\nI'm exhausted like crazy, i dont care about anything anymore", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qdzu5x/overwhelmed_with_everything_i_just_want_to_kill/", "title": "Overwhelmed with everything, I just want to kill myself now, I can't bear it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Empress_Garlic_Bae", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634972437, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qdzu5x/overwhelmed_with_everything_i_just_want_to_kill/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425329.1946094, "replies_charged": false}
