I was heart broken that nobody wanted to be with me in my darkest moments, they would always say that they had something else going on at the time soI tried so hard not to push my own emotions, insecurities, and baggage on them after all they only just started to reply to me. I was convinced that no one in my life felt like i was worth it to them. I had set a date for my suicide the next year and said that if I had felt the same after a year i wouldn't be worth recovering. Now I had gotten better but it just so happened that something similar reoccurred around the same time of my scheduled \"event\" i sent only 3 of my friends thank you messages and I sent my best friend my suicide note on her email (cause I know she only ever checks her emails once a month).\n\nI had but only attempted and chickened out to be met with guilt and disappointment and fear. To my surprise my bff left a number of calls and messages asking me to live and i only grew weaker nd more guilty realising she read it earlier than i expected. I feel like an imposter for not actually being able to go through with the act... Should i even take thid seriously?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nrl1n4/i_feel_guilt_for_failing_my_suicide_attempt_but/", "title": "I feel guilt for failing my suicide attempt but also a fake cause i chickened out", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Clementine_times", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622746790, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nrl1n4/i_feel_guilt_for_failing_my_suicide_attempt_but/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426193.1381848, "replies_charged": false}
