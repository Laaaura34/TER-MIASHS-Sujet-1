It's not a convenient time for everyone else. \n\nI have everything to live for. I want to be happy.\n\nI'm fucking exhausted. I have 2 young kids. No family in the area. My husband and I haven't been doing well in general. We do not go on dates, we have on average an hour together exclusively per day. Sometimes not even that. I cant remember the last time I wasn't drunk during sex. Which is also rare. \n\nHusband is away this week for work. I've reached out to every friend I have. Everyone is flaking. Tried for playdate, hangout dates, anything. Nothing. I've started doing a NA program that takes up my weekends. For 3 weekends, and for 3 weekends more I am essentially an unpaid caretaker. Someone died this last weekend. That doesnt even bother me. It's the constant demand. Every angle. Demand at home, demand out of the house. Its endless. I just want to rest.\n\nI need to lose weight, I have to watch the budget,\nI dont look like I used to look. I get frustrated with my kids, then I feel bad. Even now my 3 year old is screaming at me because I opened the cheese packet for the mac and cheese I'm making. He didnt want me to for some reason. Mac and cheese is all I have motivation to make right now. I went off my meds for the first time in years.....intrusive images and heart palpitations are back. And I dont know if its withdrawls....\n\n I want attention. I want someone to be on my side. It's just not going to happen.\n\n I'm not going to kill myself. But I think about it right now.
