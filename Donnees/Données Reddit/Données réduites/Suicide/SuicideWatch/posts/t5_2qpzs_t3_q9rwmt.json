I'm sure I've been depressed for way before then. Either way, now my depression has escalated to the point where I have: \n \n1) Constant, unending suicidal ideation \n \n2) Irritability, where I might lash out at other people, and feel guilty about it afterwards\n  \nMy self-esteem is completely atrophied, and my mood is unstable. I hate myself. I hate living like this. I hate being dead-weight to the people around me. I hate self-isolating myself from everyone. I have not self-harmed yet, nor do I plan on actually commiting suicide, but the urge to die is still there.\n \nI want to get better, and I know that I just have to wait a week until I meet a psychiatrist, but that feels like such a long time.\n \nI'm not sure why I decided to make this post. I've vented to so many people, but it's just a temporary relief. I'm sure that this post isn't going to be any different. To be honest, at this point I'm just reaching for straws. I'm desperate for any little thing to keep me off the edge. The urge to die is just so, so tempting.\n \nI just hope I last long enough.\n \nThat's all I have to say, I guess.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9rwmt/one_more_week_until_i_meet_a_psychiatrist/", "title": "One more week until I meet a psychiatrist", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "paralebih", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634445771, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9rwmt/one_more_week_until_i_meet_a_psychiatrist/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427649.2740417, "replies_charged": false}
