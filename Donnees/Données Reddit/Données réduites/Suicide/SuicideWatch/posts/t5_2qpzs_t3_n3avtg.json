For example, you eat food and drink water to prevent yourself from suffering from dehydration/starvation. You go to school to get a job in the future in order to not end up homeless on the street eating scraps all day. You talk to friends to temporarily alleviate yourself of boredom. I could give *plenty* of other examples of how this is true, but I\u2019m honestly too lazy right now. If I killed myself it would guarantee that I will not suffer ever again (unless there is an afterlife, but the whole concept of an afterlife is simply just a manmade idea that\u2019s supposed to give life a \u201cpurpose\u201d), so why shouldn\u2019t I kill myself? Existence is pointless and full of suffering, and not to mention, for some people it DOES NOT get better...
