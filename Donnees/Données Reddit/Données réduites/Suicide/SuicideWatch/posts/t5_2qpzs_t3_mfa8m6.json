So a bit of context to my situation...\n\nI had found my soul mate. The love of my life. Let's call her Mel. I met her through my wrestling coach. They worked together, and she actually asked him for my number. We started dating, then became exclusive. However we lived about an hour and a half away from each other. She lived In the city where I went to train for wrestling. We spent the first year or so seeing eachother on weekends, or when we would take holidays together. It was going great. We were in an unbelievable amount of love. So eventually, I took the plunge and decided to move to where she lived. Not just for her, but because it would mean I could train for wrestling 4 times a week. \n\nI got a house, originally by myself, as we had an adult discussion, and both decided that moving in together was a bit too soon. But, you know how it goes, first they start sleeping over one or two nights a week. Then she started leaving some of her things there as it's easier. Before we knew it, she had moved in, and I was so happy. We were so happy.  Eventually, the pandemic hit, and we found ourselves at home, with each other 24/7. And it was great first off. But it started taking its toll. And I fully admit, I took my eye off the ball, and I began to neglect her. \n\nAnyway, for the last 6 months, we became distant. She was having financial issues due to losing her job because of COVID. And long story short, she made the decision that she would move out of our home, and back in with her dad. But we would still be together. However, I was unable to afford the house by myself, so it meant I also had to move out. But where? Enter my wrestling coach. Let's call him Bob...\n\nHe owned his own house, and rented out rooms. He offered me a room there, just until I could get back on my feet. Keep in mind, Bob used to work with Mel before I met her, and they had stayed close. \n\nSo during this time, I had gotten Temporary work about an hour away. So we had come to the decision that I would just pay to store my stuff there, and then come back on any time off. Jump to this week...\n\nI came back to the house unannounced, and my life changed forever. I noticed that a package with Mel's name on it in our kitchen. When I went to Bob's bedroom to ask why he had a package for Mel there, I saw her stuff all over his bedroom. Her underwear in his drawers, her slippers, her PJ's, dressing gown. You name it. I of course confronted them.\n\nWithout going on any more, I found out that they have been sleeping together for the past two months. Merely DAYS after we had broken up, she had begun to move her stuff into his house. The house that I was living in. They have completely ruined my life. I've lost my soul mate & best friend, my home, one of my (supposedly) best friends & Wrestling coach, the house I lived in, and also my Wrestling academy. \n\nNow I admit, how I dealt with it was bad. I have Bipolar Disorder, and I react in extreme ways to different things. And Mel knew me better than anyone, and KNEW I would react this way. I took my car, a bottle of Jagermeister, and planned to drive myself into a wall. I feel terrible because I could've put someone else in danger. I know it was wrong.\n\nShe told me that she has always liked him, and they had a \"thing\" before we met. And that the reason she actually got together with me was to \"try and get over Bob\". That absolutely destroyed me. And I now feel like I've wasted the last 3 years of my life.\n\nI genuinely don't see anyway out of this. I've lost everything while they still get to be happy, living in that house. I've never felt pain like this. It hurts just to breathe. I haven't eaten in a week. I haven't gotten out of bed. I can't even look at myself in the mirror because the reason she gave me for us not being intimate for 8 months, was because she didn't find me attractive anymore. At the time she lied to me and said she just didn't feel like. I feel so gross and unlovable.\n\nI've bought a hosepipe and some duct tape. I'm planing to attach it to my exhaust pipe, and go that way. I cannot stop thinking about them being together. About doing the things we used to do. And literally the only thing stopping me from ending my life right now, is the fear of surviving\n\nThanks for reading.
