I\u2019ve never attempted but have been in a psych ward and not allowed to leave for thoughts of it and alcoholism. I keep thinking of trying to hang myself though and I\u2019m scared it will progress to actually doing it. I don\u2019t want to go back to the psych ward though. It was like jail and very expensive and there\u2019s a spike in covid in my area. \n\nI relapsed recently in drinking. I was doing so well and now all I can think about is how sick and miserable I am. A guy I liked told me not to contact him for a week after I quit drinking. I guess he didn\u2019t really like me that much. All I can do it seems like is sit here feeling sorry for myself. I hate it. I don\u2019t know how to snap out of it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/omxdyg/i_want_suicidal_ideation_to_stop/", "title": "I want suicidal ideation to stop", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "No_Average9868", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626636246, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/omxdyg/i_want_suicidal_ideation_to_stop/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427236.543166, "replies_charged": false}
