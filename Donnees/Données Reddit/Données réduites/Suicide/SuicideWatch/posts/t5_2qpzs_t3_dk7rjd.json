She was asleep in bed so I woke her up and she told me she took 5mg of ativan and 4 beers and was just going to sleep all day.  I found a 5 page suicide note detailing her struggle to get into a bulimia program and hoping her death would change the system.  She has been trying for over a year to get into a residential program on Medicare and nobody will take her without like 10k to 30k up front.  I snooped around a little and found all her blankets and pillows in an empty closet with a noose hanging from the door.  She is breathing fine and just sleeping over the pills right now.  I\u2019m probably going to take her to the hospital later but this has happened before and they\u2019ll hold her for a week then let her go and say they can\u2019t help with getting her eating disorder treatment.  I have no idea what to do.  Healthcare is fucked.  I\u2019m in Massachusetts.  I tried to contact Elizabeth Warren directly to no avail.  I am at a loss.  I can be with her until Tuesday to make sure she doesn\u2019t make an attempt but after that I have to go back to work.  I don\u2019t know.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dk7rjd/my_girlfriend_was_going_to_kill_herself_today/", "title": "My girlfriend was going to kill herself today because her healthcare won\u2019t cover eating disorder rehab and I don\u2019t know what to do", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "kstanela", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1571510246, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dk7rjd/my_girlfriend_was_going_to_kill_herself_today/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422954.3406763, "replies_charged": false}
