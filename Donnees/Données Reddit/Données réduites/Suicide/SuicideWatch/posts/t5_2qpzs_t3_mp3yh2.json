Life is monotonous and boring and there's just really no reason to keep going on in this hell of a society. My relationship feels like a joke, I have no relationship with my parents anymore, and I have no way to escape my feelings. Medications haven't worked. I cannot smoke weed because I'm allergic so that's not even an option, and drinking is out of the question because I can't keep it under control. I'm ready to just say screw it and let go.\n\nHowever, my best friend has lost so many people including her own father to suicide that I just feel so guilty whenever I consider taking my own life. I cannot imagine how she would feel if I were able to actually succeed. We have gotten so much closer in the past year or two as well and like she expects me to be there to help her with her wedding in 2023. (Yeah she's got me here until at least 2023 it seems ugh). \n\nI just can't handle feeling the way I do anymore. Everyone leaves it seems, my other best friend recently called it quits because I'm too much for her. This friend won't leave though. Would sure make things easier if she did lol \n\nCrap.
