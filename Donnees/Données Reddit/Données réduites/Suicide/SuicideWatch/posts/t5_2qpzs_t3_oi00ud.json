I feel so terrible almost all the time. My brain has so much fog I can\u2019t think straight anymore and I keep pushing people away . I think about dying very often nothing planned or concrete but the thought is there a lot. So much so that (like I mentioned in a different post) I feel like I\u2019m tied to railroad tracks and the train is coming. I can\u2019t avoid the thoughts very well they just come at will and I can\u2019t stop fixating on the idea. I just want to feel alright at some point it\u2019s exhausting which only makes every thing worse", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oi00ud/thoughts/", "title": "Thoughts", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "fishwithcape", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625988367, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oi00ud/thoughts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428098.0403125, "replies_charged": false}
