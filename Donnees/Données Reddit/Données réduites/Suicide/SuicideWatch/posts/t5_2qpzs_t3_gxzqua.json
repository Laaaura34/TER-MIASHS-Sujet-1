I feel horrible for thinking about suicide because there is other people out there who are in a worse situation than me.  This is a problem I dealt with majority of my life,  I\u2019ve always felt alone (doesn\u2019t matter if I am with family or friends) and always been emotionally distant.  I don\u2019t see the purpose of my existence anyway.  I tried once sometime in November 2018 but it stressed my parents out and haven\u2019t attempted again since m.  I\u2019ve thought of ways to kill myself in the future.  I\u2019m basically waiting for the right time.  \n\nI don\u2019t know why I wrote this.
