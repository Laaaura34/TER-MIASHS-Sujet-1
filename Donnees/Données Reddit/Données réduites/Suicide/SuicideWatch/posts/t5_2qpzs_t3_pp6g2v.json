I never thought when I did this the first time how long I would continue to struggle with this but eight years later and it\u2019s the only way I can shut my brain up and move on with my life for a while. I feel like it\u2019s just the grand buildup to me ultimately shooting myself in the head some day. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m scared of death I just want to experience too much in my lifetime. the only reason I keep pushing is to complete my bucket list. I keep adding to it to give me some inspiration but there are a lot of days where I just don\u2019t even care. sometimes when I\u2019m this bad I just want someone to fight for me but no one is ever going to be in my corner. I have no family anymore, they disowned me. My anxiety has made me feel threatened by my friends when they show compassion to the point where I force myself alone into this mindset.
