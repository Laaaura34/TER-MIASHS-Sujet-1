It's starting to have a negative impact on my life, missing a lot of school, isolating myself more and more, losing hope.\n\nCurrently, I am sitting here, sweating, anxious as fuck, freezing, and also in a lot of pain. I've taken 2g of gabapentin and a bit of Ritalin in order to fight the depression and boredom, the Ritalin keeps me awake but I won't be able to sleep either way - redosing every two hours or so, snorting the stuff.\n\nI'm only 18, I am ruining my life, I feel like my time might be running out, life doesn't feel like it's worth living.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pswugs/relapsed_2_months_ago_my_addiction_has_never_been/", "title": "Relapsed 2 Months Ago & My Addiction Has Never Been Worse", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "StimulatedVindicated", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632273703, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pswugs/relapsed_2_months_ago_my_addiction_has_never_been/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427017.5114272, "replies_charged": false}
