I'm convinced I could never even attempt to do it. \r\n\r\nHowever, I started questioning how healthy even having these thoughts and discussions with myself was after my father killed himself with no warning two months ago; I know I'm at a statistically greater risk now, so I've been wondering if there is a \"tolerable\" amount or frequency of desire to kill oneself (or in my case, more specifically, not really to kill myself but rather to just pop out of existence for a while). \r\n\r\nThoughts?
