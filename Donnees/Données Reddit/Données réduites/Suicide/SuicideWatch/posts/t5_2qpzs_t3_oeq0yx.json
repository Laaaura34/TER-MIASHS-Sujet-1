I choose not to disclose my age because I am paranoid that this might come across someone I know. And let's call my boyfriend M. \n\nM and I have been together for around a little over a year now. The story I'll tell you happened either at the very first month of our relationship or before we were even official. \n\nSo for context. At january 2020 (before I knew M) I went on to omegle to chat with strangers. Specifically sext with them. Admittedly in my mind I always viewd sexting as watching porn. Especially if it's with a stranger, it's like watching a cam show. But everytime I did it I felt awful and guilty afterwards, just like with porn. I only did this two-three times. Here comes M. I liked him a lot, but with covid and whatnot we couldn't meet properly.\n \nAs I'm writing this I'm going through a stressful period in my life, and I wish this memory was the only unpleasant one to arrise. But this is the one that shocked me the most. \n\nAs I lay in my bed, in the middle of a panic attack a few weeks ago my brain suddenly had the thought \"you're a cheater\" and I thought back \"no I'm not! I'd never cheat on M\". And then my brain thought \"Yeah you are, remember the last time you sexted how guilty you felt for M?\". I was mortified. I had completely forgotten about the last time I sexted.\n\nI went on omegle and found a random stranger with whom we sexted. At the time my mind was still thinking of sexting like watching porn. But then something clicked. When I send a breast pic back I realised, what the hell, this is an actual person on the other screen. So I deleted that picture, my account and completely left the sexting game. As I destroyed my account, along with it were destroyed any evidence of WHEN this event took place. After searching I've come to two possible scenarios. It happened in march when we just knew each other or it happened in october (which I doubt it because October was was warmer than March and I was wearing very fuzzy clothes). \n\nNow after this thought came to my head, my brain can't let it go. It's been three weeks since it came back up and my brain is always telling me \"you're a cheater, kill yourself, you hurt M, your family will find out and kick you out of your house, M will publicly humiliate you and your friends are gonna leave you, you'll be homeless and alone as you deserve\". I am going to see a therapist in a month or so, but I don't know if I can hold on till then. I have no friends who I consider friends, just friendly people, so no support system. I worry that if I break up with my bf I'll be completely alone and I'll go back to self harm or I'll kill myself. I can't live with myself. \n\nAnd the think is, say I tell this to bf and he breaks up with me. What if the event did happen in March when we first knew one another? \n\nAt the end of the day, I'm confused and scared, I don't want to be a bad person. I don't. I don't want to feel like if this happened in october I should kill myself as punishment. It just, it feels like I should genuinely physically harm myself if I did this, I can't believe how dissapointed I am in me. To think I'd destroy the best thing that ever happened in my life.
