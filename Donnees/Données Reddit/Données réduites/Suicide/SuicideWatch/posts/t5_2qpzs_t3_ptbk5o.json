Nothing helps, I changed my meds so many times and nothing worked.\nI started to have that type of thoughts every day and even hurted myself.\nI didn't attend the first days of school and I was worried about the eventual problems my parents could get.\nI decided that the best was going to a new psychiatrist ( I just saw her one time and I loved her) but she was different this time.
