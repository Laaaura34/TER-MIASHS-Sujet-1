The disappointment in her face is something I\u2019ve never seen so prevalent on her before. I\u2019ve let her down. I let my mom down. I\u2019m a burden. I was too scared of growing up because of some stupid fucking trauma from highschool that I\u2019ve become a burden well into my 20s. For the first time really in about 2 years I though about ending my life, just taking a rope and giving it up and saving my parents the shame of what a failure I am.\n\nI\u2019m sorry mom, I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pfacil/21_never_had_a_job_dropped_out_of_online_course/", "title": "21, never had a job, dropped out of online course, depressed, failure.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AngelWhite123", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630430257, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pfacil/21_never_had_a_job_dropped_out_of_online_course/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426939.1749556, "replies_charged": false}
