I actively don\u2019t have friends.\n\nSure, some people might be surprised, and even some would probably be sad. \n\nBut nobody would be heartbroken or anything. I don\u2019t know a single person who would care more than a \u201coh damn, that sucks\u201d.\n\nAnd why would they? I don\u2019t have any fucking redeeming qualities. I\u2019m a piece of shit, angry, coward that can barely face his stupid fucking reality.\n\nOnce people see me, they lose most of any \u201cpity\u201d they had. I\u2019m not particularly ugly I don\u2019t think, but I look homeless. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t shower, I shower every day. Clean clothes. But I\u2019m a \u201clow income\u201d white passing dude with long messy hair. \n\nThat might not seem like any reason to be depressed, but godfucking damn does it feel shitty when *most* people actively make a point to avoid you. And I mean everyone. \n\nWhy should I smile\n\nWhy should I wake up.\n\nI\u2019m alone, and I deserve to be.\n\nYou know what? I know a few people that would smile at my death.\n\nDon\u2019t know jack shit that smile because I\u2019m alive. \n\nThe choice seems pretty obvious to me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qa7o4e/i_have_no_reason_to_stay/", "title": "I have no reason to stay.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Drug-Edu-4skools", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634504601, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qa7o4e/i_have_no_reason_to_stay/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423162.9288502, "replies_charged": false}
