I've been passed around and let down time and time again by every medical and health professional I have come across and I am living in constant emotional torment and fairly intense physical pain. Tried every Rx they've given only to become numb to it after 4-6 months. Even after swift dosage increases. \n\nFriends don't exist in my world because I have become \"too much\" for them. My pain depresses others and reminds them of their own shit apparently, to the point where I am avoided and most of the time (despite everyone knowing how bad my mental health is), no one bothers to check in with me. From what I understand that's because they expect such a negative response (as my circumstances from childhood to present day have generally been pretty fucked and though I've not had \"the worst\", I've had it bad relentlessly. It's never stopped). So they anticipate something they won't want to \"deal\" with or discuss, and avoid me as it's politer than telling me they can't or don't want to help me deal with my problems. The endless vicious cycle that I cannot escape. \n\nI mean that literally. I cannot escape at all now. My mind is a prison, a maze of endless PTSD triggers and memories of trauma. I enjoy nothing anymore and rarely take pleasure even from what used to be my favourite hobbies. Medical professionals and \"friends\" (I use the apostrophes because they don't really exist) have let me down entirely as one is relying heavily on the other to provide a level of care for me. Since that other doesn't exist, I simply get left behind. Family isn't a thing for me either. I'm estranged from them because of childhood abuse and trauma. I also live in a shared house with people who are inconsiderate of my poor physical health (nevermind my mental health) and who are ignorant of serious mental health issues entirely. In that house I have one room. Since the lockdown happened in the UK, I have been inside this room,  \"shielding\"/distancing from everyone else in the house. That's the 23rd of March. I have left this place a total of 5 times, now, 4 of which were for emergency doctor's appointments because I have an eating disorder they can't treat (Dr referred me 2x because they rejected me on the basis they couldn't treat me as they only knew how to treat anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, Dr referred me to dietetic consultant who rejected me and said it was a psychological problem rather than a physical one, Dr referred me back to ED specialists, they rejected me again on the same basis despite my weight continuing to drop), have been losing weight for months and months, and were preparing me for being admitted to the hospital indefinitely (during a pandemic, so I guess they really thought it necessary) so they could feed me. Once, in the early weeks of lockdown I went out and took some photos of the empty streets on foot. My muscles have waned and I am so weak now. I'm also hypoglycemic, to add to the list of reasons why this eating issue is fairly serious.\n\nAnyway, you can see I physically can't escape anymore. I have to protect myself from covid. As any news outlet will tell you, you cannot trust strangers to be as careful or thoughtful when it comes to washing their hands, wearing a fucking mask or even keeping socially fucking distant from other people when they go out and see others or do things. My partner (who is trying their best to support me with little to no experience and knowledge on my kind of issues), has been sharing this space with me since then, too, as they couldn't risk going back their parents' house as they were elderly and it's not worth the risk. It's been hard on us both. I can't express myself properly because of how it affects them. And neither of us have anyone else to talk to, so this space becomes small very quickly. I can't get away from this place and now I can't escape my mind. \n\n\nI dissociate and have panic attacks every day, because every day is the same. I have been SCREAMING for help from medical professionals for YEARS, and have been let down, over and over. I've had to explain my trauma over and over to people who spent weeks \"assessing\" me, only to pass me along to another service which kept doing the same. The entire time I have been asking for long term talking therapy. They keep telling me help is coming. Even when I am in crisis, they tell me \"you only have [X time] until your assessment and then hopefully treatment will follow\" as a means to soothe me (shut me up). No one listens to me. I am never included in conversations about my care. Decisions are made for me and not explained in a way I understand (I am on the high-functioning side of the autistic spectrum and I was diagnosed late in life while I was at uni). All the while I am told to hold on, to wait it out, to keep going. Because help is coming. Then someone contacts me and tells me after my assessment that they don't think their service is right for me, and they've referred me to someone else. Another specialist. And there's a waiting list but it's only 4 weeks (compared to the years I've been waiting so far) so it won't be long now. But no one contacts me and I have to chase it (that is, if I have the energy - which I don't). I tell them I'm suicidal. I call their hotlines, call their crisis and support teams. They tell me help is coming, that it's good that I'm seeking help and that help is out there and people do care. They hang up. I go home. I wait. Repeat. I have gone to the ER/A&E when I was suicidal, I have self harmed and told them, I have attempted a few times this year and last. I have told them about my past traumas. I have been honest and torn myself open to give them a glimpse of what I'm trying to cope with. Yet time and time again, they make me repeat it and tell me their service isn't right for me. But I tell them I need therapy, and guidance, and support to figure this all out. They tell me they aren't sure it's right for me and will discuss it with their manager or superior and get back to me. They come back a few days later and explain they don't think its right of them to keep me in their care and think it best to refer me on. I wait again. I tell them I'm still suicidal and still in pain every day, and I'm struggling, so who can I talk to in the meantime? I'm told - don't worry, we will make you an urgent referral and they should get back to you within 2-3 weeks. That time passes. No help in the meantime so I go into crisis somewhat frequently during then. Partner manages to keep me from harming myself, but not at no cost. Our relationship suffers. Things get harder. I call for help again. They tell me they are sorry they haven't been in touch, but my assessment is soon. I tell them I am suicidal and need help now. They tell me to hold on until my assessment or I can go to A&E/ER. Panic rises. Cycle takes bites out of my sanity. Fast forward months and months to present day.\n\nI feel like I just can't do this anymore. It's literal insanity to keep living this way and I am banging my head against a wall because I am DOING EVERYTHING to \"help myself\" and end up nowhere. I have been in touch with free organisations. I have asked doctors, physical and mental health specialists, private and NHS care, occupational health and therapy through employers (don't get me started on the discrimination and abuse I've faced at work, good lord), for help and support and been *honest* about how much I've been struggling and to what degree (even when they asked for some painful details). I have lost employment because of it. Lol, it really is laughable at this point why I am even writing this and considering the possibility that anyone cares and that it will somehow make any difference. \n\nI spent my whole life running from abusers and spent my life's savings trying to survive because of that. So now I have nothing to show for myself and all my life's efforts. I am broken and struggling to make and save enough to live, pay off my small debts, and get myself he necessary tools I'll need to get out of this situation, yet again. By the way, the room I'm confined to also is infested with *bed bugs*, has terrible internet that cuts out every few hours so I can't watch or listen to anything without constant issues, the hot water constantly goes off without warning (including mid shower and the water is ICE cold in the UK), and the room temperature itself is unbearably hot in the summer (it's generally 5-10\u00b0 warmer in my room then it is in the hallway outside the room - no exaggeration) as I am on the top floor of the house (it's an old Victorian house I think). Can't open the windows either as I am extremely arachnophobic, and there are literal spider nests all over the windows and I'm terrified they'll come in. Just have this little tabletop room fan. Gets so hot in here that any \"soft\" food melts within minutes. So it is really not comfortable or great in here and there is very little space to move or breathe. This is where I have ended up after years of just trying to better myself, better my circumstances and do good in the world. \n\nAnd they keep telling me help is coming. But you know, after hearing it for so many years and getting nowhere, I simply don't believe the lie anymore. I see truthfully and wholly that help is not out there for me. No one who is able to help me is willing, and the only person willing isn't able. I am a constant burden on them, and make their lives so much more difficult, and also my mental health problems give them mental health problems. Another vicious cycle. Every service I have encountered has let me down when I've asked for help. The police, the mental health services, physical medical doctors, housing aid, unions, employers.... And I have no one else to rely on in my personal life, as I have been abandoned. I'm too much. Too negative, too heavy, too sad, too \"something\". Whatever fits their narrative at the time. That's the other thing. Most of my issues are classed as \"hidden disabilities\". This often means I don't present physically what my problems are until pushed to very extreme circumstances. So, I often don't \"look\" the part of being someone with disabilities. I don't fit that person's inner narrative of what someone with my disabilities should \"look/seem like\". So I figure that must be a factor in why I don't get taken seriously or get the help I am asking for. \n\nRepeat, repeat, repeat. \n\nIt's literal madness. I cant stand it. I want to escape it. However, the most logical way out of this is the inevitable one, it seems. \n\nI have also done yoga, mediation, CBT, mindfulness, journaling, music, etc. \n\nI am at my wit's end. What's the point in feeding the cycle any further?\n\nSorry to anyone I may have triggered while I spilled my guts here. I really am. I fought and I repeatedly lost, but I tried. Hard. I had so much love to give and so much to live for once. Now the world itself seems like a reflection of what is happening internally - utter and complete chaos and destruction. I can't be here now. I don't belong here. I guess I never belonged anywhere. \n\nI'm done asking for help. It's never answered. Death, however, has been calling for me incessantly. \n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for wasting your time on me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hm6f4z/i_have_asked_demanded_help_for_so_long_everyone/", "title": "I have asked (demanded) help for so long & everyone keeps telling me it's coming, all the while never actually helping me.
