I also watched my mother die in front of me when I was 16. I was prescribed Ambien at 15 and was on that and other drugs for years, and am currently still addicted to Xanax, which I was given by my doctor at 17.\n\nI'm in therapy but my life is just utter hell, I have flashbacks and nightmares, people think I'm crazy, I have poor impulse control, I can't work, I don't have any friends, my entire family besides one grandma, my brother and dad are dead, I literally have nothing to live for and am in constant pain. I'm paranoid about being hurt when I go outside or going to jail or ending up homeless and am a complete slave to Xanax, which I cannot get off of. I tried watching Pete Davidson's videos on BPD, but  I don't feel better.
