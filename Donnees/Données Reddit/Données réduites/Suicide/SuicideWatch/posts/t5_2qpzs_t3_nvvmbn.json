It happens over and over again. I feel broken. I feel unloved and confused. How do you operate when you are so alone? I thought about going to public places (bookstores, malls, parks) just to be around other people. Sometimes it helps, but sometimes it makes it worse to see that there are so many people in the world, and I can't/don't have a connection with any of them. I just wish I could feel held by something or someone. Or just have human interaction. I'm not sure life is worth living if nobody knows you or cares about you.\n\nI fear I'm going to spiral and start cutting myself again. No one would ever find out, after all. Or care. \n\nIf you read this, thank you for the time.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nvvmbn/how_do_i_manage_loneliness_and_suicidal_ideation/", "title": "How do I manage loneliness and suicidal ideation?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Honey_Bunny27", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623244332, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nvvmbn/how_do_i_manage_loneliness_and_suicidal_ideation/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427237.3646762, "replies_charged": false}
