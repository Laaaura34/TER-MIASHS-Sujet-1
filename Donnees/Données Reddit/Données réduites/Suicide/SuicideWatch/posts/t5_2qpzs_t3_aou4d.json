I feel like the solution is simple: \"just do it.\" Yet I'm not. And I'm not sure why if it's all making me so miserable. I'm a freshman in college and I'm not sure how much of this is \"well everybody fucks up a little when they are growing up\" and how much of this is a serious problem.\n\n\n\n* my schoolwork is suffering. I'm not motivated enough to go to class or study material every day. I like school and I like learning and I can't figure out why I can't make myself go to class. I put off schoolwork and then do a sloppy job because I'm in a rush to finish.\n\n* my depression and anxiety are pretty bad, although not the worst they've ever been. But I find myself hating myself and the things I do constantly. I have awful self esteem and I always have and I'm not sure what to do about this either. My doctor increased my medications and I'm a bit better but the problem is still there.\n\n* I'm completely unhappy with my body. I'm not in shape and due to health problems, exercising is really painful, although I can go, but it certainly doesn't help to motivate myself to go to the gym to look better when I know I'm going to be in a lot of pain for a few days.\n\n* I've had a string of bad relationships and I'm not sure what to do about that either. I often feel like I am constantly being put down, and I know that I tend to date people who do this. At this point, I've just decided I can't involve anyone else in my shit show so I need to stay away from dating people for a while, although I would eventually like to have a healthy relationship.\n\n* I'm very unorganized and I can't seem to do simple things like manage money, allot time to spend on hobbies, get all of the things done I say I'm going to do, and manage my time. I often get nothing done because I feel overwhelmed with all of the things I need to do and start a negative thought spiral of having to do things --> feeling overwhelmed --> feeling like I can't handle anything ---> hating myself  --> having a depressive episode and not getting anything done ---> having to do more things, rinse, repeat.\n\nI'm really not sure what to do. I'm pretty sure that not everyone does this their freshman year. I know I need to see a therapist. I don't know why I'm doing this, but I want to stop so I can just stop hating myself all the time. I feel like I'm constantly destroying friendships and relationships because of these negative patterns in my life and I want to stop annoying the shit out of people I love and making people sick of me.\n\nWhat do I do reddit?
