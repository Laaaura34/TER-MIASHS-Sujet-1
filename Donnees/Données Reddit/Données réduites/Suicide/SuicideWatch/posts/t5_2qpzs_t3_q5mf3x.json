I\u2019m curious to know how everyone feels about calling the crisis hotline. The times that I\u2019ve called I felt like it wasn\u2019t helpful. It made me more angry and more willing to do it. It was always something else that stopped me. Like my esa jumping in my lap and showering me with affection. Or my brother/best friend FaceTiming me for hours until I pull out of it. Or my fear of hell and weighing the risk and deciding it\u2019s not worth it(I was raise catholic and though I\u2019m not practicing and actually despise the church all the fear that was instilled in me growing up is deep rooted and doesn\u2019t go away.) \n\nAnyway, never has the hotline actually helped me. I would just hang up on them. One woman was even very cold to me. I haven\u2019t used it since and I don\u2019t think I ever will again. And to add, it\u2019s always so triggering for me when I hear people who \u201cadvocate\u201d for mental health and say things like \u201ccall the hotline.\u201d Immediately I cringe at those people and assume they know nothing about being mentally ill. Which maybe isn\u2019t a fair assumption for me to make. But that\u2019s my default reaction.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q5mf3x/im_new_to_the_sub/", "title": "I\u2019m new to the sub", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ShaolinRoku", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633919948, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q5mf3x/im_new_to_the_sub/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427938.5964792, "replies_charged": false}
