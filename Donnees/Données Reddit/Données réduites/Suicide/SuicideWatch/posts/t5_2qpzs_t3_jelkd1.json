But it seems like my ability to control my actions and thoughts are lessening by the minute. At this rate I will be gone in a few days. And since I can\u2019t tell anyone about this, I need my last words to be out there somewhere.\n\nHello, my name isn\u2019t important. Neither is my age, nationality, occupation or past traumas.\n\nI have major depression, anxiety, bpd (crippling dissociation anyone? ) and bulimia nervosa. I have been actively struggling with these for the last 6 years. I have been hospitalized due to complications of bulimia numerous times, institutionalized 3 times and underwent ECT treatment in each of them. I also tried dozens (yes literally) of medications and therapy.\n\nNone of them worked.\n\nBefore you say \u201cmaybe you should change your therapist\u201d, I\u2019d like to inform you that I did. In total of 12 times. Among those therapists, two of them told me they couldn\u2019t/didn\u2019t know how to help me. One of which was a professor.\n\nI\u2019m newly married, I have the best husband I can ever hope for, two spoiled dogs, a car, a house , you name it. But my brain won\u2019t let me live.. I can\u2019t even work. And as much as I feel guilty about everything I have and still feeling this way, I have come to the conclusion that I have tried everything to save myself- even if it\u2019s for the sake of my loved ones and not my own- and it simply didn\u2019t work. I have recieved the most radical treatment that modern medicine can offer -I let them electrocute my brain for god\u2019s sake- and it still didn\u2019t work.\n\nI\u2019m coming to terms with the fact that this is it for me. It\u2019s sad really. I had so much more to do, see, feel. I\u2019m genuinely sad that I can\u2019t live anymore. Then again, it\u2019s the most merciful thing I can do for myself, the best self care for me and my situation in my opinion.\n\nNo one believes me when I say I did everything I could, that I really tried my hardest. \n\nI hope you do. \n\nThank you for reading this.
