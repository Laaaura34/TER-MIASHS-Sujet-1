I've started working out more often and I feel great for a little while.. but, after about 30 minutes the come down just hits like a ton of bricks.\n\nI either find I feel down.. or not much at all.. There are times of happiness and stuff but, in general I have just felt down and over the last days thinking about suicide a bit more frequently lately..\n\nI really know what \"needs\" to be done in terms of getting a job and getting back on vyvanse but, at the same time I am afraid that even with medication I'll be unable to make the grades I want since jobs never go the way they are suppose to..
