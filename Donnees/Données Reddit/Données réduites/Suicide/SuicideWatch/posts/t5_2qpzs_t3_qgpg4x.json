Till about 5 months ago she told me about her attempts and how she still tries to end it. ive tried everything i could to get her to stop. A month or so ago i genuinely thought i lost her for almost 2 hours. Till she messaged me back she couldnt swallow the pills properly. ive tried everything i could, i tell her i love her every single day and night, i tell her how much she means to me and everybody, i tell her everyday that shes the most beautiful person ive ever met. The reason *i think* she keeps trying is, she has depression, shes been diagnosed and has a depressing past. (sexual harrassment, domestic abuse, horrible parents, physical and mental abuse) during the attempt i mentioned earlier, while i was panicking i called her friends who live next to her, i had no other choice i didnt know what to do. Now she doesnt wanna tell me anything because she thinks im going to tell them.\nI dont know ive tried everything.\nI cant visit her because i live in a dif country and im an immigrant and my home country's passport cant pass the US borders.\nNobody knows about this. Not even my closest friends, nobody.\ni feel useless and that if she does go, idk what ill do with myself shes the only thing keeping me going.\n\nive come here for advice", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qgpg4x/my_long_distance_so_is_suicidal/", "title": "My long distance S/O is suicidal", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "worstlifepossible", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635312671, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qgpg4x/my_long_distance_so_is_suicidal/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428302.3459098, "replies_charged": false}
