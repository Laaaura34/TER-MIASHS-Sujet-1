Everyone I have ever known sees me as a complete failure. I am nothing and wont ever be anything.   \n\nMy \"goal\" now is to find a work from home job and then try to stay busy (also from home) for the next 60+ years. Nothing to aim for, no purpose. Unloveable. I don't even have the energy to hate myself anymore. I'm a pathetic piece of shit. \n\nWhy not just quit life too?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pfencx/i_quit_my_job_doctor_so_now_i_am_left_with_being/", "title": "I quit my job (doctor) so now I am left with being a failure and no goals", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "0909121212", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630443264, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pfencx/i_quit_my_job_doctor_so_now_i_am_left_with_being/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426937.0249245, "replies_charged": false}
