I\u2019ve struggled with pretty severe anxiety my whole life and I\u2019ve been having increased panic attacks and rumination and it\u2019s affecting my relationship with my girlfriend and my family. I go back to college in a few days and the change of pace is scaring me because of how depressed I was the first semester of last year. I made really good friends and they\u2019re excited to see me again, and even though I am largely ready to be with them again, I can\u2019t shake the feeling that something will go wrong in the future and I\u2019ll be left with nothing. I don\u2019t even know why, I should just be happy. I\u2019ve even been going to the gym the past two weeks to try and stave off feelings of worthlessness and I\u2019m happy with how I feel after these workouts. But that\u2019s basically it. I can\u2019t focus on creative outlets I used to enjoy because I keep thinking of shitty things I\u2019ve done or things I might have done to hurt people. It all makes me sick. My girlfriend doesn\u2019t really know how to help, and I know she\u2019s trying her best and I love her so much for that. She\u2019s dealing with her own challenges physically, we are pretty sure it\u2019s MS but we\u2019ll find out for sure soon. My younger sister has depression and was admitted to a facility in April, she was released and is now medicated but it made me realize something about myself. I\u2019m scared of not being caring enough to the people I love. I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m typing this, I\u2019m just tired of feeling insane and sad all the time. I know I put too much blame on myself, but I don\u2019t know how to stop it. I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been having these thoughts in the first place.
