So there\u2019s no expectation for anyone to reply - though it\u2019d be nice if others could chip in their thoughts or experiences :)\n\nHow I feel when I\u2019m suicidal and how I feel when I\u2019m wanting to self harm are very different:\n\nActively suicidal (vs just \u2018pondering\u2019 it): flighy (in thoughts), derealisation, diminished insight, extreme sensory sensitivity/overload, feeling of \u2018losing\u2019 part of myself, this leads to overwhelming fear and panic, crippling indecision to the point of effective cognitive paralysis.\n\nSelf harm: very focused, clarity, acts are planned, no impulsivity, anticipation and excitement in planning/preparation, an almost \u2018mastery of self\u2019 feeling, feelings of invincibility, meticulous planning, execution and \u2018clear up\u2019 processes, afterwards a calm, soporific serenity.\n\nThe thing that strikes me is the difference in the extremes of feeling in control. Suicide = 0/10, self harm = 10/10. Also, if I\u2019m in one of these \u2018modes\u2019, I don\u2019t think of the other.\n\nSuicidal thoughts can leave me feeling risky, fearful and cognitively paralysed. When self harm occurs, I feel motivated, focused and committed to the act.\n\nSo effectively, if I\u2019m \u2018active\u2019 in self harm, it denotes I\u2019m better psychologically than when feeling suicidal. OK, this might sound obvious, but for me that translates to self harm being an indicator of \u2018coming back\u2019 to myself.\n\nEffectively, my conversations can go as such:\nThoughts of suicide?\n- Yes\nThoughts of self harm?\n- No, in this scenario self harm would be a positive action as it demonstrates a return of autonomy and insight.\n\nDoes this make sense to anyone?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8gc856/self_harm_and_suicide_relationship_between_the/", "title": "Self harm and suicide - relationship between the two or discordant?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Antimarwil", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1525211289, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8gc856/self_harm_and_suicide_relationship_between_the/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426697.3121016, "replies_charged": false}
