I wish I hadn\u2019t hurt us so much.\n\nWe were so full of life, of wonder, I long again for that naive awe. When we could stay up till midnight and catch dreams in the palms of our hands. Counting the stars with our fingertips and watching videos waiting for the birds to wake. \n\nGolden hour and boyhood dreams, waiting for that \u2018lucky\u2019 person. I mourn the moments of sibling rivalry and parently hugs, I mourn our happiness. I mourn our innocence.\n\nI\u2019m sorry I never protected you from him. I\u2019m sorry I let it get this far. I\u2019m sorry that you stifle tears when you are touched. \n\n10 years old. You know you never deserved it, right? You didn't ask for it. You never led him on. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you want to be abused, I\u2019m sorry that the love you know is saturated in manipulation. He was 18 and you were 13, you knew it was not okay and yet you loved him still. But you were a child, how can anyone ask you to be emotionally mature?\n\nI\u2019m sorry that you are lonely, you\u2019ve pushed them away. You regret it, don't you? You seek love in the bite of a blade, and the kiss of a lit flame.\n\nYou want to die and I have caused it. \n\nI am so sorry.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ohdd4k/to_the_child_i_once_was_im_so_sorry_for_what_i/", "title": "To the child I once was, I\u2019m so sorry for what I have done.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mr-mars-bar", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 712, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625897777, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ohdd4k/to_the_child_i_once_was_im_so_sorry_for_what_i/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635426742.1647093, "replies_charged": false}
