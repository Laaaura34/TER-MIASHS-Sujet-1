I exercise, eat well, I don't go to be stressed, and my devices go on night mode during the evening. \n\nFor someone who wants to be an author, this isn't good. I can pump out workouts most days, but writing is harder with a sluggish mind. You can't work as efficiently as you'd like.\n\nSo, I feel if this doesn't improve despite my efforts, I'm going. I'll be writing multiple short stories in the coming month or so. Maybe I'll start a novella or novel. After that, I'll have to see what I can do about leaving. I already have a method in my closet. It's just ridiculous. \n\nIt doesn't exactly bother me. I've been improving, mentally, physically. I've started taking initiative over things, you know. But there's this one thing that's important to me than most other things. And that thing requires a sharp mind. If I don't have that, I can't execute my stories as efficiently as I'd like. \n\nReally, I can't function as properly as I should. The exercise and great diet feels like it's only doing so much. \n\nThis isn't a guarantee, but I am considering suicide if this worsens.
