I have been bulimic for about a year now and it has completely changed me. I feel soulless, nothing brings me joy, I have tried so hard to stop, but I can\u2019t. I am so tired. On top of that I go to medschool, my grades are excellent, but i have put so much pressure on myself to excel, because studying is the only thing that I am good at. I am burning out. I hate myself. Nothing seems to have a point anymore. I keep fighting for my mom. She is so worried about me. I know it would break her if she lost me, but I don\u2019t know how long I can keep holding on to life. Have any of you gotten out of such a point in life? How do you win a fight with your own mind? Please.
