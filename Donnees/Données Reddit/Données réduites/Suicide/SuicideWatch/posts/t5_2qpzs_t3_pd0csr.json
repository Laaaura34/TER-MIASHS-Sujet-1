Don\u2019t forget.\u201d And I call him expecting to be mad at me because usually when he says it like that seriously I usually end up getting in trouble for something, so I call him and he says \u201chey kid\u201d and I say \u201cyes\u201d because I expect to be in trouble as he usually has that attitude with me when I am about to get in trouble, but we end up just talking about how I am currently sick and he says to call him if I need anything and I say \u201calright\u201d then I say \u201cdid you need anything else?\u201d And he says \u201cno, why?\u201d And I say \u201coh nothing I just thought I was in trouble\u201d and he says \u201cwhenever someone tells you to talk to them on the phone you expect to be in trouble?\u201d And I say \u201cno\u201d and he says \u201cdon\u2019t be afraid to speak your mind, why do you expect to be in trouble when you are on the phone!?\u201d In a rude manner, and I say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and he says \u201cwell stop thinking like that think positive!\u201d Then he says \u201cJesus Christ\u201d then hangs up abruptly on me before I could say bye.
