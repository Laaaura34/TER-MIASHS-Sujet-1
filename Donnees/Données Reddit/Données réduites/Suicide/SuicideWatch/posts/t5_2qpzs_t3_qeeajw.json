Tbh I think sometimes when someone is in crisis they don't want to be hugged or touched, they just want someone to sit with them and just show that they care by hanging around them and being empathetic/getting them a drink/holding their hand etc. Often when a close friend or someone you know tells you that they're suicidal, often the other person is silent because they don't know what to say in response", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qeeajw/knowing_other_peoplepeople_i_know_are_feeling/", "title": "Knowing other people/people I know are feeling suicidal makes me feel uncomfortable.
