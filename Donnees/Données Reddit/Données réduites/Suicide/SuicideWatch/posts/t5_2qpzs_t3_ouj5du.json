I know it is wrong and disgusting to think about yourself when someone is in pain and someone's life. But I just couldn't help but think \"Why can't that be me? Why do I get to carry on living and they get to die?\" and the ever so disappointing question of \"Surely killing yourself isn't so hard right?\" to which the answer is always no. \n\nThis is turning me into a bad person and I need to stop. I won't like start being healthy or chasing serotonin or whatever, I'll just try to be more considerate next time. I'll still be suicidal lol", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ouj5du/im_starting_to_get_envious_when_i_hear_about/", "title": "I'm starting to get envious when I hear about people dying/committing suicide successfully", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Ok-Money-597", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 155, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627646041, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ouj5du/im_starting_to_get_envious_when_i_hear_about/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428318.3002496, "replies_charged": false}
