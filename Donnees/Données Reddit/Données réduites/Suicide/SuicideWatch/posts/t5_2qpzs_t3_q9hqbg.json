To get completely shit-faced, cover myself in gasoline, and burn, dancing in the streets. Or maybe burning while sitting down in a permanent self-reflecting pose, like how monks do in protest. I'm an emotional burn victim and every day that I'm here feels like bathing in salt and lemon zest, so burning at the stake would feel like home. Even my maladaptive daydreaming has turned self-violent and I cannot shake fantasizing about fantastical ways to die, like shoving my machete through my abdomen and watching everything leak out, or dissolving myself in a tub of hydrochloric acid. Even as far as designing a method plan in my head for how I could bury myself alive. \n\nIs this normal?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9hqbg/romanticized_violent_suicidal_thoughts/", "title": "Romanticized violent suicidal thoughts", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Mechanical_Turk_", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634409140, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9hqbg/romanticized_violent_suicidal_thoughts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427297.6268063, "replies_charged": false}
