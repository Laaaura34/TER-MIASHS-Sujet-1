Ive always lived my life a year at a time. I feel like this is the right r/ to post it on! I constantly feel like ending it, but i always have a glimmer of hope and wonder if anyone else feels this way. Like ill give it my all but at least i have the control to end it one day. Ive sabotaged myself so many times but ive come on top most of the time. Anyone else feel this way where you're totally ok with ending it all but know that if you try a little harder itll be alright? But you still got that backup plan just in case? But you know itll never happen but the thought keeps you calm?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/g5vpho/5_year_plans_and_possibly_beyond/", "title": "5 year plans and possibly beyond", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "grandmasterg7890", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1587535075, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/g5vpho/5_year_plans_and_possibly_beyond/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427750.1326902, "replies_charged": false}
