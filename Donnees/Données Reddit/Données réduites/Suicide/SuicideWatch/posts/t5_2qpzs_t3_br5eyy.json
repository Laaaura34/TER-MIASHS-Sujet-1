After my girlfriend broke up with me for being depressed two months ago my life has been an absolute hell. I tried to kill myself that night but I was never able to do it because I kept slipping down from the pull up bar I was trying to hand the noose from, that is still my biggest regret in my life because the breakup now looks like it was inevitable because I drive everybody away. I\u2019ve now lost all my friends and everybody I cared about and I really can\u2019t handle it. My girlfriend broke up with me over text and hasn\u2019t spoken a word to me since even though we still have classes together and saw each other multiple times a day at school. With that she drew all my other friends away from me because she\u2019s such a happy and fun person while I\u2019m insufferable and suicidal, she didn\u2019t even do most of it intentionally, people just like her that much and dislike me that much. I\u2019ve tried everything, I\u2019ve talked to the school guidance counselor, I\u2019ve been going to a therapist, I\u2019ve had a million psychiatrist and whatever appointments, I\u2019ve been locked up in a mental hospital, I take medicine now, but none of it has made any difference and I can\u2019t see any of it making any difference at all ever. Everyone says wait and it just takes time and that\u2019s all they say, but it\u2019s only gotten worse. One of my friends who I was talking to about it because they used to cut themselves told me that I shouldn\u2019t have gotten help and even though they were the one that first dragged me to the school guidance counselor, they\u2019ve since ditched me at a concert for my ex and we don\u2019t talk anymore. I\u2019m not allowed to talk to my other friend anymore after we made a suicide pact and likely would have caused another 2-3 people to commit suicide after we were gone. And I just lost my last friend, she was helping me because she has seen a lot and helped a lot of people but she hates me now because I\u2019m non-stop and I haven\u2019t gotten better, she won\u2019t respond now and doesn\u2019t care no matter what I say. I\u2019m not well, I\u2019ve stopped going to school or doing anything, I used to miss a lot of meals but now I do t even really eat at all, maybe one meal a day if I get out of my room. I can\u2019t lock the door to my room so I usually barricade myself in with my dresser but then my parents threaten to call the cops on me. I tried to kill myself again last night but I can\u2019t let anybody know because they\u2019d try and lock me up in a mental hospital again and i\u2019ll kill myself before I let that happen again. The only thing that stopped me this time was that it was starting to get light outside and by the time I finally found where my parents had hidden the rope from me I only had ten minutes to tie up the noose before my parents would be awake, so I put it back and locked myself in my room the entire day. I\u2019ve tried everything, I\u2019ve calmed the suicide hotline and all that, but after hearing that stupid song for ten minutes I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I know I\u2019ve typed a lot and left a lot of pain out but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m just typing this because I want a reason to live so badly, I\u2019ve got a future and I\u2019ve I lived I\u2019d likely be a d1 athlete at an Ivy League school, but I have no friends and no happiness. This hell of mine has only gotten worse and I see no end to the pain. I have no idea what anybody could tell me but please, anything, anything, I just want to stop the pain. I don\u2019t think i\u2019ll fail a third time if I try to kill myself again.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/br5eyy/ive_tried_everything/", "title": "I\u2019ve tried everything", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "swxm13", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1558409337, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/br5eyy/ive_tried_everything/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427718.7120194, "replies_charged": false}
