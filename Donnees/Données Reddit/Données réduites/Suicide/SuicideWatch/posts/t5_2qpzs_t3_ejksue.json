Thank you very much if you read and/or respond.\n\nI've been making serious strides lately, so much so I was actually able to enjoy new years, and even felt optimistic about 2020 - I've been eating better, exercising. I've been really trying to reach out to friends, spend time with family, take care of myself, and so on. I actually felt like -- caring about life, I felt like I was just starting to remember what life was like before I was suicidal, and depressed. I felt like I was on track to start living again, and I feel like it's fucking been ripped away, and I've been stomped in the throat with the weight of the hope I had.\n\nI don't know if this is the right place but I NEED to fucking vent, it's scary how quickly these feelings have resurfaced. It's mortifying. Don't know what to do with myself or how to cope. . . I can't abstain from worrying.\n\nI imagine tensions rising and escalating into war, I see a draft coming, visualize myself being handed a gun and killing myself as soon as it's in my hands. All because the fucking \\*\\*impeached\\*\\* president of the U.S. decided to be trigger happy not even a half-week into the new year!! FUCK!!! I hate the world we live in, the inequality, the suffering and gross injustice, and when I try to enjoy my slice of life I am guilt ridden, why does this pussy who doesn't wanna be drafted get to have so much that others don't? I'm not even that well off generally speaking but there are hard working people out there who work so much fucking harder on a weekly basis than I have in my entire life; they deserve what I have and more. I hate that I have an excuse to kill myself and that I almost welcome it, and infuriates me to think it would be because of circumstances outside my control. Fuck you, fuck me, let me die. If you want me to kill it'll be myself.\n\nIf I go the conscientious objector route I fear that I will be crystallized as a coward in the eyes of everyone who knows me, and I will lose a great deal of respect - I would expect significant social ramifications. So, I could see that driving me to suicide as well.\n\nI'm a fucking loser, honestly, not employed or enrolled in scbool, don't even have a license. I'm not fat but now I want to be. Bone spurs? Nah, I've got dormant and fervent suicidal urges.\n\nI was going to exercise this morning until I heard the news last night, and then I stayed up late stress eating junk food instead. I've been trying to stop doing drugs but decided to break into my stash last night as well(only weed but I can see myself slipping into the worse vices again because of these immensely negative, uncontrollable feelings).\n\nIt's like, I was nearly there. I feel like I got a taste of happiness, contentness, whatever; \\*\\*I had a distinct lack of depression\\*\\* , lately.\n\nNow,  I want to sabotage my own life(which will make me super depressed) that I've been working really hard to fix so I won't get drafted(which would either make me super depressed or guaranteed to commit suicide.)\n\nThis is what the world is like, isn't it? Is it? Am I inhuman to desire a simple life where there is not the need to meddle in other's affair's, undisturbed? That's selfish as fuck, isn't it. \"I wish to experience no conflict, to be utterly neutral and at peace,\" is a selfish notion, I reckon.\n\nWhat the fuck, man.\n\nI was going to write about an ideal life, one I'd wish to be reincarnated in. Maybe as a self sustaining individual, living alone, with a small family or small community. . . but the pessimism is back, and again I wish nothing awaits. Because I feel that even in an ideal life as such, the worst, most repulsive and vile tendrils of humanity will find you, and wring you for all your worth whilst sapping all that brings you meaning.\n\nSometimes I wish I was ignorant to the news.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ejksue/i_cannot_bear_the_thought_of_war_and_i_am_rapidly/", "title": "I cannot bear the thought of War and I am rapidly plunging back into a serious depression", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Grobext2throwaway", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1578081631, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ejksue/i_cannot_bear_the_thought_of_war_and_i_am_rapidly/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426235.4291844, "replies_charged": false}
