I feel seriously out of control with my thoughts, feelings and emotions. No amount of talks or therapy or drinking or exercising is helping remove this persistent, intense sadness inside me, from panic attacks most nights at 2/3am to physical lumps in my throat and walking on a mental tightrope everyday fighting to not break down\n\n\nI feel like my life peaked in my adolescence. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth going on. I genuinely would rather die now riding the happiness from a few years back than continue to fight this losing battle I face every single day.\n\nJust finished leaving my family some money and investments (crypto and shares). Prolly gonna do it tomorrow. \n\nI never post. If this somehow gets linked to me in real life, Mum, I\u2019m so fucking sorry I wasn\u2019t strong enough. I love you so much. Tell Mimi and Frank I love them immensely.\n\nCrystal, I love you. I\u2019m sorry.
