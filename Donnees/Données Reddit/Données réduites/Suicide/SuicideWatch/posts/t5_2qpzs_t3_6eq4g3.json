I grovel when I have to ask for help - yes, my psychologist just called it grovelling - and I want to relieve the burden as well as hurt my psychologist by killing myself.\n\nI found a good location outside, and I have a belt that I can hang myself with.  Going to stay up till my husband is asleep and do it tonight.  \n\nThis is what actual suicidal behavior looks like.  This is someone who is going to follow through.
