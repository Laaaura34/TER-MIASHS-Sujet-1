Throughout this, I've taken many steps in improving my mind set and prospects, but the state if my teeth is really getting me down.\n\n They are at the point where 4 are out or broken and I get regular pain (which I can deal with). The fact that there's seemingly no where to go with this gets me down, it inhibits my future in so many ways that it brings me to tears and I can see no way out. I am also often not sleeping at night.\n\nI haven't told anyone, and I'm a student in the UK and have no funds to sort this. I have made so much progress in all other areas, but this issue alone drives me to a place of hopelessness. I am at a loss as to what to do.\n\nThis issue has been underlying and unaddressed for a long time because of my insecurity regarding it. This is the first time I've even begun to address it and I thank you all for giving me a space to vent.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4o1tcp/suicidal_hopeless_state_of_teeth_is_biggest_hurdle/", "title": "Suicidal, hopeless state of teeth is biggest hurdle", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "taway130", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 17, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1465916673, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4o1tcp/suicidal_hopeless_state_of_teeth_is_biggest_hurdle/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426465.3941512, "replies_charged": false}
