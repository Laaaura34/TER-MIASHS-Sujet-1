I don't ever want to experience another early morning again, being ripped into feeling some kind hapless disoriented misery, and yet the process restarts every time I wake up. I don't want to wake up anymore, I want to die. The only reason I'm even posting this here is because I just don't care no one's going to respond,--- Nor do I even expect that anyone will care anyways. My words don't read like I'm in constant melancholy but each word drains me more and more. I've slowly begun withdrawing worse and worse from everyone else since April, and I know that means I'm getting closer to the end. Every time I want to call out for help I feel more miserable and empty, but I never muster the courage to force up the words. I don't want to live anymore and I really don't think I'm going to make it much longer.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n94950/i_hate_my_life/", "title": "I Hate My Life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "expiredbrogurt", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1620652753, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n94950/i_hate_my_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427503.2922955, "replies_charged": false}
