Currently I have nothing good going for me my hobbies that would get me through the day just don\u2019t satisfy me anymore and every day at school is like hell so I don\u2019t plan on going to college. This leaves me to believe that my life is going to only get worse as I get older and to be honest I think I\u2019ve seen enough of what life has to offer. My point is im not actively trying to kill my self but I wouldn\u2019t be mad if I crashed my car and died on the way home and I\u2019ve been living a bit more risky when driving or something dangerous like that because I kinda hope I\u2019ll die doing it. I\u2019m just lost, confused, and sad with no purpose in this world", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/px9bqv/i_just_dont_see_the_point_of_living_anymore/", "title": "I just don\u2019t see the point of living anymore", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "jdjdjdbdnz", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 37, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632844356, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/px9bqv/i_just_dont_see_the_point_of_living_anymore/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425549.579785, "replies_charged": false}
