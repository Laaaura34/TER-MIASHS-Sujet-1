This week has been one of the worst of my life. I was in an adult football tournament that all my friends said they were so excited to come and watch me play, no one showed up. I had to leave a job I love for a job that\u2019s going to be terrible but makes way more money. My husband is barely speaking to me because of a fight during the football tournament. My car needed new tires to pass inspection. I had to take the cat I\u2019ve had less than two weeks to the emergency vet for lacerations he got from something random in the middle of the night. I applied for a job with the non-profit I\u2019ve been volunteering at for years and didn\u2019t even get an interview, the executive director and fundraising coordinator both told me to use them as references. There\u2019s more. I\u2019m tired, I want to drink all day, or take 10 of my Valium and not wake up for a week. The little furry lives I\u2019m responsible for are keeping me from getting drunk and driving my car into a tree.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pr9gix/i_cant_cope_with_all_of_this_safely_anymore/", "title": "I can\u2019t cope with all of this safely anymore.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "kat-nda-hat", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632063400, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pr9gix/i_cant_cope_with_all_of_this_safely_anymore/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426541.0531592, "replies_charged": false}
