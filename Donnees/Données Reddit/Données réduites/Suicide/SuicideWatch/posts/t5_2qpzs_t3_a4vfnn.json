Friday, I actually feel like a person, but that's only because the week is over. It's fake joy. Saturday - Sunday, I get hopelessly wasted then spend hours in bed recovering, feeling guilty and worthless, regretting being alive. I'm turning into my dad, and he's a terror. I just want this cycle to end, and I only know one way out... Yes, I know I should stop drinking. Those weekends I don't drink, I still spend in bed because of the depression, so it's virtually the same.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/a4vfnn/cycle_of_selfdestruction_tired_of_disappointing/", "title": "Cycle of self-destruction, tired of disappointing those around me", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "QueenDido", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1544446673, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/a4vfnn/cycle_of_selfdestruction_tired_of_disappointing/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422539.9156232, "replies_charged": false}
