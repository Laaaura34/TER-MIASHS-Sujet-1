I am 28(M) and been in suicidal thoughts for the past 12 years. Everytime some difficult situation arises I quickly go to hiding from the world and just hope that I will kill myself so no worries. Now I have wasted the past many years to this and also remained in absolute social isolation with no job and dependent upon my psychopathic and extremely manipulative family. I know if I decide to live,I will have to first find a way of hiding from my family and also do a shit ton of healing work to come to normal functioning. Honestly my soul is tired now. Don't see any point of surviving  in this fucked up world. I am just delaying the inevitable.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pghmmg/i_feel_suicide_is_my_destiny_to_save_my_soul/", "title": "I feel suicide is my destiny to save my soul.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "destinedwarrior998", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 42, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630588375, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pghmmg/i_feel_suicide_is_my_destiny_to_save_my_soul/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425168.4198058, "replies_charged": false}
