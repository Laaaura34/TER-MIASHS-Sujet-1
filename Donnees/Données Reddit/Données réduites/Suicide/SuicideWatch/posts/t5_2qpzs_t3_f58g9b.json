I managed to start up a business, work on my health, made some friends. And now it just feels... like it was all for nothing.\n\nMy best friend of 3 years, who I talk to literally every day, decided to not invite me to their wedding. It\u2019s not a small wedding either, I think its about 80-100 people attending. His reason was that his fiancee feels weird about it because she doesn\u2019t know me and my husband that well. We\u2019ve met her once for a day of sightseeing, which was a nice day and we seemed to get along. Afterwards I tried to initiate more contact with her to get to know her better but she just wasn\u2019t interested.\n\nAnd I guess he, he just didn\u2019t tell her that he wanted me there. Or maybe he doesn\u2019t even want me there himself. I just.. Don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t know what I did wrong. Maybe she doesn\u2019t know me well (not for lack of trying from my side) but she has no reason to dislike me either. \n\nI... I just really thought we were best friends. Maybe the notion of \u2018best friend\u2019 is childish, but close friends at least. He told me many times he cares about me, thinks of me as a good friend etc. Now I wonder if it\u2019s all just lies. \n\nI tried to be part of this world. I rebuild my life from rock bottom and I tried so hard to fit in, to be loved, to matter. But if even someone I talk to every day for 3 years doesn\u2019t want to include me, what am I even doing here?\n\nThere\u2019s distant relatives coming, coworkers etc.. But not me. \n\nHe said he does care, that we can be best friends without all that. But I\u2019ve never heard of a best friend who wasnt invited to a wedding with 100 other people there. It\u2019s not just the wedding, I\u2019m not welcome to visit his house either.\n\nI made a pact with myself to live till 30 and end it then. I\u2019m 26 now, but I don\u2019t know if I can do another 3,5 years. I\u2019m just a nuisance, some random person. Never a true friend. Why burden everyone with my presence for 3 more years?\n\nGot some stuff to take care of first. But then I\u2019ll just leave this world. I don\u2019t see the point. I just wanted to be loved, to be part of something. But I should\u2019ve known that wasn\u2019t in the cards for me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f58g9b/why_do_i_even_bother/", "title": "Why do I even bother", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "darkladysylvanas", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1581944662, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f58g9b/why_do_i_even_bother/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427762.4595678, "replies_charged": false}
