At the moment it feels as if i don't deserve the good things in my life, that I am worse than everyone else and not the person I thought I was.\n\nMy brain keeps fixating on an event from my late teen years I think 17/19 and I\u2019m worried what it means about me and my life and whether or not I'm as good as other people or worthy enough to enjoy life. In a moment of stupidity I shut the door and encouraged the family dog to lick me down there, it didn\u2019t last long a 30 seconds, maybe I don\u2019t know , but the fact I was capable of doing that of thinking for a split second that\u2019s that was ok or even an option mortifies me.\n\nI am terrified it makes me akin to people who abuse, molest and take advantage of the weak and innocent, it makes me feel as though I don\u2019t deserve to my life and how bad I am compared to others in the world rattle around my head.\n\nI hate that I ruined my life story and my conception of myself. That I can never look back fondly on my past self because she was capable of this thing that mortifies me. I cant have any self esteem or a positive image of myself. \\`I'm always thinking that I am the worse person in a room. That I have no morals. That i dont belong.\n\nIn all other regards I was a normal teen. Other than being anxious and a little depressed. its just this weird thing i did which is horrible. I wish with all my being I could take it back I really do. I worry that I\u2019ll never find love because I feel I don\u2019t deserve it, and I worry I will never be able to enjoy sex because any time I do anything enjoyable that is related to sex by myself or with a partner I am reminded of my worst action it plays constantly in my head and ruins everything.\n\nI feel so guilty and ashamed. I just want to end it all. EVERYTHING REMINDS ME OF IT and reminds me I am an awful person compared to the rest of humanity.\n\nI need to know how horrible I am compared to the rest of humanity. I want to know how horrible, awful or disgusting what I did was. I just feel trapped in a horror story of my own making . Every second it feels like my skin is on fire and I just want to crawl in a hole and disappear. I don't know how to go on living, i feel so guilty, its hard knowing i'm a gross, disgusting monster like a child sex offender. I feel dirty and morally bankrupt. That I am worse than everyone. Like i have done something that has ruined my life story and i can never atone.. Im reminded of it everywhere, i just want to know others thoughts to help me process how bad it is.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ltkv3t/i_have_a_really_big_regret_and_i_dont_know_how_to/", "title": "I have a really big regret and I don't know how to get over it.
