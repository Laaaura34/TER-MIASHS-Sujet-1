im 17 now. over the years ive developed a smorgasbord of \"symptoms\" from mental illnesses ive completely convinced myself that i have, but now i know none of it's real, i don't know how to unlearn them and quite frankly im terrified to be truly myself and be happy. these symptoms have ingrained themselves into my being and without being \"mentally ill\" i literally do not know who i am. it's making me anxious and distressed and extremely suicidal. i don't know what to do from here or where to turn.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oip6hk/realised_ive_been_faking_my_whole_life_and_im/", "title": "realised ive been faking my whole life and im terrified", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "pilled1217", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626088587, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oip6hk/realised_ive_been_faking_my_whole_life_and_im/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422266.911846, "replies_charged": false}
