I believe that if you have unexplored options, you don't have a right to complain. But this is the second time in my life where I feel like I have absolutely no options left. I tried so many ways to be happy and to survive in the past year and they all failed spectacularly or simply evaporated. \n\nThe crazy thing is that it's not even my fault, I did everything I could. Its the pandemic, it's the economy, it's our slow-ass indecisive bureaucracies, it's our country's lack of safety nets, it's everyone being sad at the exact same time.\n\nI'm talking to a military recruiter soon because I feel like it's my only option left in order to have any level of economic security. But everything else failed, so what's keeping this from not working out too? Ive already come really close to killing myself in the past month and a half. I don't want to feel trapped, I dont want to feel like I don't have any options just to simply live. When you feel trapped, you're always one step away.\n\n I don't want to be there.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/othl1r/feeling_trapped/", "title": "Feeling Trapped", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Existing_Fortune_435", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627502051, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/othl1r/feeling_trapped/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426627.2204933, "replies_charged": false}
