Saying \"I wanna go fkin die\" without knowing. When I came to realize I always searched suicide methods or like how to die painlessly on google (which is how I came to know this subreddit btw). I dont even know cause of this, could be depression or smth like dat I dont really know\n\nI am definitely not okay. I constantly think about dying (much worse at night and when I am alone). Sometimes I ask myself that what if I just could be seeking an attention. I have family that support me well and few friends that I hang out with. I am just burden to them.\n\nI dont even feel sad. Just emptiness.
