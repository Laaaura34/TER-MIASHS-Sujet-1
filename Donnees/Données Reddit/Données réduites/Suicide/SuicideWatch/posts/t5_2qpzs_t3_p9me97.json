Especially after being in a psych ward for almost a year now.\n\nBut I generally feel like shit. I'm quite often ill probably due to stress and bad eating habits. I notice that I fuck a lot of things up recently going from good contacts I used to have all the way to just handling thoughts of self harm.\n\nI'm not going to beat around the bush. I don't like to live and I'd rather not. But I know that there are people around me who are struggling just as much as I am and trying, even if there's not much I can do to help or make things a bit more bearable for them, makes me go forward.  \n\nThat's the thing. I'm torn between not wanting to live and wanting to help others. I can't help if I'm dead, but I'd love to not having to care.\nI don't know. I'm just done with my own bullshit.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p9me97/stuck_between_needs/", "title": "Stuck between needs", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bloemsuikerMan", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629671030, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p9me97/stuck_between_needs/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425274.7464287, "replies_charged": false}
