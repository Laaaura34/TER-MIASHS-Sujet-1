I don't want people to know that it was intentional.\n\nI am 20 years old to date. I have been living with depression for the majority of my life and I feel that I am at a point where I am contented with the idea of my death. I have terrible generalized hyperhidrosis (basically, I get really sweaty for no reason). It's an awful condition and inhibits me from interacting with people in even the most simple of settings. Honestly who would want to be around a sweaty person all the time? The worst part is that I look normal otherwise, so people are always disappointed and weirded out by me and my condition. That's what makes interacting with people so punishing. Honestly, if I had a nickle for every time I was asked \"why are you sweating so much?\" I would probably be able to pay off America's debt crisis. Please don't bother suggesting the topical clinical medications. I've tried them and it only makes it worse in the areas that I can't apply the medication. I will never be able to truly be close with anyone and that's the sad fact.  I've always had this hope that things would get better if I just tried harder. I did and I have been but I just feel worse than ever. I got good grades. Got into a good school. Started a service organization... But all that means nothing if you can't be happy around other people. It's a terrible cycle of avoiding social situations, becoming more socially awkward, trying to talk to people again and failing miserably. In addition to all that, I was in a bike accident several years ago and I now have permanent brain damage on the part of my brain that helps with language. I have a terrible time remembering names of anything. People, places, movies, anything. It really inhibits my communication, and no matter what i do to try to improve it, I still suck at it. On top of that, I have two hideous scars on my face that people always stare at. I just can't handle looking at someone as their eyes dart to my scars. You don't know that you do it, but it makes me very self conscious.\nI thought things would start looking up for me by now, but after years of failing to connect with anyone beyond my family I am giving up. I dread waking up in the morning every single god damn day. More and more I have these fantasies about shooting myself. I play it in my head over and over and over no matter how hard I try to make it stop. I know its bad to think but it's the only time I'm happy now. It's like smoking a cigarette or those few seconds after an orgasm. I feel as though I am getting some sweet relief, but then reality comes back and my life still sucks. Fuck it.\n\nI'm sorry Mom, Dad, Big bro, and little bro. I know this will be hardest on you all. \nMom- I hate how this will affect you the most and for that I'm and eternally sorry, but no matter how much you love me, it will never make up for how much I hate myself.\nDad- Please take care of mom. I'm sorry for being such a burden. You'll have more money now that you don't have to worry about me.\nbig bro- You've got it made. I know that you'll find a great wife, buy a big house, and be a wonderful father someday. I know you told me that you believed in me. I'm so sorry for disappointing you.\nlittle bro- I don't even know what to say. I love you little man. You're gonna rule the world some day. You're tougher than I ever was\n\nI know that someday you will be able to move on with your lives. \nGoodbye", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m3dnc/a_final_farewell/", "title": "A final farewell", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Throwaway2587092", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 30, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1320660260, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m3dnc/a_final_farewell/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426482.2915535, "replies_charged": false}
