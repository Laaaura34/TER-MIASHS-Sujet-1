I have not gone a full week without actively wanting to kill myself. It used to be a reactionary response to something going wrong (even for minor things), but this past year has felt a lot more existentially unbearable.\n\nI turn 21 this year. So, roughly a year left of college. To people that do not know me intimately, I feel like I give off the presence of a put-together, function human. And I won't lie and say that my life is more difficult than anyone else's - there are not any extenuating circumstances that would really challenge my way of life. But man, I would give anything to just die instantly and painlessly without any kind of gory leftovers (I'm not here to discuss methods, just voicing).\n\nI know that I'm young and full of angst/hormones, and that is probably the bulk of the emotion (or lack thereof) in this post. I am just so sick of pretending like this world isn't fucked up; sick of playing the guessing game with loved ones where I need to figure out whether or not they are acting like I am normal to save my emotional affect; and just generally being tired. Of anything that happens.\n\nI want to go to sleep tonight and not wake up, but I know I'm gonna be a little scared fuck and not do it like it goes most nights - and then wake up tomorrow and lose the morning to regret, and the night to fear.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/krje7g/does_the_suicidal_ideation_ever_stop/", "title": "Does the suicidal ideation ever stop", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bomb482", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1609919919, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/krje7g/does_the_suicidal_ideation_ever_stop/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427272.1003556, "replies_charged": false}
