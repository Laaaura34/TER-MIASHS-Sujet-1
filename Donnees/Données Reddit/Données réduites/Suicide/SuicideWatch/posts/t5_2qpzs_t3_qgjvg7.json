I have come a long way and it made me happy. \n\nThank you for everything you\u2019ve given me and always motivating me. Meeting you was the happiest thing in my life. I would\u2019ve traded my soul just to be somebody to you. I\u2019m sorry for not being okay, and you deserve so much better. \n\nI still remember, I remember what you said about I\u2019m not worth it and I\u2019ve really thought it through. I understand my self worth now and I\u2019m sorry for being unaware. Had I known earlier, I still dont think I would\u2019ve not fallen for you. Why\u2019d you have to be born so perfect? \n\nI wish you were there for me and I wish you meant something when you said \u201cforever\u201d. It\u2019s been 4 months since you\u2019ve gone and I still cannot kill myself. I just wish I could see you more in my dreams, and if I do I\u2019ll try my best to not dissapoint you my love.\n\nI\u2019ve done something good today but there\u2019s still a voice that screams I dont deserve anything. I have earned this but idk why I still cant accept it. You were the first person I told my good news to, so I figured I\u2019d send you this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qgjvg7/all_i_ever_wanted_was_to_be_somebody_to_you/", "title": "All I ever wanted was to be somebody to you\u2026", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "WalkingCorpse_", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635293191, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qgjvg7/all_i_ever_wanted_was_to_be_somebody_to_you/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425196.6970003, "replies_charged": false}
