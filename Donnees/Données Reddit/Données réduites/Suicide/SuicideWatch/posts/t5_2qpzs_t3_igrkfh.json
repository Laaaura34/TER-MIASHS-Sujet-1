I have been suicidal in the past, quite often actually. But right now, it's not so much that I want to commit suicide, and more that I'm just tired of the pain of being alive, and I'm ready to die.\n\nI want to try to avoid a wall of text, but I'm going to summarize my situation. I'm a 23 year old guy, and I live in the united states. I live with my functional alcoholic, borderline verbally abusive father, and pretty much have for about 90% of my life. It's always been painful for me having to watch him slowly kill himself with booze, but I've done my best to support him, even when he's been unemployed. In the past, I've paid bills, and given him money. It's not something I like to do, but there isn't really any other choice, since he would likely be homeless if I didn't.\n\nBut this has had a tremendous impact on my personal, professional, and social life. This year in January, I had an incident at work that led to me telling my boss to fuck off. I smashed a bunch of merchandise, and was subsequently fired. I've been unemployed since then, myself, but I've been receiving unemployment benefits. While this job was god-awful, and it was destroying my energy, this incident had partially to do with my situation at home. I was trapped between a terrible home life, and a shitty job where I was overworked and underpaid.\n\nRecently, with the pandemic, work has been tough to find obviously, but thankfully, my father has been staying employed, at least up until last month, when he was laid off. While there is no doubt that I love my father, because c'mon, he's my dad, I definitely don't appreciate him or what he does to himself or me, and being physically near him has an impact on my mental stability. So you can imagine how things have gone being stuck at home thanks to the pandemic, and now both of us being unemployed. Keep in mind, his alcohol consumption hasn't changed much, either, which is distressing considering money is becoming a problem.\n\nUp until he lost his job, I was actually doing well. I was happy, and for the first time in years, I felt \"normal\". Like there was no sign of depression or anxiety for miles. I was able to find a nice balance between me-time and keeping physically and mentally healthy (working out, practicing good mental hygeine, etc.), and tolerating my dad when he wasn't away from home. But almost immediately it all ended when he lost his job. I remember the week he lost his job, I started drinking more often, and went back to my old smoking habit. Shortly after, I stopped working out entirely. I started stress and boredom eating (gaining almost 15 pounds since then), and my entire desire to look for work has just disappeared.\n\nRight now, I'm basically living in my room 24/7, hiding from him and his constant woe-is-me, everything sucks, naysaying attitude. It's a drain. Until today, I hadn't actually had any genuine human contact with any of my friends in 2 whole weeks. I've just drifted further and further into my bad habits, and turned toward excessive internet consumption. It's at the point, where even doing things I like can't shake the dread going on in my mind. It eerily feels just like when I first started to develop major depression and anxiety almost 4 years ago. It's strange. I notice more disturbing things. I think about my own mortality way too much\u2014about the past 23 wasted years of my life. I'm afraid to speak to friends, because I've noticed more and more that I'm turning into my father, from his behavior, to his habits, and his overall defeatist outlook and attitude. It's like I'm trapped and there is nothing I can do, any move right or wrong will inevitably drag me back to square-one, which has been a big fixation I've had in the past too.\n\nRight now, because of this life I live, I just feel like a husk. I feel empty, with no meaningful emotions in my body. I can't even feel sadness. I just want to sit and stare at a wall every day (or rather a screen), because there's nothing flowing through me. I feel broken. I feel like I'm not me, like there's another person in my head, controlling my thoughts and my body. It's like the old, good me is dead, and gone, and I've been replaced with a strange doppelganger. I've research derealization in the past, and I'm certain that's not my case, as I don't really exhibit other symptoms or behaviors like that. But seriously, every day feels like it's only a few minutes long, and they all blend together. It's like time is on overdrive, and my life is flashing past me a-mile-a-minute. Late at night, when I'm finally alone, I'm stuck thinking about death, and how much time I've wasted, and how I'll never escape this prison. I think about what it's going to be like, at 70 years old, dying of cancer on a hospital bed, thinking about my past. What will I see? The hundreds of times I've watched porn just to feel some kind of basic human sensation, the time I've wasted sitting in my room hiding from someone who is too dimwitted and booze-addled to realize the magnitude of how simply behaving like normal around me makes me want to hide away alone for the rest of eternity?\n\nI think about the progress I've made over the past 4 years since I fell into the pit of depression and self-destruction, and I see it all slipping away like grains of sand in a timepiece. How can I feel anything but loneliness or despair? It truly seems hopeless.\n\nAnd then I think about my peers. A few weeks ago, I got the news that one of my close high school friends was moving to New York for a full time position as an IT consultant. It was a pretty nice gig, and a lot of us were proud, and a bit jealous of just how good of a job he got. I'm happy for him, but I can't help but think how that could have been me, if I had only just gotten my shit together in middle school. But alas, I'm a college dropout, who's unemployed and too emotionally dead to find it even palatable to start working again. A week before that, I visited a friend a half-hour away from where I live. He and his girlfriend just moved into a very nice and affordable duplex. I felt jealousy, and resentment toward myself. My biggest goal in the past 4 years, and this guy got it in less than 2. He's an interesting case too. Just out of nowhere, this guy went from someone, while an awesome guy and genuinely a great person, you'd never expect to grow up and find success, to someone who's got a strong relationship, a job that pays well that he enjoys, and now his own place that's only a few degrees away from perfect, knowing his values and goals.\n\nThat day, when we were hanging out at his place, I drank a lot and started slipping. This was maybe less than a week after my dad lost his most recent job. That following day I was hung over, and felt like shit. I basically locked myself in my room and just surfed the internet, trying to escape the throbbing pain in my head. That night, I snapped at my friends. I was paranoid and vulnerable, I took out my frustrations out on them, told them they were deceiving and manipulating me (which I knew the weren't). I just started shit, because I lost control. After they told me to come down and shut up, I said fuck you, and told them I was going to kill myself because no one cared. In reality, I had no intentions of doing it, but I wanted to so bad.\n\nWe're still friends, and a they were all supportive. This isn't the first time I've done this, so they weren't really shocked, or hurt. But I feel like I may have crossed a line with some of them. And now I fear I may have damaged our relationship. Friends I've known since high school.\n\nI talked to my therapist about it, and it really grounded me, but looking back now I question that conversation. Am I really okay? Was that real, or just me acting up because there's something wrong with me? It was surreal in the moment, after my talk, it was like a 180, I changed my mood just like that, which I've never really done. She has doubts about bipolar disorder, so I really don't know why that happened. Maybe just all that pressure building up that week blew up, and seeing that house was all it took to break me, again.\n\nThe thing I want most... The thing I crave more than anything is freedom. I want to move out, but I can't just up-and-leave, lest my father needs me and goes homeless. And it's basically setting me up for failure if I just jump into a whole new living situation without any sort of job or safety net, which is funnily enough what I desparately want to do; escape and never look back. But even that fantasy is muddied, because I know that realistically, I could never just abandon my father or my family, I can't hurt them by forgetting about them.\n\nMy mother is somehow even worse, as she is content to behave like a helicopter parent, and is borderline obsessively attached to me, like I'm still 5 years old. I've improved my relationship somewhat, but it seems like the conversations we've had in the past aren't really sticking, as she's drifting back into her same behavior. She treats me like I have to be tied by a leash to her. She wants to be included with everything, even if she has no business really knowing anything. My biggest regret is telling her about my sexuality when I was 18, because she immediately spread the rumor to her side of the family without really thinking about it. Thankfully, no one really seems to mind it, so it's not like anyone is treating me differently, it's just like she did that without my consent, like it was gossip, about her own son.\n\nFollowing that time I snapped at my friends, I took that as a sign to stop drinking for a while. And thankfully, I haven't consumed any kind of drug or intoxicant other than nicotine, because oh boy, I sure am addicted to that. While I feel like I normally would be happy and proud of that, all I feel is indifference, and worse, scared because of that indifference. I just want to feel again, not be numb all the time.\n\nI'm getting a bit off track I guess. Apologies, since this did turn out to be a wall of text, and this is pretty stream-of-conscious writing, so it might be hard to follow. But I'll try to reign this in. Today, after weeks of isolation from people I cared about, I saw them face-to-face for the first time in weeks. There was nothing outright bad that happened, but it was like nothing changed. I was still depressed, I was still scared, and devoid of emotion and feeling. I was numb around them, even though I was putting on some kind of facade of a happy normal person. And now, I'm writing this because I don't really know what else to do. My thoughts drifted toward death again, and I contemplated suicide for a brief moment, but only for a brief moment. I just have no one else who can really listen, my friends I keep this stuff from, because I'm afraid it will ruin the good friendship we have. I can't turn to my parents, nor my siblings, because they won't understand, and they won't know what to do, because we're so distant as a familiy. Even my therapist is a limited amount of help. While it's nice to have someone to talk to, she does it because it's her job, she does it because she's supposed to find solutions. \n\nI just need someone to listen for once. I just want to be heard, and feel like I have someone who loves me truly, because now, truly, do I feel alone. Distant from everything, from goals, from love, from just a person to hold and feel and be present with. Everything is running by, so blindingly fast that I can't catch a moment to breathe. It feels like the world is metaphorically ending, because there's so much chaos and nonsense flying by me at a million miles an hour. Intrusive thoughts, dread, my personal hobbies and memories, addiction, behavioral and thought patterns...\n\nI just don't know what to do. I want to be normal again. I want to be healthy and happy, and feel like there's some sort of meaning in my life. But I just simply can't find any right now. I just hate myself. and everything and everyone around me. I don't know what to do.\n\nAll I need is someone to talk to.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/igrkfh/i_want_to_die_but_im_afraid_of_death/", "title": "I want to die, but I'm afraid of death.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LifeIsPainThrowaway1", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1598413089, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/igrkfh/i_want_to_die_but_im_afraid_of_death/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428158.3484714, "replies_charged": false}
