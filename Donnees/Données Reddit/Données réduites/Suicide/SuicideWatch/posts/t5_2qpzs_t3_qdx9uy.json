If I died, she would have no one to drive her to work or remind her of things. So I asked her if we could do it together. I want to be together always. She said no and assured me that she loved me. She said she wanted to grow old with me and experience life with me. \n  Part of me can\u2019t accept that. I\u2019ve pushed so many people away. I just wanted it to be her and I. Her rejection to it hurt. She wants to live life to the fullest. \n  I\u2019m tired of the pain. It makes me sad thinking about leaving her behind. She\u2019s so beautiful, I\u2019m sure replacing me would be easy. If I do leave her, I hope she finds someone she likes.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qdx9uy/my_wife_said_no_to_a_suicide_pact_now_i_have_to/", "title": "My wife said No to a suicide pact.
