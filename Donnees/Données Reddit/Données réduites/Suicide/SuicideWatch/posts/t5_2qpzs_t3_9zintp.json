The original stuff that made me depressed wasn't bad I guess but I started to lash out at my friends and do odd things I never would. It's like I want them to hate me and I'm trying my best to get them to want me dead or not care about me. \n\nI've been having random intrusive thoughts like: \"Man traffic is up I wonder if it could end if I walked through it right now\". I feel like no one cares but that's my fault because I lashed out and gave them all reasons to hate me. I have no idea what to do anymore. Nothing is fun. Nothing to look forward to. I just stare at a wall mostly. I mean, why not cut to the chase?\n\nSorry for being whiney.
