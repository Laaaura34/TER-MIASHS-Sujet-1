Sometimes the idea of having to stand up to days like the ones i had before the attempt terrorizes me. And i can't do anything about it, everything i attempt something that might br useful for my condition i just stop, because when i recognize it's useful that it just becomes too much for me and i can't deal with it anymore. I cant draw anymore, I can't learn piano, at times I can't even get up from bed. And now I'm here. In recovery. Having all the people that care about me preoccupied.
