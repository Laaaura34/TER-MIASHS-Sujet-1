So this all started in 2015, when I was in 10th standard (High school) in India after passing 10th, for 11th you have to pick one stream out of three that are - Science, Commerce and Arts. I was never good with my mathematics or physics so I was never interested in Science field but I was always passionate about Arts. So that's what I picked but my parents cared more about their standards rather than my happiness, my parents were angry with me for choosing Arts and ignored my existence for a week or two, me being only 15 and scared of my family treating me this way made me change my stream from Arts to Science. \n\nFrom day one, I hated it not only because it wasn't my choice but also how my teacher treated me. I was bullied not by any students but by my own teacher who didn't liked because I picked Arts at the beginning making his class less valuable as compared to others. He would constantly called me in his lab to give me extra work or he would just fail me in exams whenever he wanted to do it. I was all alone in this no friends, no family helped me. My mom was happy that now she can go around places without having to fear to justify why I was an Arts student before as nobody knew that.\n\nIn 12th standard, I was in tears the whole year, I wasn't able to grasp anything like derivation, integration or trajectory etc. I didn't understand any of that and I was in fear of failing. My home life was nil, my dad was always angry with me for not passing physics exam (I tried everything I can), my mom back-peddled and said she wasn't the reason I'm suffering (She always does that). I hated my sister to the core for never backing up in any of this situation and she actually joined with my parents against me. I was in tears during my final exams due to not understanding anything in question paper but I somehow managed to get marks and passed the exams. \n\nNow it's time for college admission, I begged my parents to allow me to take one year gap or break to figure out what I was going to do next. Well it didn't happened. I also begged my parents to let me take Computer graphic designing or other courses in college but the scenario from my 10th class started again and I was ordered by my father to do Engineering. I know some of it is my fault for not able to stand up for me but I didn't knew anything and thought my parents are doing it for me (my biggest regret). Some of you may suggest that you should've moved out your parents house but in India you have to be at least 18 or higher to get a job below this age you won't be given job.\n\nAfter sometime, I took an admission in 3rd grade Engineering college (I didn't scored good in my high school )and I took Electronics and Communication Engineering. I shifted to hostel and this is where I got know what was happening to me and how abusive my parents and sister were. I got some good roommates that told me how narcissists and controlling my parents were.\n\nI didn't knew what anxiety and depression was until I talked with them. But it was too late and I had no other option but to complete my course. Engineering sucked and I didn't learned anything even after I spend my weekend holidays in my college to get better but nothing. The professor don't care, I also stopped caring after 3rd year of college and didn't get any job after completing engineering.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I graduated from my college and here I am sitting wondering what to do now. I neither have any job nor any money to move out and start some other course. \n\nDuring these 6 years, I have tried to commit suicide many times to relieve this pain but couldn't able to achieve it. I only have one friend but he doesn't want to listen to any of my problems.\n\nSo no family support, no friend support and thus I'm here. You don't have care about me, I just want to vent my situation to somebody or someone that's it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs there any hope for me? Is there anyone who had suffered something similar and how did you overcome it?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pbzkvl/i_21m_is_suffering_from_depression_and_anxiety/", "title": "I 21(m) is suffering from depression and anxiety from the last 6 years and I'm standing at the edge of cliff.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "iamdonewith_it", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629984732, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pbzkvl/i_21m_is_suffering_from_depression_and_anxiety/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422905.1887326, "replies_charged": false}
