Not only in my life but making everyone around me happy. Every time I do something it turns out bad and every person I make happy they turn out they only used me. By the time I go out, if there\u2019s not one shred of kindness given to me or I witnessed I think imma go on and do it. I already have two ways I wanna go incase one fails. I\u2019m so tired of me trying to get better just to be laughed at for trying.
