I can barely work dead end jobs unrelated to my degree that don't even add up to full time. Due to mental illness I put a huge burden on my sister. I have almost no \"real\" friends, the only reason I am actually still am alive is because I don't want to cause my sister pain from either finding my body or me dying in a random field and her never finding closure. \n\nI stopped actively planning.
