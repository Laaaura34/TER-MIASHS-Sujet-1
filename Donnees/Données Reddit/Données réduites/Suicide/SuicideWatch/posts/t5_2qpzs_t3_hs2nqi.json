Life is repetitive, I go to school and work hard to do well so that I can get into a university, then i work harder so that i can get a good job, then i work even harder so that i can just provide for myself to keep living. There's no end goal, you just stay alive to stay alive because dying is bad. I don't think life is for everyone, I'm just not made to work hard for things I want, because soon enough I don't want them anymore anyway. It sucks now and It'll just get worse. People always say \"You have it good now\", \"wait until you get into the real world\", \"Life's going to hit you hard one day\". If it just gets worse and harder then why am I forced to live through it. I don't like it here, I'm always uncomfortable and I don't want to be here anymore, I haven't for a long time, I'm getting close to getting there. I want to be gone before adulthood, before its too late and responsibilities sweep up, but time's running out quick and I have to decide. I think i'm almost ready to do it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hs2nqi/times_running_out/", "title": "Time's running out", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Worm_On_A_Spine", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1594871452, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hs2nqi/times_running_out/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425250.1418068, "replies_charged": false}
