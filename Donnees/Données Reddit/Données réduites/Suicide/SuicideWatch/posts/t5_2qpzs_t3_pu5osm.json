Every thought can draw me to a reason to commit suicide. My past, my present, my future. Strangers. Seriously just seeing another human makes me so depressed. Its like I can see them and their pain and their blissful ignorance and I find it so unfathomable that anyone can be happy. I'll also get fixated on the idea of how horrible life will continue to get. I want a way out but I'm too scared too lazy. There's no point to any of this mess. Life is just pain. I want to be nothing. I want to bo longer exist. I think death is the only true bliss.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pu5osm/endless_racing_thoughts_where_it_always_results/", "title": "Endless racing thoughts where it always results in more suicidal ideation", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Error_username_L0ST", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632434130, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pu5osm/endless_racing_thoughts_where_it_always_results/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427206.2453601, "replies_charged": false}
