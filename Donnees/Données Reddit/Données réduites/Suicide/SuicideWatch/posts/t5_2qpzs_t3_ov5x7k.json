I am okay, very bruised and regret wearing my seatbelt because that\u2019s what saved my life. I could not have anyone visit my during my two nights in hospital due to Covid restrictions which I didn\u2019t mind. \nI came home to my family (I Live with my parents and my siblings) snd there were no hugs, no \u201comg thank god you\u2019re okay\u201d, instead everyone has been very hostile and has just asked me not to do it again. \nI\u2019ve only been helped once to get out of bed, the other times I have had to slide out on my left side which came better off after my accident. \nIt\u2019s not that I want sympathy, bunches of flowers and to start getting affection I never had from my family to be begin with but I feel like I\u2019m more of a burden and that it\u2019s disrupted their life for a few days which makes me even more regrettable about not going faster or harder. I know they don\u2019t want me to die but I thought their actions would match their first words after the accident a bit more. \nDad said on the way home from the hospital don\u2019t do it again and definitely don\u2019t crash a car again like that and that there\u2019s other ways to do it and it\u2019s making me think of another way\u2026 \n\nI can understand my family might feel hurt that I would do that to them BUT their hostility and inability to make me super glad I didn\u2019t do it is exactly the reason I did it in the first place.\n\nDoes anyone understand me?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ov5x7k/feelings_of_anger_from_family_members_after_a/", "title": "Feelings of anger from family members after a suicide attempt?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Expensive_Explorer_3", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 30, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627732938, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ov5x7k/feelings_of_anger_from_family_members_after_a/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426812.4077506, "replies_charged": false}
