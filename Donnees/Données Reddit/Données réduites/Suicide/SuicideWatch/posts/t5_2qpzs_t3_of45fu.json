I'll write a note for your spirit too. Earth is seriously overrated and your body is your own. Nothing more infuriating than being at rock bottom having ppl tell you to hold out. \n\nI will not tell you how to do the deed. Only do rituals for your spirit so you can hopefully have rest.\n\nLove you all", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/of45fu/thank_you_for_giving_me_permission_to_die/", "title": "Thank you for giving me permission to die.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "nico1325", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625605622, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/of45fu/thank_you_for_giving_me_permission_to_die/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423041.3614829, "replies_charged": false}
