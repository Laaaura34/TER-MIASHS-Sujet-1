I Had great friends who has been around for most my life and I thought we were solid as fuck. Me and my partner were talking about a house and a family , \n\nAfter the crash my neck and headaches were a obvious strain, for the first few months I couldn\u2019t turn my head and lifting my arms was a nightmare that caused such a headache my eyes would go blurry, even though I was in constant pain I knew my job wouldn\u2019t wait for me and I wanted to try and go back and do my best. Once I finally was cleared for a few hours a week I went back to a clearly unwanted environment, I was Clearly old news and nobody thought I would keep up, they were right my headaches would take over and I could sometimes barely string a sentence together which just isn\u2019t acceptable when 98% of the job was relaying information to customers. My performance went down and it was very audibly noted, when I said I was still seeing four five doctors a week to fix my shit they would literally scoff at me for not just turning off the pain, \n\nAs o was driving home from work when all this happened I was covered by their insurance, but because it didn\u2019t happen at work they were actually paid to help rehabilitate me to normal work, this meant they were covered and my treatment, \n\nMy dumb fucking ass thought this meant someone cared and they wanted me better. \n\nNo they wanted me off their books. \nThis meant I was never offered any proper treatment I was offered medication, when their doctors started saying \u201cthere\u2019s no hope for these headaches\u201d it spun me into a deep pit, by this point I\u2019d developed what they say is serious depression and ptsd with adjustment disorder, while still dealing with headaches every single day, so bad I couldn\u2019t always wash my hair or lift a t shirt over my head. \n\nDay by day people started getting sick of me being around or having a headache,  not that I said anything it\u2019d just become obvious in my lack of life, even my constant yes\u2019 became no\u2019s and I didn\u2019t want to leave my dark room, whereas before I was the life of the party, it\u2019s funny how nobody likes you when the symptoms start to show, \n\nAside from losing my friends, my job and my fucking life, iv now been told this physical pain will probably be permanent as iv damaged nerves, \nso now the insurance is all finished, my jobs gone and my rents due and I\u2019m stuck with headaches, my soul is desperate for this shit to be over but with no hope in sight all I want to do is end it all, \n\nI have a partner who won\u2019t let me out of his sight, and tbh he really is the only thing that stops me from downing a bottle of sleeping pills, I had them in my hand the other night, no sane thought in sight, and in the middle of a snore he reached over and grabbed my leg, dead asleep, like he knew he needed to save me. Iv noticed all the sharp objects disappearing and our medicine cabinet thinning out because someone\u2019s hiding them, I want to leave him in the middle of the night and just go so far they won\u2019t find my body, then at least he\u2019d have hope, but I know that\u2019s cruel.\n\nI\u2019m so fucking lost every urge in my body just wants to die. But he won\u2019t let me go so I wonder if I maybe shouldn\u2019t.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/i1tc6x/my_death_would_make_more_sense_then_my_life/", "title": "My death would make more sense then my life.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "hammladd", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 31, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1596293200, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/i1tc6x/my_death_would_make_more_sense_then_my_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422319.847347, "replies_charged": false}
