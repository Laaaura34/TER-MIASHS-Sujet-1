I don't expect anyone to honestly read through the whole thing. I don't even feel like it expresses the suicidal feelings I have, or how it comes in waves throughout my days and nights. What I've written is not even comprehensive, and leaves out so much nuance and context. I also forgot to mention of my exes tried to outright kill me (didn't realize it at the time, I was just confused why he was choking me out on the ground before I gave into the realization I was going to die. But even after that, I didn't realize he was trying to kill me), and another was about to choke me to death with his hands, the look in his eye - he wasn't himself, it was something or someone else. I don't really believe in demons, but something else took over him at that time. I think it was a dark spot in the mind. Sort of like when you break from a really dark mindset, and realize, it was like there was a cloud over you or something, and you weren't your normal self. It's just so visceral and unexpected and unrecognizable until you're in the sun again.   \n\n\nAnyway. idk. At the very least, thank you letting this exist here.   \n\n\nI also have a TW in one point about sexual assault/rape, which is also why I marked this post as NSFW.   \n\n\nWhy my life isn't worth it:   \n\n\n1. Autistic. Have always been different from others, got diagnosed near age 20, didn't understand what it all meant until after mid twenties. I've always been treated as \"other\", dumped by people for reasons I couldn't understand. Told I guilt trip people about them not hanging out with me. Never could understand how wanting to hang out 1-2x a year when the people I know are getting together loads more than that without me. I have always felt like there's something eternally flawed within me.  \n\n2. Adults in my youth always said things would change once I graduated primary schooling and started college - that I'd get friends in college. They also had high hopes for me - the quiet, loner kid with intelligence that would do \"great things one day\". I completed two classes at a community college - dropped out of the third due to the density and only two real tests on the content. Ran out of financial aid, and stopped going cuz i didn't know what I wanted to do.   \n\n3. Probably because I'm autistic - I always just trusted people, and thought things were as they were. I was not prone to lying, so it didn't occur to me how commonly people lied. This means I have been a rube for the most of my life. My sincerity and earnest interest in things or people always seemed to repel them - no friendships ever really took off. Again, any friends I got would leave me behind at some point, usually, as I said, without understanding why. I was nothing but honest and sincere, and did not understand how my tone might be being received. As a result of my naivety, honesty, and possibly even my religious upbringing, I was more susceptible to doing what people asked or wanted. I didn't know how to say \"no\", nor that I could even say no. I was not allowed to take sex ed growing up. I was homeschooled until 6th grade, and when I attended school in 1st grade, I was the outsider - I would jump ahead of lesson plans because I'd learn by observing adults, and I remember I got in trouble once for not strictly following the lesson plan and employing advanced techniques. I told kids I saw jesus, and as far as my uniformed mind knows, I did. I saw something. I made some things up, but I also did have genuine experiences. The teacher and students at my catholic school in 1st grade told me I was a liar about seeing Jesus or hearing angels. This made me feel further ostracized. I was always alone on the playground. I saw a red spider once on the playground, and shared the sighting during show and tell. I once again was called a liar. I was sent to school without underwear and lunches at times. I was the poor kid. I didn't really have any friends. My dad abandoned me once at the house to go to get fast food. I was terrified. The wood floors gave us splinters. The water would freeze in the pot in the sink if left overnight in winter months. Birds lived in the rafters.   \n\n4. I don't remember most of my youth. 1st grade is the clearest time to me, but even that is fuzzy. We moved, and that's when I stop remembering much of any linear timeline or what happened. I don't have memories that are \"clear\" until age 11 - things start to become less clouded about half way through age 10. At 11, shortly after my birthday, my dad tried to kidnap me and my sibling. Police told my mom we needed to leave that night. We left almost everything behind and went to live with strangers for 6 months at least after that. They had many children, so rooms were shared with 3 people in it at least. In the times of my life I don't really remember, we were homeless often, and lived with people sometimes, under charity-like terms. Sometimes we lived in the van. Sometimes we were at a campground. I don't remember a whole lot. I just remember there wasn't a \"home\" that most have. We never really owned objects as a result. The first apartment I remember us living in was pretty bare. Eventually we had a reclining chair, but no couches beyond that materialized. My father also cut a wart out of my big toe, a big one, with a pocket knife. No one has really confirmed that this is scary/bad/abuse, but it scared the crap out of me and was without consent. Any abuse in my life has been downplayed by anyone with \"authority\" or professional power or ability. This has often kept me downplaying the severity of my experiences.   \n\n5. Every year after 6th grade, I was at a new school, until 10th grade, when my mom finally settled down in a city. I was bullied throughout my school experience. I was so naive, I often didn't even know I was being bullied or made fun of. I got in trouble in 7th grade for trying to return a laptop bag to the main office because it seemed like a student had left it behind in one of my classes, but after rifling through the front pocket for an identifier, it had business type papers in it, and I started to think it wasn't a students, so I left it behind in a different class before lunch. A few weeks later, I was called to the main office during my first class of the day. They said I tried to steal a teacher's laptop, and they put me in in school suspension for a few weeks. I cried and tried to tell them I was not trying to do that at all. The teacher whose classroom I found it in wouldn't even look at me. He watches every student leave the classroom. He should have known I wasn't in laptop class. I walked out with a huge laptop bag on my shoulder. It looked like every other student's laptop bag. This was my first real experience getting in trouble for being me, with serious consequences. No one seemed to believe that I did not try to steal the laptop (except for my mom probably). Even worse, a person in the class I was pulled from who bullied me (like asking if I was a \"dyke\" when I didn't even understand what that meant, I guess because I wore overalls, or, idk really) was the one to deliver my bags from the class. She got to see me surrounded by school officials and crying. In 8th grade, at least once, I got a \"kick me\" sign put on my back during a class, and I didn't realize it until some point after, walking in the hallway.   \n\n6. I started depression at 13. Things just dramatically changed. I think people made fun of me for being \"poor\" behind my back. On my 13th birthday, we came back to our house with it having been ransacked by thieves. They didn't steal electronics or valuable high ticket items - they stole my zine notebook, my dolls, things with sentimental value. We saw them coming down our one car lane to our house. We pulled into another driveway to let them pass. They were never caught. I have dealt with suicidal ideation since 16 at least. Since I have never really been able to maintain friends, I started valuing objects as replacements for companionship.   \n\n7. I almost failed senior year of high school. The senior notebook project left me incredibly suicidal. I barely finished it at the very last minute. Of course, most of the scholarships were heavily awarded to sports and club kids,many of which were well to do and didn't \"need\" the money. I got barely $400 in scholarship money, because my focus was art probably.   \n\n8. I stayed loyal at my jobs. 7+ years, and almost 5 years before being fired over an event that was the result of them not providing me safety equipment and me being told to do 2 hours of cleaning in 30 minutes. The \"first\" job I had at a daycare, I was let go of after I got my period unexpectedly and was bleeding all over my underwear and clothes, and after tying the shoes on the last kid and getting them out the door to the playground (where there was another daycare worker), I rushed to the bathroom to deal with my profuse bleeding. I got lectured for \"leaving\" the kids (again, there was an adult to supervise them - I didn't \"leave them\"). I was so ashamed of my period situation, that I said nothing about why I rushed to the bathroom. So one day I came in to work, and there was a check on the pinboard for me, when it wasn't payday. My boss told me she was letting me go and hiring a kid's mom. No real explanation. I felt ashamed adn stupid, uncertain precisely why she let me go. The period thing is the most reasonable guess I had. She said after I finished all my STARS training, I could try again maybe, but my senses told me this had nothing to do with her unexpectedly, with no warning, letting me go.  \n\n9. My first boyfriend was abusive. He ate through 2-3k of my savings, because he always assumed I would buy him food when I asked him to take me by a fast food restaurant to get food. Didn't ask, just assumed. I was too weak and naive and taught to do what others want, so I never said anything about me not wanting to buy him food, or as much food as he wanted. We broke up a lot, and I only agreed to date him because he kept begging me. We went on a break immediately after I conceded to be his girlfriend, because he would be up all night, and would not be awake to see me when I was off work. He did not work. He lived with his mom. He had a car. I did not. He cheated on me immediately, and continued to have sex with a large number of girls after this, even though he apparently did not do this before. He took my virginity, which I did not want, and I felt terrible when it happened. I went in the closet and cried. He didn't seem to understand why I was upset. He convinced me to do anal. Eventually, one day, we had a fight. He wouldn't let me leave his room. He pulled me back into the room and threw me down on the bed, ripping my cardigan, which was new. He barricaded me in. I had to go to work. He would not let me go. I don't remember how I got out. But then I knew he was dangerous, and I couldn't stay with him. But his birthday was coming up, and I didn't want him to be lonely, miserable, and unhappy on his birthday. So I tried to stay with him for the extra month. On the day of his birthday, I also had to finish moving out, because my landlord/roommate was kicking me out (I I still think she was recording me or something, cuz she stuck a file cabinet at some point outside my room on a floor that otherwise had nothing but some barbells in it)(I think she disagreed with me dating this guy. I sometimes got home late, but I felt I was always respectful. She also blamed for leaving her sliding door open one night - something I did not do - and scratching her fridge, and leaving a greasy, oily mess in the kitchen once - all things, I feel, I did not do. But my denials did not matter to her). I had work at 9 am that morning, and my mom was helping me move the last of my stuff to her car. My bf kept calling me, and demanding I answer the phone (in voicemail), or else he's leaving me. I ignored the calls because the clock was running out, and I planned to talk to him later when I had a chance. I don't remember what he was mad over. He came over without consent, came into the house without consent, and came storming into my room where my mom was present too. He was very angry, and threatening. I remember being scared, but I don't remember words. My mom said she was calling the cops. I don't remember if she did, but he ended up leaving and said we were broken up, on the morning of his birthday, for something I supposedly did to upset him. Ironic, because I had stayed with him the whole month just so he wouldn't be alone on this day. Notice also how i got in trouble for things I did not do with someone who had power over my place to stay. I was happy he dumped me, because then I didn't have to deal with the guilt of me doing it to him. But the event was scary. I don't count him as my first bf, as he coerced me.   \n\n10. In the following years, I ended up with a guy I met at the same time as the above bf, who left his job almost the moment we started being together. He never got another job in our 3+ years together. I only had part time hours. He had a heavy smoking habit. We ended up getting cats. We had to move around a lot, and it was always hard to find a place for a smoking couple (I started smoking cuz i thought we were going to grow old and die together - i still feel he's my soulmate, but i have no illusions that we could ever be together again) with a cat or two. I always had to handle the search, even though I was working and he was not. It feels like we moved roughly 8 times in 2 years, but linear memories and precise time-important details don't stay clear in my head, not until later. Often I was short on rent, and he'd just ask his mom for the money and she'd pay the remainder. During this time, I also lost a lot of cats - often not because of my own accord, but things like roommates accidentally letting the kitten out, or other things. I've lost so many kittens, I can't properly count them. Another fuzzy bit of my memory. But it hurt every time. My then-bf had severe depression, and tried to kill himself within a week of the night I agreed to be his gf. (we were together for a month before I agreed, because I had to make sure I really loved him and didn't want to commit to something I wasn't serious about. Unlike the last, he was respectful of my no's). This is a small insight into our relationship as it was. There was a whole of questionable shit going on in the place I was living then, a bunch of teenagers and a few young adults hung around the place. We lived 6-8 usually in the 2 bedroom, no one related. Some toxic stuff happened. His heavy depression, worse than mine, became a huge burden I carried. My heart hurt all the time. Some of the toxic stuff just never let go of him or our relationship.   \n\n11. Over time, the relationship degraded. Again, I shouldered most of the worldly responsibilities. Until we almost got evicted when we were letting his bff live with us rent free for half a year. His bff had said he wanted to start helping with rent, but he didn't follow through, leaving me with far less than half the needed rent - an amount I couldn't ask my bf's mom for. I was becoming emotionally labile, flipping on a dime. After this, I told him he had to move out and had to find a job. I gave him 3 months until the end of the year. Neither of us would do anything, as it was supposed to just be a break. After 3 tumultuous years, where I wasn't supported in the same way (not to mention I had a high sex drive, and he, for various reasons, wasn't having sex with me. I think it had been 4 months at least since we had had sex at the point I told him to move back in with his mom), I was setting my boundary, cuz I was dying from the anxiety, stress, and situation. This is about the time I decided to see a therapist, to get diagnosed, because the mood issue wasn't a thing until that fall. He moved out. Became clear almost immediately he wasn't going to look for a job. I still waited. On the last day of the year, the deadline, after begging him to come and see me and spend time with me that final week, every day, because I knew I'd have to follow through on breaking up (again, I was expecting to get back together after he finally managed to get a job. We both felt a transcendent pull towards one another, from the start - basically love at first sense), with him refusing every time that week to visit, against my tears, I found someone to have sex with. The year had been particularly hard. Not having sex was a sacrifice I was ok with for love. He came over that night and saw a car, after I had asked him first if he'd come see me just to be close, and he confronted me. I lied, idk why, it was the end of our timeline. But he wasn't stupid. He then ended up calling me a whore and said that he never loved me. He decided he never wanted to be with me again. I was broken. I never had any intents to date anyone else or find another partner. I simply needed physical relief, from the physical and mental desert between us, that I willingly stood in for as long as I could.   \n\n12. After this point, I grew desperately, whole-bodiedly depressed and suicidal and hopeless. I had not reason to live. We had talked about getting married. We both felt something very deep between us. I didn't know how to go on, now that the person I was supposed die with, hated me and said he never loved me, all because I had sex with someone at the end of our timeline for him to get some sort of job. I loved him, but he was not responsible, and he had been physically and mentally abusive during our relationship, although I didn't really see it as such during it (like cutting his leg deep with a kitchen knife in his parent's bathroom over something involving me, i don't even know what anymore, probably didn't even then), or grabbing me by the hair and restraining me and spitting in my face and hair, which he did a few times during a particular time in our lives. Making fun of me for being fat, mean-spirited jabs and \"jokes\" that I told him I didn't like and made me feel bad. His parents didn't really allow shows of emotion in the house. His mom never left her bed, by choice. I particularly had issues with his mom, for how she treated him. She didn't like me much either, and got rid of my cat after i moved in with them after the place I was renting a room burnt down. I lost everything in the fire except for the clothes on my back, my scooter, and my cat(s) (I don't remember if we had one or two). His family was a cat family. My cat was kept in a cage on the porch. My cat disappeared one day. No one knew what happened to him. But my bf from then told me a year or two later that his mom took my cat to the pound. She hated me cuz I had an autistic melt down on a vacation they provided us, and she felt I wasn't thankful, so she hated me. Again, never told me to my face, and didn't seem to listen that it was my autism that resulted in me crying - not her or their nice vacation. Again - in trouble for me being me. I don't think about it that way, but it subconsciously exists in that context for me. They couldn't accept what my truth was.   \n\n13. I felt hollow and soulless. I howled and cried all the time. I had no will to live. All I wanted to do was die. I tried to kill myself, but I couldn't. I sucked at it. No one at work ever noticed the attempt cuts on my arm. And if they did, they didn't say anything. One person, once, might've said I shouldn't do that. But I don't remember if that's my dreams, or reality. I tried finding another person to have sex with. I found one. \\[TW, SEXUAL ASSAULT\\] On the way over, they changed what they wanted. They told me to leave the back door open, and all the lights off, and to get in bed and pretend I was asleep. I tried telling them I didn't really like that, I didn't want to, I wasn't comfortable with that, but he kept saying to just trust him and do it. He started telling me these things when was already over half way over to my place. I had no time or way to really stop him. He already had my address. He wouldn't listen to me, and again, I hadn't been taught I can say \"no\" to anything. I had been taught to be compliant and kind. So I got in bed, turned off the lights, and unlocked the door (incorrectly ordered the list here, ftr). I was scared, actually. But I tried to pretend I was asleep. I immobilized myself mentally. He came in. I laid limp. I did nothing but pretend to sleep. He did what he wanted, in the dark. He came in me. I had told him to use a condom. He said stuff like, \"You like that, don't you.\" after he came, he got dressed, and left. The lights were never turned on. Afterwards, I texted him. That I hadn't wanted that, and he started changing it when he was already on the way, and he didn't listen to me when I tried so many ways to tell him I didn't want to do what he said he wanted to do. He hadn't discussed these wants before, when were discussing what we wanted to do. I told him he cannot do that to people, that he needs to listen in the future. He called me a bitch and told me to shut up and said that I liked it, and verbally assaulted me for trying to assert the grounds I hadn't been able to directly say no to. Also, because he wanted me to pretend to be asleep, I felt like I couldn't respond to anything. I was mentally prone because he broke my boundaries and i didn't know wtf I was doing. He broke my consent, and I didn't know I could forcibly take it back. Although, who knows if I even said no forcibly, if he would have listened. I felt even more hollow and empty. I felt confused. Eventually, I started to wonder, was I raped? I called a rape hotline and asked them. \"Was I raped?\" They repeated some definitions again, and wouldn't answer me. I hung up crying and in desperation, because I had no clue what was going on. I was very suicidal after this. I felt like I had no life or soul or goodness left in me. I called my mom asking her to help me find help. We drove around into the city around 4 am, looking for something. What, I do not know. I didn't think an emergency room was appropriate. I just felt broken and gone in inside.   \n\n14. I got raped 5+  additional times over the rest of my life. Every one by someone different. Every rape, a different experience. At least two of them said they just wanted to make me \"feel better\", as I reached out on craigslist when I was suicidal and trying to find a way to not be, or I was just severely depressed and unhappy. I was very clear, no sex, I don't want that, I just am very sad and need a friend. They did not care. One of them brought me a smoothie, then did the thing, then left and emailed me to see how i felt. I didn't tell them they raped me. Just that they reaffirmed everything I thought about life. One of them I was seeing for a few months. He'd come over on weekends. He would fuck me without a condom, often in my sleep, without my consent. One night, when I was half asleep, I felt him trying to enter me. I thought he'd get the message and stop, as I wasn't wet and it wasn't working and I had work early in the morning. He kept going, and then, quickly, he came in me. I asked him if he just had sex with me, and he said, \"no, why?\" He knew I wasn't on birth control. I was devastated. I went to the bathroom, and cried on the edge of the tub until I had to get ready for work. This put me into such a bad depression that I started skipping work a lot. I was too emotionally wrecked to manage my customer service intensive job (where every minute was accounted for - not a regular retail job). They then tried to fire me several months later for having so many unexcused absences. I told the manager that I had been raped and I was feeling very badly, and that's why I hadn't been coming to work. I didn't get fired, amazingly. I should have lost my jobs so many times, as I would go through periods where my depression and suicidal ideation would be so overwhelming I couldn't function, because I'd just be crying all the time. Even when I was with the boyfriend I thought I was going to marry. And often, I wouldn't recognize what I went through as rape, even if it was the 5th rape. And I've felt stupid for not even being able to recognize the rapes as rape, when I've already been raped so many times.   \n\n15. There's stuff inbetween I will not detail. I eventually got into another relationship where I fell in love. I felt they were my soulmate too, but a different kind. More like a mentor soulmate. The relationship ended up being the most toxic, abusive relationship I ever had. I won't detail everything that made it so, it's so dark. But the relationship burnt out in 8 months, where, again, they are the one that left me. Things had been falling apart for awhile. At the end of that 8th month, they held me by the shoulders and said, \"I intend to come back tonight.\" And they left. And didn't come back. He refused to talk to me or explain why. He already had a gf, they were poly. She was his soulmate, and I knew this. But it became clear he wasn't telling us the same things. He had been working on helping \"fix\" me, so when he left, he did so much more damage than a regular breakup. Again, I was tanked and hollow and miserable. I contacted an old friend, the only super close female friend I had, but our close friendship had only spanned a few months before she found someone to take care of her and moved further away. She said I could come see her and her guy, and hang out, and they'd take care of me. I took them up on it. It resulted in them calling me \"the darkness\" and leaving me outside a gas station on the skirts of a town, in a place I didn't know, surrounded by woods, at 1 am. My friend wasn't always good at holding her liquor, and sometimes she got into zones that didn't make sense, but she'd insist they did, and that I was wrong. I don't think I had a phone, but eventually someone came up to me ask me if I was ok, I think, I don't recall, but I know I ended up in the car of someone, who I think was something like an uber or taxi driver, and they drove me to a grocery store a little bit away (it was closed), and he called my mom for me, or something, idk. There, some maurading guys came by and asked if I wanted to come back to their hotel room. I said no. After most of them walked away, one lingered and said, \"It's good you said no, they probably would've raped you.\"   \n\n16. My 8 month relationship ex was absent for several months, before showing up on my doorstep out of nowhere one night. After that, he came back monthly, always unexpected. He never could say whether he was going to see me again or not. He mostly came back for the sex. But I swear, I felt that he loved me, even if he couldn't acknowledge it because of how screwed up his own experiences in life had been. I could not start to move on or heal because he kept ripping open my wounds, sometimes even pretending he missed his chance to go home, simply so he could spend the night, because he did, in fact, like me.   \n\n17. Inbetween him leaving me and him starting to see me without notice or expectation every month, I got raped again. A weekish later, my ex came to see me again. I was not on birth control. I got pregnant. When I had my ultrasound, I found out that my conception date lined up with me being raped. I was mostly asleep when it happened, so I didn't know if the rapist used a condom or not. I was devastated. I had no idea of my child was from rape or not. That, and dealing with my ex, who again, was far more unsavory than I knew or realized, completely tanked me and left me suicidal all the time.   \n\n18. In short. I made it through. I did not abort because I found out the conception date after I would've been comfortable aborting. I did not get a choice. I gave birth, then a social worker spoke to me. They said there was nothing wrong, this is normal. They then decided, after being very nice and supportive to me, saying I was going to be a great mother, that I could not take my child home. Why? There was no precise reason that made sense, and it always changed, but in the secret planning meeting that first revealed that they were not letting me have my child (not from the rapist, btw, which alleviated my biggest concerns and left me feeling free and ready to live and care for my chlid and future), the social worker who interviewed me for 2+ hours and said I'd be a good mom, said I wanted to kill my child, post partum. I was shocked. I had referred to suicide while pregnant as murder, because that's why my religious mother calls it, but I had also said I never did it (kill myself and \"my child\") because I didn't want to harm the child and they didn't deserve it. But the worker saying that's what I said was enough for them to take my child from me. I had an extensive support and health team that had built personal relationships with me. Help I had sought and sorted on my own. They all trusted me and believed in me. I worked so hard on fixing myself and my life once I found out I was pregnant. But the social worker refused letters from these professionals, saying she'd get it later. She called my psychiatrist, and asked him, \"If she's wanting to harm the child, would you recommend the child not go home with her?\" He said if that was the case, then yes. The social worker told me that my psych had said I wanted to harm and kill my child, when I asked her why they took my child from the hospital and put them in foster care (a bunch of weird things happened, that hospital staff willingly shared were abnormal processes)(I had come back to see my child at the hospital cuz they were going to let my mom take care of my baby. They put my baby in foster care without notifying me. The social worker told lies like she was tossing out candy at a parade). I told her that was not possible, that he would never say that, because it wasn't true. I never wanted to harm my child. She then said she was tired and didn't want to talk to me.   \n\n19. They banned me from breastfeeding, possibly illegally. I was only allowed supervised visits once or twice a week, I don't remember the schedule, but it was only 2-3 hours a visit, supervised. I had to pump all the time, I was empty and hopeless and could only think, \"my baby, my baby, why did they take my baby. I want my baby. Why don't I have my baby.\" My milk supply was drying up. 3 months, limited supervised visits were maintained. Anytime I tried to ask the social workers why I didn't have my child, they would refuse to answer or give a vague non-answer that changed with every ask. Saying to discuss it in court - but in court, I was not allowed to talk. I could never talk to my state appointed lawyer except for the briefing just before or after court dates. No one, none of the moms I met, came to a court date. No one brought me food or visited me. In fact, I feel like I was a burden to some of the moms involved in the birthing community. The group I met them at ended up making rules disallowing the sort of help they provided me a yearish later, and the moms in the birthing community I thought were my friends were on the board of the group. I do feel the rules were made precisely because of me. They said they couldn't put the burden on other moms with my sort of ask. As if their lives with their partners and careers were of the same level of me having my child taken from me at birth for no valid reason.   \n\n20. After that, I had to move in with my mom, and my landlord forced me to move out after being there for almost years because rent prices were exploding and she wanted to capitalize on the inflating housing market. The court ordered I couldn't be left alone with my child. My mom always had to supervise or take my child. We never really got to live on own. It was a year before they closed my case. All the social workers were nice and confident in me, and even mentioned how horrible something my ex did that landed him in jail. But it was sealed, I think, so they wouldn't tell me, and said they hoped my child's father could be in my kid's life. He didn't want to be. He knew he couldn't be a healthy or appropriate father. I had already known from when I found out I was pregnant it was just going to be me. I thought things were going to be great until that ultra sound. Even then, I worked on prepping the house, getting clothes and toys, turning my bedroom into the baby's bedroom.   \n\n21. After my last ex left me, the one I've been talking about, I couldn't stop crying most of the time. I lost my job at a restaurant that I loved after 3 months because my sous chef couldn't handle me crying ever week at work in the kitchen. They were vague, saying they needed someone who could \"keep up\" with the kitchen, when previously, they said I was killing it, and that I might even be upper level material. My autism is partly responsible for this - I didn't communicate to them how my autism affects my processing and methods for doing things, and I hadn't even thought about how it would be an issue. So again - penalized for me being me. As was the situation where my child was taken away. I won't go into that story, but it was my prenatal professional who reported me months before i was due to give birth, for reasons I don't understand. She always had a weird vibe, but my options were limited, and I didn't think I had other options for prenatal support.   \n\n22. I have learned to not trust anyone. I have been severely harmed and penalized for things I do not understand or did not do. I have no friends. My relationship with my child is severely damaged, because I have PTSD from what happened with him at birth. The social worker and her employer were corrupt, and the oversight agency said that what they did was correct, and I had to just keep following rules. Even a well respected judge knew about the social worker who lied; her reputation preceeded her and I had to say very little for the judge to supposedly guess who landed me in this litigation. How everyone could be so two faced and kind and supportive, and then fight to terminate my parental rights (as this is what they were attempting to do from the start). No one, most parents, do not understand what this is like. I am scared of everyone and everything. Every knock at the door. If my kid is not in line with a supervising adult's eye. If they scream, lie on the ground, or aren't wearing a coat. I am scared someone will call and tell them that they need to check on my child, and that I will lose them forever.  \n\n23. Ever since the protests started happening, my mental state took a huge dip. Depression overwhelming, Emotionally, overwhelmed. I am marginalized on many counts, and I feel so strongly for the marginalized and oppressed. Understanding the deep levels of human separation I experience is not something many can understand, but those who are severely oppressed, I feel we know what it's like for a seemingly unreasonable fear that tints everything to float over us, invisible to others, but not to us. Others don't realize that when I speak, they're not really hearing or understanding how deep this is in me or us. I am so many things that so many hateful people hate and deride. I have failed in life. I applied for SSDI around the time I got pregnant, and was approved on first try by the end of the year. I personally make very little on SSDI. The cost of an apartment is usually more than what I make on my own. My child's money is the only thing that makes our lives affordable, but not affordable enough to live on our own. I could start to believe in hope again (not that that's enough) if we could afford our own place. But I don't see that happening at all in my life unless we move states, and that is not feasible. I have very limited opportunities as a disabled individual.   \n\n24. People from hs sometime over the years have unfriended me on fb. I have lost every friend, and any friend was usually brief. I cannot trust anyone, ever, for anything, and I don't know if I can ever fix that. Life is a risk until my child is grown. I can't get over my rapes, how I was stupid, how every relationship was toxic at minimum, how I've had impactful consequences for me being me, how my mom refuses to respect me (she has outright said she refuses to, as I am her child), gaslights me because she is unable or unwilling to face her own traumas, threatens me with my biggest triggers from time to time, clearly unable to understand how serious the matters she pokes me on are for me, despite her being there with me for the experience with my child (the social worker lied about my mom too, about really odd things). I had indepence, and I don't anymore, and I don't know if I ever will anymore.   \n\n25. But back to point 23 - between covid 19 disrupting everyone's lives and the protests and my life and experiences and predispositions and friendlessness and broken ability to trust, I just don't see the patterns changing. I don't see hope. I don't know how I am supposed to achieve fundamental foundations from Maslow's Hierarchy when I am at a low financial value to society. It's all so much to bear. I'm basically an agoraphobe, and because I am balancing so much, trying to find a balance between being ok and finding ways to fix my biggest problems, I am not able to be present for my child the way I know I could be if they hadn't ripped them from me unjustly. No one can understand the pain of that, and it others me so deeply I feel I can't relate to others and feel like I have to hide the depths of the scars and the crevices that go deep within me. I feel like another creature. So close, but different just enough to never just be with others. I keep working on it, I keep telling myself I don't have to think like this, that I will feel different tomorrow, that I can be \"normal\" (normal means standardized levels and expectations per society, not that elusive and undefined \"normal\" that everyone says does not exist.). But you know what. I don't think I have enough life in me and carveable marble to reach a truly sustained better day. I used to be able to go into the city every month or two for a few days. Eat great food, enjoy the music scene or art scene. Experience that autonomy and introverted socialization by simply being around colorful, diverse people. My mom blames me for things, and she lowkey hates my autism, and is not able to understand how it functions to the point that she doesn't feel like my autistic features are an attack on her. I have executive dysfunction, but because i am so good at looking \"normal\" and nice and am articulate and intelligent (per others)(because I often feel stupid stupid stupid, especially because I can't do any of the things that I waste my life thinking about and analyzing), and no one, not even my therapist or mom, understands how much I struggle to do simple things, like brush my teeth every day, shower regularly, or finish laundry. It sounds stupid, but it's really difficult to maintain those things the way others can.   \n\n\n  \n\n\nI went above the 40,000 character count.
