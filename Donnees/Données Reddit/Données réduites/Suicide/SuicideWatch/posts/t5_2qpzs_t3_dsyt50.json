Non-committal, indecisive, tired of self and others.  I have been working with therapist, dr, and wife for a couple years when new suicidal thoughts took over.  (depression/anxiety = old issue, suicide fantasy = fairly new for me...and getting very very strong)   \n\nI havent tried that hard.  Tried strangling myself just to snap myself out of it and got caught.  I suspect if really wanted to, i would have done something more permanent.   (see above--indecisive).\n\nDon't know why i am posting.  I have no question to ask.  Its the internet so, i guess i feel just brave enough to admit--this fuckin sucks & i cant fathom it getting better.  I feel as tho my expectations are too high for life and i should start over (or get off the ride).   Literally have to convince myself every single day to get up and carry on.  Anger is my only motivator.  \n\nShotgun to mouth?  Religion?  Get sober?
