Eight years and three months ago, when I was 21, I bought a .40 caliber pistol and exploding rounds. I \"practiced\" shooting myself with the unloaded gun repeatedly, and loaded it with the rounds. I picked a location, and decided to do it one morning at 3 A.M. in my apartment bathtub. \n\nAfter spending some time lying in the bathtub thinking, I eventually decided not to kill myself right then. I thought about all the things I would miss out on, and made a deal with myself. I would give myself until my 30th birthday, and if nothing improved, I'd kill myself then. Knowing that I eventually had a way out from what I was feeling gave me real hope. I've clung to this as a ward against suicidal behavior ever since. \n\nI turn 30 in about four months. I thought that getting a great education and a good paying job would help. After struggling through years of poverty, I am, by all societal standards, quite successful. I'm still miserable. I have tried an array of psychotropic medications, including prescribed anti-depressants. None of this has helped. \n\nFundamentally, I don't see the point of continuing to live. I am understandably afraid of hurting the people that I love; this fear is the primary thing that has motivated me to stay alive this long. I don't believe that there is anything beyond this life, and I have experienced pretty much everything that I think I need to in order to make an informed decision. I've delayed doing anything for a number of years, and I think that the desire to kill myself will be pretty overwhelming after my self-imposed deadline. I still can't deal with the world or my life or my depression. \n\nAt this point, I am strongly considering jumping from a bridge several miles from my home that will virtually guarantee my death, either by impact or drowning soon after impact. \n\nBasically, I guess this is a question for those of you who have chosen to live: what kept you from going through with it? Is there anyone else who has dealt with basically life-long depression and has not been helped significantly by drugs? What did you do to deal with it?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1ljx6y/ive_been_thinking_of_killing_myself_for_more_than/", "title": "I've been thinking of killing myself for more than 10 years.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "OnlyGoesOneWay", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1378089329, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1ljx6y/ive_been_thinking_of_killing_myself_for_more_than/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425265.405081, "replies_charged": false}
