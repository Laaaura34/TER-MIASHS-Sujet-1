QuArANtInE has fucked everything and my life and my girlfriend who was with me since four years just broke up with me... I really know if I let myself feel everything then I'm gonna go into self destructive mode and I don't really wanna do that but I really wanna do that at the same time... So I'm just not gonna let anything inside me for now and I'm just gonna blast Skrillex in full sound to keep me from thinking..... If I succeeded for a month, I'll let you all know and if I don't then nobody could have prevented it anyways so I don't really blame anyone for it..... I really really love my family but I cant talk to them and have them worry about me too in this hard time..... I really hope I make it through...... I haven't had the courage to do it before so hopefully I won't have the courage this time too.... \n\n\n-Walid", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gopicv/its_talking_a_lot_of_me_to_not_self_destruct/", "title": "It's talking a lot of me to not self destruct", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "walidansari", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1590174048, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gopicv/its_talking_a_lot_of_me_to_not_self_destruct/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422551.1760743, "replies_charged": false}
