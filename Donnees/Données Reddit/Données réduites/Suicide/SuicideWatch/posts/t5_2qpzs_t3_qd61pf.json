When she gets treated with the same energy she acts like it is such a big deal. She\u2019s a fucking loonitic bitch. She always escalates the situation and when people escalate wen she escalates it, she\u2019s the one who goes fucking mad. When she is being a sassy little bitch to someone and someone treats them with the same energy, she gets all defensive. She never sees herself in the wrong. That\u2019s what I fucking hate about her. I hate most things about that egotistical little stupid bitch.\nThat\u2019s her main goal. A reaction. All she wants is to get a reaction out of you. Then when she gets it her ego is satisfied. All she ever does is cause drama. I\u2019m tired of dealing with her constant bitchiness and constant drama starting. I want to fucking leave. I fucking hate this house she never shuts the fuck up. She is always fucking arguing with someone. She never chills the fuck out. I wish I had chill parents. I wish I had normal parents. I wish I had a normal fucking life.\n\nShe does the exact same shit that I am going to court with my dad over child abuse over but on a smaller scale. It\u2019s fucking ironic because she does the stuff she complains that he does and did to her. I guess that\u2019s how it works because victims always spread the pain to other victims. That\u2019s why people become bullies. She is a bully.\n\nAll she wants is to cause drama and wants a fucking reaction. Yes I got into an arguement with her tonight which she escalated. I kept my cool until the very end because I got mad at how she was mistreating me even though she was the one in the wrong. So I got an attitude with her because she told me to \u201cchill out\u201d even though she\u2019s the one who escalated the shit to begin with, and so I told her \u201cyou need to chill out.\u201d Then she started laughing and I said \u201csorry.\u201d For saying that. Then she walked away laughing because her ego was satisfied, and she went ironically to cause a fucking arguement witt my sisters next. I stormed to the bathroom and said \u201cman I need a break.\u201d Now I am here, typing this in the shower. Man I wish that my parents were my teachers from school. I love them.\n\nThe bullshit she does stresses me and everyone the fuck out.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for all of this cursing it legit just happened a few minutes ago. And sorry if I am in the wrong or I seem like a spoiled brat. I just wish my life was normal.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qd61pf/nevermind_my_mood_has_been_brought_down_again_i/", "title": "Nevermind.
