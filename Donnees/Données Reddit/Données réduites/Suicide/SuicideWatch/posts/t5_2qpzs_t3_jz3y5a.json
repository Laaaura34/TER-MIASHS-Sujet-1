I\u2019m scared because I don\u2019t know how I much I can actually help her or be there for her. Maybe I\u2019m still taking it all in, I just found out yesterday, but I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m scared and I\u2019m ashamed. I wish I was stronger, or better, or not broke. I know she\u2019s gonna need help, I want to help her, I know in my heart I will I\u2019m just wondering how the fuck I\u2019M going to handle all of this. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s wondering the same thing herself. She already has Parkinson\u2019s disease and has had it for well over a decade. Not really sure why the universe / God / whoever decided to give her cancer.\n\nIt\u2019s somewhat early on (Stage II), so it\u2019s going to be *somewhat* manageable, but obviously she\u2019s still going to have to do chemo and radiation therapy.\n\nI\u2019m just jot ready. I\u2019m not ready for this. I know she isn\u2019t either, I know, I get it. I know she wants her sons and husband to be there for her and we are, I\u2019m just lost. I\u2019m lost and angry and confused and I can barely even get out of bed how can I help others? I can\u2019t even help myself, I can\u2019t even really help the \u201cfriends\u201d or \u201cfamily\u201d I have that DON\u2019T have cancer or Parkinson\u2019s. The truth is that I want to die. That\u2019s the truth. But I can\u2019t. Not now. It isn\u2019t my time right now, it is my Mother\u2019s, but I don\u2019t want to face it. I don\u2019t want to face anything. My suicidal thoughts aren\u2019t wholly circumstantial, but they are being exacerbated by things like this.\n\nI\u2019m selfish. I know I\u2019m selfish. My Mom is about to get very sick and I\u2019m just here twiddling my thumbs thinking of suicide. I did apply for some jobs today so I guess there\u2019s that, but she talked to my brother and I today just letting us know we\u2019re gonna have to contribute more and do more and be more and be better. I\u2019m not better. I\u2019m not ready for this. I\u2019m not ready for the responsibility and I\u2019m not ready to see my Mother in chemotherapy. I\u2019m selfish. I know. I\u2019m painfully aware of my flaws. There\u2019s a lot of them so it\u2019s a lot to keep up with.\n\nThe bottom line is this: I feel so bad for her. I feel bad for her but sometimes people with MDD or serious depression lack empathy. Not in the sense that they don\u2019t CARE, but more in the sense that they often struggle to see the world outside of themselves because they are so closed in, so tunnel vision, so fixated on everything that is / could possibly go / be going wrong. I am that way. I have no outlet. I have no people that I truly trust, other than I guess my Mom. Therapists don\u2019t help me. Medication barely helps me. I have nothing to reframe my mind, gather myself, gain insight, regroup mentally, get some fucking piece of mind. I have none of that, and nothing helps me. I know this probably just makes me sound like a shitty person, and I already know I am, so, whatever, but, I wish I could just kill myself already, I don\u2019t believe in myself and I don\u2019t have ANY faith or hope for the future.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jz3y5a/my_mom_got_breast_cancer/", "title": "My Mom got breast cancer", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ontheshortnessoflife", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1606080543, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jz3y5a/my_mom_got_breast_cancer/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428161.2337291, "replies_charged": false}
