I had it since 19 but at age 21 I began taking Prozac for OCD and depression but it basically quelled the arousal. I never told my psychiatrist about my PGAD. But the past few months the arousal has come back and it's intense for hours at a time. I\u2019m often late to seeing friends because I am busy at home quelling the arousal. I recently tried rubbing lidocaine down there but it only helped a little bit. I am in a PGAD support group on FB and many users say their doctors have never heard of PGAD. Plus I have bad insurance so the suggested treatments I found online like electroconvulsive therapy or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation I can't afford. I'm really considering suicide because I just don't want to live like this. I know they say \"suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem\" but this problem is not temporary, and I don't know if I will find treatment. I would never consider suicide if I knew the problem would eventually get better. I really don't want to end my life but I don't want to live with the pain either and if that's the only way to end it, then so be it.
