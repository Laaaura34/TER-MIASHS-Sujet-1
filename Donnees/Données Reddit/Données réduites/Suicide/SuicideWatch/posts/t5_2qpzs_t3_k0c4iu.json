I know comparison can be toxic when one's mental health is at the lowest of the low.\n\nBut where I stand, it drives me crazy how being 'their' kind of normal is like climbing Mount Everest for me. I want to get out of the poverty. All I have got is zero body confidence, a manchild personality, a dysfunctional family which never really prepared me for life's challenges, an ill father who still tries his best he can to provide.\n\nBesides that, no friends, no money, no enthusiasm. The loneliness is taking to my head. I'm apathetic. I'm a coward. I have got an insurance which covers my death with ~10 Million of currency units in my country (which isn't much in terms of USD). Suicide is not covered for 1 year since the issuance date. I don't want to think about ending it, but it's what my mind ruminates about all day, even at work. I just want to go to sleep and be done.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/k0c4iu/its_too_funny/", "title": "It's too funny", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dpr55nThr0w4w4y", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1606246813, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/k0c4iu/its_too_funny/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428067.1447253, "replies_charged": false}
