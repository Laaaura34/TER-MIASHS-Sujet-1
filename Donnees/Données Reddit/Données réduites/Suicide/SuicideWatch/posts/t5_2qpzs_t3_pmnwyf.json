I even remember writing suicide notes in the 6th grade, I had one of those little diaries with a lock and key. \nBut I feel like I\u2019m super fucked by this one time in my life. \n\nI started dating this guy, who was a big manipulator and abuser, just after a massive surgery that caused me ptsd. Dropped out of high school for 2 years, switched schools 10+ times, and developed a ton of anxiety. Dated this guy from age 14-19, also a really big time in a young persons life. I don\u2019t know why I stayed, I guess I thought I was in love lol. \n\nI was doing alright with myself near the end of our relationship, as I was pretty emotionally checked out. But I fainted, got a massive concussion, and had to drop out of nursing. I left him a few days after that happened. I got stalked for what felt like I year until I never heard anything again. \n\nI\u2019m overwhelmed with flash backs of him. All the shit he did to me runs through my mind constantly. It\u2019s been over 3 years since I\u2019ve seen or spoken to him, and I\u2019m in a decent relationship with a wonderful person, but I feel like I can\u2019t escape. And it\u2019s very hard to explain my feelings past this. Whenever my partner asks why I\u2019m crying, or even when I ask myself, I have no answer. \n\nI feel like I carry this weight around with me and I can\u2019t get rid of it. I have barely any motivation, I haven\u2019t went back to school, I hate having to get up in the mornings for work, and I honestly just want to end it all. I stay awake at night itching to self harm, I haven\u2019t in years but I\u2019ve put a razor to my arm multiple times recently just to feel something. I also think about checking myself into psych all the time but can\u2019t even muster up a bit of motivation to tell anyone.  \n\nI just want to end it all, I want this feeling to stop. I know I won\u2019t do it though, but I think my fire is about to burn out.
