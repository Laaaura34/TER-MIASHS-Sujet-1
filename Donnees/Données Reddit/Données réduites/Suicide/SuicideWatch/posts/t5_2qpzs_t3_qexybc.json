I didn\u2019t realize till i was at customs that it was missing. They told me that the passport was on its way up am hour ago but now they\u2019re saying the flight left and i have to wait all night. Ive lost an iPhone and airpods before. Ive spilled bleach on expensive clothes. I allowed a laptop to be damaged. I have adhd and im on medication but it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s doing any good. \n\nI meditate. I try really hard to keep things in the same spot and keep things clean and nothing works. All my friends left. I am alone at this airport i have no idea when the plane with the passport will come back. I want to swallow all my medication and never wake up. Im clearly worthless and i ruin everything i touch. There\u2019s no hope for me.\n\nEDIT: The airline found my passport I just feel like a big idiot for leaving it on the plane in the first place.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qexybc/im_a_failure_and_an_idiot_i_dont_deserve_to_be/", "title": "I\u2019m a failure and an idiot.
