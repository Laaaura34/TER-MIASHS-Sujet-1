And my choir teacher voluntold me for some more for me to study to help her with her other choir that I wasn\u2019t obligated to help with.\n\nI am so burnt out, I haven\u2019t had a day with nothing planned since three weeks ago. And the work keeps coming. I wonder if I died if people will grieve me or grieve the fact that my commitments won\u2019t be fulfilled. Do I need to start opening up to explain why I cannot take on more work and need help? Or would that institutionalize me where I sit in a hospital for two weeks while my grades slip and work backlog increases.\n\nHumans were not meant to be productive this much. I\u2019m not even going to get good enough sleep to make it through the day ahead, I\u2019ll probably break down in my 4.5 hours of classes. Not to mention the two hours I\u2019ll spend walking. When have I done enough that I get an actual break from this cycle without the risk of feeling guilty for not working through it?\n\nI want to go home, but even there I have to work. I can never take a break, there\u2019s always more. When is this not what life is? I can\u2019t even get a full 8 hours of sleep, my schedule goes so far that it makes it actually impossible", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pz2kys/when_will_it_be_enough/", "title": "When will it be enough?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "63628depressed", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633071479, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pz2kys/when_will_it_be_enough/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427972.4905157, "replies_charged": false}
