They know about my history of mental illness and previous hospitalizations. I do live with them after all. For now. \n\nAnyway, now my brother won't be able to sleep easy tonight thanks to me abusing my little support system, and my mom's already sleeping, snoring away without concern because she never thinks I'd do such a thing as to KILL MYSELF because she believes in Jesus. :)\n\nSo tomorrow, the plan is to get to the gun store and purchase my first and last firearm. Wait 10 days. And then KABLOOEY, what a sight to behold. And I'm not going to be like that woman who shot from the chin up and blew only her face off and survived. Even if I do mess it up, I'll just be incapacitated and drown anyway. That's called preparing things properly. \n\nI cannot contain my excitement.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qal9bs/now_that_ive_brought_down_the_mood_time_to_prepare/", "title": "Now that I've brought down the mood, time to prepare", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "hopelesspeasant", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634558422, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qal9bs/now_that_ive_brought_down_the_mood_time_to_prepare/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427603.1849408, "replies_charged": false}
