I'm not gonna elaborate on my story, it's a complex and really fucked up one, im affected by chronic health issues completely out of my control and as a result my mental health has spiralled. I dont have a single friend. Im a high school dropout as a result. However I was once a straight A student honours student with interests in history, philosophy, psychology, art music  with a social circle and extra curriculars.Most people dont know how to empathize, but one thing I can say is that I was born absolutely innocent ,happy and loving, creative  , and connected  into this world fuelled with optimism for the journey of life  and it completely fucking ruined me. I loved people, but in turn they ruined me and I fucking hate them.  I didn't choose to be born in this hellhole.   This place completely killed me. I'm living because of survival instinct, which is my biggest weakness , but even that is slowly dying , day by day . One year ago I was not suicidal and could not even contemplate it. Today, I have to make a strategic effort to leave any items/tools/ out of my room to avoid killing myself. I'm not sure why I'm posting because I dont wanna be talked out of it .", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hezqqe/does_anyone_know_the_lethal_dose_of_ativan/", "title": "Does anyone know the lethal dose of ativan?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwaway372Eu", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1592999903, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hezqqe/does_anyone_know_the_lethal_dose_of_ativan/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427421.2011824, "replies_charged": false}
