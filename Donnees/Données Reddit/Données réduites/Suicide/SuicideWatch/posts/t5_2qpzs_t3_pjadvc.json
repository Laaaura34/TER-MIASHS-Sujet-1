The dog belonged to other people for 4 months until we got him. They kept him in a basement and didn\u2019t show him to any other people. He is 9 months now. His name is Duke. He growls at people and even bites. When we first got him I got really stressed as we already have another dog named Daisy. I wanted a second dog but I told my family we shouldn\u2019t get him until we move because we had to move in July. They didn\u2019t listen, go into a fight and got him. Then on the day we moved it was my dad\u2019s birthday. We got him a chocolate cake. When we moved my parents go into another fight and Duke ate the cake. We rushed around (me and my dad) and there was a lot of screaming. He was losing his mind. I think that is when the growling started. Different environment, the yelling, olus he wasnmt socialized before that. Its only gotten worse. He bit my sister because she went really close to him. My family hates him now. Its not his fault. He is going to training soon but the trainers recommend aggressive methods like grabing their paws and yelling. My dad recommended that too. I think it only makes them worse. I think he is afriad of people. I know he will be put down. Killed\n\n. Indon\u2019t think I can live with myself if that happens. The shame and guilt will kill me", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pjadvc/guilt/", "title": "Guilt", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bdjsmskamam", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630968316, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pjadvc/guilt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426179.819577, "replies_charged": false}
