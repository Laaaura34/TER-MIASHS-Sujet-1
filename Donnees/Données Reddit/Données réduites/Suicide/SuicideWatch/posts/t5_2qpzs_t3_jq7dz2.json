Schools here lock people for weeks and weeks, forcing us to sleep for 6 hours or less each day, putting enormous amount of pressure on us, just for a stupid exam three years later that enrolls us into different colleges. [The NCEE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_College_Entrance_Examination) forced us into useless competition with peers that resulted in nothing but stupidity and exhaustion. We live like pigs in pens, gulping down useless knowledge, pretending to be obedient and machine like, so we can be enrolled into the best prestigious colleges in Beijing and Shanghai.\n\nI hate myself for living in a totalitarian country, pretending to be furious about foreign countries declaring ROC independency or backing up Hong Kong, pretending to love the only leader Xi on stage, where he acts like a clown, and everybody except me cheers. I live in a country that sees its people as pigs, pigs that never want spiritual freedom.\n\nI performed several suicide attempts and none worked. One time I try to pry open the dorm window and got caught by the patrols, which warned me that they will get fired for my actions. Several teachers warned me of the same message. Nobody cared about me. I feel like a coward. I have already cut myself on the arm for relief. I want to jump off the top of the dorm tonight.\n\nUTC+8 Nov 8 14:56 China", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jq7dz2/i_dont_know_what_i_desire/", "title": "I don't know what I desire", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Mdtski", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1604818735, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jq7dz2/i_dont_know_what_i_desire/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422316.3724334, "replies_charged": false}
