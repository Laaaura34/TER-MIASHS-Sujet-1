I planned to cut circulation from my arm and cut my wrist using a box cutter, that way the pain wouldn\u2019t make me hesitate the slash but only my will would. I\u2019ve often meditated on how I would do it. Any method that would inhibit any conflicting thoughts that would prevent me from doing it. \n\nI feel as if no one truly feels anything for me and thus i don\u2019t feel anything for myself. Im a people person and thrive off of knowing that i do good and people in turn do the same good will to me. But every time i do a good, there is a bitter feeling i get from the person im being kind to. I reflect on the faces and (for lack of a better term) aura i get from people, and its negative. As if they are disgusted or see me as a parasite and a good-for-nothing. Even significant others look at me with with the same face as well. A concerned face, that says \u201ctheres something wrong with you and i should distance myself from you\u201d. \n\nI see myself develop relationships with people to find them distancing themselves from me in the end. It seems like they never have a thought to include me in anything. In truth, I have a hard time clicking with anyone. I withhold any expression in fear of being judged negatively for what I enjoy. Simply put, I feel like an outcast because of it. As someone who you would avoid and wouldn\u2019t want to associate with. I cant break this mental shell that i put over myself. Only doing what i think would make people like me rather than what i enjoy doing, and im very tired of doing it but i cant stop something that ive been doing for so long. \n\nI\u2019m here to vent out to anyone and no-one. Shouting through text what I won\u2019t do physically. Just knowing that someone read this, in my mind, is better than keeping it hidden away.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ha2baq/just_talking_about_my_feelings_and_hopefully/", "title": "Just talking about my feelings and hopefully casting away negative thoughts", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Skakunga", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1592307501, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ha2baq/just_talking_about_my_feelings_and_hopefully/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426423.5164979, "replies_charged": false}
