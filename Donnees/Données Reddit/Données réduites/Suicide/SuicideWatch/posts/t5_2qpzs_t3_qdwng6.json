I'm tired, my mental health is suffering a lot right now and I'm isolated. I don't want to talk about it but the long short is I have no way to get help and I don't want suggestions, it hurts because I've tried so much to no avail. I'm just... Burnt out man. It's been a long, long road. It's not even about the pandemic, it's just solely about my life and my family and my situation. My body is wasting away and I'm miserable. There's... So much I want to do but can't. I just... Want to die. That's it. That's all. I wish someone could just... Hold me and speak to core of my being to make me understand there's still warmth somewhere on earth. I don't feel a lot outside of the anger anymore. I stopped crying for a long time now and I'm just... Numb from all the emotional burnout. There's never a break from any of it. My coping method is so helpful but so isolating because I don't trust anyone to help me anymore. I'm scared of getting hurt again and again and again. I'm so tired I'm sorry but I'm still trying my hardest to stay here for those I promised", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qdwng6/im_not_doing_great_and_im_tired_of_lying_about_it/", "title": "I'm not doing great and I'm tired of lying about it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Amaiyoru", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634958835, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qdwng6/im_not_doing_great_and_im_tired_of_lying_about_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426313.3400905, "replies_charged": false}
