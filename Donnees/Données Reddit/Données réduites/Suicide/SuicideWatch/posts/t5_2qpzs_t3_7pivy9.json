I'm extremely socially inhibited and I have barely any friends as a result of this. Having a conversation with people is very hard for me and I feel absolutely hopeless. I feel as if people like me are not cut out to live in this world; how can you live a decent life if you can't connect with anyone? It seems like every route of getting help involves calling someone on the phone and that's a very intimidating concept. I hate calling people for menial life stuff and I really hate the idea of calling someone and saying \"Hello, yes, I am severely suicidally depressed and I need any form of human contact to proceed with trying to live.\" The psychiatric services at my college involve a 20 minute phone call and that sounds hellish. I'm familiar with the Crisis Text Line but I feel like, with my situation, I need some long term care. Care that involves rigorous testing and someone who can truly see what kind of monster is inside my brain. I realize that this is a very lame issue and that fact makes me hate myself even more. There are people who can help me and I can't even call them on the phone without all the signals in my brain firing off and making me panic.
