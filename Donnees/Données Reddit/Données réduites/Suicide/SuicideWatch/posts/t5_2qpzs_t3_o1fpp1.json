I was called trash and such and i also feel lots of embarrassment and it's killing me. I can't stop thinking about it. I find relief that i am a decent person etc. but it only lasts for a day or two and then back to usual thing. My breathing is different after ruminating it feels like breathing after stress and it lasts for a couple of days.\n\nThis thing has been lasting for year and a half. Its killing me sometimes i just wish a truck hit me or something.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o1fpp1/real_event_ocd_is_ruining_me/", "title": "Real event OCD is ruining me.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Virusattribute0", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623878075, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o1fpp1/real_event_ocd_is_ruining_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428037.2084742, "replies_charged": false}
