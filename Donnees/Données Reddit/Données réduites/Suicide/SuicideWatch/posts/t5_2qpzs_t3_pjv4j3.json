I joke a lot about that stuff to cope (I think) so usually people laugh about it with me but it\u2019s the first time that it was taken very seriously. I know that I can\u2019t really do anything about theses toughts and symptoms but idk. It feels weird and I feel kinda guilty about making her THAT worried \u2026.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pjv4j3/guilt/", "title": "Guilt", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Flimsy-Beginning-206", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631046138, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pjv4j3/guilt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426179.5147104, "replies_charged": false}
