Over the weekend, I had gotten blackout drunk and probably traumatized my friend; I couldn't remember anything. My friend recounted that I seemed deeply suicidal. I had continuously said things along the lines of \"I'm ok with just dying right now\" and \"If I jumped in \\[to the rocky lake\\] head first, no one would miss me\". I didn't try to jump, but I fell over from lack of motor control and scraped off a good chunk of skin. I was told that I became really dark and asked them \"why are they here, they should just go\" and \"let me just die\".\n\nI'm terrified of what was going on in my head when I lost control and this is deeply disturbing to me. I can say that I'm not depressed and, other than regular life stresses (maybe a bit higher right now because I'm searching for a job), I am a pretty positive person. This dark side of me was something I never expected and I don't even want to think what would have happened if my friend wasn't there; they were just as shocked when my personality completely changed.\n\nHas anyone been through this type of experience? I know alcohol removes inhibitions; is this who I really am or was it an acute brain chemistry imbalance? I know I should never drink like that again, but it worries me that this dark side takes over when I lose control.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/c5nhf2/suicidal_when_blackout_drunk/", "title": "Suicidal when blackout drunk", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "suomynona_gniyats", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1561539546, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/c5nhf2/suicidal_when_blackout_drunk/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426441.6242647, "replies_charged": false}
