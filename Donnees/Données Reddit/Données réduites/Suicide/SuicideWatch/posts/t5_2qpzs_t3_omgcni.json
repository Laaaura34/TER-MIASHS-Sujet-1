I'm not exactly sure how this started, but I can recall at a very young age picturing myself jumping off bridges to my death. Like I stated earlier, I'm not certain why that would pop into the head of a 4th grader. Maybe it had something to do with the physical and emotional abuse I received at a very young age, and I was subconsciously realizing that committing suicide was probably my only way to escape it. \n\nAs I've gotten older, I've found 'better reasons' to kill myself, those mainly being my failings as person. I've only ever really discussed these feelings with 2 people. One encourages me to look past my pain and keep pushing forward. The other.. well.. they've had it rough too, and at one point we made a suicide pact. \n\nI just feel like... I've always been at war with myself, trying to see the 'beauty of living' as some people would call it, while simultaneously making preparations for where and how my body will be found, or if I should go in a manner that would do away with my corpse completely. \n\nI don't know where I was going with this, I just know that it's a struggle living like this. And even if I don't have any real hope for myself, I do for all of you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/omgcni/im_already_regretting_typing_this_vent/", "title": "I'm already regretting typing this (vent)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Kakaditz", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626569185, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/omgcni/im_already_regretting_typing_this_vent/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427700.7853975, "replies_charged": false}
