I can't even talk to my friends much less my parents my brain is so inhibited by every little insecurity i have that every time i talk about myself my problems my life my mind draws a huge blank and i cant find what to say. In fact when im surrounded with people, it feels as though my problems disappear, but not in a good way, it just feels as though i cant feel them because if i feel them it will show and i dont want anyone to know. i'm so ashamed of myself but what for? i'm ashamed of everything about myself, everything i have ever said and done.\n\nI don't even know if it's insecurities??? what's wrong with me how am i supposed to live like this? why am i even like this? i havent suffered trauma i havent been abused or treated like shit, yet i'm still. like. this. why? how?\n\n???\n\nI dont want to exist but i dont want to die, I don't want my parents to outlive their daughter, dont want my friends to know. why was i born?
