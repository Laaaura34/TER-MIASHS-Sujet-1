Out of rage from his sadistic and hurtful insults, I texted him to kill himself.  I immediately deleted the message after, but he screenshotted it.  Now, over a year later, he is claiming that he is suicidal and my statement has seriously affected his mental health over the past year.  He told his girlfriend (who is my best friend) that she cant speak to me anymore because of the ways I affected him.  (He is also lying about the extent of it and pretending I badgered him multiple times to kill himself and told him how to do it). \n\nAnyways my question is, that if he was in fact suicidal, would my one statement obviously made out of rage, and immediately regretted, affect his mental health a year later?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lrbne0/would_telling_a_suicidal_person_to_kill/", "title": "Would telling a suicidal person to kill themselves (out of anger) make them want to?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "OnlyIce9350", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614169584, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lrbne0/would_telling_a_suicidal_person_to_kill/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426828.3332987, "replies_charged": false}
