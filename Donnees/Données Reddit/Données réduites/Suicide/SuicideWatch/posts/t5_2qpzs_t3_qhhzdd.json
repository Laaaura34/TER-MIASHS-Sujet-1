To the point where my housemates are waking up at the time I'm usually going to sleep. Tonight was particularly bad as my night hours were consumed with suicidal thoughts about drowning myself. It got to around 7:30am and I saw the bright sky outside my window, and I decided to take an early morning walk. I'm not sure if subconsciously I was thinking that it would clear my head but I think it did, even if just a little bit. I walked past a bakery and bought a chocolate croissant for breakfast. It reminded me that there are good things to stay alive for. \n\nIt's currently 8:58am, and I'm in bed at home. I'll hopefully be able to get some sleep now, even if it's not for long. Just wanted to share this sweet moment I had, with you all.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qhhzdd/i_couldnt_sleep_because_of_my_suicidal_thoughts/", "title": "I couldn't sleep because of my suicidal thoughts, so I went for an early morning walk.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Roma_a", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635408088, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qhhzdd/i_couldnt_sleep_because_of_my_suicidal_thoughts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427311.0964665, "replies_charged": false}
