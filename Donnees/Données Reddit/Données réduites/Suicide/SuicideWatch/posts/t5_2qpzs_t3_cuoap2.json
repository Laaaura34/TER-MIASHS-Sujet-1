When he\u2019s by himself and stuck in his own mind he drives himself crazy and the bad thoughts consume him. It\u2019s fascinating that most people that commit suicide or have depression are the nicest people you\u2019ll ever meet and care about others more than they care about themselves. Often times these people are very creative and artists as well. I listened back through all the tracks that I\u2019ve produced and you can just tell I\u2019m fucking dying inside. The vibe is so melancholy and relaxing. The only time I\u2019m happy is when I\u2019m channeling my emotions through music - or surrounded by other people. \n\nI\u2019ve dug the hole too deep to climb out this time. Ive lost all motivation for life and success. I\u2019m days away from probably losing everything I\u2019ve ever worked for. I\u2019m not even sure how I got this far into depression and into my thoughts. It\u2019s such a dark and lonely place to be and to be honest, I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m scared that I don\u2019t care about myself. I\u2019m scared that I don\u2019t care about anyone or anything. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened to me. \n\nI wish I knew what I\u2019ve done so wrong in life to deserve this. I\u2019ve always tried my hardest to help everyone that I can, to be there for other people, to make others laugh and feel good about themselves. Even when my life was going good I would dedicate time to offer advice on this very sub and many others to anyone who just needed someone to be there for them. I know how it feels to feel alone and I don\u2019t want anyone to ever feel like that. \n\nThe majority of my time is spent alone - in an apartment that used to hold so much happiness but is now empty and devoid of all things positive. My mind is such a scary place to be and I fucking hate being here.\n\nPeople that used to be apart of my life have moved on. They have families of their own now and their own life. They have weekend getaways and marriage plans. They have a career and a stable income. They are surrounded by love and support. They have parents and siblings and they\u2019re a family. They do activities with loved ones and take family photos to save the memory. \n\nI have none of that. Never have. \n\nHere I am - no job, no motivation, in debt, no money for rent or bills. Rock bottom. \n\nI wish I knew why I\u2019m not worthy of having a family, being a father, godfather, someone\u2019s best friend, apart of a friend group. \n\nI wish I knew why I\u2019m incapable of being loved the way I love others. \n\nI wish I knew why every person I\u2019ve ever loved has betrayed me and left me.\n\nI\u2019m closer now than I\u2019ve ever been and it\u2019s scaring me.\n\nNights like these fucking tear me apart.\n\n This world just isn\u2019t for me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cuoap2/im_writing_this_for_myself_you_dont_have_to_read/", "title": "I\u2019m writing this for myself.
