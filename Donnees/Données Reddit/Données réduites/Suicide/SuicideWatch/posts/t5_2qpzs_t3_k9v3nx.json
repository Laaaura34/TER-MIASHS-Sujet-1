I dont think im gonna actually do it, but there is still a small risk i can. I could hoard my anti depresant pills up and then take them all at once, but theres a risk it wont be enough and i might just end up permanently disabled due to brain damage or something, but its still something im considering to do.\n\nI have shit life situation currently. I have piles of assigments and less than a month to do all them and im just... im just giving up. I cant give a shit anymore. I just want this all to end. Im sick of being alive. I just want to die. I havent done anything today besides gaming for 30 minutes twice and then going back to sleep. \n\nIm a failure. I should just fucking kill myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/k9v3nx/if_i_take_100_of_my_anti_depresant_pills_thats_a/", "title": "If i take 100 of my anti depresant pills, thats a lethal dose", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "napoleonwithamg", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1607531699, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/k9v3nx/if_i_take_100_of_my_anti_depresant_pills_thats_a/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427415.0502837, "replies_charged": false}
