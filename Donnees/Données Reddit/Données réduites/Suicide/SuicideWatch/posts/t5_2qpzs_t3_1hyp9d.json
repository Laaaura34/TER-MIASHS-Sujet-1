I learned of SW today, and I wanted to write here to get to anonymously talk about something I have never told anyone before.\n\nI am a 26 year old male, but ever since I was 11 years old I have wished I was female. I am a medical doctor working at the Psychiatric Clinic of a medium-sized hospital. It is an understatement to say that I am the wrong person in the wrong place.\n\nI have always been very unhappy with who I am, and at 19 years of age I made my first suicide attempt by taking benzodiazepines (and um, perhaps for information: it is practically impossible to commit suicide by taking benzodiazepines, their toxicity is just too low. They remain a common method of attempt, however, due to their availability and because of tradition, and I had not yet studied much medicine back then.) Ever since, I have wished for my life to end, and for many years now my going to bed ritual involves praying that I will not wake up.\n\nSo how does it work treating others for mental disorders and suicidal behavior when you're ill yourself? The answer is not well. I will look at my patient as she describes her symptoms, smiling and nodding to encourage her and show that I am paying attention, while in my head I will think \"I would do anything to be you, please stop complaining.\" After every patient visit I will lock myself into one of the bathrooms and run my hands under cold water, telling myself \"you will make it through the rest of this day.\" I will suggest different treatment regimes based on what symptoms my patients present and what medications they have tried, and I will assure them \"I know it is hard now, but as soon as we have chiseled out the optimal therapy you won't have to suffer these suicidal thoughts anymore.\" While in reality I just want to say \"how can your suicidal thoughts torture you so? I consider them a comfort, a reassurance that I won't have to continue living.\" When I meet patients with cancer and other terminal diseases, I find myself envying them, wishing I can put my hands on them, magically absorbing their illness so that they can be well, and I will have a countdown until I won't have to live.\n\nI realize how this sounds, and that you are probably now thinking that I may be the worst doctor in the world. And this most certainly is not what an ideal doctor should be like. I would like it noted that despite these confessions, I have always done my best, and I have helped many, as evidenced by gifts I've received from content patients.\n\nSo, now my vacation is coming up, and I am making plans to end my life at the end of it. I have made my family proud, I have managed to work for about a year, and thus I think I have earned not having to continue on. I will spend time with my mother and my brother, and try to express to them how much I love them so that they will not think it is their fault when they find out later. Since I am a no-lifer I have not spent any of the money I earned, so I will transfer it all to them. I understand it does not in any way compensate for their loss, but it will perhaps help and show them that I do not blame them, and love them.\n\nThank you for listening, and giving me this opportunity to tell someone something about myself that I have never done before.\n\n\nTL;DR: Suicidal transgendered doctor works in psychiatry and finds opportunity to express his self-pity, and plans another suicide attempt.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1hyp9d/suicidal_doctor/", "title": "Suicidal Doctor", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "venvy", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 44, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1373406492, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1hyp9d/suicidal_doctor/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425258.0357056, "replies_charged": false}
