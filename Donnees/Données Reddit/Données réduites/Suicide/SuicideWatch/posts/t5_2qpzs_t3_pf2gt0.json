A guy fired a gun at my high school, and when he was arrested they found him with a to do list on how to do a school shooting. In January my left arm went numb and I couldn't find a heart beat, and as I believed I was having a heart attack my only thought was, \"Fuck, I should've cleaned the cum stains off my walls\"\n\nI can't talk about any of these with close friends or anything because they just laugh, which is fair because it's so stupid, but I can't feel like I ever have a right to feel sad.
