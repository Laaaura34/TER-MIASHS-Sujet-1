I don't really know why it matters though since I'm gonna kill myself anyways, I went to the DPS(DMV if your lucky enough to live anywhere that isn't fucking texas) and tried taking my drivers test, and I failed so hard because I couldn't understand the instructions at all, none of it made any sense, I'm used to just knowing the route on my phone or in my head though we keeped making so many sharp turns I almost crashed, she the started talking about how I was laughably underpepared, though I would have been fine with it if every single person that we had to talk to didn't misgender me every single time, I'm just remeded of how much I look like an ugly man, for a while I was able to keep myself delusion that I actually looked okay and maybe even passable after hrt that I've been on for a few months though I've seen the mirrors I know I don't look any different at all, I stupid, ugly and a massive failure. Maybe if I had spoken up a few years ago then maybe I wouldn't have had to have gone through puberty but no, testosterone has destroyed and ruined my body, and I can never change that I'll always look like an ugly man to people no matter how hard I try, I can't deal with this anymore I'm killing myself, hopefully within the next few months or sooner, cause I can't live like this anymore", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oj1b76/i_am_an_ugly_stupid_failure/", "title": "I am an ugly stupid failure", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Pierce3737", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626126528, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oj1b76/i_am_an_ugly_stupid_failure/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426945.4236047, "replies_charged": false}
