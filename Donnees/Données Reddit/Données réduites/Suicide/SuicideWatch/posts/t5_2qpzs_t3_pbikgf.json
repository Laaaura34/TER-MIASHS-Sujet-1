This isn\u00b4t an urgent case at the moment. I have read about the two thinking stages of suicide and i have been passivly thinking about it for quite some time now. Passivly meaning i thought that i might want to do it but not yet how. \n\nBut recently i have been thinking about how it could end for me. I am 21 years old and have had a good school career. My nuclear family is still alive and well. I also started an apprenticeship. I pretty much have all the reason to be happy and yet since i was around 16/17 i have been feeling desperate.\n\nI never had a girlfriend which i reason with beeing on technichal schools for a long time where there were no woman. But in reallity its mainly because i wouldnt even have the courage to talk to one if i had the chance. When they approche me i dont really have a problem with talking tho. Longer conversations can be difficult depending on the subject since i dont have that many interests.\n\nI am a gamer and because i have been feeling sad and alone for so long i even tried getting addicted to video games so that i can thing about other stuff... I dont think that i have depression (maybe something like Dysthymie?) but i cant really see why i am always feeling this hopeless. And every time i think about having it or something simular i just tell myself no you are just pretending to have something like that its not true. Which makes me feel kind of guilty because i see other people who have to go through so much terrible stuff and i dont even know why i could be sad?\n\nI dont have a goal in life and so little interest in anything. I really want to like something but for some reason i just dont. I would like to experience romantic love but i just dont see that happening anytime soon.\n\nEven before all this started I was never scared of dying it was more like not wanting to waste my life. And i am not religous but even if there is the slightest chance for it to be true then suicide would really ruin my afterlife.\n\nIf there was a situation where i had to sacrifice myself for something or someone i wouldnt think twice which i know in my head is problably not that healthy. And i dont mean that in a \"heroic way\" but more in a  \"I couldnt care less about this happening to me\" already went to two different psychologists but i was disappointed in that experience. And i dont want to speak to my family about it.\n\nI problably forgot about alot of stuff i wanted to write about but this should do it for now.\n\nHave any of you been in a simular situation? How did it get better? Do you have an idea what i might have?\n\nI hope you were able to understand most of what i was trying to say. English is not my main language.\n\nThank you for reading this and i hope you have a good day.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pbikgf/i_should_be_happy_but_i_am_not/", "title": "I should be happy but i am not", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "The_Unspoken-", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629920073, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pbikgf/i_should_be_happy_but_i_am_not/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428204.2485466, "replies_charged": false}
