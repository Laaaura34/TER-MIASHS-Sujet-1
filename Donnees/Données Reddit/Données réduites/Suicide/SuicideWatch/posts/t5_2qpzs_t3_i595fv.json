Everyone tells me that it \u201cgets better\u201d but it doesn\u2019t. They don\u2019t know the inner workings of my brain. \n\nI work for a certain corporate mouse. I just recently went back to work and I can\u2019t handle it at all. Before I even got the call to go back I tried to kill my self by taking too much clonazepam. Three days in a row while my boyfriend just thought I was sleepy. Today I doubled down on my dosage last time and took thirty mg. I\u2019m just stumbling around. I\u2019m ducking stupid. So I\u2019m trying to get the willpower together to just cut open an artery in my wrist and take a hot bath and just let it all leave me while I listen to the music that makes me feel... I don\u2019t want to say happy, but content. Saturday is when I\u2019m getting a refill on my clonazepam so I\u2019m going to take all 60mg to numb the pain and do it. \n\nI broke up with the one person I saw a future with. Before him I saw nothing. But he kept making me feel worse and worse and worse as time wore on. Like I was a burden on him. He loves me but he makes me feel like a burden. My parents too, to the point where I was going to go no contact with them. They make me feel so worthless and small. All I fucking wanted was love and care and attention. \n\nOn top of that, I recently excavated repressed memories of being groomed and sexually abused as a minor as well. I must be the world\u2019s shittiest archaeologist. I had to tell my parents three fucking times for them to have it sink in. My ex while I remembered yet another instance that was peticularly violating ignored me going catatonic on the couch while he angrily cleaned around me, making every nerve ending alight with fire until I said I need d to go lie down. I barely remember after that. I\u2019ve been losing hours and days. \n\nIve managed to unintentionally build up a system as to where no one is going to call a wellness check on me. I can\u2019t go to a fucking hospital again. Especially not in cuffs. I know this will hurt... I don\u2019t know like five fucking people???? But every fucking moment of my life is screaming agony.\n\nMy boyfriend... well, ex at this point I suppose, is going through his own shit. I try to give him space but he wouldn\u2019t let me. He always back burnered his shit to be there for me when he clearly didn\u2019t want to. And when I confronted him about it to take care of himself, he told me \u201cthere\u2019s always something\u201d with me, so he can\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019ve been holding onto that. He is untruthful to me about his emotions but they radiate off him in waves.  If I apologize and ask if I\u2019m interrupting or being \u2018bad\u2019 he would get this fucking wince and say what he wanted to do. This wince of \u201cfuck here we go again I guess I can\u2019t do what I want\u201d. He\u2019s been doing it for years. I\u2019d confront him, he\u2019d deny it, then months down the road he\u2019d confess I was right. He\u2019s been gaslighting me this whole fucking time. \n\nWe were together almost three fucking years. This past month I\u2019ve been just sharply getting worse and I\u2019ve talked to him about how he can\u2019t fucking help me unless he helps himself multiple times. \n\nAnd it\u2019s over. \n\nI don\u2019t want my legacy to be killing myself over some guy. This isn\u2019t what I want. I\u2019d rather be forgotten. Blipped our of existence. I don\u2019t want to hurt people but they\u2019re all selfish for making me stay here on this plane of existence where I cry every single fucking day, or I\u2019m numb, or I\u2019m panicking. I don\u2019t have a normal day. I can\u2019t cook for myself. I can\u2019t clean up after myself. I can\u2019t even manage my meds on my own. Hygiene is out the window unless necessary (work) and my laundry is just a pile strewn around because I just picked all his clothing out of it. \n\nMy parents will probably find my body. It\u2019s going to shatter my mother. It will destroy my father. But those two facts which have stopped me thus far cease to matter. I said my one goodbye. I held my dog in my arms and cried over him and apologized and told him he was the most important thing in the world to me. I sent my parents an email of my final wishes post-mortem. I\u2019ve tried to tie up as many loose ends as I have the energy to. \n\n The rest of this week is just a matter of finding courage. Courage to face headlong into the unknown and hopefully find that my consciousness ceases to exist. It\u2019s horrifying and scary, but it\u2019s all I can do now. I have no real friends. Everyone leaves. I\u2019m the common denominator.
