I'm nearly 14, my first suicide attempt was at 10 and i've had about 30 since. I have been suffering with anxiety for as long as i can remember. I developed depression about 4 years ago. I developed anorexia nervosa at 12, and nearly died. I recovered and maintained a healthy life style for a bit, before developing binge eating disorder in late 2020. Now im in a vicious binge/restrict/purge cycle. I was sexually abused about mid way through last year by a student at my school, and my school blamed me. This experience was so traumatic and it worsened my mental health alot. The flashbacks only recently subsided. My guinea pig who i loved more that anyone died 10 months ago, and i know i should be over it, but i miss him more everyday. My best friend who is my other soulmate, moved schools and i had to go 5 months without seeing her. She is the only thing keeping me going and i never even get to hug her. My family have been emotionally abusive for most of my life, but it has gotten alot worse over the last few years. My sister was the one who gave me an eating disorder by calling me fat my whole life, when i was skinny the whole time. Now i actually am quite fat because of my binging and I feel descusting all the time. She also tells me to kill myself constantly. My dad has really bad anger issues and its terrifying. He shoves me around, spits at me, screams at me and says hurtful things. Recently he said he didnt want me anymore. After doing stuff like this he always goes \"lets not fight\" or \"you know i didnt mean it\" so i forgive him even though i dont want to. My mum has always been awful. She nags and yells way more than what is considered normal and over the tinniest things. E.G \"youre so selfish, you dont care about anyone in the famil\u00ff\" when i spilt something. The other day we got in a full-on physical fight. I'm a pretty high matinence child but i really dont think this \"discipline\" thing has helped me at all. Also, they never allow me to have my phone and are so strict about everything. They also talk about my mental health in derogatory ways eg: \"you should be locked in a padded cell\". I really want to run away but i dont want to leave my friends, my footy club, my surf club and despite everything i actually really love my family. Plus, i dont want to go into an even worse situation.
