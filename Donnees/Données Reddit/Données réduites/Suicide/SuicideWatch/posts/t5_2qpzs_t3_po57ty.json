I'm diagnosed bipolar II and diagnosed schizo, I just can't function and it kills me to let my family down like this, to be a financial burden. My mother has spent so much money on me.. but I just keep failing. \n\nNo aptitudes or marketable skills, I just don't know what I will do with my life. Covid has made landing jobs even harder.\n\nLast night in a cheap motel did some elaborate knots on the door handle and then around my neck, so I was facing the sink, above the mirror. I had thought, or at least planned, that I would face death stoically, as it's the rational things for me to do. Either that or starve to death. I broke down and burst into a pitiful weeping as I saw my face swell up, veins popping in my neck and forehead. 'How did you let it come to this?'\n\nI called my poor mother, working (as always) and told her everything. I feel so bad, because until now I had never shared my suicidal plans or feelings with anyone. I'm hurting my family more and more and I don't know what to do.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/po57ty/tried_offing_myself_yesterday/", "title": "tried offing myself yesterday", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "neverbegan99", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631633897, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/po57ty/tried_offing_myself_yesterday/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423172.2983015, "replies_charged": false}
