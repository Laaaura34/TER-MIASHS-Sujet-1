Even with what I make, it's not enough to service my debt. I keep seeing death as the only option. I really have considered everything else out there. One night when my wife and daughter were away, I tried to do it. I looked at their photos one last time but I couldn't go through with it. But now I know that won't stop me the next time. I have decided my bed is the most comfortable place. I'm going to take sleeping pills. I looked up how many is enough. I failed everyone.
