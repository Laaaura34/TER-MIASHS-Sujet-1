I\u2019m not on depression meds nor anxiety meds and normally do a good job of managing it through mediation and other things such as the gym. Recently though I have almost daily thoughts of hoping I die in my sleep or I get hit by someone while driving to and from work and tend to notice myself speeding more. Hoping that God or whoever will decide my time is up. \n\nMy question is what can I do I find myself looping or trying to research ways I can die slowly or suicide by accident in a way to lessen the burden on my Mom, brothers, ex etc. I have good friends and only told one about these thoughts but I don\u2019t want to burden anyone else. I\u2019m just tired of life I know things get better but there\u2019s so much I need to do and get done and work for that I don\u2019t really want to. I\u2019ve started to try to find ways to escape i.e drinking, smoking occasionally and doing shrooms to try to solve these deep traumas. I guess I\u2019m posting this to just be honest and leave a mark god forbid anything happens.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to get attention or anything like that. I\u2019ve just come to very melancholy mood and still can\u2019t seem to get over a situationship that only lasted a month and three weeks. It\u2019s been almost 2 months and tinder doesnt interest me. I\u2019ve muted her stories yet still find myself trying to see what she\u2019s doing or hoping for another chance. I\u2019m 22 i know I\u2019m just starting life and I\u2019m not trying to be selfish or anything, but now I just don\u2019t care I just want to find peace and finally let everything go. \n\njust wanted to be honest and get this off my chest finally.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pj8fuz/i_dont_even_know/", "title": "I don\u2019t even know", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "NewsPuzzleheaded8436", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630962118, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pj8fuz/i_dont_even_know/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635427496.846158, "replies_charged": false}
