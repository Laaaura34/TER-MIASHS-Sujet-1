WHY does that mean I can\u2019t have depression? Everyone is different and everyone has different thoughts and emotions happening in their heads, you can\u2019t just dictate how my mind feels. Yes, I failed to keep myself from spiraling downwards even though I have a generally good situation compared to most people in the world. Does that mean you can insult me and make me feel worse? Why make someone feel worse when you can try and make them feel better. \n\nIf you think that gatekeeping is a wake up call, it is not. It\u2019s invalidating, it\u2019s rude and invasive.
