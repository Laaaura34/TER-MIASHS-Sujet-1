I talked to doctors, family, and friends and everyone kept asking \u201care you in crisis\u201d and it just sounds so dumb. I get that \u201csuicidal\u201d is a hard word that makes people uncomfortable and its not super specific about the current mind set, but in my opinion it\u2019s better then \u201cin crisis\u201d. Suicidal is a solid, meaty, sort of word, with one meaning, while, \u201cin crisis\u201d is like this weird phrase that could mean anything between your hamster died, a senator got caught fucking a younger woman who is not his wife, and your entire country is flooded and on fire at the same time.\n\nI\u2019m new here and not sure what else to say\u2026.
