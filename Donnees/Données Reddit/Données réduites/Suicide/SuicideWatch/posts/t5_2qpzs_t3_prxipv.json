That is the battle of the mind. Diagnosed with Borderline/Bipolar/ADHD/PTSD I always assume that one day I would be okay and my life will get back on track. I was/AM a weirdo. I remember being young and being too depressed to go out and hang with friends/family I was too afraid to talk to girls and be social. I had this huge fascination on religion and the afterlife at that age. I always wondered why I was so fixated on learning about what happens after you die. I've read countless articles/ NDE testimonies and have watched thousand of videos on the topic. Looking back in hindsight I see why.\n\n Somethings are pre planned in this world. This person was meant to succeeded, while this person is made to suffer, a sort of YING and YANG. While, my life NOW i would be seen as blessed. I have my own place although no job or any source of income tho. I have a Playstation 5 that i got lucky and I have 3 people in my life that i hold dearly. But yet I've came to the conclusion that this world is too much for me to bare. The chemical imbalance in my head will never let me be happy. It took so long for me to realize this. Maybe i was lost in the fa\u00e7ade that one day my problems will disappear and I will be okay. I talk to the right therapist, i take the right medication or exercise or do this or that and I will be okay. I've learned that happiness is simply a state of mind. Well my mind is corrupted you see, I could have EVERYTHING i want in the world and I would still be unhappy.\n\n I recently found out that \"Normal\" people only thing of suicide maybe 2-3 times in their lifetime. I have been thinking of suicide everyday since a young teenager and I realize that all I'm doing is prolonging my death. I see God in heaven right now nodding his head saying \"He really thinks he's going to live a long prosperous life? What a Fool.\" and Honestly. I have to agree with him. I feel having one mental health problem can be fatal but having more than 4+ I can see why people with mental illness do not live long in this world. I am a hypersensitive person, which is very un attractive in a man. I am seen as a gay to people who look down on me(nothing wrong with being gay mind you). People look at me and instantly it turns to judgement. I have no girlfriend, no car, no job and I do nothing for fun. But i swear to you with all that is holy that are the only 4 questions people ask me. Literally the first time I meet someone the first question out of their mouth is \"Do you have a car?\" That drives me (LOL) to shame because I know why they are asking me.\n\n I wish thinks were as easy for me as it is a normal human being. The extreme anxiety i feel riding in a car is too much for me to handle at times. I cannot deal driving a car with my anxiety and low attention span I would be crashing into people. So I either walk to take the bus and I don't mind it. I love putting in my earbuds and blasting my horrible music that I love. But people out in this world are so judgmental that I believe even God himself would not be as judgmental to me as they are. It sucks that in this world the first thing they see looking at me is me being Black. I hate it. Not being black, I love myself as crazy as it may sound. But I hate what comes with being black. Being stereotyped is the worst. \"Yo Dawg\" \"Yo brotha\" \"You like Rap?\" \"DAMN MAYNE LOOK AT HER ASS\" all by people whom are not my ethnicity but believe that's how we all act. If i am asked if i like soul food one more time I am going to flip shit. I hate when i walk down the street white people that has two LARGE pitbulls on leashes will risk getting hit by traffic crossing the street than to be inconvenienced of walking by me. I hate having a speech impediment where I would have to repeat myself 3 times before someone would understand me. Then I came to the conclusion that they understand me the first time. They are just fucking with me. I hate that I have no back bone and I don't speak up for myself because I am afraid of the consequences. They already see black men as aggressive so anything I do or say will just confirm their thinking. \n\nBut hey man, that's the world I live in. I hate going out and seeing homeless people and there's nothing that I can do for them because anything I have is not enough. I hate seeing people in the world struggle and live in torment. Y'know the action of suicide used to make me feel guilty. But what about the ones I leave behind? Would God be mad? Would I go to hell. And what scares me now is that I simply don't give a FUCK anymore. Fuck all of em. I hate this world more than i hate everything and i want nothing to do with it. I even dabbled into spirituality for a bit. What disgusts me about that is that they believe that we CHOOSE our life time because we have to Grow? or to learn? That before we incarnated into this world our memory was wiped or something and that pissed me off because how do you learn something you forget? You know what I'm saying. After my quest for the truth of what this world is and after. I came to the conclusion that there is no God/Afterlife. How could their be? Would you build a home, create children in said home and watch them be tormented and tortured for your amusement? No you wouldn't because you are not a psychopaths'. I realized the more and more I learn about God the more human he sounds. And that hurts because I wanted to believe so bad that someone or something was out their looking out for me and one day I would be saved. Then i realized the only one to save me is myself. Horrifying. I do not want to make it another day. But I will have to Try for the 3 people in this world that I have left. But I know for a fact one day I will take my own life. And I will do it with a smile on my face knowing I can rest.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/prxipv/i_am_exhausted_i_need_to_vent/", "title": "I am Exhausted - I need to vent", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Throwawayluvo", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632152799, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/prxipv/i_am_exhausted_i_need_to_vent/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428092.712069, "replies_charged": false}
