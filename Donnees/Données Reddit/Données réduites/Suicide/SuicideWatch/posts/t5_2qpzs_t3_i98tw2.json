Maybe it's coping... Idk but I don't want advice on how to fix my marriagei already know it's doomed just a matter of time.... Your all going to tell me I am awful and I should leave and I know I should but I can't pull myself to do it.\n\n I am 25 years old male. I am an Army combat vet and I have depression and anxiety (maybe ptsd idk yet). I met my now husband, (26 year old FTM) after we both had gotten out of the military before He started his transition. He has two kids from a prior marriage and I had just left my ex-wife that I met in the military. When I met my husband we clicked right away and it was great.... Unfortunately I am a POS and I made a lot of mistakes... Before we were exclusive I was trying to get laid as much as possible.... Sleeping with anyone I could. This ended up bitting me in the ass because I decided to be exclusive. He told me that if I wasn't ready to commit that we could remain friends, FWB, or we could be in a polyamourous relationship. I at the time thought I wanted to be committed. I obviously didn't and ended up cheating multiple times. We decided to be poly together since I was doing what I wanted anyways even though I knew I loved him and I was trying to be a better person. But I couldn't just stop all the lying and I continued to break all the rules we had set and boundaries we had agreed upon by being poly.. I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with those kids and him.... But something just causes me to always make mistakes. I yell and scream and I make everyone on edge. I cheat and lie.... I am a terrible person and I don't want to be but I just keep making the same mistakes. Anyways fast forward 2 years and our marriage is on its last legs I feel. He is such a strong person and has put up with me for way to long.... We will go months without any issues and then I'll fuck something up again and it just starts this whole train of bringing up the past which isn't even that long ago so it still stings and hurts him.... I love him with all of my heart and I want to be with him but I cant stop being a child and making mistakes. He is the best thing to ever happen to me and I am the worst thing to ever happen to him.... I feel like a terrible human being and I feel like because of all the pain I have caused him and those girls that the only thing I can possibly do is to kill myself.... I am so severely depressed and hurt that I have hurt the 3 people I care about most in this world so many times. But I am too scared to do it... I don't get why i feel this way. I want to end it all and solve everyone's problems by not being around anymore... I don't want to be alive but I don't want to kill myself. I wouldn't attempt it myself but if something happened to me I would probably go down with a smile on my face... I ride a motorcycle everyday and everyday I just pray someone runs a red light and t-bones my worthless ass.... Obviously I haven't been that lucky yet... Sorry for the long post but I do feel a little better getting this all off my chest, thanks.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/i98tw2/i_want_to_die_but_i_dont/", "title": "I want to die but I don't?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwawayfml2757", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 0, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1597354499, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/i98tw2/i_want_to_die_but_i_dont/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427182.2768502, "replies_charged": false}
