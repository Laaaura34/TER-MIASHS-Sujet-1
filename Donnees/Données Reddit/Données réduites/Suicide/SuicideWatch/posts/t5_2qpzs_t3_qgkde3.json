A friend of mine hates me because I ditched plans with him again yesterday, In favor of hanging out with a girl who drove over twelve hours to see a friend and me. I feel horrible, I should have been a better friend and never ditched him. I just wish I was perfect, happy and just made everyone happy. Instead I\u2019m narcissistic, prone to depression, and everyone eventually hates me. \n\nI think about suicide at least once a day and I feel like a freak because that\u2019s in no way normal. Being drunk is the only time I feel normal, social, and carefree. But that also gives me the risk of becoming even more sad and depressed, even more so if I\u2019m alone. \n\nI know that there are way more people going through way worse, and I shouldn\u2019t be bitching about my comfortable life, I\u2019ve got food water and shelter, not to mention a paycheck every two weeks.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for wasting your time. I just wanted to vent and i didn\u2019t know where else to go. I hope you all live better lives than me and I\u2019m sorry for anyone that has or will hurt you all.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qgkde3/im_just_so_tired/", "title": "I\u2019m just so tired.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Proper-Problem1968", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635294861, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qgkde3/im_just_so_tired/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427960.2058964, "replies_charged": false}
