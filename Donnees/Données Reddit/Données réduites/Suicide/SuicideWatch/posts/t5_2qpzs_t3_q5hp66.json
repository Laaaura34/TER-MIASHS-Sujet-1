I don't want to kill myself, but they are always there. Due to complications from a medication, I have to go off of them and wait about 10 days for an appointment.\n\nI really can't tell anyone about these thoughts. My mother? Instantly throws a tantrum and makes it 1000x worse. People I live with? I become the crazy person who is unfit to provide and relationships slowly become sour\n\nThe worst part is, I understand it too. I don't think I could handle living with myself. I would probably handle it much worse than anyone ever has\n\nHow do I open up about it without sounding like I'm an unstable failure at life? I just want to be treated like a real person with an issue, instead of someone who is purposely trying to draw attention or make it seem like it's everyone else's fault. It makes me feel so worthless and I feel so bad for those around me", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q5hp66/how_does_one_speak_up_about_suicidal_thoughts/", "title": "How does one speak up about suicidal thoughts?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "RxWest", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633902973, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q5hp66/how_does_one_speak_up_about_suicidal_thoughts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427356.0626235, "replies_charged": false}
