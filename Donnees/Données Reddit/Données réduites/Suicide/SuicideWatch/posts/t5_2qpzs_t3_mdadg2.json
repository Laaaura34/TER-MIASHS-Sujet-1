I range anywhere from L to 2x (because of women's sizes). I'm not the biggest but it doesn't matter. Ever since I was 7 I've had people, specially grown men, comment on my body, calling me fat, unfuckable, worthless, ugly, etc. I was groomed when I was younger and I've had people tell me I should be appreciative of that because no one my age would want my fatass. It fucking hurts. I'm not even attracted to men, I'm a lesbian, but it still hurts to hear that my life is worthless because I'm fat. Everyone fucking hates us. I've had dealt with multiple eating disorders in my life and each time they've been undermineded. I'm not treated like a fucking person. My life is worthless to fucking everyone. I've been on diets since 7 only leading to eating disorders. I had bulimia for a while and now I have binge eating disorder only leading to more scrutiny. I'm literally worthless and I hear it every single fucking day. I don't have a problem with my body, but everyone else does. I like my size and how I look, but other people have a problem with me. I'm sick of dealing with these comments and remarks every fucking day. Fat people aren't allowed to be happy and I'm sick of it. I don't want to be thinner I just want to not be treat like shit for just existing.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mdadg2/everyone_hates_me_for_existing/", "title": "Everyone hates me for existing", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "urmanismyman", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616711895, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mdadg2/everyone_hates_me_for_existing/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422930.5728345, "replies_charged": false}
