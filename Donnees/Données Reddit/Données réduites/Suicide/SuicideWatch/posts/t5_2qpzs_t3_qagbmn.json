The days almost seem to merge into one foggy memory of merely existing. The amount of times I have to pinch myself to realize I'm actually still sentient and conscious is getting a bit out of hand. I keep living the same days on repeat, going through the same high highs and same low lows. One moment I'm on top of the world and everything is possible, and the next I'm ready to end it all. I'm not sure how much more my mind, body, or soul can take before leaving this place becomes the closest route to happiness for me. I recall a teacher once telling a friend and I that it gets better. All these things plaguing my mind eventually become distant memories, she said. I told her I had no clue how that was possible because I never saw myself seeing adulthood, yet here I am. And honestly, it's just as miserable as 13-year-old me might have predicted. I just want to rest. I just want to be still for once. I just want to be at peace.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qagbmn/i_cant_wait_for_this_shit_to_be_over/", "title": "I can't wait for this shit to be over.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mrphenix963", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634535508, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qagbmn/i_cant_wait_for_this_shit_to_be_over/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635425187.887197, "replies_charged": false}
