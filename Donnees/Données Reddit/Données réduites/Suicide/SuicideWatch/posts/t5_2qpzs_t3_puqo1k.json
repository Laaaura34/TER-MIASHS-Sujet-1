I want her to have a clearer picture of how I feel, but I\u2019m hesitant because her brother killed himself when she was around eight or nine. She\u2019s had to live with that trauma for the majority of her life, and I don\u2019t want to scare her like I\u2019m about to put her through that hell all over again. \n\nI don\u2019t expect her to help me unpack this, I\u2019m looking for a therapist to help me process and move forward, but I hate putting this distance between us. It feels like I\u2019m hiding some dirty secret from her.\n\nHow would I go about telling her about this stuff? Should I tell her at all? I don\u2019t want to burden her conscience with more worries, I don\u2019t want her to be scared of losing someone else.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/puqo1k/how_do_i_talk_to_my_girlfriend_about_my_suicidal/", "title": "How do I talk to my girlfriend about my suicidal ideation?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "j_crow182", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632511282, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/puqo1k/how_do_i_talk_to_my_girlfriend_about_my_suicidal/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427211.1984406, "replies_charged": false}
