Unfortunately, it's just a slow and painful process but I think this is exactly what Darwin meant when \\`\\` he developed his theory of biological evolution.\n\nI am inferior at everything I do. I am bad at sports, not in shape \\(super skinny and narrow shoulders\\), I have crippling social anxiety, I am very pale, I am not good\\-looking at all \\(some have called me ugly\\), I am not good at my job, I don't have any money, I am not funny nor am I able to talk to people, I am a virgin at 26, I have never even kissed someone.\n\nMy social anxiety is probably the worst of all. Usually, I just sit inside playing games or watching some Netflix in my bed, basically in my comfort zone. However, I always feel some kind of guilt towards myself, like I'm not going anywhere with my life.\n\nOn the other hand, every time I go out or do something with friends/colleagues I barely say anything and it always becomes very clear to me that people just don't like me. I try my best but it just does not come naturally to me. I struggle so much with making friends and meeting new people. Most of them dislike me within minutes.\n\nSo either way, I'm unhappy. If I stay at home, I feel guilty and worthless. If I try to go out, I always feel very bad about myself after evaluating my interactions with other people. Basically, every time, it just becomes crystal clear that people do not like being around me, especially girls, they seem to really dislike me. I don't know why, I am just trying my best, but obviously that's not always enough. I doubt things will ever work out for me. Getting a girlfriend is just out of the question, so I will probably be lonely for the rest of my life. My uncles/aunts are the same way. Basically, my mother is the only one in the family who found a spouse, probably because she is really good\\-looking \\(something I did not inherit, thank you genes...\\).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8kzuho/inferior_me_26male/", "title": "Inferior me (26/male)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Less_Word", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1526899156, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8kzuho/inferior_me_26male/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426296.0604515, "replies_charged": false}
