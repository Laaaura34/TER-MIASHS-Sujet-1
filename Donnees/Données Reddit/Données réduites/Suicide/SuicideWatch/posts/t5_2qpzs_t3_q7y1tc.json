I'm 20 and I live by myself at college so other than class I don't really talk to anyone. My days are boring. I get up, do homework, eat, work on weekends, and then play guitar/bass or paint/draw. I don't have a lot of friends in the first place but I haven't talked to anyone outside of \"hello\" in weeks. Sometimes I wish someone would check up on me since I try to make a point of talking to people but it never happens. Which I understand, I'm not sure any of my friends know I've been hospitalized before. I'm falling behind in some of my classes and I just feel like nothing will ever change and I'll always feel this way. My plan was to join a few clubs but between work and class I have no time. I did go to one club meeting before work but even there I just felt alone among people. It was like everyone already knew someone and I didn't matter. I figure that's how I'll feel anywhere I go so why even try? I do have a therapist but I don't meet her again until November. So I'm not sure what to do anymore. I'm not sure I can take another day of waking up like this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q7y1tc/my_days_are_starting_to_get_so_similar_i_think/", "title": "my days are starting to get so similar I think what's the point in waking up anymore", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tarotaurus", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634212113, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q7y1tc/my_days_are_starting_to_get_so_similar_i_think/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427667.099014, "replies_charged": false}
