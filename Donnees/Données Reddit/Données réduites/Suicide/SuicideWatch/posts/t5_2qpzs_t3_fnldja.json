Im also taking meds, which just makes me either numb from feeling or emotionally suicidal. It supposed to make me gain appetite but I have zero appetite. I have work which I am slowly neglecting due to this whatever, my workmates are good people and the workload isn't too overwhelming. I've tried working out, but the mental tiredness is far more exhausting than the physical exhaustion I get from it. I have a loving family and friends. They support me in every possible way in my clinical depression. I've tried being religious, went back to church and is still praying but nothing really changes.\n\nWhy do I still feel like this? The loneliness, the pain, the constant. Everything feels overwhelming. I really just want to be gone. I want to cry but I can't shed a tear. I try to divert my attention just to not think I'm not ok. I am tired of being tired. I'm really on the verge of giving up.
