Please don't be afraid that I'd lash out on you, because hurting you in any possible way is the last fucking thing I'd ever do.\n\nBut maybe this is for the best. I think you'd be happier without my depressing company, right? You don't have to deal with my bullcrap. You shouldn't. I don't want you to, either.\n\nWith that... maybe subconsciously, I was trying to push you away because of that.  Without realizing, I did everything I could for you to stay away from me. So that you don't have to tolerate my shit and live a good life of your own. Even if it means losing my last lifeline. \n\nBut I guess that was the problem. I was already hanging by a thread when you, being the kind soul you are, were by my side. But I stubbornly thought I would be just slightly okay, if you were to leave. For your own sake. I will be able to handle myself. A 12 years old shouldn't be carrying the burden of my shitty mental health.\n\nSo... this feeling of wanting death now shouldn't be a surprise. But it still hurts.
