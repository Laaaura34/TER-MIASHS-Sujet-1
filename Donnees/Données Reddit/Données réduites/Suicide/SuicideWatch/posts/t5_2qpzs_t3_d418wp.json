It was an accidental (I believe) overdose of oxycodone, which she was prescribed to take daily. She was my person... she was the one I felt I could rely on, out of anyone in the world, no matter what happens. And now that she's gone... I just want to go and be with her.\n\nMy boyfriend and I broke up just the other night, because he was struggling to feel strongly about me. I initiated the breakup, because it was just too painful to see him be so indecisive when I knew how I felt. It's tearing me apart, not only because I'm heartbroken, but because I can't hang out with that circle of friends without making him feel awkward (they were his friends first after all) so instead of playing DnD like I did every Friday night, I'm writing this.\n\nI would not wish these feelings on my worst enemy. If you are struggling too, I am so sorry that life has dealt you this hand. I wish, more than anything, that there was something I could do about it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/d418wp/i_dont_want_to_want_to_die/", "title": "I don't want to want to die", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "undedheart", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1568439585, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/d418wp/i_dont_want_to_want_to_die/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426699.778798, "replies_charged": false}
