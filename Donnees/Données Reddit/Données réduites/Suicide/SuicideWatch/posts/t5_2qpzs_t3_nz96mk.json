Haven't done any long Reddit post in a few years, actually.  Last one was in 2016 on /amiugly. It says it all. So, I read a few other posts and I relate to everything so much. Buckle up, because it's going to be a long ride. I am going to explain what others don't see.\n\nI am healthy, my parents love me,  I am just 20, college is doing okay, I am not underweight or overweight, I am very far from broke, I have some wonderful friends. I'm living in the city I've always wanted to live in, in a beautiful apartment. \n\nSo why, why am I still struggling every day? It truly feels like a never-ending battle. I don't think I could ever commit suicide, because I don't have the strength, and also because I know it would destroy my parents. And I know that life can be beautiful, I know. But I think my need for love and recognition is too big to ever be fulfilled. \n\nDuring my teenage years, I was hideous. I know that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes, but I had a huge underbite that I only got fixed after high school, I had severe acne, tried Accutane but was allergic, and was overweight. Looking at myself in the mirror was insanely hard. I thought things would get better after the surgery, and it did for a while, but now am just back at it. I know how vain and superficial it sounds, but I just want to be and feel pretty.  I know how easier life can be when you correspond to beauty standards, how people love you and respect you more. I hate that. I hate that so much. Even if deep down, I know that being insanely pretty would not help me, or barely. I developed an eating disorder at 15, became slightly underweight, nobody cared of course, then became bulimic, and now I struggle with binge-eating. Because of some family problems (one of my parents was alcoholic), I also developed this thing called maladaptive daydreaming. I spend so much of my time in this alternative reality where I am absolutely perfect and where everyone loves me that I can't stand looking at the way my life is in the real world. I've tried stopping it, it's so hard when it's one of my only sources of happiness. I've developed a fixation on a celebrity, and trust me, even writing these words down makes me feel incredibly weak, cringy, and stupid. Not only that, but I envy her so much, I can spend hours staring at pictures and videos of her even though it is hurting me, because I will never be her, or close to her. Maybe a kind of self-harm? Oh, I also have trichotillomania while we're at it. We could see my scalp from 11 years old to 13, now I still have it, but at least I can control it, so it doesn't show. At school, people would say that I had burned my hair with a hair straightener. Funny. \n\nThe irony? The famous girl I'm obsessed with also struggles with her mental health. But still, she is beautiful, lives her dream, and is adored by millions. I realize how superficial that sounds, and it costs me to write those words, to show how futile I can be. I haven't even talked about this to my therapist, and she is on holiday until next month.\n\nMy dreams could never be achieved, because I'm not good enough. I am lazy and envious, and I feel like I'm such a bad person. I want to write, and I just launched a blog, but I know that it will never really be successful because most of the things I write are mediocre. I want to make music and be in a band, I'm taking singing lessons but I can hear how bad my voice is, no matter the techniques I use. I need to choose a master's to study after my bachelor's degree in literature, and I am absolutely lost. I know I will never be happy in a 9-5 job, I need art to even start thinking about happiness. But I lack talent, and I feel like no matter how hard I work, it's useless. \n\nMy big sister  (2 years older than me) has, I suspect, an untreated personality disorder. She always feels the need to bring me down, I tried to stop caring, but I just can't. She used to call me a \"walking fat ball\" and last year she had a kind of hysteric crisis where she almost violently hit me, my dad had to intervene to protect me. I've been living 6000\u00a0km away from them for two years now, and I thought it would improve our relationship. It did not. \n\nI wish there was a button I could push that would make everything stop. The issue is, as I wrote above, I know how beautiful life can be. A good afternoon with your friends, dogs, baking with your mother, traveling, reading a good book on a sunny afternoon on my balcony, walking and getting lost in the streets. Also, somehow, I see that people know they can count on me, I am very involved in student organizations, I have projects and plans. There are many people I can count on as well. I love my friends deeply and would do anything for them. They would be very sad if they read those words. I just feel like it's not enough, like it will never be enough, because the expectations I set in my daydreams and through my fixation with this celebrity are way too high.\n\nOn my bedroom wall I wrote \"It's your own reality, your own simulation, create your own version\". I try to make my reality fit my dreams so hard, but I constantly fail, and when I try to make my dreams fit my reality it always ends up being out of reach. I don't feel like therapy is helping. In bigger letters, I wrote \"make me proud\". I really want to be proud of myself, to be my main and primary source of love and validation, but I can't stand myself. \n\nWith my first therapist a few years ago, we talked about dysthymia, something I might be having. Sometimes I hope I have it, so it means it's an illness I could heal. But he wasn't even sure I had it anyway. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs there an answer to this? Will there ever be an answer? I've been sad, insecure, envious and unsatisfied for so long now that I don't even know how it feels like to be happy, confident and content. \n\nSorry for this long text, I just needed to get everything out.\n\nThank you for your time if you made it this far, it means a lot if you cared enough about a total stranger to read her awkward words and thoughts. Thank you. And hold on, because no matter how desperate I sound, maybe there is a way out and an answer to everything, maybe it's just a few days away from us, a few texts or a few singing lessons, a few years, a few classes, a few people. Who knows. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWho knows...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nz96mk/i_seem_to_have_it_all_but_in_reality_every_breath/", "title": "I seem to have it all, but in reality, every breath is a struggle.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "i-am-an-ocean", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623627542, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nz96mk/i_seem_to_have_it_all_but_in_reality_every_breath/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428106.3413444, "replies_charged": false}
