Other days like today, I end up a complete mess crying and hyperventilating, I want to kill myself so much, I felt that today was different, the pain of just breathing (I guess, but heavily) got to me and I nearly picked up a knife, I just wanted to end the pain, as of now I am still very light-headed, this is the only year when I've had insomnia or have just stayed til 2am and even then I can't sleep, please help me, I don't want to die, I want to live, my parents are of course like any other parents, they wouldn't understand if I told them I had depression, I know it, I don't have much of a good relationship with them as well, so it's pointless talking it out. I am normally occupied with school so that keeps me from being depressed, but now that our school year is over, and I have 2 months of worthless time to spare, I have just felt worthless like a soldier after a war, I'm sorry if that sounded like an insult to any military personnel but I just, I just don't know anymore. I cry for no reason, I talk to myself on a constant basis, and when I do I just realized I slowly talk myself into depression, my head hurts I think I may have schiz, hopefully not, I just don't want this anymore. This is the first time this is happening, I won't even bother with my grammar, please, just comment something, anything, I want it all to end.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ok5k0d/just_read_this_and_comment_anything_you_want_its/", "title": "Just read this and comment anything you want, it's all I need", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "RyougiPendragon", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626273112, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ok5k0d/just_read_this_and_comment_anything_you_want_its/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426586.0921547, "replies_charged": false}
