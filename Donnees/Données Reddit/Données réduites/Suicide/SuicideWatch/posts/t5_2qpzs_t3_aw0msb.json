Listening to biggie and ice cube, as well as other old artists, sometimes Joyner Lucas. It helps me cope and stay awake during the day. I used to love video games, but now they make me feel more distant. I never leave my room anymore so sports are a 'no'. I'm constantly questioning if I'm sick or if I'm greedy because I can't shake this feeling that loves me more than anyone I know. I just wish I could pause life and just lay down and be by myself for a while, like at least a few days. I'm afraid of everyone and everything I have around me. I'm to the point I wont try to ryhme these and make a hit song for suicide awareness. I can relate and sympathize to everyone even crazy people. I don't know what the fuck I want and what I'm going to be happy with. Why won't I even get the strength to get up and kill myself I can't do anything with myself, I can't clean or work extra. I feel like I'm on autopilot. I want to stop being a witness to my own actions and conduct my life. Who will care what I have and what I've done? Who will read this and get inspired? Nobody? Just like the crowd supporting me while I'm alive. I don't want to call in a suicide crisis and talk to somebody because my family might get unemployed. All I've ever felt like is a inconvenience. This music won't get me a high school degree, a loving family, a better self image, or honestly the will to live. Why isn't there a service to send suicidal people to sacrifice themselves to something beneficial like organ donation or science experiments.
