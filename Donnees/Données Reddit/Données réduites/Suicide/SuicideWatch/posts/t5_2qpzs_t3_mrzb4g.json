Everything is just so damn hard, even though it's the easiest it's ever been. I have no friends, haven't had a true girlfriend since reaching adulthood (still a virgin), and my indecisiveness and drunkeness caused me to miss out on gaining $40,000 from gamestop in January. I'm 26 and spent years in college putting off life and never really tried, wasted tons of money in the process, and was finally starting to turn my life around. Now I can't stop thinking about ending it all. I know it will hurt my family so much and that's really the only reason I haven't done it. I'm in so much pain though. I'm tired of being such a drain and waste of space.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mrzb4g/i_fucked_up_my_life_in_countless_ways_being/", "title": "I fucked up my life in countless ways, being irresponsible and refusing to grow up, causing me to fall behind my peers and become a failure.
