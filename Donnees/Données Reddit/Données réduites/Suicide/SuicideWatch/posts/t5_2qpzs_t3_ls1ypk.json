I\u2019ve never had the guts to go through with it, but I\u2019ve come close many times. There\u2019s always been something stopping me from taking that final step, pulling the trigger, or swallowing the pills. But as of late that inhibition has faded and I think pretty soon I\u2019ll finally be ready to do it. I\u2019ve got no reason not to do it. My life is in shambles, my family is brutal, and my relationship with my girlfriend is toxic as can be. I want out, and I think I\u2019m finally gonna get it. I don\u2019t feel sad, I don\u2019t feel tears coming, if anything I feel...... calm, relaxed even. It\u2019s coming, I\u2019m sure of it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ls1ypk/i_think_im_finally_ready_to_go_through_with_it/", "title": "I think I\u2019m finally ready to go through with it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Alternate7625", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614242229, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ls1ypk/i_think_im_finally_ready_to_go_through_with_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426413.8963015, "replies_charged": false}
