She was in so much agony and I want to feel that and die too. \n\nShe's my baby...\n\nI been having suicidal thoughts ever since HS. Don't know how I've lasted this long. I promised myself that I wouldn't want to live past my next birthday next month. I grew up in a place where mental health is a myth. Family that couldn't give af. The cats are my solace.\n\nMy baby died because of my carelessness. I always knew that I'd outlive them but not like this... \n\nI just want to be with her. I have to believe in the afterlife so I can meet her again. Will I meet her again if I take my own life? I don't want to live in misery for the next 20yrs. I've had enough. I'm pretty much useless anyways. A waste of oxygen.\n\nI want to be with my late brother & late cat again.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ps9tb5/grief_guilt_i_want_to_feel_what_she_felt/", "title": "Grief & Guilt...
