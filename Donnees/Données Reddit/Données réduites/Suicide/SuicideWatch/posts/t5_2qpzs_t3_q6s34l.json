Not a single friend and no partner anymore. This is honestly just a dumb vent but I don\u2019t know how long I can keep going. Currently thinking about a suicide plan. Or maybe I just let my unhealthy behavior kill me.\nI wanna die pretty somehow. I don\u2019t want to commit in a gruesome way where my body would be unrecognisable. I just want it in my hands how I go. And just giving into my mental illnesses seems the easiest way. Starve to death or whatever. \n\nI don\u2019t even have any motivation to ask for help here I guess.
