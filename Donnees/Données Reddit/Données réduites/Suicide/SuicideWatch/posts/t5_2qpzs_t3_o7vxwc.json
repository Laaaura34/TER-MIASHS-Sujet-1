My name is Mani, and I want to say something more than what's my name or where I am, or what I do. I want to say that I'm lost and alone and that there's a sadness inside of me that is huge and heavy, and I don't know how not to feel it. I want to say that I\u2019m like a broken compass that points only to a lonely spot with no name, no hope, no touch of anything comforting, no person to say \"I'm tired... I'm really, really tired, like a million years tired, and I don't think I can make it to the next day.\" I want to say that most days I'm just fumbling around not even sure what I'm looking for; that I don't even desire to find \"it\": just wishing to find a corner, grab a blanket, and wait for it all to end. I want to say how the ache in my heart burns hot, and it eats me up inside. I want to scream out my pain and all the hurtful \"thanks, I'm doing great\" that I still manage to say in the corridor of people. I want to say that I'm not good and if you haven't already guessed it, you never really cared how I\u2019m doing...\n\nTwo years ago, I decided to take my life away. I felt something inside me- a need, or a yearning, or wanting. It was not the howling emptiness in my core that mostly takes up the day: it was like a need for not existing. That night, I stared at the ceiling, thinking about the easiest way to do it. I thought about getting into the car, driving to a high place, and just jumping off. Then I thought about not bothering to get into the car and just walking down the steep street till I fall off from the overpass. I thought about taking the pills and then watching myself just die, but I went with the idea of the bridge and the river.\n\nJust a few hundred meters from the spot, I reached out to a suicide hotline. Someone picked up the phone. She talked to me and reassured me that there's always somebody who would listen... I don't even remember the other words we exchanged on the phone, but I remember her voice. The concern, the warmth in her voice made me feel safe like everything was somehow going to be okay. It made me feel like someone was out there somewhere for me to listen even when it felt like most of the world did not care. I was still on the line, and a little later, I felt my legs, my arms, my whole body changed the direction of the bridge and decided to go back. I trusted her that there's always someone who will care.\n\nEver since, I've tried hard to look for a face, a voice, somebody to talk to. But people are always pushing me back or let me in, but when I need them most, they're just gone. I have to say I don't really blame them. It's even understandable somehow.... or maybe I'm just too tired to feel angry about anyone anymore. After two years, I still think about that voice on the other side of the suicide call and the words that changed my direction from the bridge. I want to say that I'm going to go back there again but I don't think this time I'd reach my phone. As much as I'm craving for the warmth of a caring voice, I can't trust anyone enough to let me taste hope.\n\nMy name is Mani, and I know that nothing will ever change", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o7vxwc/waking_up_is_saying_no_to_everything_you_know/", "title": "Waking up is saying no to everything you know about yourself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TomatilloSad5246", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624653183, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o7vxwc/waking_up_is_saying_no_to_everything_you_know/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423046.0245628, "replies_charged": false}
