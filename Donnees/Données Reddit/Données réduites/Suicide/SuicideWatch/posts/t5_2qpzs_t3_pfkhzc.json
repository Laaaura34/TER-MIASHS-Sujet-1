I just want people to pay attention to me, right? I don't know. I don't really know too much of anything anymore. I've become disassociated from life and I've reached a brand new numb. It used to be all there was, tears.... Emotions. Now there's nothing.\n\nI should be scared but I'm not. I simply dont care anymore. Why should I care? There is nothing to care about. I did everything they told you I'm supposed to do, seek counselling, see doctors, try different medications, talk to your friends.\n\nMy friends don't care anymore. The people I love the most are feeling the very way I feel right now, but towards me. They are numb. They don't care. There is so few left. And that's because who I am as a person.\n\nTo be honest I'm surprised I've lasted this long. Since my wife and partner of ten years left me, I figured it wouldn't be too long after that.\n\nBut I'm in an abusive relationship and have been for a while. But as a man that isn't taken seriously. I could never leave and do what I want. Sell my house and move, move to my two friends I'm close to. But they don't want me anymore. I'll just poison their lives too. So that's gone too now.\n\nAll I'm left with now is regret. I wanted the pain to stop. But I don't really feel it anymore. The traumas don't stop and the traumas don't go away. They are here with me, forever, with my guilt, with my regrets.\n\nI'm not a good person.\n\nOver the last few days I have stopped eating and drinking. I've just been smoking. Ive cut myself off from the world. The last person I thought I cared has stopped responding to me. I guess you can only put up with someone's bullshit for so long. \n\nTrue love doesn't exist. \n\nSo I've written a letter to the people I think will be affected. It's taken two days. They each have one. I've googled how to write a will and I've done that as well. I've made arrangements for how my assets will be divided. In about an hour when my girlfriend goes to work, I will drive out onto the highway, to a remote exit, and from there I will jump off. \n\nGiven the height it's unlikely I will die on impact, however it should injure me enough that I will be unable to move and eventually a trucker will run over my body and finish the job.\n\nPoint in case, my girlfriend just came into the room I'm in and started watching a show. I went to turn it down because the volume was loud and was making my head hurt. She then proceeded to storm off muttering something about spending time with me. I messaged her to tell her why I turned the volume down and she ignored me.\n\nI won't get into that too much. Her actions say it all.\n\nShe can't see me.\n\nI don't know why I'm posting this but I guess here I am.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pfkhzc/in_about_an_hour_ill_be_dead/", "title": "In about an hour I'll be dead", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "itsprobablymyfault79", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630463068, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pfkhzc/in_about_an_hour_ill_be_dead/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425448.297484, "replies_charged": false}
