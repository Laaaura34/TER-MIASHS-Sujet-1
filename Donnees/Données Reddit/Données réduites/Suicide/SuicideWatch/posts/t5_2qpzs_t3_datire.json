It\u2019s been 6 years since my last suicide attempt and those years have definitely had their ups and downs. I\u2019m a senior in college now in a major I hate, because I wanted to make my parents happy and be an engineer. I\u2019m struggling with my classes which in turn makes it hard to keep motivation to keep trying. My sleep schedule is absolutely fucked. I\u2019m just broken mentally at this point. I was a \u201cgifted\u201d kid growing up and my mom always expected me to do great things. She\u2019s reminded me a few times about how I\u2019m technically a genius and I have to keep reminding her that IQ doesn\u2019t really mean anything and I took that test when I was a kid. This year she finally said she was done with her expectations for me since she\u2019s never right. And on one hand that\u2019s what I\u2019ve wanted and on the other it kind of broke me more. My dad knows how much I hate my life right now and he\u2019s always there to support me to just get through it so it\u2019s over. I appreciate that. But it hurts to see the pain in his eyes when I talk to him about it. I feel like a failure even though I know I\u2019m not. I do know I\u2019m a disappointment though. I had a great relationship a year ago. I slowly destroyed that with my toxic and unhealthy tendencies, one of which was major emotional management issues when it came to being angry. But from that I learned and actually grew a lot as a person. I don\u2019t blame her for leaving, but I was already beginning to change in the end and she still walked away. She went on to date her friend she always told me not to worry about a few weeks later. This was a year ago and I\u2019m still alone. That is what it is though. I hold no anger over it. I guess I\u2019m just trying to give context to the situation or maybe I\u2019m just talking for myself. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t get angry anymore. About anything. I guess I changed too much I don\u2019t know I just can\u2019t find it in me anymore. I get breifly angry sometimes, but it never lasts. The problem is I don\u2019t really feel anything else either. I try to get out and talk to people but I\u2019m so busy with school it\u2019s hard. My best friend Emma says I should just get a girlfriend but I\u2019ve tried. I\u2019ve talked to so many people over the past year and they all just stop talking to me eventually. I just feel so alone. Funnily enough she\u2019s the closest thing I have to a relationship. She wanted to make a marriage pact at 30 years old since we\u2019re at different parts of life right now and of course I accepted because I fuckin love her. I just don\u2019t have it in me to tell her I\u2019ll probably be dead long before then. I\u2019m rambling I\u2019m sorry. Drugs help deal with my problems but I only get high when my roommate isn\u2019t here so I don\u2019t get paranoid. I\u2019m just ready to die. I see no future. Sometimes I wonder if that gun really did go off 6 years ago and now I\u2019m in hell. \n\nSorry for wasting your time with all this. I\u2019m just gonna go get a little higher, turn on some music I listened to when I was younger and happy, and watch the sunrise. \n\nIf you\u2019re reading this I hope you have a wonderful day. I love you. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll die, but I keep getting this feeling it\u2019ll be soon. Exactly how I don\u2019t know. But if I do let\u2019s grab a beer on the other side.
