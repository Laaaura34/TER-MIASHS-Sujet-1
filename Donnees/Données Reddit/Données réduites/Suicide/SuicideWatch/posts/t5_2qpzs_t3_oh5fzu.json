Apparently, I am told, it can kill you.\n\nSo I call the Urgent Care, to ask for anti-biotics so I don't die.\n\nAnd there is the dilemma: They assume that you are a drug addict seeking opiates. So you get nothing. If you say, \"I don't want opiates, I want anti-biotics so I don't die,\" they assume *your abscess isn't bad and you can wait.* Because if you had a bad abscess, you would be asking for painkillers. So if I ask for painkillers for my abscess, I get nothing. And if I ask for anti-biotics, it must not be real, so I get nothing.\n\nThe message: FUCK OFF AND DIE, and THEN we'll write you a prescription. We'll write a prescription for your corpse. Prove it by dying. Because not errantly giving a painkiller prescription to a junkie *is more important than your fucking life.*\n\nThat alone is a reason to kill yourself.
