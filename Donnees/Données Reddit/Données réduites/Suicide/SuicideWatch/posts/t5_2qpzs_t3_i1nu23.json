I have been really struggling these past few weeks. At the moment it feels as if my life is more difficult times than anything and I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nMy brain keeps fixating on an event from my late teen years I think 17/19 and I\u2019m worried what it means about me and my life and whether or not i'm worthy to be alive. In a moment of stupidity I encouraged the family dog to lick me down there, it didn\u2019t last long a couple of seconds maybe I don\u2019t know , but the fact I was capable of doing that of thinking for a split second that\u2019s that was ok or even an option mortifies me. I am terrified it makes me a monster akin to people who abuse and molest and take advantage of the weak and innocent , it makes me feel as though I don\u2019t deserve to live and suicide constantly rattled around my head as my only release.\n\nI hate that I ruined my life story. That I can never look back fondly on my past self because she was capable of this thing that mortifies me. I wish with all my being I could take it back I really do. I worry that I\u2019ll never find love because I feel I don\u2019t deserve it and I worry I will never be able to enjoy sex because any time I do anything enjoyable that is related to sex by myself or with a partner I am reminded of my worst action it plays constantly in my head and ruins everything.\n\nI feel so guilty and ashamed. I just want to stop thinking about it and end it all. I need to know how horrible I am compared to the rest of humanity. I want to know how horrible, awful or disgusting what I did was. I just feel trapped in a horror story of my own making . Every second it feels like my skin is on fire and I just want to die. I don't know how to go on living, knowing i'm a monster. I can't believe i did this, i just dont want to to beleive i did this", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/i1nu23/cant_forgive_myself_for_something_heinous_i_did/", "title": "Cant forgive myself for something heinous I did as a teenager, i cant stop thinking about how bad and awful I am", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "59693439", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1596264173, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/i1nu23/cant_forgive_myself_for_something_heinous_i_did/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635428166.2459188, "replies_charged": false}
