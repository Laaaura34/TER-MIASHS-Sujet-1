I'm alone and I start to anticipate the joy of killing myself as though I were about to watch a new movie or embark on a road trip. I never have any specific methods in mind, but the mere thought of being dead in the near future is so exciting. \n\nMy thoughts usually cycle through the following:\n\n- You're fucked up beyond repair. Time to check out before you get any worse.\n- No one will miss you. They say they will, but they won't.\n- You'll never find anyone who can understand you. \n- You hurt everyone around you. You embarrass yourself without even realizing it. You don't even know how to behave. \n\nI (29, M) have a good job and an okay social life but life hasn't always been stable. I've had multiple periods of depression in my life, the first starting when I was 13, and when those receded I've had to pick up the remaining pieces of myself and struggle to put them together to figure out who I am, what types of things make me happy, etc. More and more pieces go missing with each episode. One day I'm pretty sure I'm just going to lose touch with reality and either never leave my bed or lose all inhibitions.\n\nI hate the fact that I'm bisexual, and that I have no trouble dating my own gender but not the opposite gender. I hate that I'm a furry, that I'm into some of the weirder stuff in the fandom, and that no matter how hard I try, I'll never be normal. I thought I made peace with all this garbage years ago but apparently I still haven't.\n\nSo here I am, daydreaming about being dead.
