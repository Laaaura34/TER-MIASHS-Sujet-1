I made two attempts, didn't have enough sleeping pills aparantly. But all my suicidal actions or when I've seriously considered it have been in times of great distress.\n\n\nWhat's concerning is that I've been, sure in plenty of distress, but calm. Handling it well by all outward appearances. But instead of panic or emotion, I just feel done. I've seen what I want to see, I'm not interested in seeing more.\n\nI've been researching ways to do it so I actually die this time, I'm positive if I try again I will succeed.
