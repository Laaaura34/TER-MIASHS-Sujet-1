It was natural. With teenage hormones, fake love, and my self loathing, I automatically assumed it was to spite me and I added it to my list of reasons. You read the rest of this and you'll understand what I meant.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I'm proud of myself, really. I'm proud I could make it this long without breaking. After years of everything. I know that you've never asked me about anything really, and you use me for your own advice and consolation. So I'll tell you my life.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was born April 26, 2005. You understand that. I was born into a family of eight, making me the ninth. We would add two more after that. I wasn't a girl, and my family was disappointed. Above all that, I had expectations to live up to, which I rarely exceeded.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Getting emotional yet? You haven't had to deal with what I had to, but you were the only one who cared.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I shouldn't be angry at you, and deep inside, I know I'm not.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could never be mad at you.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And I blame myself.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You ever question what happened with the boy in the back? You ever question, \"Why, oh why, have I never seen this boy's arms?\" \"Why, oh why, does he dress the way he does?\"\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It's funny, they wanted me to be a girl, but it seems I was past a socially acceptable expiration date.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I'm writing this in case you ever read this. I know you won't. I feel it. My death won't matter, my story will never be told, I'll never be told! I'm unimportant, and I'll always be. Life is different when you're me.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And I just got picked in this game of Russian Roulette.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With love and pain/With fire and with rain/With the rumble of a train/I'll be gone/Gone forever.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hopes and prayers from the one who never got a chance.\u00a0\n\n                            It is bad, I'm sorry.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n545et/i_wrote_a_letter_it_isnt_inspired_by_me/", "title": "I wrote a letter.
