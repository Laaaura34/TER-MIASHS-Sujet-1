However, because I am and have been close to people who are also suicidal and understand the impact their departures would leave on the lives of others, I am doing everything in my power to avoid attempting suicide or self harming, no matter how painful it gets.\n\nBut sometimes certain situations come up that genuinely make me feel like a waste of space, or sometimes I do some extremely regrettable things that hurt others and I just constantly feel insignificant and worthless and it drives me to want to harm myself.\n\nI am and have been incredibly suicidal for years and I think about death all the time and I just want it to stop. I just don't want to cause even more problems for people than I already have.\n\nWhat do I do to help soothe these feelings? Are there any tips people may have on avoiding self harming, or at least distracting themselves from feeling this way?
