They have very bad family and school problems, and they really are tired of it all. I seriously don't know what to say to them. because telling them to live on is basically me telling them to keep on suffering. please help me. if u guys need any extra info I'll say some, so please.\n\n\n\nEdit: She's back guys, thanks to everyone who commented. I'll make sure to work even harder now that ive been given another chance to help.\n\n\nalso changed \"student\" to classmate", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9dld5/how_to_deal_with_suicidal_people_who_think_that/", "title": "How to deal with suicidal people who think that they have no future?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "A_good_future", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 172, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634396191, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9dld5/how_to_deal_with_suicidal_people_who_think_that/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635421080.9389997, "replies_charged": false}
