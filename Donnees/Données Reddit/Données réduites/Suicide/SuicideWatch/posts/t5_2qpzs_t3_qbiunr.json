The only thing I see is how people are stuck in their 9-5. The amount of anxiety that comes with it. I have no passion, nothing that fulfills me. I did not sign up for this shitty thing called life. I literally see no point in it. I am not a depressed person. I am more of the anxious type. The only thing I would want of this life is literally nothing. Nothing makes fun, nothing seems special nothing seems joyful. EVEN IF, it's only for a short period of time. Who would want to live a life without freedom. Stuck in a system that is disgusting. I am disgusted. The thought that we have to work to survive makes me feel sick. The thought that nobody understands what I mean and makes me seem crazy makes me feel sick. Why would I suffer here. I am tired, not my body but my soul. I just want to sleep.
