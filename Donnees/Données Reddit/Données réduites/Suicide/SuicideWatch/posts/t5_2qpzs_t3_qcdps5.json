I spend pretty much all day on my phone opening Reddit because I\u2019m bored and have nothing to look forward too and then closing it because my feed is exhausted and I don\u2019t want to be on my phone anymore. I hate mindlessly scrolling through apps, but anything beats being alone with these thoughts I have. I probably first thought about killing myself 6 years ago. I\u2019ve never attempted it, but there are more times than I can count when I would have if it didn\u2019t take so much effort.\n\nMy usual pattern is a few months of near daily suicidal thoughts and then it gets better temporarily, but the cycle inevitably continues. Currently, I am in the more unsavory half of that cycle. Where do I even start? I have so much to say but I seriously doubt I\u2019ll be able to encapsulate it all in this post without forgetting something.\n\nFirst of all, I don\u2019t hate myself. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m \u201cworthless.\u201d I\u2019m worth just as much as any other human being, whatever that means. Sure, in the past I\u2019ve thought I was completely worthless or incapable. Earlier this year I made a post about how I wanted to kill myself because I thought my league of legends performance was indicative of my worth. It sounds ridiculous, right? The post should still be up on my profile, if you\u2019re curious. I\u2019ve long quit that godforsaken game. \n\nSo no, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m worthless or incapable. I don\u2019t think I lack potential. I don\u2019t hate myself (I actually am quite happy with the person I\u2019ve become). And yet, all I ever think about is ending my life. \n\nIf the post about league should tell you anything about me it\u2019s that this isn\u2019t my first time reaching out. I\u2019m very open to my friends about this. That being said, a thought just occurred to me that this is an exceptionally helpless and entitled thing to do. Everyone no doubt has their own problems and concerns and here I am forcing my own upon them because I\u2019m incapable of dealing with them myself.\n\nI failed a test yesterday, and I lamented to my one and only friend that I\u2019ve made on campus the whole year about how I wanted to kill myself. I realized that I wasn\u2019t helping myself by reaching out, but just being annoying and toxic. I spend so much time on my phone just scrolling through apps, waiting for some notification to show up so I can talk to someone. But it\u2019s never enough. At least never to make me stop thinking about it for more than a few hours. The thoughts always come back.\n\nI realize that this is the source of all my problems; I just don\u2019t have enough in person contact with people and it makes me feel incredibly isolated. I only commute to my university 3 days a week and on those days I feel significantly happier. All that entails is me going to my classes and leaving, and sometimes it has me elated. \n\nBut when I\u2019m not there I\u2019m deeply, deeply unhappy. I feel as if there\u2019s no point to doing my school work because I don\u2019t care about money and it seems like trying is not going to get me any further than just walking along. I don\u2019t really enjoy doing anything. I don\u2019t have anything to look forward to. I don\u2019t have anything to be proud of. The only joy in my life comes from the little interactions I have with other people. \n\nThe problem is, every time I\u2019ve made a new friendship it\u2019s always crashed and burned. I become hyper fixated on one relationship at a time (whether I have other healthy ones at the time or not) and either the other person reciprocates and then I eventually abandon them out of loss of interest or they do it to me before I get the chance. I just broke up with my girlfriend of two years because I didn\u2019t feel anything anymore. I know I made the right decision and I have no remorse. The problem is that this has happened 3 or 4 times in the last 3 years. It\u2019s made me afraid to get close to people despite the fact that my social skills are easily better than they\u2019ve ever been at any point in my life.\n\nWhich brings me to this: I wish I didn\u2019t need people. I wish I could just focus entirely on my schoolwork and shut everyone out, constantly aiming for success. I wish I didn\u2019t feel terrible every day because I never interact with anyone (in person). I wish my happiness wasn\u2019t so dependent on everyone else. I\u2019m starting to think that I should stop reaching out and just help myself.\n\nToday I watched a video on how to stop catastrophasizing (making everything seem like a bigger deal than it is). I thought this was super fitting considering I was resigning myself to failure after that awful test yesterday. I got a few things out of that video: don\u2019t be afraid to be hurt because then you will have no opportunities to be happy (vulnerability) and consequently don\u2019t be afraid to take risks.\n\nThis may sound like mental gymnastics, but all this made me think was that I should kill myself. I\u2019m done bothering other people. I have nothing to enjoy, nothing to desire, and nothing to look forward to. I have nothing to be proud of and nothing to lose. There is a very obvious solution to this, and all I have to do to enact it is stop being afraid.\n\nToday I put a kitchen knife up to my neck. I wanted to see how the blade felt pressed against my skin. I didn\u2019t cut myself and didn\u2019t intend to, but being comfortable enough to do that is probably bad. I fear death less and less every day. Someone cutting me off at 70 mph on a highway and almost making me crash doesn\u2019t feel like a terrifying event but a minor inconvenience.\n\nAnd no, before you private message me, this is not a desperate call for help to make friends. I\u2019m sorry if that sounds callous, but I want to clarify that I\u2019m really not looking to make friends on Reddit. I don\u2019t want to disappoint anyone who private messages me by exchanging a few messages with them and then completely cutting them off once they try and have me add them on other social media platforms. It\u2019s happened to many times and I feel like a dick for doing it which is why I\u2019m saying this here. I have friends. Three of my best friends from highschool are in the same school as me, I just barely talk to them. I text the ones going to other schools but the ones in my own have new friends and clearly better things to be doing. I\u2019d rather not bog them down with myself. I have talked to them a few times but on the rare occasion they do help it feels like they\u2019re going out of their way to do it rather than wanting to. I have one new friend who I text and she says it\u2019s fine but I don\u2019t like bothering her with my shit. It\u2019s getting on my OWN nerves at this point. People say it feels good to let it out but it never helps me. I only talk about it because it\u2019s the only fucking thing on my mind and I need to talk to SOMEONE. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this was so long. If anyone actually read this, thanks. \n\nTl;dr: I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t hate myself but I feel isolated, unhappy, and bothersome. I feel like I have no reason to keep going.
