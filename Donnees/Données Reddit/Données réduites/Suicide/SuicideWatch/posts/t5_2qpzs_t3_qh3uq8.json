I overthink a lot it\u2019s really really bad and I kinda can be super apathetic. My life is starting to take a bad curve right now like money and relationship. There\u2019s something seriously wrong with me and it ends up making seem super distant. I\u2019ve made her cry twice now but I genuinely believe that she is one of the good ones and I\u2019m hurting her. This is the one thought I\u2019ve had with any empathy in the past few months(My iPhone predictive texts first option was 2 years, fuck you, Dear FBI agent) And it\u2019s going to destroy maybe the one good thing I have. \n \nI\u2019ll try to quickly sum up a few thoughts from the ol\u2019 depression/anxiety department it nitpicks the smallest thing she does and I die because of it. I shouldn\u2019t be mad I don\u2019t think. My brain if currently trying to force me away from posting this. It\u2019s sending up read flags everywhere. \nThis mental crisis end here.
