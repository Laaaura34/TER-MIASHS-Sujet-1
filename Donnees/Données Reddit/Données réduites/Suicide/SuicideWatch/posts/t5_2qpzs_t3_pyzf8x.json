I\u2019ve hurt the girl that means the most to me. I literally can not deal with this. I\u2019ve ruined this night, and today was supposed to be such a good day and I\u2019ve been making it so shitty. I\u2019ve been making every day of the past months shitty. She dosent deserve me. I truly mean that. I feel like it might be best if I break up with her with one last final apology, and tell her to find someone better. I can not keep getting forgiven for this. I\u2019m changing her life in such crazy uncomfortable ways. I need to stop. And I know I can\u2019t change myself, not in time at least. I\u2019ll break up with her and then a few months later end my life. That girl means everything to me and to know I hurt her daily is just enough to push me over. I hate myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pyzf8x/guilt/", "title": "Guilt", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "P1atypus123", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633058257, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pyzf8x/guilt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426174.4952059, "replies_charged": false}
