The moment was so amazing. Those beautiful creatures looked deep into my soul. \n\nIt was one of those moments that made me think life isn't so bad. After all, the world can't completely suck if deer can thrive in it.\n\nIt made me a lot more ready to face the day. Hopefully you have moments like that too, when you see something that touches your heart.\n\nLive another day and experience something breathtaking.
