It's instinctive.  But my instincts are gone.  Like that time the guy ran a stop sign. And I saw it. I had time to stop. Every part of me, every instinct, should have done its job to try and protect me. But I just kept on driving cuz I wanted to die. I didn't even react. The guy slammed on his breaks and missed me but it's a miracle I'm not dead yet. I don't care if I die but I don't want to hurt anyone else because of my recklessness.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qafx0r/my_driving_is_dangerous_to_myself_and_everyone/", "title": "My driving is dangerous to myself and everyone around me", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "_Vincit_Qui_Patitur_", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634533755, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qafx0r/my_driving_is_dangerous_to_myself_and_everyone/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425513.8364182, "replies_charged": false}
