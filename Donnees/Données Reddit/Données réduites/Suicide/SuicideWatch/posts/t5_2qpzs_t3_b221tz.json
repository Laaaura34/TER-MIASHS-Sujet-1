I have a girlfriend and it\u2019s been 2 years (anniversary was like a month ago) and she comforts me but nothing feels right. I\u2019m not the best at describing stuff since my way of thinking is different and shit but it\u2019s agonizing thinking that my friend pool either hates me or only puts up with me due to pity. Sometimes i wonder ( Ik original words ) how much do I impact people on their lives, Ik the memes \u201cmom would be sad\u201d \u201cdog wouldn\u2019t understand\u201d I don\u2019t want to be a edgelord, but I wonder who really cares about me-every time I go back and think about the events I do it seems melancholy, i won\u2019t kill myself I have it too good to do it, only things keeping me afloat is JoJos Bizarre Adventure, my girlfriend, and my friend pool. \n\n\nLong story short: Autismo feels like shit for no reason\n\nEdit: I\u2019m trying to understand music and movies better because two of my friends are in a band and want to be a director. Trying to get close to them as much as possible. But it\u2019s low key backfiring at me because I can\u2019t remember both passions that well.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/b221tz/i_dont_feel_right_i_have_it_good_but_it_feels/", "title": "I don\u2019t feel right, I have it good but it feels terrible", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "abc123poP", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1552801366, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/b221tz/i_dont_feel_right_i_have_it_good_but_it_feels/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427574.4847493, "replies_charged": false}
