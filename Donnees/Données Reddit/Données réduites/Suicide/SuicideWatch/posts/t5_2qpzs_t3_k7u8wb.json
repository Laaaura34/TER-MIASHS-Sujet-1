The dog helps, but she's wonderful. It would be simple to rehome her before I do it. \n\nI don't want to resent them. When I can feel anything, I love them. They've been nothing short of admirable in their support of me and dealing with all this. \n\nIt just feels pointless. Like keeping a broken cup because you've had it for so long, despite it doing nothing but take up space and be a safety risk. Yeah, sure, it had some good stuff in it, and it was around for some good memories. But now it holds nothing, and you'd have those memories anyway.\n\nI usually just feel empty. Those are the good days. I can just coast by on surface things. A funny quip. The dog being particularly cute. Sometimes I even reactivate the old dating profiles I turned off from the last go round. \n\nBut as soon as I start scratching, I always am faced with the reminder that my depression stole everything from me. Ambition. Discipline. Hope. Dreams. All that's left is a fucking useless mass of misery and loneliness. \n\nAnd I think that comes through. It would certainly explain why at a couple decades and change years old my dating life is much like life at conception. Theoretical, and even the existence is very much up for debate. \n\nIt gets to you, after a while, being unlovable in that way, but not another. What are you doing wrong? You must be pretty fucked up if you can't get anyone to look at you once, let alone twice. What the fuck are you thinking, believing that anyone would want to be with you. Get your shit together before you bring someone else into this mess. \n\nThen you keep doing that for a decade, give or take. Miserable because you have no hope and no one, no hope because you have no one and you're miserable, no one because you have no hope and eat misery pie. Lovely how it developed its own little self-sufficent food supply.\n\nAnd why do I have any right to think I ought to be with someone? I couldn't get the energy, motivation or courage to go to class, I got drummed out of the Navy because I wanted to increase the lead concentration in my brain and I'm, as one former coworker put it, no Channing Tatum.\n\nWhat a stupid thing to fixate on, finding someone, when you don't know what that is or what it feels like. Maybe it's because people call it the great redeemer. How it improves you. Calls for you to be better and to make the challenges seem worth it.\n\nBut all I have are challenges, and I'm not sure any amount of water or love can redeem me.\n\nI'm stuck in this cycle of self-loathing and self-sabotage, I leave the care teams annoyed at this fuck who doesn't seem to improve no matter the medication or therapy we try, and my family frightened of a phone call they might receive one night. \n\nAnd if they weren't a factor, it would be so easy to end this. Like an alcoholic finally giving in to the call for drink. Giving yourself that cheat day and grabbing the slice of cake. \n\nLove and suicide. The two things I want more than anything else, mutually excluding one another. Leaving me here, stuck and becoming more and more bitter toward the ones who do care about me, and everyone else to boot.\n\nAin't life grand?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/k7u8wb/beginning_to_resent_my_family_for_wanting_me_to/", "title": "Beginning to resent my family for wanting me to stick around.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Weak_moments_last", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1607263289, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/k7u8wb/beginning_to_resent_my_family_for_wanting_me_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428168.2653258, "replies_charged": false}
