Ive had a lot of time to reflect and that's my conclusion.\n\nI don't really have friends or hobbies, or even something I'm good at. I'm really just a waste of space.\n\nId do myself and everyone around me a massive favor by offing myself.\n\nAs time goes on things are losing meaning. Im less invested in school and can't bring myself to play games or watch something.\n\nI really want to kms tonight.
