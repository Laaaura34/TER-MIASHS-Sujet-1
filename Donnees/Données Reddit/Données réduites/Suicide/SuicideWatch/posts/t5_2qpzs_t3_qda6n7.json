(i\u2019m 17 now)every time i manage to pull myself out something major happens and ruins the progress i\u2019ve made in my mental health. there\u2019s not much i can do to change my life due to the fact that i\u2019m still young and in high school and i can\u2019t take full control. the past 5 years of my life have been ruined and i don\u2019t want to grow up resenting and regretting the fact that i lost my adolescence to depression. i don\u2019t want to graduate next year and go to college for something im not passionate about and do a bullshit job. i don\u2019t want to have a normal job. i have dreams and passions but i have no confidence in myselfto actually pursue them. i don\u2019t want to live a life that i settled for. i\u2019ll never be truly happy and i wish i would\u2019ve just killed myself when i was 12 like i\u2019d intended to. i wouldn\u2019t have missed out on anything.death is traumatizing enough but i feel like a suicide is so much heavier especially considering the fact that i\u2019m so young and i don\u2019t want to put my family through this. i don\u2019t want to die i just want to be happy but it\u2019ll never happen. i have no other options.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qda6n7/venting_about_my_constant_suicidal_ideation/", "title": "venting about my constant suicidal ideation", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Vegetable-Raise8392", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634880845, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qda6n7/venting_about_my_constant_suicidal_ideation/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427199.5843725, "replies_charged": false}
