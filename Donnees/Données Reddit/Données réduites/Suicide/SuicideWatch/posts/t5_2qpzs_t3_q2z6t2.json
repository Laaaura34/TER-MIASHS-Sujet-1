I\u2019ve had a sad, pathetic life and I\u2019m sick of all the memories. I\u2019ve been thinking about it for a while now but today I got a bill from the irs for 6 thousand dollars. That\u2019s the final nail in the coffin. I already work two jobs. So this is going to be it. I wish I had just one friend to tell me to go on. There is absolutely nothing to live for. I\u2019ve punched myself in the face a couple times trying to make myself pass out. I just want this pitiful life to end. \n\nPlease be aware that the fact that this sub Reddit exists gave me some comfort in my last moments. I\u2019m going to take every pill in the house now and go to sleep for the last time. I\u2019m laughing rn because I\u2019m so happy that I know I\u2019m not going to be alive anymore. Please be happy for me, this is what I want. Like an old dog you have to put to sleep, sometimes it\u2019s for the best.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q2z6t2/im_about_to_kill_myself_and_i_have_nobody_to_talk/", "title": "I\u2019m about to kill myself and I have nobody to talk to, absolutely nobody.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MeggyNeko", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633573225, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q2z6t2/im_about_to_kill_myself_and_i_have_nobody_to_talk/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635423139.4582617, "replies_charged": false}
