I dont even dislike starving at this point, its like the same with self harm, u just get used to the feeling, the first time was scary but now its like \"eh, this isnt so bad\" \n\nalso just makes me feel so incontrol too, its great. like its always the mindset \"imagine what you would look like if you just didn't eat for 1 more day\" and its great, but it also makes me feel guilty for eating cuz i feel like such a failure lol (not really lol it actually makes me very sad)\n\nI think I should save mine and others times and just kill myself, ive been fantasizing about dying a whole lot lately, usually by my own hands but sometimes by others. it just feels like my  brain is just pushing me in the right direction, it just feels like what i need to do, i just feel very drawn to killing myself.\n\ni understand that i sound pretty stupid right now (and probably annoying) but some advice on either how to solve these problems or how to kill myself would be greatly appreciated.
