I hike a few miles a day, I eat healthy, I drink water, and I try to stay positive that I'll be back to my normal self. But It's been three weeks since I took the last dose of abilify, and all the side effects are still there. I'm depressed, my ear won't stop ringing, I have no motivation or drive, no libido, I can't sleep, and my relationships are deteriorating. \n\nI can't live like this. I spend most of my days sobbing and mourning everything. Before all this I had goals, I ran my online shop, I did crafts, I was silly and happy.\n\nThe urge to stab myself is so strong. Maybe someone will take me seriously then. Is that what it takes? Would taking the rest of my sleeping pills be easier? I miss my husband and my friends and family so much, but I don't see an end to this. I feel like my ability to feel has been ripped out of me. I'm so flat and sad. I feel like a shell of my former self. I can't do this anymore. I can't. I'm so sorry. I'm so scared. I love everyone so much but I just can't anymore.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p9bb36/i_cant_live_like_this/", "title": "I can't live like this", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Hakunamitatas", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629633999, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p9bb36/i_cant_live_like_this/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426769.6051953, "replies_charged": false}
