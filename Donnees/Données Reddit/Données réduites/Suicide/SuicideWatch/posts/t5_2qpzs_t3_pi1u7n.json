My best friend died at the start of this year, my first relationship ended and that relationship left me kinda messed up, the family of my dead friend all moved away this week and now I'll never see them again and one of my other lifelong friends recently got married and moved away as well.  The only friends I have right now are in relationships and don't really have time for me.  My last sibling moved away for college recently so I'm the only one left at home now and the girl I like just seems really distant half the time and I can't figure out how she feels.  I relapsed with self harm and bulimia recently after being clean in both for nearly a year.  I'm just lost and don't know what to do.  I feel really alone and useless.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pi1u7n/id_never_had_suicidal_thoughts_before_but_i_find/", "title": "I'd never had suicidal thoughts before but I find them creeping in lately", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SpiritualGlove1303", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630797349, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pi1u7n/id_never_had_suicidal_thoughts_before_but_i_find/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422924.4346828, "replies_charged": false}
