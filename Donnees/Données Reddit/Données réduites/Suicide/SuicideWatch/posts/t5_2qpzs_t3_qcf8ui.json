I feel like life isn't worth all of the pain and suffering. I have attempted three times and I just want to know what to do that works. My family has everything tempting away from me right now. I don't want to go to the hospital because then I just have to pretend I'm better so they will leave me alone. Medication doesn't work, and therapy isn't enough. I doubt anything else will either. My greatest desire is to be rid of the pain. I wish I could get a lethal injection or get cancer or anything to put me out of my misery.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qcf8ui/i_am_so_suicidal/", "title": "I Am so Suicidal", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Jolly_Inevitable_811", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634776511, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qcf8ui/i_am_so_suicidal/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427409.2871075, "replies_charged": false}
