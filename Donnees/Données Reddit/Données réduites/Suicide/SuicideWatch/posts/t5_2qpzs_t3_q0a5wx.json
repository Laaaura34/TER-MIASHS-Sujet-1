After years of bettering myself and proactively working on my mental illness\u2026. I find myself stuck in the same hole I crawled out of. Only this time I\u2019m older and my problems/anxieties/fears have grown. It used to be irrational to think why would I kill myself over some trivial bullshit\u2026 now it seems justified I think I should. I feel there is a predetermined route, a destiny. Everyone\u2019s destiny has an expiration date. Why would I try to cheat fate when it\u2019s staring me in the face. I\u2019m past my expiration date. I think it\u2019s time I\u2019m out of time to decide.
