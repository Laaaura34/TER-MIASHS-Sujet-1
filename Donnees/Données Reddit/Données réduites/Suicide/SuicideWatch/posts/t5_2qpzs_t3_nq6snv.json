When he got out he only used me for s\\*x and eventually broke up with me because HE was starting to hang out with a random girl regularly from like 10 pm to 3 am. I wasn't okay with it and he didn't care and so he broke up with me and never told me the whole reason why and we haven't talked since. \n\n2 months after that, at the start of October, I started my first job. I met this guy on the first day and since we were wearing masks I couldn't see his whole face but when I looked into his beautiful blue eyes I was so hooked. We ended up not getting to work together because of different schedules yet I still wanted to get to know him. The next day he was working and I wasn't so I went to see him and I actually ended up giving him my number which I have NEVER done before and I'm not a confident person in the slightest but doing this was just so easy, I don't know if it was because it was him that I was giving my number to but my heart was skipping the entire time. We started talking and became friends and started hanging out whenever we could. Soon he ended up asking me out and I told him that I really only wanted a friends with benefits type thing, which looking back on was so incredibly stupid because I really really liked him, but later that night I told him that I wanted to be his girlfriend and we started dating. At this time it was the beginning of November. It was crazy though because I had already fallen in love with him. I couldn't keep it in and like a week into our relationship I told him that \"I love him\" and it was an idiot thing of me to do because I was his first girlfriend, his first kiss, and soon I would be the one to take his virginity. It was a little while later but on my birthday he told me that \"he loves me too\" and I was so fricken happy. A day or two later we had sex for the first time. I made our relationship move so fast and it was such a huge mistake because it was his first relationship and I think it was all too much for him. Our relationship was going amazing but then he got a job at the same company we met, our jobs were seasonal. Things were going well but then we started seeing each other and talking less because he was busy with work and running start and just life in general. Two months ago he told me that he said that he loved me too soon and wanted to stop saying it. I then decided that we were going to stop having s\\*x because I didn't want him to think that he had to do that if he didn't/didn't know if he loved me. Since then he wasn't making time for me and our relationship has just been declining these last two months. On Friday May 28th, we got into a deep discussion about our relationship and it brought up a lot. For the last two weeks he wasn't sure if he wanted to continue our relationship or not. The next day, Saturday, I went to his work and we talked on his lunch break. In the end he basically said that my mental health was too much for him to handle. Later that night he broke up with me because he didn't know if he could make time for me or make time to fix this.  \n\nIt's been 2-3 days since the break up and right now were texting. I'm so scared that I'm screwing everything up and that I'm making everything worse. I'm so in love with him and he means so much that I just can't go. I want him to be happy more then anything. I've been crying nonstop since the break up and I can't even sleep in my own room. From day one with him he made life so different and made it worth living through all the \"unbearable\" parts. I don't know what to do anymore. I'd rather be in a relationship with him where I'm ignored rather than feel this way for even a second longer. I just hurt so bad that if I didn't know him I would be overdosing right now and even though I feel like someone is crushing my heart to a point where I can barely breathe just hearing one more word from him makes that crushing pain worth feeling because I get to talk to him. \n\nI've been to the emergency room and inpatient care due to my self harm and depression before but this life is not worth saving if he's not in it.\n\nNo one will read all of this and I know that but even if you do you'll just think I'm crazy and an idiot for wanting to die over an ex but there's just so much more to it.
