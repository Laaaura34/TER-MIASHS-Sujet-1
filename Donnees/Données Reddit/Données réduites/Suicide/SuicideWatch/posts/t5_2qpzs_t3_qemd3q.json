Since I left my first career (due to stuff carried by the awakening of my mental illnesses) I can't keep up with anything.\n\nI tried another career out of my hometown and by the second semester I started feeling bad, didn't attended and finally drop out. After that I started a third career  , that I was sure I'd like but by the end of my first semester everything went awful. I got into the second but didn't finished and tried the third but actually I'm not attending.\n\nIt's not that I don't like the subjects, I quit eventually even in my personal projects. I tried to make my craft business, (I really enjoy doing that and it's not stressing) but I have been stuck with my first project for several weeks.\n\nI hate it. It's like I'm trapped in a cycle and can't break it. It's so frustrating. Specifically when my (ex?)bf asks me if I know what I'm gonna do with my life because \"I've been resting for years\"  or \"when I'm going to do the things right\" :(\nI can't keep a career, a job or a relationship.\n\nI don't see a way out. At the moment I was thinking about hurting myself again after years of restraining. I even thought of ending it all because I can't finish or keep anything so I can't have a proper life, but I'm too weak to actually do it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qemd3q/im_just_tired_of_trying_again_and_again/", "title": "I'm just tired of trying again and again", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "missrycbar", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635056109, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qemd3q/im_just_tired_of_trying_again_and_again/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426362.3850563, "replies_charged": false}
