That I\u2019m just lazy or pathetic and use mental health as an excuse to get away with not trying even though I feel like I try really hard and get nowhere. \n\nProblem is this mindset of thinking I\u2019m just not depressed enough to warrant care or treatment has resulted in me ramping up the self harm. It used to just be hitting myself or walls but now I\u2019m actively trying to bruise myself. I never was a cutter, just don\u2019t like it, but the blunt impact of a hit soothes the tension. It is surprisingly hard to bruise and I don\u2019t even know why I want to. I guess just like cutting I want a visual indication that I\u2019m fucked up. Heck I know I\u2019m fucked up but my mind keeps rocketing between extremes of \u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019ve always been fine and I can be better anytime I want\u201d and \u201cI am going to kill myself. It\u2019s not a question of if, only a matter of when.\u201d \n\n\nGonna end this with a lyric like a proper angsty teen, even tho I am no longer the latter. I like Penelope Scott a lot and I really resonate with the line \u201cI would give anything to look the way sick people are supposed to look\u201d\n\nHope you\u2019re all doing okay tonight \u2764\ufe0f", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbcnhi/guilty_about_not_being_sick_enough/", "title": "Guilty about not being \u2018sick enough\u2019", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DonTacheMii", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 71, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634653674, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbcnhi/guilty_about_not_being_sick_enough/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635426194.3611922, "replies_charged": false}
