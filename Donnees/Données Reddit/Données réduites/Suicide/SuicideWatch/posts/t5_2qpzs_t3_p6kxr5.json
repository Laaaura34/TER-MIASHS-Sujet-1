I'm terrible with people, and I can't do anything right. It's like the more time that passes, the less competent I become in every area of my life. I've tried so fucking hard to become a better person and improve myself and be more social, but I fail every fucking time. People want happy, positivity, and warmth, and I can't be those things. I can't even pay attention or concentrate most of the time because I'm so disconnected from reality. How the fuck am I supposed to be positive and happy when I can't even remember the last time I actually wanted to be alive? I just wanna fucking die but I don't want to hurt anyone I care about.\n\nI wish I never existed. I had a 1 in 400 trillion chance of being born, why the fuck did I have to win this shit lottery", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p6kxr5/it_would_be_so_much_easier_to_die_than_to_change/", "title": "It would be so much easier to die than to change myself or my life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "WildSeretonin", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 61, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629264705, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p6kxr5/it_would_be_so_much_easier_to_die_than_to_change/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425527.063839, "replies_charged": false}
