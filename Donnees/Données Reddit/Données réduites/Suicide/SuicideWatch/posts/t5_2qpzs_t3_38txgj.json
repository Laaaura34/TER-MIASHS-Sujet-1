Also something about how \"its one thing if one person thinks you're an asshole but if everyone does then you probably are\" -- im not sure if that was meant for me or the aggressor.\n\nwe talked for a while, but it changed my entire perspective on my job.  now all these passive aggressive statements i ignored in the past are apparent and galling.\n\nthe quips i brushed off or wrote up as \"ball busting\" now just seem like vinegar in the wound.\n\ni have pack all of my stuff next week to move, for a job i might not want anymore.\n\nthis was my only connection to reality; i have no other reasons to live.  it made my job more important to me.  i really want and hope that this is the end, but im also sad that nothing ever works out.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/38txgj/unappreciated_work_sacrifice_death/", "title": "unappreciated work, sacrifice, death", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lofilofilofianalog", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1433621168, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/38txgj/unappreciated_work_sacrifice_death/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428247.195955, "replies_charged": false}
