At first I wanted to change everything and do something about it, but I tried and nothing went as expected and I ended up with even more trouble. I don't want you to feel compassion about me and my stuff, but I need to feel better and that somebody in the world cares just a little. I want to end with this pain I can't get rid of unless I die, because it is only in my head and I am already tired of feeling watched and vulnerable. I feel so tired of having to expect another day with even more loneliness and nobody to trust. I don't know what to do at this point so I'm not looking for help at all, just a little comfort.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oyxkc1/just_another_14_year_old/", "title": "just another 14 year old", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "gatitosetu", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628216785, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oyxkc1/just_another_14_year_old/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423026.3295367, "replies_charged": false}
