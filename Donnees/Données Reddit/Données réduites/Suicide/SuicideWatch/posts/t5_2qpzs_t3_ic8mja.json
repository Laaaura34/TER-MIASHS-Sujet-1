Long story short I got in, and couldn't be happier....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut now all this... the entire industry I love so much is gone, the stages are dark, actors and crew out of work, with seemingly no positive news on the horizon. I'm paying a large amount of money (All I've got) to move to Toronto and peruse a dream that may not exist anymore, paying so much to attend online classes,  I'm not good with online classes either, I don't like how little personality comes through when interacting online. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel so overwhelmed all the time, it feels so unfair, I've worked my entire life just to live my one dream, just to have it taken away overnight and there's nothing I can do about it.\n\nThanks for any help you might be able to give. I'll respond to any comments, thank you all!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ic8mja/covid_19_has_ruined_the_only_thing_ive_ever/", "title": "Covid 19 has ruined the only thing I've ever wanted in life.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "utCamren", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1597781269, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ic8mja/covid_19_has_ruined_the_only_thing_ive_ever/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427173.1852813, "replies_charged": false}
