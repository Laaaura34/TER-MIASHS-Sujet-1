I ended up taking another 1000mg for 1.5g total. I didn't die obviously. It kicked in and I started having incredibly realistic hallucinations and my legs soon were heavy and I couldn't walk. I crawled from the lounge to my dorm and was in bed, in and out of consciousness, for the next 48 hours. \n\nFor the next couple days I felt weak and delirious. It was a terrifying experience and I wish it had just killed me. But it didn't, and now I don't know what to do. I feel even more alone then before, because I can't talk to anyone about this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2ui4xr/update_still_alive/", "title": "Update: Still Alive", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Throwaway1012418", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1422871191, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2ui4xr/update_still_alive/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426463.650877, "replies_charged": false}
