My stepfather has always been kind of a dick and my mother has always enabled his behavior. I looked up what toxic parenting looks like and they both fit the descriptions to the fucking dot. \n\nFor some backstory, almost every single attempt (including my most recent, which this story stems from) has involved me trying to give myself alcohol poisoning. If I am being completely honest, I really don\u2019t like alcohol that much. My parents however think I am some sort of alcoholic due to all of my failed attempts - they refuse to believe I am suicidal and think I am feigning suicidal tendencies as a front for alcoholism. \n\nMy most recent attempt (maybe two months ago) was no different. I kept drinking and drinking, and I honestly was really excited because I thought that I\u2019d succeed that night. My stepfather caught me getting more alcohol though. \n\nFor the longest time, I\u2019ve recognized that I\u2019m too much of a pussy to choose any other method, so a while ago I decided that if I was ever stopped again, I would just tell my parents I have a drinking problem rather than letting them know I am trying to commit suicide. My reasoning for this is that I honestly resent my parents. We don\u2019t really talk (small talk pisses me off and that\u2019s all they know), we don\u2019t do anything together (they\u2019re always together; they\u2019re always \u201ctired\u201d so that means they can only watch their show rather than one we both like), and the list goes on. Because of this, I decided that my parents don\u2019t deserve to know how I am really feeling if we never have any normal fucking conversations other than \u201chow was your day\u201d. \n\nSo when my stepfather caught me, I just said \u201cI have a drinking problem\u201d. That was that. I can\u2019t really remember the entirety of the night for reasons that I have made apparent but I remember texting my older sister and her boyfriend what really happened. \n\nNow time skip to the next day and my mom is like \u201cWhat the hell were you thinking\u201d and for some reason I tell her the truth. \u201cI was trying to kill myself.\u201d\nThen I left for school.\n\nI don\u2019t dislike my mom as much as I do my stepfather (I love my mom in all honesty) but my stepfather made sure to convince my mom I couldn\u2019t have possibly be making another suicide attempt and instead was feigning. Now whenever she doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m listening talking to someone else she will be like \u201cHe tried telling us he was trying to kill himself but he told ___ that he had a drinking problem\u201d.\n\nI want to stab myself in the fucking neck just for them to be like \u201chow could we have known\u201d when in reality I actually told them.\n\nI apologize for how incoherent I must sound. I\u2019m writing this with a jumbled mind and I doubt it is easy to understand. I\u2019ll be happy to clarify anything.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9jo20/parents_are_stinky_smelly/", "title": "Parents are stinky smelly", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "jackaroniandcheese", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634415306, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9jo20/parents_are_stinky_smelly/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425271.9710846, "replies_charged": false}
