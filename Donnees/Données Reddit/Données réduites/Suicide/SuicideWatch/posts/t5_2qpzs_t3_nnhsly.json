My entire life is fked just today mom ( whom I had protected from my abusive household) is taking the sides of the abusers whom I had fought so hard. I felt betrayed. I can't even get my meals from my family anymore. I'm literally so thin and weak now. I was hoping my mother and my little sister would at least understand my sacrifices, my protection for them but now that they are taking their sides, I'm hoping mom and the rest are okay with the abuse. I'm probably going down as the worst son, a parents nightmare in the eyes of everyone who knew me but I wish I could tell them that I want nothing more than giving mom and my little sister a life they deserve. I was too weak to fight back, I was protective but too weak to actually protect them. I had the heart but I lack the strength. \n\nBut if I am going down why should these snakes continue to torture mom. It's really wrong ik and I'm trying just so hard to not reach that point of anger but just today these abusers are at it again. I can't stand them rejoicing over my death why should they still be alive when I shouldn't be?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nnhsly/my_suicidal_tendencies_is_starting_to_turn_to/", "title": "My suicidal tendencies is starting to turn to murderous intent.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "abiehamm", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 179, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622271889, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nnhsly/my_suicidal_tendencies_is_starting_to_turn_to/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635428197.301783, "replies_charged": false}
