I'm so angry that it hurts my head so much, so intense, i'm angry to myself for not being good enough. Angry for being weak. Angry because i can't stand for myself. It's a painful anger. I just want this anger, self hatred, and self rumination to stop. I don't want to die either. I'm currently locked inside my body, can't move, only feeling this intense anger feels like my head going to explode.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pokl79/my_anger_will_reach_its_peak_and_feels_like_my/", "title": "My anger will reach its peak and feels like my head is about to explode", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Outrageous_Tea_4264", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631687078, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pokl79/my_anger_will_reach_its_peak_and_feels_like_my/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426812.7325459, "replies_charged": false}
