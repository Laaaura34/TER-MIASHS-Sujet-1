I'm unfortunate enough to have a triple whammy of mental disorders (major depressive disorder,OCD,and autism) that inhibits basically every single function I have.\n\nThis was more than enough to get nonstop and ruthless tormenting from my sisters growing up. I was made fun of and freaked out for fun,one of my sisters molested me when I was only 4 and another beat the shit out of me on a daily basis for years because my mom didn't care enough to stop her,or to pay attention at all. But everyone stopped caring almost entirely when my stupid fucking nephew was born when I was 7. Now he's spoiled rotten,has twin siblings who are also adored,and I'm still ignored. It doesn't help that he was born only 11 days before MY birthday,so my birthdays are always shared with him,and he ends up getting the spotlight every. goddamn. time.\n\nOverall, I'm always ignored and the second choice. It doesn't help that my sisters still dont like me /that/ much and that they all happen to be beautiful,meanwhile I'm an ugly duckling who has a severe testerone imbalance that makes me have terrible acne and body hair,as well as a deep voice. My now ex-girlfriend,who I was in love with beyond description,recently broke up with me and basically said that they only ever wanted to be my friend. \n\nI wish I had the balls to kill myself already.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8veyb5/im_ignored_all_the_time/", "title": "I'm ignored all the time", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "really_sad_cat", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1530496555, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8veyb5/im_ignored_all_the_time/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426475.0310102, "replies_charged": false}
