The point is the cycle never stops. This sub is the end result every time. Why bother? \n\nI somehow manage to seem fairly normal at work and with friends. Hard for people to know how fucked I am. I live like a hermit and decline many offers to hang.  This way they will only see me at my best. The truth is I can genuinely be happy at times. It's just little flickers though, the whole picture is still very dark. I've been this way for so long. I just didn't get a good foundation as a kid.
