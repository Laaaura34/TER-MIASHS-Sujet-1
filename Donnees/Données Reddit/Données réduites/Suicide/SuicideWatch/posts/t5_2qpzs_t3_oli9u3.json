I came out as non-binary to them around late December of 2020. My brother did not take it well. Ever since then, I've been hearing him spew homophobic, transphobic, sexist, and racist rhetoric almost every single day. He's made fun of me to his friends when he thinks I'm not listening. My mother hasn't done anything about it. She tells me that he's an adult, so there's nothing she can do to get him to change his beliefs. She'll tell me that I need to speak with him to smooth things over. I do not think that burden should be on the shoulders of the person being harmed to initiate that conversation. He does not feel any guilt about the things he says, it's only gotten worse over time. My mother says she supports me, but I don't feel supported at all when she doesn't stand up for me at all, only urging me to seek help and to eventually talk to my brother. She said she doesn't want to choose sides with her own children. Which I understand is hard, but it makes me feel so suicidal whenever I think about it.\n\nI don't feel welcome anywhere anymore. I used to at least feel a little bit welcome here at home, but even now that's gone.\n\nI've always been out of place, my whole life, anywhere I've ever been. I have several fairly severe mental health issues that have made day to day life very difficult for me. I dropped out of college years ago, I currently work at a supermarket with no end to it in sight. I don't work very many hours because of the mental illnesses I have, made worse by the severe symptoms I had due to long Covid. I cannot afford to move out anytime soon.\n\n I am also about to be too old to no longer qualify for being covered by my mother's health insurance in a few months. I'm afraid that I'll struggle to pay for my own health once again, and that it will only set me back in terms of finally moving out and becoming an adult. It was very expensive to pay for my psychiatrist visits before I was able to be covered under my mother's insurance. I'm terrified to have to start all over again with a new doctor, or to have to go any period of time without the mood stabilizers, anti-anxiety medication, and ADD medications that make it even a little bit possible to function. If I lose my medicine, I might be dead for real. I'm afraid to seek a therapist due to the fact that I'm about to lose the insurance coverage, I don't want to get attached to a therapist only to not be able to afford seeing them anymore. I also have trauma about therapy stemming from a past therapist, who told me I was never sexually abused when I came forward to her one session and told her that I thought I might have been raped. I don't know what's happened to me anymore, maybe she was right all along.\n\nI'm sorry. I have struggled with suicidal thoughts for over half of my life, but never before have these thoughts felt so real. I don't have any long term plans or goals anymore. I had plans to travel, but Covid ruined that. Even now that things are starting to pick back up, I don't really care about traveling anymore. I'm an artist and had ideas for long term projects I wanted to make. These ideas don't matter anymore either, I never start anything and I never finish anything because my ADD gets in the way. I used to have hobbies and things I enjoyed doing, but nothing is enjoyable or rewarding anymore. Every day is the same, I wake up in the afternoon, work a few days a week at my night shift job, get home and eat a shitty meal, work on my art in the most inefficient and energy consuming way possible, fall asleep after the sun is up, maybe for 3-5 hours a day, or 10+ hrs on a bad day. Rinse and repeat. I'm too old to be living like an overgrown 13 year old, but here I am. I leech off of my mother's resources, I seek attention and pity because I decided adults didn't pay enough attention to me as a child, I make everything into a much bigger issue than it ever needed to be.\n\nComing out as non-binary was ultimately so inconsequential. I asked for a change in pronouns, but almost no one has used them. I came out because I wanted to live an authentic life, but I've regretted it every single day since I started hearing my brother say horrible things on a daily basis. Everyday, I don't feel welcome in my own home, and I wish I were deceased. I don't have any active plans at the moment to take my life, but I don't know if I see myself living any longer than a year from now. I am exhausted and empty and there is no joy in my life. I feel this is a battle I'm going to end up losing. I never should have been non-binary, or ADD, or mentally ill, or stupid. I'm sorry.
