So, I have been feeling suicidal lately and I have had a lot of SH urges. I decided it was about time to talk to the hotline and of fucking course, the entire thing was down on the moment I needed it most. So here I am, sitting down, legs shaking bc I am the fucking verge rn. I had to try so fucking hard not to do harmful stuff to my body.\n\nHere I was, sitting, and thinking once again: \"enough of this crap\". As I had no other people to talk to, I was finally going to tell my girlfriend I was feeling this way. I didn't care anymore. It was too fucking dangerous to be sitting there all alone. I tell her everything and you know what happens? I HAVE BEEN LEFT ON READ FOR HOURS. I can't. I don't know what to do. My apologies if there was harsh language,but I am just fucking baffled at wtf is going in with my life and I don't know what to think of the person I was supposed to trust. It just feels beyond embarrassing. Does she see me for some kind of attention seeker? That's the end of my rant. I think I am just going to sleep.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q8vzge/being_left_on_read_after_funding_to_courage_to/", "title": "Being left on read after funding to courage to say you were feeling suicidal.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "enderfighter5000", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 30, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634327279, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q8vzge/being_left_on_read_after_funding_to_courage_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635421117.6437426, "replies_charged": false}
