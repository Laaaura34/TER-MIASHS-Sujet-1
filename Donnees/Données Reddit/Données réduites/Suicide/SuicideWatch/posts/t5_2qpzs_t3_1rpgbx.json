I am almost 30 and did not finish high school, hilariously enough I was skipped from grade 10 to 12, but then I fucked up horribly. I just felt horrible, skipped a lot (went to the library of all places to read and be alone) and just stopped caring. This is a massive embarrassment causes me to lie to people, they think I'm smart etc etc. I even lied to get my current job.\n\nI don't even have a car nor do I have license to drive one. \n\nI go to a psychiatrist every week, but it's not helping. Nothing really helps as this is something I accepted I needed to do since I was 17.\n\nMy depression destroyed my first relationship. My fiance could not handle thinking about me being dead and her being without me, so I gave her an out. She left.\n\nOn sunday my depression... not not my depression... [i]I[/i] destroyed another relationship. She left. I am alone now. \n\nBut it has given me plenty of time to think. I just spread hurt everywhere I go. I hurt the two women I loved. Just thinking about it makes my heartache. \n\nI've already started to prepare everything. I have cleaned out both my fridge and kitchen. I threw the food out and picked up boxes to store all my plates and misc in. I then wrote who can have what on the boxes.\n\nI then cleaned out my desk and computer area. Packed everything up.\n\nMy clothes came next. Most of them (except for what I need for the next few days) are in bags and will be donated into those charity bins when I go and hunt for a spot. I want my house as clean as possible so I cause little inconvenience as possible for moving whatever remains of my belongings. My apartment is starting to look like I'm moving out.\n\nI purchased most of the supplies, the rope, anti-nausea pills, oven bag, vodka and prescription sleep aids... I lied to my pharmacist and said I was moving and asked if I could just fill them all now as my new 'home' is going to be pretty remote. \n\nAt noon today I am going to the doctors and get more medications. I am telling him I am having bad anxiety (which is true). I'll crush all pills and put them into capsules. I know they won't kill me, but they'll lower my inhibitions and hopefully knock me out. 30 Ambien, 30 Lunesta and 60 xanax so far, I hope the doctor can give me valium. \n\nI have not been eating for 3 days now in an attempt to lose weight, as all I could afford was 200lb test weight marine nylon rope. I need to lose as much weight as possible. I also want to be as sensitive to the drugs and alcohol as possible. \n\nI was so sad earlier. Now with the cleaning and preparations I feel almost pretty normal and oddly... kind of driven. But I know I need to do this. But this sadness and pain comes back if I'm not careful, it's a weird struggle wrestling with it.\n\nA huge worry is people other then the police finding me. Or worse wild animals. I know it's strange to worry about being eaten by animals even after I'm dead, I live in a place with plenty of bears, wolves, coyotes and cougars. So it's a concern.\n\nI do need help. I do want someone to try to reason me out of this.\n\n\nEdit: A long time friend messaged me out of the blue today. She wants to get together this today. The only problem is I am flat broke, I cannot afford the bus money. \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1rpgbx/planning_on_leaving_this_weekend/", "title": "Planning on leaving this weekend", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throaway238389054", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1385728110, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1rpgbx/planning_on_leaving_this_weekend/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426473.376805, "replies_charged": false}
