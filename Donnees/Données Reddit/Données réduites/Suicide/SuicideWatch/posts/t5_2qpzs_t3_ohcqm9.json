I see that and wish to myself it could be me who does instead. I imagine all the fears and worries I'd never have to face again. All the monotony, boredom, pain, suffering, all of it gone. Return to the dark, the void, nothingness. Home. The good things in life are a pittance to pay to escape the horrors of life. The humiliation that accompanies it. If only a quick death was so forthcoming in the real world. It's somewhat odd how I simultaneously see the deaths of others as a tragedy and my own as a freedom, as an escape from punishment.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ohcqm9/whenever_i_watch_movies_i_wish_i_could_take_the/", "title": "Whenever I watch movies I wish I could take the place of characters who die", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "methylphenidate1", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 21, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625894888, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ohcqm9/whenever_i_watch_movies_i_wish_i_could_take_the/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427027.1436076, "replies_charged": false}
