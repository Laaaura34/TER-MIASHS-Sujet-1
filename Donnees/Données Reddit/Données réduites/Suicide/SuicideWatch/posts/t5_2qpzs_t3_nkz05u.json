It's not like it's going to get better and I'm only prolonging the inevitable suffering that I'll endure. I wish I wasn't so scared and I hate myself for being a coward. If only I have more motivation to end it, it would be so much easier for me. The only reason I'm still here is because the option of killing myself if things go terribly wrong comforts me. I hate being indecisive and unsure. I should either be happy with life or have no hesitation to end it all.
