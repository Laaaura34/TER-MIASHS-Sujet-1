For example, I\u2019m just simply walking and I\u2019m just thinking about how nice it would be if someone walked up to me and just ended my life for me so at least my parents and family wouldn\u2019t be upset at me for doing it myself. I\u2019ve have these thoughts and daydreams for years now, but they just appear more and more often. Every time I leave the house actually. \nWhen I cross the road I imagine getting ran over by a car so I tend not to look both ways anymore. \nI\u2019ve been avoiding waking across bridges because the urge to throw myself off is overwhelming. Does anyone else go through this or is it just me. \nI\u2019m ready to stop living to be honest. I\u2019m just really tired of living.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ocbtzo/a_constant/", "title": "A constant", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Jobutyouneverknow", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625237930, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ocbtzo/a_constant/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426568.3024268, "replies_charged": false}
