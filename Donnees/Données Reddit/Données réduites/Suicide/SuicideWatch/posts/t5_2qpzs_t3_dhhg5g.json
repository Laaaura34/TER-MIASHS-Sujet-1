I've developed bad habits that led me to drop out of high school and led me to be socially isolated and led me to be irreversably damaged.\n\nThe other day I had a picture taken of me for a membership card. That is when I realized I'm hideous. I'm 21 and I'm obese and I'm nearly bald. People make fun of me in social settings because I'm damaged inside and out.\n\nI'm a straight, white, christian-believing male. I sometimes hear that is something to be desired. But nobody cares about me. I'm miserable every day. I am damaged by prolonged isolation, bulimia, and a flawed personality. I'm an easy target.
