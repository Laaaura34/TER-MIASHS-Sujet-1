I\u2019m still a teenager so ig I can blame it on hormones and puberty and shit but I don\u2019t know if I can go on. I relapsed on self harm again recently. I cut on my ankle for the first time after coming to the conclusion that my mom won\u2019t check my ankles for cuts the way she does my arms. I\u2019m tired as fuck but I can\u2019t sleep for some reason. I\u2019ve been thinking of offing myself for a long time now but it\u2019s been my fixation for the past few days. I honestly think I\u2019m going to do it. Idk how deep I have to slit my wrists to die but i guess we\u2019ll find out lol /j \nI\u2019ve been hurting myself for a while and having issues in the mental department for almost a year now, but I think it\u2019s at its worst right now. This is the first time it\u2019s gotten to the point where I\u2019m genuinely considering killing myself and feeling like this. I feel like I can\u2019t be happy anymore. I can be distracted, but I don\u2019t think that qualifies as happy. I\u2019ve accepted that suicidal thoughts will probably follow me around for the rest of my life but they\u2019ve gotten so bad that at this point, I don\u2019t feel the way I used to. \u201cI\u2019m depressed because I feel like I\u2019m horrible and I wanna die bc I think the world will be better without me and I\u2019m tired of suffering,\u201d was how it used to be. NOW, it\u2019s \u201cThe world is shitty and I\u2019m too tired to deal with it, I\u2019m tired of suffering and the world isn\u2019t worth my time or efforts.\u201d Cringy teenager shit, I know. If my parents read this they\u2019ll send me away to some psych ward. They\u2019ll have a long talk with me about how by hurting myself I hurt them too and basically belittling my pain and telling me my emotions are invalid and my struggle isn\u2019t bad enough to cause me to hurt myself. \nI\u2019m thinking that getting sent away might help since I\u2019m actively looking for a diagnosis. I literally just need an answer to what\u2019s wrong with me. This got a lot longer than I wanted it to as well, e.\nI\u2019m gonna try to sleep, goodnight", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mii6zi/im_so_fucking_tired/", "title": "I\u2019m so fucking tired", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "h0mo_3rectus", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617362020, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mii6zi/im_so_fucking_tired/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428124.3908541, "replies_charged": false}
