The thought would not leave my head and i was looking forward to it (i'll do it saturday night) i pictured it over and over. Even planning to do a \"will\" in mp3 form and leaving a USB in my pocket, and my phone having my password on it with instructions.\n\nAs i approach that moment i have that question pop up \"What if i screw it up?\" \"I'll make things even more difficult for my family\"\n\nI dabble in my chosen method and see how it works and how easy it would be, but my brain kicks in and stops it.\nI wish i had that full conviction to do anything and not be indecisive constantly. I know that makes me a weak person as i believe when people accomplish their death it isn't \"an easy way out\" by any means and it takes a lot to be able to push through not only your resolve but survival instinct. \nI'm tired, i want everything to just stop.\"\n\nI wrote that 3 days before my birthday, and today more issues weigh on me and i still wish for it. Due to my family being unable to afford to live in our current house family has to split into 2 houses and rather than wasting money living on my own i stick with my dad. They've got a decent plan going forward but in my head id rather kill myself, have most of the money be sent to my sister and her family and then my dad and his wife wont have to deal my presence any longer.\n\nOver 10 years and it still doesn't \"get better\"", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fhssev/saved_a_submission/", "title": "Saved a Submission", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Hybrid67", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1584067763, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fhssev/saved_a_submission/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426680.6310732, "replies_charged": false}
