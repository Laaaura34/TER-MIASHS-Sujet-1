I wrote on the phone and I am still an emotional wreck. I can't step back and look at this objectively anymore because anything that involves my family completely throw me off. It's been a day after the nuclear fallout. I am still breaking out in silent tears as I unintentionally recall the past. I don't feel alright unloading this huge burden on my acquaintances. This is too close to them and it will skew their perspective.\n\n\nFamily background\n\nI am from a traditional Asian family. Stern parents, constant goal post moving, unreasonable expectations, the full works. Parents relationship was always pretty rocky and it took a nose dive once my father became wheelchair bound. Even before he passed away, it was difficult to be around him. He was very moody, grouchy, and he coped with whatever was bothering him by shopping. Honestly, the entire family has a hoarding problem as well, we just all hoard different things.  \n\n\nThe thing with my father and I is that everyone says we are very much alike, looks and personality. Which means whatever issues the rest of my family had dealt with regards to my father, highly likely they'll apply the same tactic when it comes to me: pretend they don't see it. Tip toe around the issue. He'll get over whatever it is eventually. Everything but actually resolving the thing.\n\n\nWhat I am\n\nEveryone else in the family are extroverts or very well disguised ones. I am a hyper sensitive INFP and a Type 5 on the enneagram. I second hand cringe when characters on tv shows are put in embarrassing and humiliating situations. But being in touch with my own feelings have always been difficult. Emotions get suppressed as a result of survival mechanism or family pressure. They would erupt at inopportune times. Always set off by an external trigger, 95% of the time, it's my family. By personal dispostion and even maybe even genetic makeup, I feel a deep need to be responsible and do the right thing, which makes me very favorable to traditional type Asian parents: meek, obedient overall, doesn't to crazy things that will rock the boat, malleable, easy to influence. My biggest con to my family is probably my extreme reluctance to be sociable to people. Father was stuck with the notion that I should try to be the leader type when I was far more comfortable with being someone in the background. Because according to him, he was an introvert in college as well. He overcame it and became a very sociable business person. Lunch or dinner with family acquaintances and friends were never a dull moment with him around. At home though, food time was always a stressful time for me. The friendly, generous businessman is gone. He's the elephant in the room. And sometimes he would push me to make conversations when I just wanted to eat in peace. \n\nI know exactly, felt exactly, what I was and want. I was pushed to be an extrovert and other things I was not comfortable with. They pushed me into it, their logic being I'll grow out of whatever weird phase I was going through. So for over 2/3 of life I suppressed myself. \n\n\nSigns of deep rooted problems\n\nIssues started to flare up during college when the freedom of being on my own led to me doing poorly in school the first year. Sorry I don't have any wild college stories, the widest thing I had done was staying up all night playing video games. Poor school performance and the looming parental expectations were doing a number on my mental health at the time. I saw school psychologist, with his help I wrote a letter to be read by my parents as I return back to school. Even the thought of interacting with them directly to bring up the trouble at a school would sent into a panic. I feel slightly short of breath even as I write this. They were supportive of me at the time, I graduated eventually with no further slip up. But that never solved the underlying issue, me.\n\nWhen little things and minor incidents started to pile up, it just slowly builds up from an anthill into a volcano. Because everything was constantly suppressed like a pressure cooker, it eventually exploded. In my late teen dissatisfaction and unhappiness with the rest of my family really began to flare up. I was no longer a gullible child anymore, I was feeling more things but I was still unable to process them. A skill that I did not pick up until well after I graduated from college, after I started seeing a life coach and therapist. Before I learned that skill, there was a time when something just snapped inside me. My father said something during lunch that upset me. I felt compelled to leave the house, because at the time it didn't feel safe for me deep down. My mind couldn't understand that at the time, I just took one of the family cars and drove off. \n\nSmart phone wasn't a thing at the time and I was still an extremely insecure young adult. I wandered around aimlssly outside in the car, ended up at a beach to cool my head. Dark thoughts and suicide plagued my mind even then. Beach goers were giving me strange looks, I doubt I looked well at the time. After staring at the waves for close to an hour, the internal Responsibility and The Right Thing voices convinced me to go back. I used a payphone nearby to call home, because it's the right thing to do. \n\n\nAttempts to reconcile\n\nFast forward a bit to when I was still seeing professional help. I made the active decision to not be like mini dad no2. Which meant I need to try to bridge the gap by attempting open communication. 1st time it didn't go well, I was only working with the coach. During dinner I tried to speak up, I was choking on words alot. Everyone else immediately got defensive and started putting blame back on me. In emotional wreck, I tried to storm out from the house but my sister tried to stop me. Given the emotional state I was in, trying to trap me at home was only going to push me over the edge more. Having no other recourse I had to call the coach at 7 or 8 pm so she could explain that they need to leave me be right now. I walked all the way to the local library to have some space. That's attempt number 1. \n\nAttempt no2, I was seeing coach and actual therapist. There was some game plan, I was going to try to have a talk at lunch with them while out in public. Maybe they wouldve been more receptive. History only repeated itself, they seemed more interested in eating than listening to what I said. Worst Xmas ever. After the awkward drive home, I called the suicide helpline. I took the car and drove to a motel some distance away, it was impossible to be home anymore. I was away for 2 weeks. And I asked my therapist to have a talk with them. And.... They didn't get it at all. Whatever issues I was going through my sister just dumbly suggest the therapist to prescribe pills for me. I asked the therapist to convey the main message that if they really wanted to help me, they need to do it the way a friend would: with respect and boundaries. That clearly went over their heads. I think their main takeaway was that the therapist was a bit hostile to them. They suggested that she was a crack and I should stop seeing her. I would just become reliant on her according to them.\n\nThere cannot, will not be a 3rd time of this. The only ways I can survive another emotional Armageddon is with a mediators help. \n\n\nA tool taken for granted\n\nHere we finally get to everything that erodes my trust towards them. No space, no respect, no boundaries, no voice. Even when I was still in school, whenever I was home from school my sister would coerce me to work for her on her jobs. There were some payment for the time, but she cited that the company wasn't doing well enough so she couldn't pay me. That payment wasn't the biggest issue, our family was ok financially. There was a time when I caught Hand Hoof and Mouth disease from her as a carrier. (Yes the name sounds terrible and stupid, but it's real) I was sick in bed with a disease that literally makes walking into a torture exercise. Each step was thousands of pins and needles stabbing into my foot. My hands were in the same condition. Unfortunately her jobs involve a large amount of moving things: furniture, artwork, accessories, etc... She couldn't find anybody so it was \"suggested\" that I go help her out. She didn't even try to call anybody. No I never got anything from her, her thanks were as empty as her promises. I felt more like a convenient tool than a person in this family. \n\nMore fast forward, this time I am in charge of clearing out a warehouse we are moving out of. Everything needs to go, sister already had plans to travel abroad for school so she wouldn't be around for the later portion of the wrapping up. The biggest problem was she's a lazy fuck, even when she was around she barely went to the warehouse to clear things out. Everything boring, menial, physical just fell on me most of the time already. Because her job was more important, mine wasn't. So she basically skipped out on the toughest part of cleanup. Second snafu happened, my mother was in the picture now. She prided herself at being extremely handy and hands on, so she said she would help out at the warehouse. Instead what happened was she would make my job far more complicated than it already was. Worst of all, she was more occupied with salvaging dismantled woods and hauling them home then help me clear other more important items out. She boasted to her friend at what she had made out of those wood. Our pool turned into her work area according to her, but it was just full of clutter, garbage and misplaced tools. I was deeply and clearly distressed at the time. I told her what there were other things that needed to be done but just just completely ignored me. At a certain point she finally saw how absolutely livid I had become. I was sick and tired of her wood scraps, I called a garbage company and had them haul the rest of the shit away. She didn't argue about it. But trust was broken when she had already had spotty records. The warehouse incidents left me deeply resentful towards both of them, it been at least 5 years now and I still can't let it go.\n\nEver since then I've just always harbored this distrust, anger and resentment towards them. There were other incidents that kept contributing to the hate ball but I'll spare the details. I can be kind and generous to total strangers, but not to my own family. They have overdrawn their Kindness account. That anger reached nuclear level last night. \n\n\nGoing nuclear\n\nA number of issues had been popping on our house. Chimney was inspected, oh your top needs to be repaired to prevent future water damage. The vents havent been cleaned, let's get that taken care of. Sorry miss your ducts have asbestos on them and the asshole who installed your heater didn't do the job right. So it's just constant Murphy's laws, I was the one dealing with all the annoying life problems. Because the sister is forever too busy with her work to lift her actual fingers to help out the house. Position wise I am the most flexible one. I don't even have a job now, but when I ask for help or input her responses were always brusque and dismissive. Like it's only my problem. Nothing to do with her. Apparently nothing in that happens in the family has anything to do with her. The final powder keg was courtesy of my mother. She had been heavily overloading our car with concrete to the degree that I can observe obvious signs on the car tires. Concrete sat on that poor car for around 3 weeks until my sister finally also saw the problem and we moved them off. Mother overload it again after that first batch was off. Home Depot staff was so concerned that they warned that we were overloading the car. She didn't heed their warning. Car didn't explode, but I was in a panic to get car to a mechanic because she already said she's doing a 3rd run. Mechanic wasn't sure what works were done on the car because the dealership's service center records couldn't be seen by the mechanic. The estimated repairs were almost as long as this post because of it. No big deal, we should have all the cars service records at home... My mother chucked all of them because they were useless according to her. ... I fetched the records from the center myself after borrowing a car from my uncle, because my useless sister was too busy with her work to leave slightly early to get them. Citing she couldn't get any work done at home. Yeah because you would just goof off in your bed. \n\n2 years ago or so, I wrote a sort of Me manual and sent it to both mother and sister. No way in hell was I able to calmly and rationally explain this competently in conversations. Basically the manual is on how a Type 5 functions. Main point: I really, REALLY need my Fortress of Solitude and things would go very terribly if I was not able to. See Xmas incident and beach staring. \n\nMy temper was one bad choice of word away from erupting last night. I tossed the records to my mother and gave her the link to the mechanic's repair estimate, I didnt want to have anything to do with the damn car anymore. My sister came down to talk about the records, eventually getting very frustrated with me because I was already livid and needed the time and space to cool off. Eventually we both blew up, even more so for me because it triggered a lot of all the previous issues. I was rage crying, screaming at her telling her to get out and leave me the hell alone. There was a fine line of still being able to salvage things but then she crossed it. She had to have her last words. \n\n\"You are always playing the victim.\"\n\nThat sentence pushed me over the edge. There was no longer any coming back. \"I'll show them. Ill show them fucking all. I'll do it by killing myself for real. It's only a bother to you because now you gotta put in some works for the family. You want to be big shot? Go ahead. I am done being a helpful responsible tool. You can deal with all the problems and nightmares. You and mother clearly know everything that I don't. I am still just a child, can't take actual pressure, don't know a damn thing about the real world and etc. Since I am such a useless sack of shit, then I'll just disappear from your fucking life.\" \n\nI walked all the way to the local Walgreens, dangerous hateful spiteful words on my mind the entire time. Once I reached Walgreens, I sat down on the bench outside and unloaded all the hate and anger I have onto an online document. It was nowhere near as long as this behemoth, as my phone was getting low on battery. In the document I cursed and swore at them. I never used such strong words directly to them. In it I called them monsters and murderers, because I was hateful and wanted to twist that knife of hate as deeply and painfully as possible. I even said I will curse them and hate them as I die. I called her out directly. \"You had only one job. To leave me the fuck alone when asked to. That was in THE FUCKING MANUAL, I NEED TO BE LEFT ALONE. I EVEN SAID SO JUST NOW. But no, you had to have your last words in. good job. They really are your last words now. Why should I expect someone who tried to break my door down with a hammer to change? You will never change. You are a fucking monster and I hate you.\" \n\nTerrible things were said, designed to hurt. I don't regret it. My pain and suffering weren't fake. I did try to make things work, but teaching a dog to dance is more feasible than fixing this wreck. I shouldn't do the thing to get get even, but when actual death was on my mind and I never got what I felt was justice for me. I didn't care anymore. No one else was going to speak up for me except for me.\n\nI originally considered posting that letter on the family LINE, backed out last minute and only sent it to the bitch of a sister directly in email. Subject line: Bye\n\nAs much as a human wreck I was, I didn't want to risk mother figure getting a heart attqck when she already suffered from a stroke last year. The straw that broke me this time was the bitch sister.\n\nAfter hitting sent, I shut off my phone and went on searching for sleeping pills to overdose on. All I could find were just supplements. Good thing I dislike physical pain? I bought a notebook, some pens and marker in the end. Because I wasn't done writing about everything they've put me through. It was suppose to be my another FU to them, a death notebook. All the words I was unable to say directly to their faces I vomited all over the pages. It's angry letter times eight, judging by the length. I seriously contemplated sending that notebook. But...\n\nAs I wrote in it I feel a deep regret towards my dog and my fictional characters. Yes I feel far more affections towards my dog and imaginary characters than my family, they've done far more for my mental wellbeing than my actual family. My stories were my coping mechanism. The dog the adorable fluff that softens most family situations. They are the ones barely holding me on this mortal plane, what kind fucked up shit is this. \n\nI am currently staying at a motel. The original plan was to literally overdose on sleeping pills but I couldn't find any that isn't supplements. Didn't want to make a mess by jumping in front of the train either. So I walked to a motel I've stayed before and just wrote and wrote... My mind is empty and incapable of thinking beyond the now. The desire for death is still overwhelming and only grows whenever I caught sight of family's text and voice notifications.\n\nI don't know how to go on. My death notebook ended up being the thing that's keeping me vaguely sane right now\n\n\n\n\n\nTl;Dr I had a nuclear meltdown with the family who's probably been emotionally neglecting or abusive throughout most of my life. A line was crossed and trust will never be repaired at this point. I wrote a hate filled email with the express purpose of twisting the dagger to the bitch who crossed the line. I am still too emotionally drained and brain dead to think beyond I HATH FURY. What else can I do. 30-50% of the brain still leans towards death as revenge. Briefest glimpse from their text and voicemail notifications just send that hate and anger bubbling up again.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pyemc9/i_had_a_major_falling_out_with_my_probably/", "title": "I had a major falling out with my probably emotionally negligent family, seriously contemplated committing suicide as revenge [warning: very long post]", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "FlyingToasterDog", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632985919, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pyemc9/i_had_a_major_falling_out_with_my_probably/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428321.0705585, "replies_charged": false}
