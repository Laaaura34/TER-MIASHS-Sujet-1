My OCD is better when I\u2019m hard at work\u2014when I\u2019m too occupied working and too busy to to let the thoughts ruminate. But work is draining and it\u2019s painful it requires so much effort and I need a break. So I get my \u201cbreak\u201d, but then the OCD comes back full speed and the rumination begins\u2014the constant thoughts they tear me up, they cause so much anxiety and much discomfort. I just need a break. I\u2019m sick of this life and i pray for an accelerated death.\n\nI wish I could stop complaining and actually conspire to finally kill myself. How long will I keep complaining and when will I fucking start conspiring? One day I will conspire and actually do it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/od6fga/i_cant_handle_the_constant_work_and_misery/", "title": "I can\u2019t handle the constant work and misery", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Monkey__Shit", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625346550, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/od6fga/i_cant_handle_the_constant_work_and_misery/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428021.33528, "replies_charged": false}
