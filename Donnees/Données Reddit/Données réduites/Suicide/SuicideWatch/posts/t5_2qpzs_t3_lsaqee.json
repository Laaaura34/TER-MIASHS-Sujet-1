My father started a new family and I was rarely in touch with him.  He has since passed on due to illness.\n\nI have done pretty well in life so far, being relatively well-educated with a range of hobbies (courtesy of my mother). However, beyond the visible successes, I have been fighting my suicidal thoughts for the past 2 decades.  I have attempted suicide and failed thrice so far (twice saved by someone of great importance).  I live in a small Asian society where suicide and mental health have been taboo until the past couple of years.  \n\nWhen I was 12, I attempted to end my life for the first time by jumping off an apartment block, only to be stopped by a resident of apartment block who spent 2 hours talking me out of it.  I felt unwanted by my parents, as mentioned above and due to my mother being unable to take time off work.  I was often teased by schoolmates for being a 'discarded' child.\n\nAs I entered my teenage years, I was filled with anger and hatred for everything around me, often getting into fights in school.  I was on a path of self-destruction with underage smoking and drinking, and giving up on education.  With some luck, I managed to do well enough at the national examinations to make it to junior college (high school) and continued my studies.\n\nIt was in high school where I met a girl who showed me hope and light for the first time.  Those days are still the happiest days of my life.  She had immense patience and care for me, and I learned to open up to people around me.  My peers noticed a positive change in my behaviour, and knew it was due to her influence.  But ultimately, my fear of losing her to someone else led me to close up and destroy everything I had.  I did not want to experience the heartbreak of having her taken from me so I broke her heart instead without giving her any explanation.  Instead of protecting and fighting for us, I cowered and ran in self-preservation, ditching her aside, in hopes of not suffering the pain.  How wrong I was.  The self-assurance that I had soon faded, and the realisation of the pain I had inflicted on both her and myself begun to gnaw away at me, festering like a infection that cannot be cured.  \n\nIn the years after, I have dated other girls, each time failing to build a deep connection because I am unable find a way to open up.  I have ended up hurting one girl after another because of my selfish desire to 'move on'.  Moving on was never truly possible because the guilt weighs very heavily on me.\n\nThe second time I attempted to end my life, I had drunk dialled her just prior to the attempt.  Hearing her voice instantly brought back every ounce of joy and happiness from our good times but also the pain and guilt of what I had done.  For some reason, after learning that she was in a new relationship, I got off the bridge over the river (also the same location we had first gotten together).  I convinced myself then that I should live on a little longer, in hopes of seeing her happily married before departing.\n\nI moved to a different country for a few years for education.  It was also there where I attempted to kill myself.  I suffered from severe adjustment issues being in a new society and environment.  I felt lonely and isolated, and I let my thoughts consume me.  I was convinced that even if I died then, no one would really be hurt or miss me, and that I would just be another number deleted off the table.  My mother was ballistic when she found out about my attempt, and I was truly touched to know that at least one person still values my existence.  I have since tried to build a 'normal life' in hopes of making my mother proud and have since made a second promise to myself that I must not end my life while my mother is still alive in order to spare her the experience of seeing her only child die.  \n\nThe suicidal thoughts continue to haunt me regularly but I am able to suppress the impulse to act for now.  Once the two conditions above have been fulfilled, I will quietly depart with the least emotional damage to people around me.\n\nFor now, I live on day to day seemingly 'normal' but hiding my sentiments and intentions like a coward.  A coward who has lived more than he deserved.
