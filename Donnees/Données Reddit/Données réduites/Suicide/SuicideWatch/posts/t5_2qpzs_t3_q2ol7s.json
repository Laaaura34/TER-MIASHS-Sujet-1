I feel lonely for some reason despite having friends and family with me . I have tried everything like getting out more  often ( I\u2019m an introvert so don\u2019t do that much ) , studying for long periods of time , reading , hanging out with friends , video games , watching anime , etc . I really don\u2019t get it coz I used did the same stuff like binge watching anime and Netflix and playing video games a year back and I was really happy back  then but I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening now , and no I don\u2019t feel guilty . Please someone who has had a similar experience,help me out I don\u2019t know what to do anymore . Will self harm work ?
