It all started when I was in pre school up to now. I am currently 22 years old. Let me share you my experiences because probably, one of these days, I might quit living my life and this might be the last time I'll share my pain with others.\n\n1. I grew up in a very abusive and unhealthy environment wherein my papa was an alcoholic, braggart, used a lot of force when drunk, chain smoker forcing my mom to have sex with him even though she doesn't want it. (He died 1 year ago)\n\n2. I have a mama who always pressured me to be on the top and forced me to sing because probably someday, I'll get famous by joining variety shows and get rich. When I get low grades or doesn't help our business back then (I started helping the business which is direct selling when I was in my 4th grade like listing the orders and how much money this person owes us etc), I'll get hit so hard. It's one of the reasons why I don't sing anymore.\n\n3. Whenever I do something that doesn't pleases them, they'll hit me so hard that there are times that I will go to school with bruises or pinch marks. My school once called them in and all they said was they didn't hurt me physically because I got into an accident in my home.\n\n4. I think I've experienced so many varieties of punishments such as getting hit by a belt especially the ones with the metal on it, my feet getting tied on a rope and puts me on a sack then be tied on a pole or something and repeatedly hit me, kneel on rice/salt/munggo beans while I balance books on my head and both hands, ny feet tied with a wire and belt all over my body as if I'm a coccon and wasn't given any food and etc. It still haunts me up to this day.\n\n5. I have a brother who is 2 years younger than me and he was the favorite. He is so dumb but has all the freedom and my parents would buy anything he wants. He hits me all the time especially when he doesn't get what he wants or if he's looking for a fight and my parents told me that I shouldn't fight him back or else both of us will get hit. I tried not to but at the end of the day, my brother won't face any punishments from my parents. It was unfair.\n\n6. Elementary days, I have this nephew from my mother's side. My mom helped him to get here from our province to the city so that he can get a better job. There was a time when I was sleeping and he approached my bed. The only person at my house was only me and him. He touched my private parts and I was shocked but that didn't stopped him and he forced me to handjob his dick and he forced me to put his dick on my mouth. He even threathened me not to snitch him or else something bad would happen. It happened again and again. He can't get inside me though. One time, my brother went home to get some stuff and he saw my nephew doing those filthy things to me. My nephew quickly ran away from home. Few days later, my parents talked to my nephew and he got kicked out of our home. My parents didn't asked me anything about it. Days later, my neighbors are talking about me. I didn't know how it got leaked. Probably our babysitter told them about it.\n\n7. My dad was a cheater and a sex offender. He raped some of my babysitters. I have seen his phone texting other women but he hides the names by using a codename. I have seen it once in my eyes when he's having sex with one of our babysitters.\n\n8. My classmates bullied me from elementary to highschool. They would make me feel like I don't belong and they're stabbing me on my back. They even don't like to sit near me or to talk to me. There was a time wherein they would say it to the class that if someone from the class would have a conversation with me, they will treat that person the same as mine. They hide my books or sometimes throw it somewhere, put garbages on my bag, vandalize my belongings and etc.\n\n9. My earliest suicide attempt was in elementary wherein I thought I can die by overdosing myself. I drank the biggest bottle of Ceelin (Vitamin C Syrup) and ended up falling asleep but I didn't die.\n\n10. Years later after the sexual assault, I was on my 6th grade and days before my graduation, I got hospitalized because I got food poisoned. I'm having a hard time breathing so they gave me oxygen. I was sleeping when I heard a familiar voice who is having a conversation with my mom. It was my nephew who abused me and they were talking casually as if nothing happened. I even heard them laughing. I didn't opened my eyes and pretend to sleep and was thinking why they didn't reported him to the police? Why are they still talking casually and laughing as if nothing happened? But all O can do is to pretend that time.\n\n11. Even on my high school days, they would still hit me as if it's their hobby. Many of my babysitters left the house because they can't withstand seeing me getting hit and of course, my dad being a maniac. I feel hopeless and powerless. I have repeatedly leave the house, slitting my wrist and still, did they changed? No.\n\n12. High school days, I have this classmate who was a guy who would bully me and say mean things to me. One day, when our English teacher told us that we have organize a play for our grades and I decided to contribute cardboard boxes for props. This guy said he'll accompany me. My house is near to my school. When I got home, he groped my breasts. I am shocked and stunned and can't do anything about it because I was panicking inside and as if I'm frozen. It brings me back when my nephew sexually abused me. My classmate told me that I should not tell this to anyone. I mean who would believe me? He was the one who leads our room and plenty of girls has a crush on him while me who was constantly bullied by them. It didn't end there. It happened again and again and again. It stopped when one of my classmates caught him with a video but at the end of the day, he said that I liked it even if I don't. How dare he spit those words?\n\n13. Even if I parted ways with my classmates since we all are moving forward on our college years, he would subtlely find a way to get near to me or chat me and would try to hit me. He has a girlfriend that time. He's one of the reasons why I don't join get togethers with my former classmates. I don't want to breathe the same air as his.\n\n14. My papa almost molested me when my parents seperated because he thought I was mama.\n\n15. I didn't finished my college years. I was 17 years old when I decided to leave them, disown my family and stayed out of their radar. If I stayed there longer, I think I am long gone and dead or become crazy because the physical, mental and emotional abuse was so consistent. Thanks to my 2nd ex boyfriend who provided me shelter when I was starting to be independent. He was the same year as mine.\n\n16. I had a hard time adjusting to my work since I was the youngest and my 1st time working. I experienced working from 7am to 10pm, sometimes working on my rest days when my seniors are not present. Some of my co workers are mean and uses their seniority against me. It's like I only wake up to work. My salary for one year was below average and they forgot to upgrade my salary. I felt like I was taken for granted by my work. \n\n17. My relationship with my ex was a merry go round. It has ups and downs. Yes, he really did contributed a lot in my life, but is that an enough or a pass for him to be mean at me, laugh at things that I don't know instead of educating me, humiliate me down to my core? Sometimes, I would gaslight myself whenever we have arguments. I never cheated on him and accepted all his flaws because I loved him SO MUCH as if he's my world. But when he migrated together with his family  he cheated on me. Even 2 of his friends was an accomplice and I've been talking to them and became friends with them before the cheating happened but they didn't said shit about it. I feel so betrayed. When I caught all the messages from his phone, he cried and asked for forgiveness. I accepted his apology. Sounds dumb but I love him damn much. \n\n18. After almost 4 years of being in a relationship with him, he decided to break up with me. We didn't have any arguments and I noticed he was being cold to me and then he finally said it. My heart crumbled into pieces. I though we were endgame. I thought he'll never leave me. He said he fell out of love and doesn't see the future with me. He has complains about my weight (I got fat bc of the contraceptive pills I have to took so I won't get pregnant when he went back here), he wants someone who is earning a lot too (how can I earn when I can't work due to the pandemic and I am in a third world country while he's on a 1st world country likr even if he didn't have a degree, he'll earn so much than I do)\n\n19. It's been a year since we broke up. Right now, I am unemployed. I am living alone. I tried being optimistic in life after all what happened to me but it's as if the universe doesn't want me to be happy. Like I only exist to suffer. My anxiety and depression only progresses from pre school up to now. I feel so powerless, helpless, unloved. Right now, I couldn't stop thinking about killing myself. I am tired of my life. I'm tired of getting bad dreams and having painful flashbacks out of the blue. I feel so stagnant and rotting. I can't apply because I have lung fibrosis since my dad was a chain smoker. I can't risk my health due to the pandemic.\n\n20. I am tired of hearing my friends telling me not to give up in life, find something thst will caught your attention, there's more to life, etc etc. No matter how I try, the demons are too strong. The sadness is eating me alive. So many bad things happened to me to the point that it affected ny way of life. I have massive trust issues, scared of getting attached, social anxiety, anxiety, depression, unstable, etc. I don't have access to mental health help because it's costly.\n\nI am planning to kill myself this year hopefully. I tried fighting but I've been losing. Maybe it's about time for me to give up. I saw the ugly parts of living. Lucky are the ones who didn't see or experienced it. Just when I thought I maybe could have another chance of living a good life, the one who I shared my heart with broke it into pieces. Maybe I am not worthy of love. I don't fit in this world. I am so tired. I can't do it anymore.\n\nI don't care being incinerated in hell.
