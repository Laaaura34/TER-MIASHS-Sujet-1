So I have to put up this persona, I have to pretend to be this smart, happy, funny, overly confident person when I'm really just a sad, pathetic little boy and when I think people are getting close to discovering the real me I push them away because what if they told everyone. What if everyone knew how pathetic I am. They'd all pity me and they'd all start to secretly think they're better than me. Living is so hard, and I'm at my limit, one of these days I'm going to break character and I hope I kill myself before that happens. I don't deserve to live.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9qgpd/i_hate_how_im_such_a_bitch_to_everyone/", "title": "I hate how I'm such a bitch to everyone", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "gayNsadrefrigerator", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634439775, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9qgpd/i_hate_how_im_such_a_bitch_to_everyone/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423169.0986025, "replies_charged": false}
