I hate myself- I want to go home, but they won't let me. I wish I was at least 18 so I could have said no to being admitted. I felt happier before, and here I just suffer every day and feel worse and worse. today is the limit. I can't do this anymore. once the lights go out, I'm using my headphones.I hate this so much. everything is taken away from us here. we have no human rights. no rights to go to the bathroom, no rights to stand up, no rights to go outside, no way we can feel sick without them forcing meal replacements down our throat. I just want to go home and I want to go back. but they wont let me. I'm just 16- please just let me go home.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qfel88/i_want_to_kill_myself_in_hospital/", "title": "i want to kill myself in hospital", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Majestic_Rip_869", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635161101, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qfel88/i_want_to_kill_myself_in_hospital/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422249.430447, "replies_charged": false}
