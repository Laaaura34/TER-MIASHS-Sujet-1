Just tonight I was laying in bed trying to sleep and I thought about letters I would write to the people I care about so they could move on much quicker than if I just took a train somewhere and killed myself so my family wouldn't have to clean me up. \nI want to talk to my friends or my family but I don't really know where to start. My friends and family have so much on their plates right now that I feel I would just be making my problem their problem. Which I cant do, I just got back and they already have to deal with so much of my shit. I just spent my last dollars on gas to get to and from school, I cant even pay for my own food anymore. (My mom is letting me live with her as long as I have good grades) I don't see my life going anywhere, I am just another miniscule ant in the cosmos who gives a damn? I sure as hell wouldn't my country my race and my planet are all going to be swallowed up by self destruction eventually why not beat them to the punch? I don't want to fight myself every day to not just cut some skin off, or bleed out, or find a gun, or take a train and end everything far away. \nI am a broke privileged little asshole that cant even get my college school work finished on time because I figure,  what is the point? If I am not around it is less the teachers have to grade. I really feel horrible that the money that my family has spent on my education has gone to waste and they cannot get that money back. \nWhat really scares me is the thought that if I was ever around a fire arm that I wouldn't be able to resist the urge to end my life right there... I don't know if I came here for help or if I came here to give up.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1zfd7l/how_do_i_ask_for_help_when_everyone_in_my_life/", "title": "How do I ask for help when everyone in my life has their own problems?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "rozen1167", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1393845959, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1zfd7l/how_do_i_ask_for_help_when_everyone_in_my_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422307.2762473, "replies_charged": false}
