The games i play and their community drive me so often to suicidal thoughts that it has become the norm to think this way. I have friends that are unfulfilling and family that honestly isnt the best set of people to be around. My schoolwork drives me insane from boredom or stress. My hobbies and \u2018passions\u2019 bring me nothing as I know that the productions will never live up to a standard that makes me happy, or even satisfied. I don\u2019t want help, i don\u2019t want a future. I just want it to be over. But i just can\u2019t do it. I am grasping at straws from a universe that has given me nothing but pain and suffering for all the years I have struggled to live on it. I have no relationships, i have goals that I will never reach, i have no future.
