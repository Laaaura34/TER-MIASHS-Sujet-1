Now things are just becoming much worse instead. I haven't worked up the guts to use any of the suicide methods I've picked out yet. I really wanted to live but now I'm too afraid, this is the first time my all my hopes have died.\n\nMy whole life I've been underweight from eating problems, so fasting has been relatively easy. The past three days I've had nothing but coffee and a small food item, today's the first day I've had nothing but coffee and I somehow feel perfectly fine. In fact the only bad thing I've felt so far was a mild headache one or two days ago.\n\nI'm doing this because I haven't worked up the guts to harm myself, but I can easier wither away like someone with anorexia. My hopes are that I'll either get better when life can get better, or get worse with life until I die.\n\nSo far I haven't seen any significant change in my weight, but this is only the end of day 4. Fyi I pour french vanilla creamer in my coffee so that's probably a tiny bit of nutrients.
