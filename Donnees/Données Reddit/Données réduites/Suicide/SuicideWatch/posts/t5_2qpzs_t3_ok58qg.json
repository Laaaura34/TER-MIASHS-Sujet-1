Also this is a pretty big post. (I'm sorry) I don't know if this is the right subreddit, I wanted to post on r/DecidingToBeBetter but I thought it was maybe too much. I apologies in advance if I made any mistake because English is my first language. In this moment I am writing this post I am in junior year of high school and I am going to be in senior year.\n\nI have this weird and toxic habit of romanticizing suicide in my head, I think a lot about committing suicide and how I will doing it. I have an obsession about suicide to the point where I can no longer spend a week without thinking about suicide once and this obsession lead me to romanticize and fetishize suicide and suicidal ideation. I don't think I am actually suicidal but I think my low self-esteem lead me to seek attention and pity to others people in a unhealthy way. I also don't I have depression, think of myself as I petty mentally healthy person. I have an history about seeking attention, to my friends especially. For example, when I was in 9th grades, I started telling people I was thinking about ending my own life and one of my friend endured a lot because of my own action. They wanted to help me but I made them feel scared because I kept telling them I was about to commit suicide. I was really toxic to them, mocking them and making them really uncomfortable but pushing their boundaries and I realized that at the end of the year when they stopped talking to me. After that event, I started high school but these though never really went away and I kept making stories about me committing suicide and I leaving my family. I started watching people dealing with suicide just to trigger my own suicidal thought. I fanaticized about how I could end my life and how people would react to my decision. Thinking about suicide make me feel like in control and I feel peace in a way. (Wow, writing about my felling and emotions make me feel better in a weird way)\n\nIn addition to that, I also seek pity a lot, I like when I am the victim and I like when people care for me. I think to myself as the broken hero even though I know damn well I a am a privileged brat in high school who have seen or experienced nothing I was protected and loved by my parents and every one around me. I am unable to take critics except when I know I am in a position of weakness. I think the reason why I am seeking pity is because I was spoiled as a child I never learned how to have a healthy image of myself. The other reason I think why I seek pity from other is because I didn't have any friend when I was a child and I am always trying to be the center of attention (I try to not do it with my family but it's really hard when I am around other people). I know I should not cry because other people have it worse but I can't help it but seeing myself as a victim. \n\nI know I can do better on my own and I see myself talking to a therapist or my parents. I want to improve myself on my own because I want to prove to myself I can do it lone. Plus, I don't want to talk to my parents about this kind of issue with my parents because I am afraid they will make things worse and that I will loose control. \n\nIn conclusion, I want to learn how to stop doing these habit because it's impacting in unhealthy way life and I want to stay in the position and never learn to grow and mature and I know I can do it. I want suicidal thought and I want to learn. I don't want people to pity me, I know I di something wrong in the past.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ok58qg/how_to_stop_seeking_pity_and_romanticizing_suicide/", "title": "How to stop seeking pity and romanticizing suicide ?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "next_squad", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626272143, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ok58qg/how_to_stop_seeking_pity_and_romanticizing_suicide/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423114.2631958, "replies_charged": false}
