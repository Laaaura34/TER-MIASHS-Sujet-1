Havent had a good night sleep since i was 14, im now 19.\n\nYou never realise how much sleep is a blessing until it\u2019s taken away from you. I really want to sleep but I just cannot. I want to sleep so i can forget about existing for a few hours. \n\nEven when i sleep I\u2019m tired. I could sleep for 8 hours and I would still feel tired. Im so tired of being tired. \n\nHonestly though im scared. My father comitted suicide when i was 14 and my mother hasnt been the same since. I would honestly just like to die, maybe fade into nothingness. But what would become of my mother? I cant do it for her sake. At least for now i have to keep going.\n\nSorry for the dump.
