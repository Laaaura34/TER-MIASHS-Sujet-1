Nan's got the telly on watching some gardening show, nothing to do tomorrow nothing to do today, don't wanna be here but cant kill myself because it would fuck up other peoples lives. Literally writing this as i have nothing else to do, how the fuck do i even meet people, i'm 24 its too old to make new friends you cant just walk up to some one and talk to them, they will say sorry do i know you. It's a fucking joke, the world is a poster for a movie you never get to see and i'm fucking over it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/es1tkk/so_sick_of_this_mind_numbing_boredom/", "title": "So sick of this mind numbing boredom", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Badbob992", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1579643868, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/es1tkk/so_sick_of_this_mind_numbing_boredom/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427040.9809148, "replies_charged": false}
