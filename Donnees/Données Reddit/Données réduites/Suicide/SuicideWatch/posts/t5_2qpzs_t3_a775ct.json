I'm drunk anyway.\n\nI'm trying hard not to die. It seems pretty close despite my feeble attempts at distraction and distance. I'm on that dangerous edge of ambivalence and weakened inhibition. I can recognize all of this in both curiosity and horror.\n\nThe only answer is to go to bed. I will flee toward sleep, and hope that I get there before the gun goes off. And in the morning, I need to get to the gym before I can start thinking. That means 0400. That's the only place where I can hurt myself and no one thinks twice. I will try to burn this madness out of my veins... Or at least exhaust myself so that I don't have the energy for anything else.\n\nHappy Birthday to me\n\nYeah. Whatever.\n\nI kinda hope I don't wake up tomorrow.\n\nI'll probably be disappointed", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/a775ct/todays_my_birthday/", "title": "Today's My Birthday", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ingravitas", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1545103052, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/a775ct/todays_my_birthday/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426439.2810223, "replies_charged": false}
