The last thing I want to do is take attention away from teens or younger adults because that deserve it more. The fact that I\u2019m writing this feels like an act of self-indulgence. I\u2019ve had a history of major depression going back to high school, so around 2005/2006. It caused me to drop out of college in 2009. This was in no small part due to a concurrent alcoholism. I managed to build a decent career in the craft beer industry despite (probably due to in some part) my alcoholism. Last year, Hoping to distance \nmyself from alcohol I quit my job and  went back to school. I\u2019m back in college now, I\u2019m in class with kids for subjects for which I have no use, I\u2019m spending thousands of dollars upon the debt I\u2019ve already accumulated and I feel like like I\u2019ve made the biggest mistake of my life. I lost my health insurance when I quit my job and with it my Psychiatrist & Therapist along with my anti-depressant and sleep medications. I have a history of cutting, mostly on my left arm and occasionally on my thighs. I\u2019ve tried to overdose twice. I\u2019ve presented my situation in a fairly clinical manner here, but it feels like the tide is coming higher every time. I don\u2019t know.
