I'm going to lose my job soon, I don't have a license, the girl I'm in love with is mentally and emotionally checked out of our relationship, no home, no car, living with people who don't even acknowledge my existence. I've been having panic attacks again. I feel like such a burden. I feel so unloved and unwanted. I can't enjoy anything anymore. I'm broken and useless, letting down anyone who ever had faith in me or believed in me. No matter how much I try, no matter how much effort I put in to fix these problems I can't. It feels like there is nothing for me here. I was an accidental pregnancy and I know I wasn't supposed to be born in the first place. No one would cry for me if I died. I don't mind it, I'm not worth the tears anyway. I want to die so badly that it's all I can think about. I wasn't meant to live this long. People will forget me, it feels like they already have. I'm a waste and I have dragged the people I love down too much it's better for them if I do this. I'll give myself a few more days to get all my affairs in order so no one has to worry about anything when I'm gone.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ntcepp/getting_dangerous/", "title": "Getting dangerous", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "imathrowaway554", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622949712, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ntcepp/getting_dangerous/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425536.3150666, "replies_charged": false}
