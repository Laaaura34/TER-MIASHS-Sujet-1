I\u2019m done with the doctor appointments, I\u2019m done with the medicine, I\u2019m done with pretending I\u2019m fine. To everyone who tried to help me through this please don\u2019t blame this on you. My final requests are that you don\u2019t mourn over me or think that my death was preventable. It wasn\u2019t. My second and final request is that you cremate me and scatter my ashes in Banff National Park.
