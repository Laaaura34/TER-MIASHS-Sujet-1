Every day, I wake up and wish I died in my sleep - most days, I can ignore that thought and get on with my day. \n\nBut, there are certain triggers which switch the desire from passive to active - such as financial struggles.\n\nI woke up to find out I got slapped with a 700euro bill today out of nowhere, because of some mishap at the administration of my university. I have no choice but to pay it. In trying to find some sort of support for financial struggle-induced suicidal ideation, all you get is articles about how to find the best kind of therapy, meditation practices, and shit like that.\n\nNobody wants to acknowledge the root of the problem - I would not want to down a bottle of pills in my bathroom if this would not have happened in the first place. Nobody wants to talk about the shaky ground everyone is standing on, which could collapse any moment. Nobody wants to talk about debt as a major contributor to severe mental illnesses and substance abuse disorders.\n\nBecause if we do address that, how are they gonna strip us for all of our worth?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mcvb65/discussion_about_suicidal_ideation_and_debt/", "title": "Discussion about suicidal ideation and debt", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Senior_Octopus", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616668911, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mcvb65/discussion_about_suicidal_ideation_and_debt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427270.025869, "replies_charged": false}
