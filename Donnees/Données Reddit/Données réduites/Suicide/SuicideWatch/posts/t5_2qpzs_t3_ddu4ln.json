I am, or I used to be depressed. About 4 years ago I started to feel fucking awful all the time. All my hobbies gradually became torture and everything I used to enjoy became harder and harder. It became worse and worse and eventually I began to consider suicide. I started to look into the meaning of life and all that and that lead me to where I am today. I don't know if I'm still depressed. I've gotten so used to the feeling of empty loneliness that I can't remember what came before. I'm so okay with it. So the pain ended, but the suicidal thoughts didn't. I started to look at suicide from a logical perspective. I've really thought about it, and currently I'm set on killing myself when I turn 24 (mother couldn't take it now, I'm 16). I looked at the pros of my best possible life, where I achieved all my desires, had all the money, was famous, and compared it to my issues with life. The reason I want to die, regardless of any changes in my life, is that I don't care. I don't give a single fuck about money, fame, success or really anything else. It's not that life is pain or something, it's that I have absolutely no reason to be alive. I'm posting here because I want you to convince me to change my mind.
