Also I should probably say that I'm still in highschool , and I just don't have any friends that legitimately want to be around me, because even when I invite people I get some obvious excuse to why they can't come over and whatnot, I spend my nights and weekends alone. Even my parents feel sorry for me. I do practically nothing productive besides shcool. I sit behind a computer all day eat and sleep my nights away. I cry myself to sleep at night on occasion.  Anyways enough of my venting and whining. I just kinda want someone to talk to.
