My anxiety is more overwhelming, and i can\u2019t stop myself from having a depressive episode on almost a daily basis. Suicidal ideation used to be all hypothetical to me. But joking about suicide pacts with friends has turned into browsing for handguns online at work. I can\u2019t tell you how painful it is to hear one customer after another ask \u201chow are you?\u201d And I, like a robot, tell them I\u2019m \u201cfine.\u201d Sometimes I say I\u2019m \u201cgood!\u201d Enthusiastically to appear more normal. But nobody knows what lies below the surface.\n\n\nMy friends are clearly tired of hearing about my issues. When things get bad I tend to send a flurry of emotionally charged messages, and it\u2019s exhausting. I don\u2019t blame them, it sucks living like this, and it\u2019s a downer to hear about. \n\nThe worse everything gets, the more I feel like it\u2019s not even worth trying to get better. I jerk off because I\u2019m lonely, then I feel ashamed and depressed after. I get no enjoyment out of my hobbies anymore. I hate my job, and my career prospects are shit. I\u2019m too insecure to pursue the women I like, so they end up with other men and then I hate myself more and validate those insecurities in my fucked up head. \n\nI know I\u2019ll never be happy, because I know trying to get better is a painful process, and not guaranteed to even work. \n\nWhat hope is there? \n\nHope is the most addictive drug. I fucking hate it. And I hate myself too.
