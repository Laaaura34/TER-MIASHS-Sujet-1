After 3-4 minutes a man picked up, said \u201cHey this is ______, could I get your name please.\u201d\nI gave him my name and explained how I was feeling; sad, alone, over it, done, etc... \n\u201cUhhhhhhhh can you be more specific? I\u2019m sorry\u2014 I just don\u2019t really understand why you\u2019re calling...\u201d\nWell man, I\u2019m calling because I feel like I no longer have real emotions and really needed someone to talk to because I\u2019m going to kill myself because I don\u2019t want to be alive anymore.\n\u201cWell - uhhhhh - I just uhh - maybe.....hmmm, this is a crisis hotline so....?\u201d\nAh, I feel as though I\u2019m in a crisis but well shit man ok I\u2019m sorry for calling then?\n\u201cOh well uhhhh, hey don\u2019t be sorry but you have a good uh rest of your uhhhh day alright?\u201d\nYeah man you too ______.\n\nGot off the call and was genuinely confused. Either it was ______\u2019s first day on the job (god bless him) or due to Covid and country wide self isolation they\u2019re just totally overwhelmed.  \n\nI\u2019ve felt this way for years, for way too long, I just simply do not want to exist anymore. I have friends, some family, a wonderful and beautiful girlfriend, a job, but none of those things negate how I feel.  I don\u2019t want to be around anymore.\n\nIn a weird way the call made me feel a little better.  Thinking about the fact that there\u2019s some guy in a call center having people on the verge of ending their own lives calling him for help and support (their last option) and he has literally nothing to say except for some nervous \u201cUhhhhhhh\u201d\u2019s. I don\u2019t know, something about the image of a guy Rodney Dangerfield style, nervously pulling at his collar, sweat on his brow, unable to offer any kind of real support...it was weirdly comforting.\n\nI still genuinely do not wish to exist on this earth or in any capacity. I had a rough childhood and have spent the last 13 years of my adult life drinking and doing drugs to the point of incoherence to try and cover up the dark cloud in my brain. I am a polite person, very sweet to people, I have love deep in my heart  somewhere - but I want to be alone and quiet forever.  \n\nNot sure if anyone else has dealt with something similar to this.\n\nCheers to you ______.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mjc0o1/suicide_prevention_hotline/", "title": "Suicide Prevention Hotline", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "vijbwiv", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617467824, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mjc0o1/suicide_prevention_hotline/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427847.349357, "replies_charged": false}
