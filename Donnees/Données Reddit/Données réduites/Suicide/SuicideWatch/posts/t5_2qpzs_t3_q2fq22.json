Then, I can't find anything to overdose at home. I cant even find razors. Then I tried some self harm but knives are bad at cutting and only good at puncturing. They weren't sharp. I just have small wounds now. I haven't slept for 2 days; and had middle insomnia for 2 weeks now. I can only sleep 4 hours a day at best and spend 20 hours in agony. I haven't ate for 2 days. I tried OD-ing Sodium Diclofenac (all i could find) on Monday but it did nothing but make me vomit and vomit some faint marks of blood, headaches, and terrible stomachaches. I work nights shifts. I can't sleep or have peace. I will go to pharmacy and get some heart medicine and high pressure pills using my mom's prescription. I tried the same medicine years ago before but the doze wasn't fatal. I woke in hospital. This time, I will chug down the whole 30 pills.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q2fq22/i_wont_be_seeing_the_weekend_tomorrow_is_the_day/", "title": "I won't be seeing the weekend.
