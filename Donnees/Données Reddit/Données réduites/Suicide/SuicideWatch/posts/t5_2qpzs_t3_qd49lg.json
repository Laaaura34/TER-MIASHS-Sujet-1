You would think everything would workout  but it never really does.\n\nGrowing up as the kid that was most adored in a massive family and the cool kid that was best at a sport, girls are always attracted but I'm always to hesitant cuz I'm too depressed to even approach them. U would think life should be fun in that position but it was never really all that. I was always feeling fucking down for no reason And i was depressed 99% of the time. It triggered even worse when my parents divorced  and which till to this day has a very strong effect. I shut out everything I had even quit the sport which could have taken me to the pros and fucked up all grades and I couldn't talk to anybody bout it. All I though was killing myself but I can not get myself to do it.\n\nI got lucky to study abroad for many years studying something that is highly recognized but even then I dropped out due to my depression. I cannot get myself to see a therapist for Watever reason. Got in amazing shape didn't work. I did all the partying, drinking, sex, drugs but nothing worked. Relationships didn't help, partners cannot get me to snap out of it,\nLoving family can not do anything bout it even though I don't talk or show it around them. Toxic relationship till now is making myself very suicidal but I feel like I'm stuck each day .Is there something fucked up in my brain that can never be changed ?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qd49lg/depression_doesnt_stop/", "title": "Depression doesn't stop", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "abupatata", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634859199, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qd49lg/depression_doesnt_stop/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422898.8738177, "replies_charged": false}
