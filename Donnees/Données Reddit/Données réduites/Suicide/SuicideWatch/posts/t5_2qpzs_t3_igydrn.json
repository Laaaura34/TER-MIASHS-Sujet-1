I've been inside psych wards been evaluated by a team of professionals. All I've been diagnosed with was PTSD and severe depression.    At first I legitimately thought I was going crazy. The stalking is being done  in such a way that it's more of a nuisance than anything illegal. Unfortunately it's a few police officers who are part taking in the activities.  \n\nI have friends who no longer talk to me because of rumors they heard. That I was out to steal their partners or hurt their children. Then rumors that I was hard into drugs, and taking crystal meth. That's not true. I get followed in stores I go into by the same people. My laptop was hacked into they set up a remote shared desktop where they were able to see my emails, any changes to passwords I made, they would make changes to emails I sent out. \n\nOne day I made a comment that I stated that I found a member of my police department good looking and that he caught my interest. Unfortunately the police station  found out, as I was out catching the bus, they drove around the block laughing at me. Since that day they take turns stalking and tormenting me. \n\nI don't want to live this way. Coworker of mine who committed suicide in April told me that I was being set up for something. Why, what did I do?\n\nI'm decided after being bullied for a year that I'm going to join her. I'm done, this isn't a life I want to live. I don't know how to make it all stop.\u00a0\n\nMy mental health become a game. I decided to quit the game.\u00a0\n\nI don't want to die, but I don't what else to do.\u00a0I'm losing the battle.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/igydrn/the_stalking_and_bullying_got_to_be_too_much/", "title": "The stalking and bullying got to be too much", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Various_Arachnid_887", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1598446866, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/igydrn/the_stalking_and_bullying_got_to_be_too_much/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426222.4189317, "replies_charged": false}
