I feel like i need something i can't get. I need change. Too many things have been the same for too long. What is the point of doing something over and over again? This feeling is not fun. Once i thought killing myself was the best way out of it. Being bored isn't having nothing to do, its doing the same thing over and over again until you go insane. And im leaning to the insane part. Im saying this stuff all over the place but i really cant explain it that good. I know suicide isnt good but i cant think of anything.
