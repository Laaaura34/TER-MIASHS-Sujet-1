However, I'm halfway done with college, and won a sweepstake for a year of free gym membership...last year. December will be the end of that membership but so far I've only gone 3 times in the last 12 months due to my depression. I just can't find the motivation to go.\n\nI just don't see myself being any useful with my college degree. I literally haven't learned anything useful. My parents live in poverty. I'm constantly depressed, suicidal, and envious of my old high school peers, who have now graduated from great universities and secured high paying jobs. Here I am without even an internship. I just don't want to live anymore.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pfl476/anyone_here_thats_a_failure_but_as_some/", "title": "Anyone here that's a failure, but as some opportunities to turn life around, but can't seem to do it?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "emilybrownies", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630465289, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pfl476/anyone_here_thats_a_failure_but_as_some/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426931.5977788, "replies_charged": false}
