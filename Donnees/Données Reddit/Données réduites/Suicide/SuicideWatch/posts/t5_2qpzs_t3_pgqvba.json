I have try to meditate, self-compassion, being gratefull for what I have therapy meds, and I feel sometimes  I can get out of my darkness easily, but I also can get pretty quick to a very very low. Sometimes I have hours, days or even weeks that I love live (eventhow often there are small backthoughts about the fact that it would be better not no live) but then the darkness comes in again taking all space and I just want live to stop and I start to think how to do it (I have two ways I find quite possible). And I feel very guilty about people that I know that would suffer (specially my children), and I am fed ut. And I wish I could give all the good things I have in my live to someone to hom it would make happy and just be so miserable that I could feel that I have a good reason to kill myself and do it", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pgqvba/i_wish_i_could_give_all_good_things_that_i_have/", "title": "I wish I could give all good things that I have in live to someone that could appreciate and enjoy it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "eba5", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630617059, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pgqvba/i_wish_i_could_give_all_good_things_that_i_have/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423016.3993847, "replies_charged": false}
