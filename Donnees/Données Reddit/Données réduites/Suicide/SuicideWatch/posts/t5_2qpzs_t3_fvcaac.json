I just had therapy and it made me better and worse in their own ways. I just couldn't take it anymore. I couldn't even hold a knife because I have the urge to stab someone or myself. I can't even trust myself.\nI wrapped a power cord around my neck once and was too tired to do it. But I felt better that I could take a step closer to kill myself. Perhaps I should try again since I know how it works.\nI just couldn't fight the urge and I'm afraid I'm losing the battle.\nI lost my girlfriend and I lost sense of myself. I tried exercising, art and none of those work. I'm treated badly at work. I don't have much success. I don't see a future with a SO since no girls would want a guy with serious mental illness, at least I experienced once myself, got dumped and left alone to rot. On top of that, I wouldn't date myself either.\nI'm just a piece of shit.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fvcaac/it_hurts_my_head_very_much_and_im_self_destructing/", "title": "It hurts my head very much and I'm self destructing", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "phonegetshotalldtime", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1586085543, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fvcaac/it_hurts_my_head_very_much_and_im_self_destructing/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422550.4642262, "replies_charged": false}
