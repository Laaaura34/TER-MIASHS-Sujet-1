I\u2019m 22, accepted I will disappoint everyone. I\u2019ve a lifelong melancholy and now the idea of overdosing on propranolol doesn\u2019t make me feel emotional or feel anything. I\u2019m a failure to myself and to others. Always hollowed myself out and became indifferent to emotions but now it just hit me like a truck. Can\u2019t see my girlfriend right now because of LDR. She\u2019s so much smarter and successful than me I feel grossly inadequate. Love her with all my heart. I have no more parents and my remaining grandparents refuse to see me as I changed last name (don\u2019t want to be associated with a murderer in the family)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ldu91l/thoughts/", "title": "Thoughts", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Hefty_Orange", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612605464, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ldu91l/thoughts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427517.2182746, "replies_charged": false}
