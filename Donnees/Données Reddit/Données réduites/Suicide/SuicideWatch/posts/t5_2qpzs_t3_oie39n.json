I am going to prepare everything. Set 999 as my speed dial. Do the last things that make me happy. Cut deeper then I ever have. Mark all of my body but my right arm. My face, legs, torso, arm. Everything. I will be prepared, almost like a sacrifice. And, in 4 hours or less, die.\n.\n.\n.\nMy name is Adam. I am 13 years old and have faced most things that this torture has. My whole life is a lie, and I tried opening up last week. I was immediately betrayed. I think one of my closest friends has killed themselves earlier tonight. I envy them. I would like to disappear so nobody has a reason to get pity points, because fuck them. 5 years ago my brother raped me twice. My brother also assaulted me and my sister 8 months ago with a knife. I don't want to continue. I don't know why others live. Goodnight and goodbye.
