Keeping up appearances and wasting time.  \n\n\nI go to classes and occasionally meet up with friends. I do it, because that's what people do. I tell myself I'm going to try and get an internship at some point, because that's what people around me do, but of course I know I won't and I know exactly why, because I don't care.\n\n\nEven the ways in which I waste time has degenerated. I used to mostly play video games. Then I switched to mostly watching series and movies. Now most of my day is spent on reddit or watching youtube videos. If I get myself to watch a movie, that's a good day. Last time I did that was more than two months ago. I think that's because I'm not just wasting time, but killing time until I can go back to bed and the more pre-chewed the things are I'm starring at, the less I have to be involved myself to get through the day.\n\n\nI tried some of the generic self-improvement advice like doing some sport and went running in the morning twice a week for a while. I stopped. It just made me feel like shit afterwards with no redeeming qualities. When I hear advice like \"get a hobby!\" my first thought is just \"how? I don't care about any of these things\". \n\n\nAll in all life does not seem very appealing. Sometimes this general melancholy shifts into a more intense feeling of sadness, I start crying and genuine suicidal desires come over me. Usually I feel a lot better after crying, but the desires do scare me.  \n\n\nRecently I've been thinking that my fright over those desires may be misplaced and I began considering what the best way to end it would be.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/9kf6qz/anybody_else_dont_have_particular_problems/", "title": "Anybody else don't have particular problems plaguing them, but rather lack desire to do anything?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "whatamIevendoingfuck", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 82, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1538390010, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/9kf6qz/anybody_else_dont_have_particular_problems/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427550.0999563, "replies_charged": false}
