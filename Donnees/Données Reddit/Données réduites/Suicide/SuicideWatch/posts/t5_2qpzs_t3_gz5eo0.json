I was about to commit suicide via strangulation or something, it didn't work, cuz i tried doing it with my hands,  I'm pretty dumb. I've tried suicide before, by cutting my wrists but the cuts were too shallow cuz i tried doing it with glass. Im a dumb f\\*cc, I tried cutting myself again, although i knew it wouldn't kill me, I've been doing it for a while, since I was 11 or 12 maybe. Im 13 now btw : ) . I'm an idiot, i spend all my time distracting myself from myself, I bet that'll sound real cringy to me in a few years, although right now i really feel....terrible. It's kinda sad, i've tried suicide a few other ways before, although i knew it won't really work, i used to be scared of dying, and i'd cry thinking of my family and what they'd do after I die, but when I do die, I wont feel anything, right?. I hope whenever I die, it's by drowning :). I'm a pretty big  dumf\\*cc, I keep changing in the blink of an eye, sometimes I'm fine and sometimes I'm having a mental breakdown. I can't remember the last time I as happy, i feel like it was probably with my sister, but i don't get too see her now, shes in Canada, I'm worried for her. I want I could change, I remember when my sister first found out about my habits of self harm, she cried. It hurt seeing her like that so I wanting to stop harming myself, so she wouldn't feel so hurt, because of my hurt. I know she cares about me. She cried, she loved me despite me being the mess I am, and i loved her despite that time she punched one of my teeth out when I as seven, and all those other times she was a b\\*tch. It was strange in a way, or maybe not, that she loved me, despite the meaninglessness of life, despite the fact that in a few more years our existence will be nothing more than something that no longer exists. It's in our nature too seek meaning in our lives, no matter how trivial, to find something to keep on living for, against our better judgement, or maybe not, how the f\\*ck should I know, im an idiot, don't believe everything you read, stinker, i might be 30 (no i swear im 13). Even though life is meaningless, its hard not to care about things right? I'm such a stubborn brat that I think even if life took everything away from me, I would live just to spite it, maybe right now i'm living to spite myself. I like Albert Camus, that absurdist guy, dont y im bringing him up. Im dumb as F\\*cc and I hate myself cuz of it, i don't want to die but i feel like i should really kick the bucket already. I dont harm myself because I want to die, but because I feel like I deserve punishment for what an idiot I am. As the years go by I just keep getting worse, I'm a self fulfilling prophecy, I hate myself because i hurt people, by hurting myself which causes them to hurt. I really want to stop, but its hard, especially in my circumstances, I know whats wrong with me but I dont know how to change, its not like i can get a therapist my parents dont really like them cuz of how they grew up, just like how my mom claims to not being racist,despite carrying racist stereoypes, smh, good thing i pointed that out but my mom's just as stubborn as me. It's kinda dumm af that my mom carries stereotypes like that despite us belonging to  a racial minority as well. My parents try their best though, but i feel like after my older sister, they kinda gave up on me cuz of how old they are and circumstances, like how I couldn't go to school for a year cuz of a disease i had, and money issues. My parents had relationship problems too, but they couldn't divorce, because it's taboo here i'm from and I and my sister exist, their better now but those times were rough, i was going through i phase and my mom strangled me once, its good i dont bring that up now, their wayy better now though, but sometimes it gets really bad becase they both succ at communication. I'm pretty sure they love my sister more than me, but so do i, shes really an angel. I want to be an artist and make money so that my sister and parents can live well, I've already started my manuscripts for a comic I'm making, so unfortunately I cant die yet, but if the manuscript and all thats a bust  i'm definitely drowning, anyways if I can get my family living comfortably, than i'll die immediately, hopefully around age 25. I feel alone, art, and my family are the only things that are stopping me right no from slitting my throat with the broken glass over there, and they'd be fine if I were gone right, I mean hey don't really need me, my sister could probably earn a lot as an economist, they'd probably be fine, but funeral costs are expensive... I'm just making up excuses now. In fifth grade, I was the new kid, I mean I always was cuz of my dads job, we always had to move around a lot and i kinda gave up on everything after 4th grade. 3rdgrade was probably when I peaked, 4th grade was when i met a girl, who confessed to me on my last day of school, she was my best friend, and that was the day i thought fucc i might be bi. Anyays 5th grade was when I went to  a counceller, cuz she noticed how awkward and reserved and dumb I was and she was really nice and helped a lot, but after a while she left, and I was back to my self conscious awkward af self, I miss her, she always listened and understood, I think she was the only one who did that, but than she moved somewhere else, i cried that day, i miss her. I remember in 6th grade we had a really nice teacher and she knew about me, she helped me in little ways....i wanted to make her proud so I got all As in her class :), but than 7th grade came around, people kept saying I looked sad all the time, more than usual (shit i never brought that up huh) anyways its getting late. guess I live another day huh, i wonder if anyone actually read this.. hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm anyways It would be cool to talk to you, cuz you read thru all this, and im curious who would torture themselves with that", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gz5eo0/i_should_get_some_sleep_or_something_this_is_way/", "title": "I should get some sleep or something.....
