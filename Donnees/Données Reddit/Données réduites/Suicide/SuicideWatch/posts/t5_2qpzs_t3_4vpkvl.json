I've never been able to talk to anyone about this. I don't want to hurt myself, but every time things start going wrong in my life there's a part of my brain that pretty much says \"wouldn't this all be easier if you were dead?\". \n\nSometimes it's worse and hurting myself is almost all I can think about. I've never tried anything, but I'm afraid of losing control one day (one of the main reasons I refuse to own a fire arm). \n\nThat's it. I just needed to tell somebody, even if it's just Reddit. I'm hoping it helps, at least for tonight.
