The injection is in front of me. Its just 5 minutes of pain, probably in the worst case. After that I am gone.\n\nIts been been 5 years since since I talked something meaningful with anyone, I don't wanna live, I am a schizophrenic, happened to be doing a CS major in a good institute. I don't like my major, my family pushed me into it, nobody wants to talk to me, not even my family, because mental illness is a joke/taboo, whatever, I just keep on buying my prescriptions and keep living myself, alone in the dark, barely eating, I want all this to end.
