The last time I said that when I was having a bad meltdown I was told it\u2019s never okay to say that unless you\u2019re 100% going to commit suicide and need help. The person who told me that stopped being my friend because of this. I did need help though. I still need help. The only reason I don\u2019t do it is because I will not break my mom\u2019s heart. If mom wasn\u2019t here, I\u2019d kill myself in a second. Nobody else cares about me besides some family, I don\u2019t really have any friends, all the friends I make I end up losing because I am not a good person. I am a miserable person and nobody wants that. As evident by my previous interaction, where I was told it\u2019s never okay to say you wish you were dead, I can\u2019t talk to anybody about this. I do see a therapist but my next appointment isn\u2019t for awhile, and I wish I could talk to a real person who isn\u2019t being paid to give a shit about my problems. I wish I could tell someone, \u201cI wish I was dead\u201d and for them to say that they\u2019re glad that I\u2019m here. But that will never happen.\n\nI just really want to be dead.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pxnmjd/i_wish_i_was_dead/", "title": "I wish I was dead.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "diagoat", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632888847, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pxnmjd/i_wish_i_was_dead/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425439.3882942, "replies_charged": false}
