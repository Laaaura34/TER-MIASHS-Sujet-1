My routine is the same as any normal person, except I can only think about killing myself. I work while thinking about methods, I go to sleep while thinking of how people would react, I prepare my food while I'm setting up dates for me to die, I take a shower and think of a proper suicide letter. I can live, but I don't want to live. I feel completely alien to society.\n\nEdit: Today (27/09) I went to a psychologist, told her about these feelings, and I will be working on them.
