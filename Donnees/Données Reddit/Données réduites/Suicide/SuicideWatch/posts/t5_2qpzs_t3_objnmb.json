This account is new due to me making it specifically for this purpose as it makes me feel more comfortable. I would like to put a trigger warning for descriptions of violence (not much), eating disorders/disordered eating, self harm, abuse, and more. Please proceed with caution.\n\nSome background information about me to start. I'm very young- junior high young in fact. I'm part of a family of four. When it comes to our financial situation, we're not in poverty, but not comfortable,  and my brother is moving out and going to college this year. Im part of several minorities, which have definitely affected my view of myself. A combination of factors, including my history, my father, future circumstances and life itself makes me think that a suicide attempt, or at least something as severe as that such as a mental breakdown is inevitable.\n\nMy family and its history is very confusing and honestly I don't know what to think. My father physically abused my mom for years, likely more than a decade. I don't know the exact timeframe, but it probably ended around 5 years ago? It got to the point where my mom called the police, which led to my dad being arrested and having to get bailed out of jail (allegedly, this is what he said. I did not ask him, this is what my mom said when I asked her.) He only stopped because she threatened to call the police again if he continued to do it. She considered divorcing him, but the realities of being a single mom with no income in country with no citizenship, (they're both immigrants from Korea,) was too much for my mom to consider feasible.\n\nWhile he no longer physically hurts anyone in the family, and does not lash out as much, he will yell at us for the most trivial reasons, shouting even in the presence of others. He points out everyone elses flaws relentlessly yet cant accept this own. Hes kind of controlling, and stresses us constantly. When something does happen that's really large, he will have a full meltdown. I've decided not to speak as much so that my words cant be twisted against me. \n\n Now this may sound really strange- and the truth is that this situation alone is enough for a whole post and I cant really talk about in this one alone. I might write a separate post one day. But I do kind of believe that he does love us at his core- he has shown empathy and does give us gifts and treats us well when hes not shouting and always has our backs. This switch in behavior makes me conflicted. \n\nMy Asian family is also fully within the stereotypes. Everyone went to ivy or prestigious schools. I study 6-ish hours a day outside school but I know soon, very soon it will go up to 10+. I'm expected to soon take nearly all aps and perfect grades, get into ivy, etc you know the drill. I am fully aware that things will soon basically be a living hell, staying up till 4 to study daily.\n\nOnto mental health. I have struggled with a multitude of issues regarding mental health, however none of them were diagnosed. We'll start with a kind of eating disorder, but I prefer to call it disordered eating as it was not diagnosed. It centered around restriction and thinking that I was too large- and in the later stages the want for control over my own body and will was overwhelming. My disordered eating began when I was extremely young, 10 to be specific. It lasted until I was nearly 12, and during that time I was constantly struggling to classify it as serious because I was not diagnosed. I tried to reach out multiple times yet each time was rejected due to it not being serious or worrisome because my bmi was not underweight- despite eating 700 calories or less daily. \n\nMy final attempt was the worst, as I was encouraged to exercise because \"lack of energy and dopamine is the cause to this problem.\" Jokes about starvation were made by others.\n\nI've also struggled with self harm, cutting myself with razor blades, snipping my skin with scissors like they were paper.  Not even sliding, snipping so the cuts went deep. It started slow- with non bleeding cuts, but once I found an easier way, razor blades, it was all over. It felt good, made me feel satisfied, was a way to quell boredom and some sort of self punishment. It got to the point where if I was bored, I would just default cut to do something with time. It may have also stemmed from desire to do something that clearly- obviously- was an issue. People could undermine your food habits, but they cant ignore blood on your wrist. This was contrasted by the way that I hid it, but oh well.\n\nOnce i told my mom, it was taken seriously. Part of me wonders if it was because of self reflection, or if it was just too obvious to deny. It was an upward battle, but I've been clean for a month. I'm currently in Korea with relatives, with no blades nor bandages, so perhaps put that number up to two in the future. Still think a relapse is inevitable.\n\nLastly, what this whole thing was about. I dont know what to call it? Depression? Suicidal ideation? Self loathing/punishment? This is where everything combines to create a kind of sad picture. I feel sad, unsure of my purpose, angry with myself, my dad is yelling daily, soon my brother will be gone as a buffer so its just me, I have unmonitored internet access, and the future looks bleak. I haven't been consistently feeling bad, more of just hour long periods daily just thinking about things.\n\n Often I think of self harm, wishing I had a razor and a goddamn private room. Very rarely I think of, probably the most concerning thing I've mentioned so far but sometimes I almost fantasize about causing harm to myself. Not just cutting, but purposely putting myself through pain. Doing a suicide attempt, but not for the death part. Just for the suffering. Dunking myself in ice cold water to feel the burn. I think of what I could do if my body would regenerate. There are too many things I've refrained from doing because it would be permanent and I do have some hope.\n\n Sometimes I think of someone else hurting me, just stabbing me because I deserve it. Yelling at me because its justified. Lastly, sometimes I think, not seriously, but of suicide. More often, suicide ideation. Jumping off a bridge or a cliff, feeling the wind. The relief of being able to say anything I want to say with no consequences because hey ill be dead. The kind of joke that \"all your problems would cease to exist if you died because.. well... you would cease to exist!\" \n\nBut the thing is that this does not happen most of the time. This is why I say this is inventible in the future. Not presently, but before I turn 17. This where the studying stuff comes into play. Right now I have too much hope of the future, too many moments of happiness and too much to cling to. These sessions of thoughts are too rare for me to think its worth losing it all with hours of happiness daily. But I think when I am in high school, with no time for anything, getting yelled at even more, somehow more hormonal, probably in a state where I would consider such things even without the circumstances, that Ill do something. \n\nIts not even about the studying itself really. But its the combination of that, with my father controlling everything Ill do in my academic life. Its all the other factors too. Its because Ive seen what happened to my brother at that age, and I still don't know how he trooped through it with hours of screaming and curses daily. \n\nI feel as though that an attempt, if not a little half hearted, is bound to happen. If not some type of mental breakdown where I just scream and give in to those self harming thoughts. I feel scared of the future, fleeting through hope and resilience and despair. May sound dramatic.. but yeah. And even after all of that studying, I still don't know what the point of it all is. I feel like I want to do something exciting in the future, but I feel held back. I feel like a disappointed optimist. I honestly dont know how to end this, but this was probably a long read, and I thank you for getting through everything. I didn't reread, so if there are errors or things that warrant clarification or expansion feel free to let me know.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/objnmb/feeling_like_an_attempt_is_inevitable_in_the/", "title": "Feeling like an attempt is inevitable in the future", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lavlio", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625138252, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/objnmb/feeling_like_an_attempt_is_inevitable_in_the/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427043.0342069, "replies_charged": false}
