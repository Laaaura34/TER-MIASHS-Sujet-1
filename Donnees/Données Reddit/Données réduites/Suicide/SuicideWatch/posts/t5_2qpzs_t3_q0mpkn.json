Im really ugly, my face is saggy and full of marks even though Im 17, I have so many hormonal issues that make my life a living hell, my parents have money and I feel like a waste whenever they spend it on me it physically pains me seeing they try to help me because I never get better.\n\n\n\nYesterday I cried while doing exercise. I just cried for 5 hours. Because Im so tired Im exhausted. What even am I trying to achieve? There's literally 6 girls in my class who are professional models, like agency hired and all. They're also very smart and are going to study in elite schools I wouldn't even be allowed to step foot on\n\n\n\n\nAnd you know whats the worse part? Sometimes for some god awful reason I think Im like them, I think I can achieve that too so I work and I try and when I finally look in the mirror it hits me and my delusion come to an end. Its happening less and less though I think Im all out of dreams to be let down.\n\n\n\nMy mom says I should lower my expectations, but I just can't live with how I am. There needs to be a way I can fix myself because if I gave up on trying to be pretty or smart I wouldn't have anything whatsoever.\n\n\nI wish I could blow my face with a gun so they would have to get a closed casket for my funeral.\nI think Im finally worn out.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q0mpkn/im_tired_of_wanting_more/", "title": "Im tired of wanting more", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "toastonaskateboard", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633282975, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q0mpkn/im_tired_of_wanting_more/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426387.343505, "replies_charged": false}
