Why is it when it comes to problems of anyone else around me I am able to help them and show some compassion to understand them but when it comes to my feelings  the only thing I feel is judgement frowning upon me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pjw7xr/i_dont_think_i_have_the_will_left_to_take_it/", "title": "I don't think I have the will left to take it anymore....", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MisterDweller", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631049524, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pjw7xr/i_dont_think_i_have_the_will_left_to_take_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423009.0361707, "replies_charged": false}
