It was a tough winter. But since March till now (June) I\u2019ve been working hard on my body. Eating right, exercising, lifting etc. I\u2019ve lost 20 pounds I was so happy proud of myself. My self confidence went up. But recently I realized I gained 10 pounds. As soon as I saw the number I instantly hit the ground and wanted to hurt myself so badly for being a failure this bad. I don\u2019t want to hear maybe it\u2019s water weight, or your diet is wrong. Cause it\u2019s been working for 3 months and now all of a sudden I\u2019m gaining weight. It\u2019s upsetting. I have atypical anorexia so this was a deviating blow for me. I\u2019m still in my bathroom on the ground crying my eyes out, coming down from a panic attack. I lock myself in the bathroom so I don\u2019t grab anything or just start hurting myself. This is upsetting.  Nothing will make me feel better, and I give up on my weight loss journey. It\u2019s useless.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ofokvd/weight_loss_journey_causing_suicidal_thoughts/", "title": "Weight loss journey causing suicidal thoughts.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "One_Yogurt_1984", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625681482, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ofokvd/weight_loss_journey_causing_suicidal_thoughts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422262.4059064, "replies_charged": false}
