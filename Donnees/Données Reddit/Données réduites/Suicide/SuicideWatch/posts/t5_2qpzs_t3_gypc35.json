I don\u2019t have anyone to talk to about this shit, and believe me it\u2019s absolute shit. The idea of dying has moved past me thinking about possibly surviving and the repercussions like the fact that i could be even more fucked up then I already am. I\u2019m so sad and angry, I just want to escape. Escape myself and the shit life I\u2019m going to live and am fucking living. If I was dead; no more fucking abuse, no more depression, no more worrying about the future, no more anything just silence and darkness I think. I hope. Idk if any of this even makes sense, but i\u2019m too much of an indecisive fucking coward to do anything more than self harm.
