SO asked me if I had a plan, and I admitted that I could see getting into the pain pills, anxiety meds, and antidepressants and washing them down with that bottle of brandy I'd been using for recipes.  \n\nSo next thing I know the pills and alcohol are all being bagged up and hidden from me.  I'm being talked to like I'm a fucking baby.  And I feel no relief whatsoever, just more pathetic than before.  \n\nEDIT:  Thank you Reddit, this commiseration is just what I've needed.  I can no longer claim to be 'the only one in the world who feels this way' and that helps me so much.\n\n  ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3umqzv/my_so_hid_all_the_pills_and_alcohol_today_im/", "title": "My SO hid all the pills and alcohol today.
