I waited over 1 hour on the Crisis Text Line and never was able to talk to someone so I just gave up.\n\nI tried calling the Suicide Hotline tonight and waited for 15 minutes. Over the course of those 15 minutes the quality of the call got worse and worse (pre-recorded lines got more muffled to the point where I couldn't understand anything). And when I finally was clearly talking to a human, the call was so muffled and distorted I couldn't understand a thing the person was saying and I eventually got hung up on.\n\nHas this happened to anyone else? I don't have any other resources to turn to. I want real therapy but I'm still on my parents' insurance and they don't \"believe in therapy\" and think I'm just being over-dramatic about everything despite the fact I've attempted twice. If anyone else is reading this and also struggling with suicide I'm clearly in the same boat and I hope you're doing well", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/l38vf7/both_suicide_hotline_and_crisis_text_overloaded/", "title": "Both Suicide Hotline and Crisis Text Overloaded?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SignificantBall1592", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1611392855, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/l38vf7/both_suicide_hotline_and_crisis_text_overloaded/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426146.8841748, "replies_charged": false}
