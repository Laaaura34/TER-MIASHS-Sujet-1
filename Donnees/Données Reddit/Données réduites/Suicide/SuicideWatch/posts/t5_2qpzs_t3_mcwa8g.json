It's not like I don't want, I simply can't. It's not a permanent thought, but unfortunately we speak as often as we breath, and every time I speak I can't stand it. I feel like I'm not gonna make it. It's just... so hard, and there are so many people who don't understand why am I so upset about it. I don't blame them, it's often impossible to understand another person until you're in his shoes, but, ugh, it just makes me feel that I'm pathetic and too fixated on my disease. But I freaking can't stop fixate on my stutter, I experiencing it every single day, and it's so, so exhausting.\n\nThings are not too bad, especially now with the coronavirus lockdown when I study from home, but I can't stop thinking about my future life, job, raising children, etc. I'm extremely scared and exhausted, it's become more and more difficult for me to hande all the life situations or just go out of my home.
