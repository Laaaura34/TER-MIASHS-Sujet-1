When I was 10 I decided to look up what the best medical schools in the country were. This was the worst idea I ever had. Upon seeing ivy leagues, I told everyone that that was where I wanted to go to college. I was also labeled gifted at the time so I thought I was smart enough. Then I went through depression and severe social anxiety and gifted kid burnout and become progressively less smart and able to function as the year went on but the idea that I could still go to an Ivy League or top school and this weird superiority complex was still there bc it had been engrained in my sense of identity. Now I\u2019m about to submit 5 application tomorrow and I am have a crisis bc I am very much aware that I won\u2019t get into any top schools bc I\u2019m stupid and a terrible writer and have terrible social anxiety and I hate myself for it. I failed my younger self and so in essence I am a failure. My state school isn\u2019t bade but going there will cause more issues bc I know everyone there. At this point idk if I\u2019ll make it to 18 bc this feeling of failure is so strong that I feel like it\u2019ll pull me over at any minute", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q8b3w4/in_my_eyes_ive_failed/", "title": "In my eyes I\u2019ve failed", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "KaiWillson", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634253172, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q8b3w4/in_my_eyes_ive_failed/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423141.5450416, "replies_charged": false}
