who fucking cares?\n\nim probably only trans because my dad died when i was 5 and now i have daddy issues. my two older sisters are both living shitty lives. my eldest sister is 22 and still lives at home playing video games in her room all day. she has no friends. the second oldest is 19 and lives with her boyfriend in a shitty relationship shes not happy with, but they both smoke pot and vape and whatever so they dont have to care. i hate knowing we\u2019ve changed so much. we\u2019re not kids anymore and i wish we were just so i didnt have to worry about getting spat out of mandatory education as a directionless burnout who would rather die than disappoint or inconvenience anyone ever again. i dont want to end up like either of my older sisters\n\nbut i have a little sister as well. shes 11 years younger than me. i was almost just like her when i was her age. an annoying tech-obsessed brat with violent outbursts. i cant stand being around her. no one in the house knows how to deal with her and i know from experience its going to fuck her up forever. the thought of ruining her life fucking hurts more than anything. but just like everything else, i dont know how to stop it and i cant be bothered to change that.\n\ntl;dr at school, im an inconsolable douchebag who assumes the worst in everyone and makes a point to never engage in school even though i constantly get help for that. at home i\u2019m a lazy asshole who distracts myself with video games, discord and youtube all day and rages at my little sister for being just like me as a kid. im all too aware how shitty my habits are, but i\u2019m too lazy to improve, too lazy to learn, too lazy to live.\n\nthe only upside is that im too lazy to kill myself for now. i cant be bothered buying anything to mix with the eucalyptus oil so i dont puke it right away, and im pretty sure i would just fail and make everyone miserable and waste space in a hospital. but im going to kill myself at some point. every day that i dont is just delaying the inevitable.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/h09qod/i_have_a_potentially_lethal_case_of_cant_be_assed/", "title": "i have a potentially lethal case of \u201ccan\u2019t be assed\u201d", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "grimdarkpixels", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1591791501, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/h09qod/i_have_a_potentially_lethal_case_of_cant_be_assed/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427449.3293638, "replies_charged": false}
