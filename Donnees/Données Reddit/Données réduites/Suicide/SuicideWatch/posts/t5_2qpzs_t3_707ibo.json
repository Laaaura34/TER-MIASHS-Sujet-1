I have had an increase in suicidal thoughts since starting paroxetine.\n\nI will likely talk to my doctor about the increase in suicidal thoughts and switch to another SSRI.\n\nI don't know why I wrote this, I'm not able to see therapist so I guess that's why I posted this, just to be able to vent some emotions and thoughts.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/707ibo/third_attempt_in_a_year/", "title": "Third attempt in a year.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Samantha_zzz", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1505448150, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/707ibo/third_attempt_in_a_year/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425263.0206141, "replies_charged": false}
