I\u2019m on several medications and have been seeing a therapist for about as long. There are no resources for people dealing with active suicidal ideation. It is inevitable that I will kill myself either consciously through suicide or unconsciously through my choices. Whenever I am experiencing suicidal ideation there are no resources that help me. Google and other corps have made it impossible to find information that isn\u2019t the same links the suicide hotline or telling you to talk to someone or think about something else or find god or some shit. I feel like the only thing besides killing myself that could stop it is hard drugs of some kind but at that point I might as well kill myself. I hate being myself I feel selfish by virtue of my existence and however I die will be equally as selfish.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nmqri0/there_are_no_resources_for_people_who_deal_with/", "title": "There are no resources for people who deal with constant suicidal ideation", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Fucotrucko", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622180099, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nmqri0/there_are_no_resources_for_people_who_deal_with/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427241.460511, "replies_charged": false}
