All year I've tried to tell my partner that I think about dying daily.  I told my best friend, and a month later she tried to get with my partner after 'convincing herself' that we broke up, because that same conversation I told her about my struggles in my relationship.  My partner and I decided to work on things after that, and were going good for a while.  But then things went back to what they were.  I then did something awful, and I can't forgive myself.  I was already struggling with hating myself, but I've never been this low before.  I've spent all day thinking of different ways to do it.  Do I take his gun and end it quick?  But no, I'm too afraid of that and know I wouldn't commit.  Now I've been thinking I'll just drink whatever alcohol I have in the house, give myself some liquid courage and numb some pain.  It'll be easy to cut myself and let myself bleed out.  He leaves for graveyard soon, so I'll have all night.  I know I shouldn't have these feelings, and should reach out to someone.  But I don't feel like anyone has cared when I tried to open up before, why would they now?  It's so hard to get myself out of this feeling... and I'm not sure I even want to..", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pn8vgs/struggling_with_severe_suicidal_ideation/", "title": "Struggling with severe suicidal ideation", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "spilled_the_beans123", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631509414, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pn8vgs/struggling_with_severe_suicidal_ideation/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427209.1469076, "replies_charged": false}
