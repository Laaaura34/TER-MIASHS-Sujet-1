Every time I start to almost enjoy something my brain creeps in with 'remember that time you humiliated yourself in front of everybody' and the depressive thinking comes right back. I'm not trying to be dramatic, but it feels like my brain is on a mission to make me miserable. I cannot live with this constant 24/7 feeling of embarrassment, humiliation and shame.
