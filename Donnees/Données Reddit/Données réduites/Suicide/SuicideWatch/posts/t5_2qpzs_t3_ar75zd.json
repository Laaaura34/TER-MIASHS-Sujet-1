{"id": "t5_2qpzs_t3_ar75zd", "request": ["21acfd9d-efc3-4a00-8159-c2d147c4dbaf"], "text": "Brief about me. I'm 30 male. American. I make shit $,at a job that offers no sense of purpose. I am a recovering (ed,mostly) drug addict, commit petty crimes to supplement. I have been an untreated sociopath for most of my life, and am recently growing a conscience. Some of the criminal aspects of my supplementation has been pushing me further and further into deep inner conflict. Long story short, I find myself doing things that make me sick, that didn't seem to bother me before, and I hate myself along with everything else, maybe most of all.\n\nBackground/Family. Youngest of 5 children. I was an all A student. Some sense of melancholy hit me around 8th grade. I can't describe it.Loss of pride, interest, sense of reality. I don't know. It was like the fuck it, it doesn't matter button got stuck and I just stopped everything. Every care,worry. A numbness and whatever could make you feel something was God, the choir, the temple, the damned parking lot and stale bread, fucking everything about everything rolled into one. Got into drugs,rougher stuff. Took until 11th grade to make school life incompatible with the lifestyle. I dropped out. I was on course for what my parents expected. Was always good on tests. Took the ACT,got a 33, could've gotten in anywhere. They would have paid my way, same for many in the middle class. The norm. Me dropping out resulted in conflict with them, all of my siblings were pride and joy.  On their way to be doctors,real money makers, and contributors to society. The same was expected of me, but I was thinking of jumping off bridges even back then. The result was  myself leaving the nest and things got worse from there. The drugs got harder,became less about feeling something new and more about maintaining, and my behavior became far more destructive.\n\nFast forward to recent times. I quit using  opiates,the caines,benzos, the cooky amphetamines, the whole family of narcotics so to say about a year ago. I drink like a fish and smoke like a chimney these days in their place.  I didn't go through treatment,12 steps or the like, far too cynical a person for that and I'm not comforted by the presence of strangers, it has the opposite effect. I had met a girl who turned me onto psychotropic substances. Lsd,mushrooms,etc..I blame them, and her for my troubled conscience, but not angrily. I used them for a while and I don't know what to say really. They seemed to rewire me a little bit. Almost a reset, not fully,I'm still most miserable, but enough to take grasp of things enough to get clean and remain so, the odd slip here and there. She was a bit like me in some ways. She got sick. Cancer, and from her own family she knew what she was in for. She intentionally overdosed rather than go through it. I don't hate or blame her for it, but in that I've lost the only person who has ever meant anything, and I do mean anything to me since childhood. So trying to get past that has resulted in me making a grand bargain with myself.\n\nI don't understand what I'm doing, or why I'm doing it. Like it. Want it. Feel any pride or desire about it. But I'm going to try. I broke down after losing her and self bargaining, called my parents. I'm going back home. Moving back in for a while. They will help me with the cost of things while I  get my G.E.D. and try to get an education, as I have nothing to show in life skills. My siblings, know so and so so at the local college (of course they do, they panned out)  so I can be priced this way,poked,prodded,judged that way, so it can be made easier for me. Like trash off the street with a spackling of glitter that somehow makes a world of difference to them.\n\nSo I've set a date. March 20th. That's when I am going back tail between legs,taking the help offered, and trying to see if I can find something worthwhile and new in a new situation. I'll be exercising like a health nut, studying, trying to de-rust the useless facts I may still have laying around in my brain, and going through some alcohol withdrawal most likely as well (this day I need it) . March the 20th, is try day. I do have a strong will,it's fickle, but strong. It's not intend to try day, it is try day. From then on, I can just consider myself a smiling puppet to be worked for whats best for me and I'm going to try to cut negativity out entirely. In the sense that I'm not going to feed it. Not with film,music, and as best I can manage,myself.\n\nI've set a second date. December 20th. That's die day. It's a special day for me. I will honor that as well. Die day only comes if the fruits of honest commitment to the time beyond try day prove as bitter as I have known life to be.\n\n\nSo, I need some new music/media? Good stuff. Old stuff. Not angry/depressive stuff. Trying not to feed that at all. I'm not religious, so please no gospel.  Going to be spending a lot of time running and trying to see if I still have a working brain. It'll be horrible I know it. And I'm going to have my nose shoved in shit on a daily basis by a family that loves me, even though it won't be intentional. Like a love spasm. I understand it, but I also know I'm going to come under new forms of wear,even some old ones long thought gone. Good music helps. I really don't know much about music. I think I used to like a few Seal songs? I know I don't like rap or pop.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ar75zd/long_story_ive_fucked_my_life_up_and_ive_set_two/", "title": "\"Long story\" I've fucked my life up and I've set two dates I am going to honor.
