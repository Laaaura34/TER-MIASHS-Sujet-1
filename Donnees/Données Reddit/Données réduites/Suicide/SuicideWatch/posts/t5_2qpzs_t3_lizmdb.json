The last time I went to the doctor (for a foot injury) a routine question about cervical cancer risk turned into the doctor interrogating me about WHY I wasn\u2019t sexually active, she wouldn\u2019t take any of my answers and just kept prying, my foot injury took a sideline to this, and I had to lie because I know from others that telling the truth could go on my record and effect the kind and quality of medical care I receive. I was given the advice to start dressing and acting like an evangelical Christian when I go to the doctor. The thought of this disgusts me, but I don\u2019t have much of a choice.\n\nWhenever I talk about these traumatic experiences I get mocked and called a liar to my face, it shouldn\u2019t hurt me, but it does. I know things will never get better for us, and we\u2019ll always be told we\u2019re lying about our experiences with discrimination. Sometimes I think about how maybe a public suicide with a detailed manifesto could get people to finally start helping us, no matter how little it could be.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to separate my feelings of existential doom, invisibility, and exclusion from these thoughts of sacrificing myself to maybe bring light to the kinds of societal threats I and others like me face and maybe help people who deserve to live more than I do. I\u2019m being vague on purpose, because I know that if people know the details they\u2019ll call me a liar and dramatic and \u201cjust-wanna-be-oppressed\u201d like always. I\u2019m fucking sick of it. I don\u2019t think things will get better anytime soon, and I know I should probably just in case start buying floor-length skirts, a cross necklace, and turtlenecks before I end up needing to visit the doctor again. I hate all of it. I wish I could magically change my sexual orientation, but obviously I can\u2019t, trust me I\u2019ve spent years trying to.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lizmdb/im_a_marginalized_sexual_orientation_that_nobody/", "title": "I\u2019m a marginalized sexual orientation that nobody cares about, I\u2019m always told I\u2019m lying about my experiences, and I don\u2019t think things will ever get better", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "CynderMizuki", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613219049, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lizmdb/im_a_marginalized_sexual_orientation_that_nobody/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427114.3938298, "replies_charged": false}
