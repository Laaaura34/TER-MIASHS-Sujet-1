But like Everything in life It requires sacrifice to even end it all.. Life is a gamble. Very luck-based gamble. For example If you wanna be successful in life, You need to be tall, handsome, smart, born in right country and middle to upper class parents.. Yes You are gonna say You are too deterministic or 'I have a frend who is ugly, short bla bla who is very successful. I don't believe it. You need to be  at least Genetically Lucky to succeed or be normal. I guess Nietzsche was right. There are ubermensch and There are people who shouldn't exist like Me. I look at the life of others and Wanna kill myself everyday. I just wanna express my feelings because You can't talk irl people like this. They are all gone when you say 'I am suicidal'. People always advise to you that you should find your purpose or something like that. What if I suck at my purpose- Btw Finding My Purpose or devoting myself to that won't make me happy. I wanna go to war and then die. This is the end I guess I can't think anything to write rn.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qgzmqc/gamble_called_life/", "title": "Gamble called Life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "PatrickJane666", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635349561, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qgzmqc/gamble_called_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428181.9905891, "replies_charged": false}
