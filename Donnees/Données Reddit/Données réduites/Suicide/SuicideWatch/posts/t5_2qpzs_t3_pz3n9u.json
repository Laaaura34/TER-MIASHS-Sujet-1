I have tried committing suicide by a plastic bag over my head and hanging with the use of my laptop chargers, either I bail as I feel my breath is not cut off enough, or either the nurses catch me red-handed resulting in a check every 15 min.\n\nMy preferred way to go is monoxide poisoning which is obviously not feasible from this location. But I am starting to get worried, everyone says it gets better, wait till the medication hits, this and that. But for no particular bad reason, I can rationally tell you, I am done. I do not wish to be here anymore. Also, I am getting kinda obsessed with finding new ways that could potentially live danger which is bringing me discomfort.\n\nHow can I best prepare my loved ones for my inevitable death?\n\nThanks", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pz3n9u/internalised_after_gf_found_me_committing_suicide/", "title": "Internalised after GF found me committing suicide", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Blurredoutaf", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633076682, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pz3n9u/internalised_after_gf_found_me_committing_suicide/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425586.6369488, "replies_charged": false}
