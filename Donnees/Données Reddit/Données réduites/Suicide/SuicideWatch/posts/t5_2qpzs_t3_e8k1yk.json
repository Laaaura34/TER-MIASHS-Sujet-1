I\u2019m poor, I never get things I need on time. My poor parents stress themselves out every day so we can barely pay rent. I\u2019ve wanted to kill myself for such a long time now. I\u2019m so sick and tired of everyone stepping on me or just blatantly ignoring me, or just seeing me as a burden. I\u2019m useless. I come home from school, eat, sleep, repeat. I have anxiety medication and I can easily overdose. I just don\u2019t want to hurt my brother or my girlfriend any more then they\u2019ve already been hurt. I\u2019m so indecisive. I need to make up my mind. But I\u2019m scared.
