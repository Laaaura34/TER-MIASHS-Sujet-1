I\u2019m a sophomore now. \nI\u2019ve been cutting for 5 years, so basically since I was 10. I know I just sound edgy but this is the pathetic truth. I don\u2019t use Reddit much, but whenever I cry for help on Instagram nobody cares and they just ignore me. \nI have no friends. I talk to a few people but we\u2019re barely acquaintances; I\u2019ve tried making friends with them but it doesn\u2019t go far. \nI\u2019m a social outcast here because of my suicidal behaviors. \nI\u2019ve been homeschooled since last year and still have schoolwork I need to finish by next week. I don\u2019t want to do this anymore. \nMy life means nothing. \nI have nothing. \nI was in love but they were kinda abusive and then blamed me for it and now they won\u2019t even talk to me. My life depends on them and they\u2019re gone. I miss her so much and I love her. \nAll my parents are about is schoolwork and grades. \nI don\u2019t see any reason to keep going. \nA few weeks ago I got out of the psych ward for the 3rd time so going there doesn\u2019t help. I\u2019ll just come home to the same shit. \nThere is no hope. \nI\u2019ll probably just be ignored here anyway.\n\nHave a good day everyone.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cn8to0/no_hope_for_me/", "title": "No hope for me.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "meemoshi", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1565199081, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cn8to0/no_hope_for_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425257.2097445, "replies_charged": false}
