My husband was hit by an 18 wheeler and can\u2019t support my family. I can\u2019t support them either, too anxious to get a $7 an hour job around here and my associates is worth nothing. No job, can\u2019t stop binge eating or panic attacks even after years of therapy and medication. I can\u2019t even make myself cook for my family or clean. I\u2019m useless. I keep writing letters bc I\u2019ve known kids who have lost their parents to suicide and idk any of them that ever ended up okay as adults. Most of them deep down wonder why they aren\u2019t enough or want to die, too. I don\u2019t want that for my kids& I\u2019m anxious about after I die. That\u2019s pretty much the only things keeping me in this endless hell. \n\n-ptsd \n-pots\n-bulimia/BED \n-everyone that raised me died around me\n-raped so many times\n-incest \n-multiple failed attempts since my childhood, my mom would usually cover them up and shame me or whip me\n-so much abuse\n-completely tired\n-so many plans to die, but I\u2019m so anxious about what would happen if I failed again. The mental facility was torture last time, with shots in my butt any time I looked sad. \n-I can\u2019t do anything right& I\u2019m huge, always scared, always exhausted \n-I feel so bad for my kids\n-multiple therapy types, years of different medications& treatments have not worked\n-I\u2019ve had life insurance for long enough that if I killed myself at 24 years old that money could support my kiddos\n-you\u2019ll probably ignore this bc I\u2019m so boring and not at all important lol", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nomg05/fat_failing_anxious_mom/", "title": "Fat Failing Anxious Mom", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Raynesalot4u", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622414309, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nomg05/fat_failing_anxious_mom/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635422927.5083418, "replies_charged": false}
