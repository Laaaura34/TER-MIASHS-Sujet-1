The first couple of weeks I felt like I was on cloud 9. As the months went by, depression and thoughts of suicide entered my mind. Once I stopped drinking the melancholy and suicidal ideation went away. Why? Not drinking allowed me to start dealing with emotions and unpack suppressed feelings.  With that being said, I had no form of control in my life. There was no such thing as physical and emotional security because those were a luxury. Therefore, I know there are several people in this group that understand powerlessness and hopelessness, which is why I wrote this post. \n    Today, my solution is following the suggestions of people that went through  very similar struggles mentally, physically, and emotionally. At any rate, my heart goes out to those that are fighting against suicide. It\u2019s not easy.... The amount of strength and courage it takes to even admit to one\u2019s self that the thought of suicide occurred is tremendous. Fight, and continue to fight.... That\u2019s all I can do, just for today.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/d3653y/drinking_problem/", "title": "Drinking Problem", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Gatorland22", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1568285614, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/d3653y/drinking_problem/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427571.566577, "replies_charged": false}
