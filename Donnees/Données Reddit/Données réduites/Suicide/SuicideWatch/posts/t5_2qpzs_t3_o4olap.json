After things came to a head in April and I tried to kill myself and it didn't work, I thought that if killing myself wasn't off the table, I guess nothing was. \n\nImmediately after my attempt in April didn't work I called my boss and quit my job, which had been bleeding me completely dry, where I had been working myself to death for two years. It took four month's to replace me but I used that time to get serious about applying for jobs in my home town, I moved back in with my mom (which is truely nothing to be embarrassed about) and I found a therapist. I got no where with them and deviced that it wasn't helping. I stuck it out and found a new therapist before giving up on the idea of therapy all together and all I want to say is that it's helped me a lot. I've had a positive experience and if you're struggling to keep in living then I hope you don't give up with out giving therapy a real sincere chance first. Therapy really might help.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o4olap/im_having_a_positive_experience_with_therapy_im/", "title": "I'm having a positive experience with therapy.
