There's this one girl that meant the world to me, and she's tired of me. I've been depressed and with suicidal ideation for a while now, and I've been doing everything I can to keep going, but im just so tired. I feel like enough is enough, I just want everything to stop. I'm tired of feeling so defeated, so shitty, so exhausted, so numb. I just want a painless way out. I have friends and family who care, but, honestly, I just can't take it anymore. I'm 22, and living in a city that's full of people, but I feel alone. I'm so tired of it all.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q271dh/im_so_tired/", "title": "I'm so tired", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Accomplished-Goat624", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633472280, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q271dh/im_so_tired/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426370.2660952, "replies_charged": false}
