I spent my life working, dedicating everything to her and giving her the world. A couple months ago that works was ripped out beneath my feet with adultery and things she said no one could ever take back. My jobs been going in the gutter and my home life isn't any better. I haven't lost control of my life, I just don't want to be in control anymore. \n\nI've looked back at all the pictures and all the texts and everything to see that really she was my one.\n\nI've been like this for some time now, I've felt a change in her and have felt I'd be better off gone. I have all of my stuff in order when it does inevitably happen, and have pieces out my possessions and monies to the right people. I thought I would be ok, and I thought I could get through anything that ever came my way. \n\nI have a date set when I'm going to go through with it, I just need time to say goodbyes and let the people I really care about know how much they meant to me. I've set up emails to be sent to those involved at a specific date and time and where to find me once it's all done. \n\nGod bless this cruel world and everyone who struggles in it. I don't believe we were meant to suffer, but who would ever think this world is what people want.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o9pniw/i_lost_10_years_to_a_woman_i_thought_was_my_soul/", "title": "I lost 10 years to a woman I thought was my soul mate", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Throwaway_Acc10", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 85, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624903039, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o9pniw/i_lost_10_years_to_a_woman_i_thought_was_my_soul/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425170.0674634, "replies_charged": false}
