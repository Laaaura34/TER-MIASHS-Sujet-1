I can't read anything normally - books, articles, signs - so it's not just because I have a reduced ability to focus due to the use of electronic devices. The thing is, it wasn't always like this. Only 7 months ago I was still reading at a normal pace. And before you ask, no, nothing traumatic or sad happened during those 7 months. \nI also have mild astigmatism, so mild that it is considered physiological. I don't think that's to blame, either. I have reading glasses that don't work, so I just don't use them. \nI have gone to several doctors and none of them have helped. The neurologist just prescribed me an anti-anxiety medication, and the eye doctor, as I said, just prescribed me reading glasses and sent me on my way. My mom doesn't want me to see a psychiatrist because she's afraid I'll be diagnosed with something \"bad.\" It should be mentioned that I used to struggle with anorexia nervosa, but now - not too much. However, my mother believes that this is the cause of my reading problems, and it drives me mad.\n\nWhere do I go from here? I just want to be normal. My academic life is forever ruined.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qa6n3n/help_me_read/", "title": "Help me read", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Sufficient_Session68", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634501435, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qa6n3n/help_me_read/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422249.710128, "replies_charged": false}
