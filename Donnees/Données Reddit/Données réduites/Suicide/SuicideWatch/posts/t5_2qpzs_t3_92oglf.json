I was extremely depressed last week, and now last week seems like paradise comparatively after a nightmare of a weekend.. I literally just have no desire to do anything at all.. Im so so close but cant quite end it.. so instead Ive been getting drunk and doing blow constantly because I just dont care anymore. I never used to do cocaine.. I dont even really enjoy it.  I just dont want to feel like myself and... I just dont care. Did a bunch first thing this morning and Ive just kept going. I'm half hoping Ill OD but I know that wont actually happen from coke.. \n\nIts like all the lights have gone out in my world. Everything is gray and.. I just dont care. I dont want to be here anymore. I think I finally figured out how Im going to do it, even tested it a little earlier today but just cant quite get there yet. Im so close though..
