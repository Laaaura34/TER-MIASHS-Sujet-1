Not because of this or anything but mentally through socializing and family issues. I have been stressing out and trying to forget everything that happens throughout the whole of yr9. A lot of my friends seem right now to not care for me and only for themselves which I feel sad about but I realize that this isn't true. I guess it's just me falling in depression whenever something happens where it feels like every action you do, the whole world is against you. I tend to release my anger through cursing and throwing stuff everywhere, also kicking relieves it as well. I feel like I am also ugly that's why I try to make up for it by building my body but that does not seem to work as well. But deep inside I know it's just me being selfish and greedy and all round bad. But to be honest I can\u2019t help myself. I also tend to cry whenever something like this happens. I feel like people will criticize me for doing this but again I just can't help it. I know this happens and it just makes me think like I am just some worthless being who craves attention and will do basically anything non life threatening to get it. I tried to change my attitude the following year but it seems like everybody's likes and hates about me have not changed. Sometimes I like to bang my head against some rough surface because I want people to worry and this feels like it is wrong because it is. The actions I take to relieve my mental pain sometimes harm me even more as I do not like to damage property, especially my own which makes me fall into a deeper state of depression. As my personality shows a lot of bad things from me like a snobby king or boy. I do not like when people tend to think they are better than me when they are not, this makes sense but when those people do something less skillful than I do and gets more attention from it I tend to flip out. Some people even called my passion sad and just a waste of time. In conclusion, I feel like I am just a piece of trash.\n\nPart 2:\n\nI loathe my personality, people says it's what makes what you are but I don't really like the position I am in. Sometimes I enjoy other people suffer and that's wrong. Writing all of this down kind of really allow me to be distracted of what I am going through. To put it simply, I am mentally suffering from my own personality. I can\u2019t change it therefore catching myself in a catch-22. \n\nPart 3:\n\nRight now I do not think much about love or any kind of relationship. I see other people doing it but I do not feel a lot of that. However I did have some in the past which caused a majority of major breakdowns which includes the other side ruining the relationship with things like cheating and such. I actually do respect other people's true perspective of crushes but it seems like it does not really change anything as in my society, I do not of that much power.\n\nPart 3.5:\n\nTo get people to understand you and listen to you; there are certain times where I try to express my feelings or ideas or basically anything to others but they always ignore me. I feel like to get them to finally listen, i must be known for something, to do something. Thats why to get someone to look or stop, I be loud and shout. This always end me up in a bad place.\n\nPart 4: \n\nI don\u2019t get what\u2019s wrong with my internal body as ever since I was 6, my digestive tract was starting to get weaker. I get stomach aches and cramps more easily which ends up making me develop a bad posture due to hours of it in the toilet. A lot of people just get by after a few minutes but there were times where I had to try to sleep up straight sitting down, on the toilet and waking up to throw up. Diarrhea is such a joke to everybody and my sister and cousins often joke about me suffering about it.\n\nPart 5:\n\nPart of my true personality changes, especially when my sister starts to judge my tastes. Older siblings tend to think themselves as better than the younger and me and my sister used to have a smooth relationship until I craved her attention as her schoolwork became more stressful. When I was 7 yrs to 11, entering a foot into her room would make me end up in a beating. I was shorter and weaker than her back then and my parents always believe her because I do tend to lie more but even in the situations where I was right, I get scolded. Her friends do not help as she tends to push me away and forget about my existence which I do make sense about, I also tend to get used to this abuse until I stopped talking to her for quite a while just to make sure I wasn\u2019t \u201cannoying her\u201d. Fortunately and eventually as I grew taller and bigger we started to respect each other and right now, she even helps me with some things. I feel like life would be harder without an older sibling.\n\nWhat to do when you have depression:\n\nJust like this book, try to write out or at least tell your feelings to a trusted friend. To be honest I do not really know what true depression feels like because I always recover fast. But I do have an idea of what might relieve:\n\n1. Spend more time socializing with family or friends\n2. Drink more water, people with depression tend to reject consuming food or liquid\n3. Sleep more early\n4. Go to a therapist \n5. Consult your fears and push on\n\nAnd if truly necessary, nobody will stop you. If you feel like truly nothing can relieve your suffering then,\n\n  6. Commit suicide. (But it is highly encouraged not to do this. Call these numbers if you feel like it:)\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(I have to put this out because people will not publish this)\n\nThey always say it's never too late but people who gets saved from suicide still suffer. \n\nEND\n\nReference: \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_suicide\\_crisis\\_lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines)\n\nReferences\n\nList of suicide crisis lines.
