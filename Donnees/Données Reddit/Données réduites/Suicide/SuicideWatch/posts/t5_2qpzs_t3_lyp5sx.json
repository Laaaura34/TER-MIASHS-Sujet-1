What\u2019s worse is that I failed entry level community college until I was barred, failed drivers ed, and really can\u2019t do tasks that are slightly complex/nuanced all because I was mentally impaired by both past anorexia and medication. I genuinely hate life. \n\nI\u2019ve been using weed to make the days pass quicker, and last night I also took mushrooms and eventually got to the point where I was convinced that my life wasn\u2019t going to go anywhere at all, so I paced around my one room apartment with a sword in my hand seriously considering killing my next door neighbor just so I could know what it was like then go to prison and essentially check out of life. \n\nI\u2019m in a horribly dark place right now. I think I\u2019m completely hopeless.
