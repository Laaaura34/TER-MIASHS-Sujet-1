She has always asked for help when she felt suicidal before doing anything. Today she took the step and took bunch of her depression medicine because of \"voices\". I have taken her to counselors. I have taken her to therapist. She's been in the ER twice before and behavioral heath centers twice. I'm sitting in the ER with her now and was told she will go to a behavior health center again. The mental health therapist from the hospital suggested that a therapist who specializes in Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) might help. I am at a complete loss with what to do next. I feel behavior health is a temporary fix, and every other therapist has dropped her. I'm helpless, and at the end of my rope and stressed. I feel she needs long term care but money is a factor and she has to be \"stable \" to go there. I have health insurance and get paid well enough for my job.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p3hy3t/14_yo_daughter_tried_today_i_feel_helpless_help/", "title": "14 y/o daughter tried today.
