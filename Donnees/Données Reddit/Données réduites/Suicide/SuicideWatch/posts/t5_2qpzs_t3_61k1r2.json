But each day just keeps getting more and more depressing.\n\nI miss seeing my friends, I miss playing board games everyday after school, I miss drinking on the weekends, why did everybody have to get so busy? \n\nI literally have nobody, I thought I might try some online dating, start a relationship like most of my old pals have, didn't work out so well, maybe I'm not attractive enough. \n\nI don't know what to do anymore, life can't go on like this for much longer, each day drags heavier.\n\nHopefully the next life is better than this, it can't be worse.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/61k1r2/melancholy/", "title": "Melancholy", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Appleseedjjjj", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1490505190, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/61k1r2/melancholy/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427512.0999079, "replies_charged": false}
