So a couple minutes earlier me and my mom fought. There was a lot of screaming and hitting and overall a lot of bullshit. So afterwards I\u2019m on downtime(obviously) listening to music to try to help myself not cut again and I\u2019m just getting sadder, so I try to find out who I can call to help and ofc the only friend that would wake up if I call her just put her childhood cat down(for the record I\u2019m not mad at her in any way) so I go to google. I tried a website with a phone number I never heard of so I didn\u2019t have high hope of it working on downtime, and big shocker here but it didn\u2019t work. So I told Siri to call the suicide hotline and she says \u201csorry I can\u2019t make a call to the National Suicide Prevention Hotline during downtime\u201d.
