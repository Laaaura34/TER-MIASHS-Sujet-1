I do not want to act in it just because of the pain I will cause to everyone. When I drink, those barriers become much lower. I  am avoiding drinking. However I feel like I am in a precarious state of existence. I took lors of antidepressants when I was drunk a while back but stopped as I thought about what I was doing - left me feeling pretty awful for about two days. I am in pain and I really want it to stop. I'm trying to work and go about life as normal but it's becoming increasingly hard. I've snapped at and alienated my husband who I love - told him to leave, though I don't want him to leave. I hurt him already and don't want to hurt him more. I feel like I'm being pushed underwater and am struggling to escape but it is becoming too much lately. What can I do to pull myself out of this. Can a crisis service help? Have spoken to samritans before and don't find them especially helpful.   I can't talk to anyone I know. It will make them too worried or they will think I am attention seeking and make me feel worse.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qao3z8/practical_help_uk/", "title": "Practical help UK", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "nyuralnetwork", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634568317, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qao3z8/practical_help_uk/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426160.7680478, "replies_charged": false}
