My parents are not normal and super dysfunctional and are the sole reason I am like this. They were strict af and did not allow me to go outside at all. The first time I ever went out with my friends was when I was a senior in high school. They also did not allow me to join clubs or engage in any extracurricular activity. Even though they were strict, they had no expectations for me, I cry myself to sleep every night thinking that I have wasted my childhood doing and accomplishing nothing, and also thinking that I wished my parents pushed me more to be better and try new things. Because I never actually got to try anything in all my teen years, I don't know what I want to do, and I am studying a degree I don't really want. Consequently, I am just going to waste even more time, thinking of what I want to do because I never got to try anything when I was younger. I almost 20 years old and I have no idea what I am doing with my life.\n\nWhenever I got angry, my mother would poke and poke and poke, saying things like \"look at you being dramatic again\", \"oh look she's mad how sad\" (My mother does not speak English so it sounds a bit awkward when I translate this). My father doesn't even  think I exist and when I say what's in my mind, or even show a little bit of discomfort on my face I'll get hit. Even if they do allow me to do something, they won't even bother driving me anywhere, or get me something I need for school, so basically, I am still not allowed to do anything. When there is a problem, THEY NEVER SOLVE THE DAMN PROBLEM. They like to set aside and stack up the problems and let the problems stress them out even more in the future, and complain like a bunch of fucking idiots. Imagine living with these nutcases, and experiencing this every single day.\n\nWe used to live in a foreign country, and we were pretty well-off when I was younger. My parents had all the opportunities to save money. Fast forward to the present, my dad can't find a job and my mom has never worked a day in her life. Even right now, when literally all we eat is canned food, she refuses to find a job. You mean to tell me, that all those years, they did not save for retirement, college, and we don't even have a damn house. And they keep complaining about not having any money, when in actuality they have done absolutely zero saving to sustain the family. Now, we can't pay for college tuition and they tell me that do not have any money saved, and they expect me to support them after I graduate, if I even do anyway. Most of my old high school friends live alone and even though my parents obviously don't fucking love me they REFUSE to let me move out even though I know in my gut it is going to benefit everyone if I did. (NOTE: In my country, parents pay for college, and things like student loans do not exist where I'm from.) I would also like to get a job, but here where I'm from, kids my age are absolutely not given a chance to work, and not getting a college degree is an absolutely positively big deal. I am so young and all I think about is money. I cannot depend on my parents, so I always think about what I should do next to save myself, and this so tiring. Salary rates here are also extremely low. How could they even think to have me support them when it is their responsibility in the  first place to sustain themselves. I have talked to my mother but she does not understand a single word I am saying. When I get a job, I'm running away and I am NOT giving them shit. They do nothing but expect to get everything.\n\nI am so mentally unstable I think of suicide in my every waking moment ever since I was young. Of course, nobody takes me seriously. I am so tired, I just want to end it all. I have no support, and the environment I grew up in and am currently in is very unhealthy. I think of killing myself everyday. I want to get revenge on my parents so bad. I am so angry at them for being so irresponsible and for treating me like a dog all my life. I want to live a happy life, I want to move out, I want to be loved, I need therapy. I am so sad and pitiful and exhausted. Why is it that I can't be happy. Why can't I be loved and respected. Why can't I have normal responsible parents who actually try to take care of their children.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ok8xsd/on_the_verge_of_committing_suicide_need_advice/", "title": "On the verge of committing suicide, need advice", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tacobell5125", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626282938, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ok8xsd/on_the_verge_of_committing_suicide_need_advice/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428346.2548187, "replies_charged": false}
