I\u2019ve lost my friends to my friends ex who blames me for everything and I\u2019m losing what little autonomy to my parents with them forcing me to make friends that I don\u2019t have interest in.\n\nI can\u2019t be the Christian smart son who is loved by everyone and follows the words of god with compassion and love, no I get to be the underperforming tranny that people only keep around due to sympathy or because it\u2019s fun to have your little court jester to cry at their command.\n\nI took the razor from my pencil sharpener and I cut up the bicep on my left arm, the pain feels like a tap on the shoulder from the other side, a place better than here.\n\nIf it gets worse, which it will with the constant college work where I\u2019m harassed by my past mistakes or my home life where I\u2019m compared to every parents son and daughter and fall short in everything. Then I have an extra hope that I won\u2019t suffer for long.\n\nEDIT: \n\nAs you can see I am still here and mentally improving, I have learned to take a backseat to cares and even accept I\u2019m not perfect and those who love me unconditionally have reasons to do so.
