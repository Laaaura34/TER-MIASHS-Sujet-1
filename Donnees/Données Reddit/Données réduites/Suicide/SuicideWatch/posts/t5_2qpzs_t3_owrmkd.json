I have been in college for 8 years and i still don't have a degree. My friends keep moving on with their lives: getting married, finishing school, moving out and loving life. Here I am 25 years old just existing at my parents place burdening them with my pointless emotional outbursts. My parents even offered to pay my college tution. Look at what other people had to go through just to obtain a degree: moving across countries, taking unpayable loans, and here I am with the luck of the draw just fucking wasting it. I hate the thought that I have to rely on the kindness of others to make it through life, yet I cant seem to unfuck myself out of anything, move on like my friends did. In summary Im just a fucking waste of life", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/owrmkd/failure_as_a_human_being/", "title": "Failure as a human being", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Shukuzulu", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627950017, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/owrmkd/failure_as_a_human_being/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426958.222194, "replies_charged": false}
