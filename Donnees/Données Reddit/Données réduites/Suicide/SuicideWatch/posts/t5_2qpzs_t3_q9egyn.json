If you don\u2019t consider me a friend please don\u2019t read the rest of this text.\n\n\nI\u2019m currently either dead or in the process of dying, I am letting you know because I care about my friends and don\u2019t want to make you guys start looking around for answers in a couple weeks when you realize I\u2019m missing. I also don\u2019t want you to think that I stopped talking to you specifically or something. I also don\u2019t want anyone to feel guilty or think this was their fault.\n\nNow I won\u2019t get into the how I\u2019m doing this but it\u2019s too late to change this decision, I\u2019ll try to explain a bit of the why to give you closure, and to get this off my chest before I go.\n\nSo let\u2019s get some common arguments that I\u2019ve already heard dozens of times out of the way, and in the process I\u2019ll explain a bit more about the situation.\n\n\u201cOh but James, you have so much to live for\u201d or \u201cit gets better eventually\u201d or \u201cyour future self wouldn\u2019t want you to do this\u201d or any other alteration of this statement.\n\nWhile that might be true I don\u2019t think the journey is worth it. I\u2019ve been planing this for several months now. I have prayed extensively asking God to help me improve and change something, but for some reason that I do not know He hasn\u2019t. I\u2019ve tried medication and therapy, I\u2019ve tried burying myself into work, videogames, or hobbies, I\u2019ve tried every piece of advice available to me, lately I\u2019ve been sleeping ten to twelve hours a day and working eight of the waking hours I have, I don\u2019t find enjoyment in any hobbies or anything else I can do in my free time, I\u2019ve been trying to do things I used to enjoy such as juggling or reading, or trying new things I\u2019ve always wanted to do but everything feels dull. I haven\u2019t had a \u201chappy day\u201d in months. I don\u2019t see how this could change anytime soon. Joy in life is made out of novelties and new things, but the excitement of those things wears out eventually. There are still things I wish I could have done, but honestly I don\u2019t see why I should try.\n\n\n\u201cBut James, you have a family and friends that care about you!\u201d\n\nIt is true that I have a family that  loves me. And I love them very deeply in return, but right now while I have a handful of people that consider friends there is only one person that I consider a close friend. He is the only person that actually reaches out to me to talk instead of me reaching out to him. Now if you\u2019re not this person I don\u2019t blame you. Everyone has personal lives and things to do. I have never expect and would never have expected that you take out time out of your schedule to talk with me.\n\nLife moves on. Some people move forwards with it and some people are left behind. I don\u2019t blame those in front for being in front. The only person to blame is myself.\n\nAs for my family, like I already mentioned I love them very deeply. And I know they love me the same way, but at a certain point the constant suffering and sadness I\u2019ve been going through has overpowered this love I have for them. I recently realized that sometimes in life you need to put your needs before the need of others. And for me this means ending the suffering in the only possible way.\n\nOver the last couple months the sadness and depression have started affecting my physical health. I feel this constant pressure and pain deep inside my chest, it gets especially bad when I\u2019m I\u2019m feeling sad or depressed. I have the impression that someone reached a fist inside of my chest and is twisting my insides into a tight and painful ball of flesh, I\u2019m having trouble eating properly, my sleep isn\u2019t fulfilling and is usually filled with nightmares and interrupted.\n\nThe only time when I can say that I\u2019m in peace or somewhere close to happy are the last 15-30 minutes of sleep I get in the morning, right before I wake up. During that time I\u2019m usually completely lost in dreaming or in such a deep sleep my mind is completely blank. It\u2019s during that time, when I completely forget that anything exists that I\u2019m in peace. \n\nCould I tough it out and keep living? Could I simply decide to keep living this existence?\n\nMaybe, but I\u2019m deciding not to. If I keep going I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll stop blaming myself and start blaming people around me. And if I do that I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll start hurting said people. And that is the last thing I want.\n\nThere are several people that have endured way worse than me. People that have lived through horrors that I can\u2019t even imagine or pulled themselves out of holes way deeper than mine. The suffering I go through is absolutely nothing compared to what other people have gone through. But I am not those people. I don\u2019t have the mental strength or willpower to push through. And even if I did I don\u2019t want to.\n\nThis was a rational decision. It wasn\u2019t an impulsive decision made in the heat of a bad day. This was pre planned. It has been planned since last New Years, when I first tried to kill myself. I decided to give myself some time to decide if I really wanted this. What happened then was an impulsive decision, that made me realize how fragile and precious human life is.\n\nA human is much more than a bag of muscle, blood and organs that walks around, we aren\u2019t just biochemical machines or computers. We are the culmination of everything and everyone that has affected us up until this point. In my case I have 19 years of memories and life experiences, on top of all the genetic material that comes from both my father and mother, every single person I have interacted with, everything that I have done, every injury, every laugh, every cry, every moment of my life has shaped me into who I am now. But I am deciding to stop this. I know I don\u2019t know the extent of the consequences of this action. I don\u2019t know how much this will affect the people around me but I know that I can\u2019t worry too much about everything, all I can do is hope that the people I\u2019m leaving behind will be able to cope with everything and eventual move on.\n\nSo I\u2019d like to thank you. Like I mentioned in the beginning, if you\u2019re reading this it means that at a certain point in my life I considered you a friend. It means that we had fun together, laughed together, talked together, did stupid things together. And I\u2019m sorry that I have to do this. And I\u2019d like to thank to for those moments, those moments are what\u2019s letting me go now in relative peace. I have lived a life that I\u2019m happy with. The only reason why I\u2019m doing this is because I think that the past is brighter than the future. I wouldn\u2019t have changed the memories I have with you guys for anything else. I wouldn\u2019t have changed them for a longer or happier life.\n\nI\u2019m happy with the life I\u2019ve lived. But all good things must come to an end.\n\nAgain there is no one to blame other than myself.\n\nOne last time thank you for all the time we spent together\n\nGoodbye", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9egyn/my_suicide_letter_i_want_to_share_this_with_a_few/", "title": "My suicide letter.
