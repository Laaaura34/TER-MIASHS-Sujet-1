I had dropped out of school because my mental health was a disaster, and I had run out of money. I had gotten a job, but I didn't make a ton and I was drinking and doing drugs on the daily.\n\n4 years ago, I had moved out of my parents' place. I finally found a therapist I could work with. She encouraged me to start medication. I was still struggling a lot emotionally, but I was making progress in a direction. I had a group of friends. I had side projects and hobbies. I was not in a relationship, but  I was meeting people and doing things.\n\n3 years ago, I felt \"human\" for the first time, maybe ever. I had been working with my therapist for a long time, I had medication that helped, I had a job that was interesting and engaging, and I was working on building good and healthy habits.\n\n2 years ago, I was in a position to move across the country for a job that I really wanted, and I did. I had a new relationship and a job that I loved, and for the first time since I was a kid I felt happy and confident. I was confident enough to go off of my medication. I felt like I had finally made something of myself and was in a good place emotionally.\n\n1 year ago, I had a different job and an unhealthy, emotionally unsafe, and failing relationship. I was working 80 hours per week and then spending my weekends helping my SO take care of her apartment and her pets.\n\n6 months ago I had gotten fired and was yet again at a different job, and there was no more relationship.\n\n5 months ago, the last close relationship in my life started slowly dying. My sibling came out as trans and while I absolutely love them and support them, it took a serious toll on our relationship - they began focusing almost exclusively on their new identity and community, and only wanted to talk about themselves and their new life. This was the only other person on the planet I could talk to about the emotional baggage caused the house we were raised in for 2 decades, and they wanted to put all of that behind them and kill off that version of themselves. Our regularly scheduled activities fell by the wayside as they got more involved with the people their newfound community, and our relationship naturally drifted apart. I was a thousand miles away, they were busy with a new identity and new friends.\n\n4 months ago, I wanted to kill myself. I had been spiraling prior to that, and I was struggling to perform at work. I was exhausted constantly, and irritable. I was fired for the second time in 4 months. Doing basic things like feeding myself was a massive emotional and physical lift. I was completely alone, jobless, and stuck in an expensive city I didn't want to be in anymore.\n\n3 months ago, I moved back into my parents' house. The same house and same parents that I've spent years in therapy trying to understand and heal from.\n\nI'm 27 now. Over the last 3 months, I've fallen deeper and deeper into a suicidal depression. Last week I finally broke the wall and put together a plan. I got the stuff together and figured out time and place to end my own life. I am devastated. I hate that I feel this way, but I really think the pandemic and the lockdown ruined my life. It happened at such an unexpected and inopportune time, and has lasted *so* long. The world is in chaos, it was 118 degrees in the arctic circle this week, I'm trapped in a place that I hate and can barely function as a human being.\n\nI really can't see the point. I don't deserve good things - they don't happen to me. When I hurt, I end up making the people around me hurt, in on way or another. I feel like I can't do this anymore. I just want to close my eyes and never wake up. There are things that are wrong with me emotionally that I don't even know where to begin fixing. If I am going to have a life I feel is worth living, it'll take another 5 years of dedicated hard work in therapy to get there. I'm exhausted. I just want this all to be over, so I can finally REST.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oc4j1v/i_was_all_the_way_up_and_now_im_all_the_way_down/", "title": "I was all the way up, and now I'm all the way down again", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "1w15h1w3red34d", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625207903, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oc4j1v/i_was_all_the_way_up_and_now_im_all_the_way_down/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427120.425623, "replies_charged": false}
