My rumination and anxiety is totally out of control. I\u2019ve tried almost all SSRI/SNRIs, on Prozac now for the second time. Antidepressants seemingly do nothing for me. But like I said my rumination and anxiety is totally ruining my life. Benzos are the only thing that help but I can\u2019t be prescribed them for daily use. Thinking about asking my doc about trying a mood stabilizer or a low dose antipsychotic. I need to slow my brain down. Maybe low dose seroquel would be able to accomplish that? But I\u2019m just curious as to what meds helped some of you guys get your rumination and anxiety under control? Desperate to find something to slow down my thoughts and ease my anxiety.
