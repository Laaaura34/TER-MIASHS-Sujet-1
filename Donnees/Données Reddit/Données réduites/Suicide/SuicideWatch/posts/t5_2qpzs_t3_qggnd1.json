With my health worsening my disabilities getting worse, the isolation, and the extremely toxic family. I find the music helps me through my darkest days. I wanna do so much. Battles in my head hammer inside my skull with an insistence I want to kill myself. I\u2019m not having enough to live on the disabled person in the United States making less than $10,000 a year in one of the most expensive places in the United States. And because of my disabilities I just cannot move to a more inexpensive part of the country. Nor can I even Dane to move to another country, because of all the crippling medical debt and at least my credit score in the low 400s. So buying a house renting an apartment any of it is impossible task for somebody like me who is almost 50. So I just get By, with Getting by. I find myself though that music much like in my teenage years when my suicidal ideation started especially the last couple years has been insurmountably essential to helping pull me out of those moods. And I don\u2019t know if any of y\u2019all can relate, but there\u2019s some songs that you discover, they just hit so fucking hard. I have two songs today, that are new to my lineup That I discovered weirdly enough thanks to TikTok. And I keep YouTube playlist various reasons and moods Whatever fancy strikes me for building a playlist usually it\u2019s based around role-playing since it\u2019s one of my main hobbies. But in the last few weeks I\u2019ve thrown together a mental health playlist. It\u2019s only Got a tiny handful of songs, But with today\u2019s discoveries It grew a little bit bigger. I\u2019ll link my playlist in comments for anybody who in fact might wish to listen to it. And if anybody has any suggestions for it, you know what to do. While the account is new, I am an old lurker to this sub. And I would like to thank y\u2019all for helping me through some of my darkest days. The ones still here, and the ones that succeeded in ending their pain, thank you from the bottom of my heart.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qggnd1/music_helps_me_when_the_days_are_too_much/", "title": "Music helps me when the days are too much\u2026", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LadyGrace_ST", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635283458, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qggnd1/music_helps_me_when_the_days_are_too_much/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427653.0718017, "replies_charged": false}
