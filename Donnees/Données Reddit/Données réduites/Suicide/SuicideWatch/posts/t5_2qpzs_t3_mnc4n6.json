Don\u2019t like my parents because if not for them I wouldn\u2019t even have to be a live. Of all the times to be alive I have to live in this time. I have absolutely no emotions anymore. I don\u2019t feel love, I don\u2019t feel hate, I just feel the loneliness of life. You can\u2019t convince me this isn\u2019t some sort of hell. We were born in hell and there\u2019s no escape from it. I can\u2019t remember what it feels like to be happy or excited. I wish there was a war. I\u2019m ready for world war three. But I know it will never happen not in my life time. I need a excitement nothing ever changes around here. All the innovations have already happened. There are no need things to discover. I\u2019m starting to think that all of history was a lie. We will never explore space. I hate society and humanity. Being born a human seem like the worst possible fate. At the same time I realize this might be the best possible reality. Maybe I\u2019m completely insane. Maybe this is my death bed and my brain is shutting down. Why is suicide so taboo. Some people want to die because they have no reason to live.
