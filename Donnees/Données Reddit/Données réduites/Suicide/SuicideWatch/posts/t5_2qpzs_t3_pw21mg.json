I hope it helps.\n________________________\n\n\nThere is still happiness under the hate, melancholy, sadness, depression, frustration, cries for help and no response of help. Do not stop going on. You will tread through pain and suffering. You will go through. You can, you HAVE the power. Never stop fighting. Do not let them take you. \n\nDo not care. Turn it off. Switch everything off. You have the power. \nYou will defeat everything that is holding you back with every ounce of WILLPOWER and ENERGY. \n\nFeel your heart and focus with all your BRAINPOWER on the beating rhythm of your heart. Feel every beat like a SHOCKWAVE of power running through your veins. \n\nDo. Not. Stop.
