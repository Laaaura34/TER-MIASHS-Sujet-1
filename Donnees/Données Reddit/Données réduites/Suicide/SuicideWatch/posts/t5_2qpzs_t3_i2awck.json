I know it was the summer before the fourth grade. That was the summer my god brother molested, and tried to rape, me and I told my mother and she told me both that he must have thought I was her and that it was just a dream. A few weeks later she made me go with her and his family to drive him to college. That was also the summer that my mother, brother and I moved from the city where our whole extended family lived to a rural town in another state where we knew no one.  I was bullied constantly, at school and at home. I had an intense desire to kill myself for at least a year and the feeling has come and gone ever since. For the past 3 years, it's been almost constant.\n\nMy father abandoned my brother and I when I was two. It wasn't that he had any addictions or jail sentences or any other extenuating circumstances. He just didn't want us. He had other children, even step children, for whom he was an integral part of their lives. Just not us. He tried to rekindle with my brother at one point, but not me. He knew. My mother knew too. She made it very clear that she didn't want us and she got stuck with us. Yes, my brother is suicidal too and I've talked him out of it many times, even though he hates me too. \n\nI was not a cute kid and everyone made sure that I knew it. I'm told that I've grown out of that now, but I don't see it. And it didn't exactly change the way people treat me. I've never had a romantic relationship with anyone who actually cared about me. I've only had a few, and they were all short-lived and the guys all treated me like I didn't deserve commitment and how dare I ask questions about it. It's less that they made me feel like I was unworthy and more that they confirmed what I already knew. Whenever I think about it, which is constantly, I get angry with myself for putting myself in that position because I already knew I was unlovable. How dare I try to give my heart to someone knowing that it's diseased and disgusting?\n\nI won't kill myself while my mother is alive, because as much as she hurt me, I can't bring myself to make her face her failure in that way. I also can't figure out how to do it in a way that won't be terribly painful, though maybe I deserve the pain. Sometimes I play around with writing a suicide note, and that is probably the only thing that feels comforting. It feels like the right thing to do. That's why I'm writing here. Writing is therapeutic because talking about it is taboo.\n\nBut, I thought by now I would have proven that someone could love me and I haven't. Given my age and this pandemic, I probably never will. I'm a cat lady and I hate myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/i2awck/unlovable/", "title": "Unlovable", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "hummingbird10030", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1596369443, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/i2awck/unlovable/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428476.3062754, "replies_charged": false}
