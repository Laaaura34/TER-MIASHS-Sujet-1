Meaning, full social stigma on the mentally ill, no support, parents do not understand me as they lived in different times, friends can't help me in any way, and I have started not talking about it due to feeling it being a pity party.Issue being, I am a type two bipolar, meaning only slight mania and terrible depressions, and have since become suicidal, and thoughts are slowly turning into VERY realistic thoughts and intentions. The societal stigma is so great, that my psychiatrist even falsified my diagnosis in order to not appear in potential employer checks, as they would never employ a bipolar.\n\nI am at the end of my rope. Those hotlines? Tried that crap, pure joke, did not help me one bit. How do I stop this, how can I even live with this??", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qevzhh/14_years_on_bipolar_15_meds_that_did_not_work/", "title": "14 years on bipolar, 15 meds that did not work, can't take it anymore, no support", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwme65435", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635094135, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qevzhh/14_years_on_bipolar_15_meds_that_did_not_work/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423128.8373563, "replies_charged": false}
