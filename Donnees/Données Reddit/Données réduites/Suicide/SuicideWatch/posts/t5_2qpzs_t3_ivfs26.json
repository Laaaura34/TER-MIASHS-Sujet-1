A while back, I told my mom that I have been throwing up my food for an entire week and wanted to see a therapist. (At the time I have had bulimia for 2 and a half years. Still have it) She laughed in my face and asked me what would a therapist do, just talk?. She asked me if I was stupid. My dad, I told him that I was depressed, and he told me then if you are depressed how am I gonna get through high school. I also told him that I had been throwing up every meal for a week straight, he told me to just stop doing it then. He later on told me that my family members' mental illnesses exist only because people don't have the will to be okay. That it's all in their head and they should just get over it. My grandma who lives with us is so mean, and contributed to my bulimia. My parents told my I'm mediocre, and not good enough. As an only child, I feel like I'll never live up to their expectations. I know they love me but they just don't understand. Everyday I just cry more and more. I have been suicidal for quite some time now, I think about it everyday.
