But recently I've been upset, stressed and it's getting really really bad.\n\nIt's been getting worse recently because of the stress I've been getting from work and stuff that I feel like I need it when I'm stressed.\n\nThe past couple of days have been horrible. I'm so embrassed but the other night I spent $900 dollars on porn like a fucking idiot. Like I've never ever done that in my life like that's not me at all and I don't know why I did that. \n\nTo me that was the final straw, I was so upset and angry at myself that I tried to kill myself by hanging myself with a belt. It didn't work out which I'm kinda of glad. I've just been sitting in my bedroom crying non stop about everything that's happened.\n\nI've had sucidal thought's before but I've never actually tried to do anything or tried to kill myself. I'm just do embrassed about what I did and what happened. I feel like an absolute idiot.\n\nI don't want to kill myself because of this but I'm so upset and angry at myself that I feel this would make all the pain I'm feeling go away.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/prhai1/i_spent_over_900_on_porn_the_other_day_im_so/", "title": "I spent over $900 on porn the other day.
