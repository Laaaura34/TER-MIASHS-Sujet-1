I have no friends, I'm failing school, I've only ever worked part time jobs, and I'm a loser shut in. I can't even register for classes this fall because I didn't submit my vaccination records in time because I didn't check my emails because I'm lazy and didn't even think of it. I'm already overdue to graduate, my parents are waiting with bated breath completely unaware that I've all but given up with school. I've applied for jobs but I have zero motivation to do fucking anything with myself, I don't care about being successful because I'll probably be miserable and alone anyways. I hate myself, I hate my body, I hate how I'm completely worthless and will never amount to anything but a disappointment to my family, yet I'm still content to just sit on my ass and waste time. I can't even say I put effort into anything because it's straight up not true, I dropped out of classes the moment they became difficult because I was too embarrassed to ask for help, I haven't tried super hard to get a full time job, it's pathetic and I have zero reason to complain but despite the self awareness I can't get myself to try. It feels completely hopeless and it's all my fault.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oze62l/im_a_massive_failure/", "title": "I'm a massive failure", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "maaaelynx", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628279563, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oze62l/im_a_massive_failure/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426963.4478595, "replies_charged": false}
