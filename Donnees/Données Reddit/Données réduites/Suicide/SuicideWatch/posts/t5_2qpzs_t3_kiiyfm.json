I had a treatable illness that they ignored, and it cognitively ruined my development. Research consensus shows that it can inhibit the IQ of untreated people by 20%. I'm a dumbass and struggle to get anything done. I'm riddled with intrusive thoughts and obsessions from my OCD. The only thing that is enjoyable in my life is consuming media/books and the dopamine rush I get from running. Those things are losing their appeal. There's a bottle of cough syrup with opiates in it that I think I'm going to chug soon. I don't even have the solace of being a \"troubled genius\". I'm just a pathetic idiot. Not sure why I'm writing this just wanted to get it out there", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kiiyfm/my_parents_failed_me/", "title": "My parents failed me", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Sad-Restaurant-5144", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1608686608, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kiiyfm/my_parents_failed_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426416.1584852, "replies_charged": false}
