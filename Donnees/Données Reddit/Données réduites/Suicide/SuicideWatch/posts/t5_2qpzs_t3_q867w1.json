It might have had some good moments, here and there, sure. But I just am tired of this drama. I want peace, not war! I want to rest, not stress! I have been trying to hang myself a few times but failed miserably each time, yesterday was the last time I tried. A month ago I underwent a treatment, I lied all I could just to get out. My heart is constantly racing, nothing's fun anymore. My mind just can't stop. I'm harming myself to the point of almost being deaf unconciously. I don't care about life. I want to go away. I'm tired of hearing things that aren't there. I'm tired of sleepless nights. I'm tired of nightmares. I'm tired of being forced to do anything. But no one will understand. All they do for me is to keep me living. I DON'T WANT TO ANYMORE!!! Leave me be. Or I'll make sure, you'll regret it not giving me up peacefully. I suppose it's not easy to clean a body's blood spi\u013aled all over.\n\nAnyway. My rant's over. I don't want to harm anyone. But being alive is just... confusing and torture.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q867w1/im_just_tired/", "title": "I'm just tired.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Pagy01", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634237751, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q867w1/im_just_tired/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635426377.332541, "replies_charged": false}
