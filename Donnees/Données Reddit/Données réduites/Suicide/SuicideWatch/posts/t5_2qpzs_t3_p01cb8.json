He's dating somebody else. I can't take it. This happens to so many people why am I any different? Why is my reaction to kill myself because I feel I can't live without him? Why is he the first thing on my mind when I wake up and the last thing on my mind when I go to sleep? I can't even have good sleep because every dream is about him. I gave my heart, soul, body everything I have to this guy and it wasn't enough. Maybe I am not enough. I just feel worthless and thrown away. Thoughts of us ruminate in my head. Everything. Literally everything reminds me of him and losing him. I have never felt a pain so deep and I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel.
