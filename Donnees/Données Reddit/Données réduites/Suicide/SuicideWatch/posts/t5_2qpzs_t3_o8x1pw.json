And if you're lucky maybe you'll get depressed as well. \n\nAs far as I go, I just don't want to be alive anymore. I'm sick of just surviving, not living. The entire process of getting through another day has become fucking exhausting.  I have decided that I am better off dead. I cannot stand being alive for even one moment for now. \n\nI am tired of people telling me to hold on, to stay positive, telling me it will get better. Believe me, I have tried. ALL OF WHAT THEY SAID. My condition mentally has deteriorated severely over the past year. Even if I don't wake up tomorrow, I wouldn't give a fuck. I am ready to leave this shithole, cause I never belonged here in the first place. **Nobody should try and convince me otherwise, you won't get me to stay alive until I decide it. Do not mourn me, cause I never deserved it.**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o8x1pw/whats_the_point_of_living_anyway/", "title": "What's the point of living anyway?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Sure_Reindeer_1224", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 35, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624800338, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o8x1pw/whats_the_point_of_living_anyway/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426777.3915677, "replies_charged": false}
