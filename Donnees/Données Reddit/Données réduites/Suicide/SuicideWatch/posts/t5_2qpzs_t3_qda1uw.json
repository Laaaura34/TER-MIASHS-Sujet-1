I have been for a good time now. Tried dating a few times after I lost the love of my life and father of my child (he left me- he didn\u2019t die)\u2026 every time it didn\u2019t last very long. At most probably a month? Nobody wanted to actually be in a relationship with me\u2026 they just wanted the idea of me. To say that I was theirs. To post about it and get a bunch of likes and the constant \u201comg you\u2019re so lucky!\u201d. To get that share of internet \u201cfame\u201d (I\u2019m sorta popular? Idk I don\u2019t think I am compared to some people but I get recognised so idk. Maybe. Whatever it\u2019s besides the point.)\n\nI feel like nobody\u2019s ever gonna actually want to date me for just me and I feel like\u2026 idk that I\u2019m not gonna also find someone who\u2019s sexually attracted to me (one of the people I tried to date had a bunch of other issues going on with his life, and\u2026 Idk I felt like I wasn\u2019t good enough constantly because he always rejected my advances for physical affection, even hand holding\u2026. So it made me feel like I wasn\u2019t good enough. But would talk about wanting to fuck strangers at the bar he would go to\u2026 so yeah. Highly insecure now to be with someone because I feel like they\u2019re not gonna be attracted to me and I feel like shit.)\nAnyways. So\u2026 yeah. The other people who dated me didn\u2019t want an actual relationship, and didn\u2019t want to work on issues together that would come up, or they would flip shit about the fact that I still love my ex- not IN LOVE- but I love him as a friend because I care about him and he was my literal best friend- and they literally blocked me on everything and never talked to me again. \nI just\u2026 I want to feel like I\u2019m good enough. I want to be able to relate to someone and have common interests. I can\u2019t find ANYONE anywhere who\u2019s into the same shit as me\u2026 I feel like my one ex was my crowning glory and the literal perfect match. I was just fucking toxic and had too many issues and crap I wasn\u2019t dealing with and I wasn\u2019t being a good person and\u2026 drove him away. To someone else\u2026. And now I\u2019m fucking just\u2026. Fucked. It\u2019s all I think about. It hurts. So much. I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m so sad. All the time. I cry so fucking much and it\u2019s stopped feeling better after. I\u2019m just tired of this cycle. I want something. Anything. Even someone to flirt with that I have feelings for. Something.  \n\n(Also: I\u2019m 27 and autistic with BPD and Bipolar and depression if that helps with the \u201cstory\u201d)\n\nI\u2019m sorry.
