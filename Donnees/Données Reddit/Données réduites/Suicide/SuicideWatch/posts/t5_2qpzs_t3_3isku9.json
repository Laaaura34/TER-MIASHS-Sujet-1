I joined JROTC in high school to try and make some friends, which I did. I graduated high school, and tried to join the military like all my friends did. Denied for medical reasons. While all my friends went off and made great things for themselves, I was stuck back home working at a grocery store. I wanted to kill myself then too. Time went by, I moved states to try and make a change. I couldn't afford rent, and stayed down a little less than a year to come back and move in with my parents. I got a job cleaning rental cars full time to make money, but it wasn't much. I'm about 20 at this point. I hated my life and I decided if by 25 I hadn't met the love of my life or was in a job with a good wage that I would kill myself. Time went on, to make more money I started working at the grocery store I worked at as a teen to make more money as a manager, along with cleaning rental cars. Well, my drinking problem got worse and I got a DUI, which put me on thin ice with my rental car job. So I keep on working those two jobs 60-70 hours a week, while doing 6-7 days a week with both jobs. Then comes April of this year. A buddy of mine told me to sign up for a dating site. I meet a couple girls, but nothing that interests me. Then I meet her. She's my age, similar interests and loads of fun. We hit it off immediately. For the next 3 months, we're inseparable. We don't have sex because she wanted to wait for the right time, which I was happy to do. Then out of nowhere she says she got into a college a couple states over and wants to end our relationship. I'm devastated but can't hold her back, so I agree. We stay apart but still talk everyday. My brother wants me to move down south to where he is, so I ask the girl if I could stop and have lunch since it was along the way, so she says yes. She shows no interest in me, talks about all the guys she wants to fuck, and is completely oblivious to the fact that I'm devastated by this. I walk her to her car, and we hug for a long time and I head on my way. I told her it was nice to see her, no response. So I haven't texted her since. So I made it to my brother's house and he isn't here. Him and his wife left for a wedding and left me to watch the cats. So I'm all alone, and thinking that next month is my 25th  birthday. I will go back home to see my parents, have a nice birthday and take lots of pictures. Then on the way back down, I'll drive off the road to kill myself. It will be easier on everyone if I am gone. I know where I'm not needed, and this earth has no place for me. I'm tired of being the outcast. Can anybody tell me what I should do? Why me? Why can't I get my lucky break? Why shouldn't I die? I guess I'm not in immediate danger to myself, but next month is fast approaching and I'm scared.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3isku9/my_suicide_pact_with_myself/", "title": "My suicide pact with myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "thinkingaboutithurts", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1440808438, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3isku9/my_suicide_pact_with_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427698.4268332, "replies_charged": false}
