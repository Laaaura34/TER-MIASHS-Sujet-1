Good job, healthy(ish) body, good parents who didn't fuck up my upbringing in any way, yet for near 2 years I've spent half my days lying in bed wishing I wouldn't wake up. Dw tho I'm a coward so I absolutely can't end myself unless I know it would be quick and painless. I regret renting my apartment too low, cuz jumping out would only leave me with broken bones  instead of instant relief. \n\nIt troubles me that I feel so shit while being objectively more fortunate than so many ppl - i don't feel like I have the right to feel the way I do. And also rage and depression apparently transform me into a cold-hearted monster - I know full well how much pain my suicide would cause my family (fortunately no friends tho, whatever friends I had I've ghosted for a long time), but I can't get myself to give a shit unless I'm in a relatively good mood\n\nFuuuuck wtf is wrong with me\n\nAnyways to anyone who sat through this rambling, thank you for coming to my Ted talk", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qe8hxf/wtfff_is_wrong_with_me/", "title": "Wtfff is wrong with me", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Careless_Win_2576", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 15, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635007637, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qe8hxf/wtfff_is_wrong_with_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427620.4876199, "replies_charged": false}
