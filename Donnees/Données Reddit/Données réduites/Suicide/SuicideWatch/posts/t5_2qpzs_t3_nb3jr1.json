Whilst there have been many times over the last couple of months that I have considered it, this time around I've tied a belt around my doorframe and 'tested' how long it would roughly take for me to pass out and die.\n\nI've always been obsessed with suicide and morbid things but this particular method feels different. I keep googling how Robin Williams and Kate Spade died, hoping that if I do go through with this that'll be it and I don't fuck up and end up in a hospital bed embarrassing and being a burden to everyone. \n\nAs things progressively get worse I keep 'testing' it every few hours and I feel like its only a matter of time before I get drunk or high enough to pluck up the courage to do it. I don't want to die this way but I don't feel like I have any other choice. How do I break this vicious cycle?\n\nI really could do with anyone responding to this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nb3jr1/i_cant_stop_fixating_on_wanting_to_kill_myself/", "title": "I can't stop fixating on wanting to kill myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "GIVEUPOX17", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1620864843, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nb3jr1/i_cant_stop_fixating_on_wanting_to_kill_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428086.973749, "replies_charged": false}
