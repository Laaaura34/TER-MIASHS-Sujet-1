Let me tell you about my situation. I live with my mom, dad, and my sister. Both my parents are in their forties, and my sister is 8. I am 16 years old. I am a junior in highschool and since my parents (my dad especially) know that this is a crucial year for me, they want me to get all A's. I understand where they come from, and I also want this for myself. I am almost 2/3 done with my fall semester, and my grades are mostly B's, with a couple A's. I try my best in school, but I still end up with average grades. I ask my friends and teachers for help, but I still can't get A's in some of my classes. My dad is worried this will impact my future because of college admissions coming up next year and he makes sure to remind me of it everyday. He drags my mom into these lectures of his, and 3-4 hours go by with him saying the same repetitive things to me (\"Work harder\", \"Stop making excuses\", \"You aren't trying enough\"). He will also curse at me several times and make me feel like shit. He threatens to hit me if I don't start showing improvement and takes away many things from me. I have not met my friends outside of school since the school year started, apart from soccer practice, which he is also taking away from me. My mom pities me, but she can't help me because whenever she tries to say something he shuts her down and threatens to hit her/divorce her. I feel trapped and I have considered suicide many times. This has been going on since I was in 6th grade, and it has only ramped up. He has hit me and my mom before on many occasions, but thankfully he has stopped because of a back injury he had. I don't feel safe at home, I dislike going to school, and I have nowhere else to go. I have nothing to look forward to in my life, and I feel like I am stuck in a loop. I keep thinking that I will go to college in another two years and get away from my dad and hopefully earn enough money to have my mom stay with me. But I don't know if I can live like this for another two years. I have never told anyone I feel suicidal, not even my mom or my closest friends. I feel like my house is always in a state of conflict because of me and I think that killing myself will end the arguing since I am the reason for the arguments.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qg13pz/my_dad_constantly_berates_me_for_everything_i_do/", "title": "My dad constantly berates me for everything I do and lectures me for hours at a time over my grades and my life in general.
