And I just don't want to participate in this world anymore. \n\nFor 5 weeks I have been at home, eating into my savings, my rent is expensive, and in a week I will be out of money. I have had many interviews over a month, Covid has destroyed the hospitality industry and thousands of people are out of work, and I just don't have what it takes to continue. \n\nI just really want to throw my hands up and say \"This is it\" my life has no meaning, no children. My best friend is my cat Odin. \n\nThe struggle in this modern world is too much for me, and I don't want to be a part-of it anymore, and to spare my family and my love from seeing me become essentially homeless and bankrupt I don't think I have many other options. \n\nI keep applying for work, and so does everyone else, and its a lottery who gets in.  I wonder how long I will have a roof over my head, the bills pile up. The struggle is real. \n\nThe worst part is knowing I am weak, that others cope with much worse.  Maybe I was just not meant for this time. I should have lived a few hundred years ago. I don't feel like this world is meant for me anymore.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jiw5uo/the_slow_self_destruction_of_my_life/", "title": "The slow self destruction of my life.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Comprehensive_Soil_1", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1603780667, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jiw5uo/the_slow_self_destruction_of_my_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422533.2744129, "replies_charged": false}
