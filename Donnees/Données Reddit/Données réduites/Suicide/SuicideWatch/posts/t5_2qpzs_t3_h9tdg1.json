I\u2019ve heard about how police interact with the mentally ill, especially with suicidal people. I don\u2019t want to be thrown in some sort of mental hospital and I don\u2019t want the police to kill me, simply because I\u2019m talking about my feelings. Whenever I bring up suicidal thoughts with my therapist it feels like I\u2019m walking on egg shells because at any minute she can just decide that I\u2019m crazy and lock me up. It\u2019s almost like she thinks I\u2019m going to die whilst we speak.\n\nI\u2019ve tried hotlines before when feeling upset, but I usually get so choked up that I can\u2019t even explain how I\u2019m feeling, and since I\u2019m not saying anything, the people on the other end almost make me feel like I\u2019m wasting their time, in a way? But, I\u2019ve tried crisis textlines before and they\u2019ve been really helpful. Only problem is that they\u2019re really expensive to continuously send messages, or they threaten to call the police. When I say threaten to call the police, I don\u2019t mean to me directly. Just in their rules and regulations.\n\nIs there any crisis textlines or any sort of medium like that that I could use for free, without fear of cops treating me like a criminal? I\u2019m not going to limit this to a certain location, because I sort of want as many as possible. Plus I don\u2019t want anyone from where I\u2019m from to find this and use it against me. I\u2019ve had a similar experience beforehand where people exposed my posts where I talked about suicide, depression and anxiety to certain people, and those people threatened to send me to a mental hospital.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/h9tdg1/crisis_textlines_that_wont_alert_police_whilst/", "title": "Crisis textlines that won\u2019t alert police whilst mentioning suicide?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "cameheretomake1post", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1592270028, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/h9tdg1/crisis_textlines_that_wont_alert_police_whilst/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426152.7860527, "replies_charged": false}
