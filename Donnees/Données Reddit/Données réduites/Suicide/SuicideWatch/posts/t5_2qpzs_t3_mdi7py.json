I am in a very difficult place mentally and emotionally and dont know what to do. I am in my second semester of my freshman year of college and am really struggling. I am supposed to be pre-dental but dont have the motivation what so ever to complete my science courses. My dad is a dentist and, for lack of words, believes that any career other than dentistry/ owning your own business will leave me poor and financially stressed. My whole like he has put constant pressure on my to be an extremely successful person like him. I want to pursue a career in art education but he thinks it is a shit career that wont get me anywhere in life. Last semester I was doing really well and got a 4.0. This semester i have dropped almost all of my science courses and am failing my chem lecture and lab that still am in. I absolutely love my ceramics course that I am taking and love it so much that I am building my own ceramics studio at my house. I was really happy and motivated last week, till tonight when my dad found out that I want to switch my major to art. He lectured me for three hours about how I am a failure for not keeping up with my classes. I have had suicidal thoughts all semester but they are extremely bad at the moment. I dont know what the point of life is anymore and dont care about myself. I wish i could die and make all of the stress and pain go away. I am too scared to kill myself but I know I could build up the courage to do so eventually. I know that people would be sad if i died, but i dont care since i would be dead and wouldnt have to think about their feelings. I have suffered from anorexia in the past and currently am choosing not to eat anything so I can be admitted to a inpatient program to give me a break from everything. Tonight starts day one of my food strike. This might be extremely selfish but i dont know what else to do at this point. I know that people will respond by saying that you dont have to decide your career right now but I dont want to take science courses what so ever while I wait out the period of not knowing my career.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mdi7py/college_and_career_choice_is_making_me_suicidal/", "title": "College and career choice is making me suicidal", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "jewelertemporary7505", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616739438, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mdi7py/college_and_career_choice_is_making_me_suicidal/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422277.5612254, "replies_charged": false}
