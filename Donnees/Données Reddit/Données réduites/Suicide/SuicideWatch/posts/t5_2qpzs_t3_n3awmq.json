Yet I still feel miserable and want to die. I don\u2019t want to hurt them. I don\u2019t want them to be sad and mourn me. My closest friend is my like my go to person. Me and her are super close and I\u2019m pretty much her only friend. I don\u2019t want her to feel alone when I\u2019m no longer here. We have so many plans for the future together but I just don\u2019t think I can hold on that long. And then there\u2019s my family. My parents would be heart broken. I\u2019m their only kid that\u2019s still local so we see each other often. Who\u2019s gonna help them use the computer or look up things online? I\u2019m suppose to help them get life insurance and prep for their funerals, they\u2019re not supposed to be burying me. \n\nI love the people in my life, but unfortunately I\u2019ve gotten to the point that they\u2019re not enough to keep me here anymore. I hate to say that but it\u2019s the honest truth.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n3awmq/i_have_such_great_people_in_my_life_and_yet_i/", "title": "I have such great people in my life and yet I still wanna die", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "curiousaf_tm", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619975281, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n3awmq/i_have_such_great_people_in_my_life_and_yet_i/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426791.212909, "replies_charged": false}
