I can't quite come to any conclusion what sort of method is best. I don't like the idea of an overly painful or messy end, but there it is.\n\nI'm not sure why. I just turned 27. I'm active, healthy, have a good job, decent looks. I keep my apartment immaculate, dress well. I even take my vitamins and try to sleep well, lol. \n\nOver the past year I've slowly begun to alienate myself from people, including my family, even my older sister. Just a few days ago my friend died from an overdose of medication (he was a workaholic). I wrote a goodbye to him today, and I realized how easy it is to die. He was a seriously beautiful person. I'm curious what medication he used. \n\nI think the only reason I haven't done it yet is because it's kind of shameful giving up. Does anyone here relate to this sort of story? Anyone made a suicide pact? \n\nThere are quite a few posts here. If no one reads this, at least I put it out there. :) \n\n ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3w6xnx/calmy_thinking_of_suicide/", "title": "Calmy thinking of suicide", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Brightwing33", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1449731769, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3w6xnx/calmy_thinking_of_suicide/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427736.6464508, "replies_charged": false}
