This is on a new reddit because I don't want my identity discovered due to military service and where I'm at in my life now.\n\nDidn't realize I was going to type a whole friggin book but here it is. A small piece of my story. I've never told all of it to anyone. Only pieces here and there, people usually think I'm joking. The story ends on a positive note. I don't know who needs to hear this, but if there's one person out there who reads my story and how I beat this crap and decides to live another minute, I'll consider this a success.\n\nHere we go.\n\nMy depression started pretty young. I didn't know what it was at the time, but looking back I know now I was depressed. I was 9. I started feeling sad all the time. I felt unliked, unloved, unwanted, like I had no worth or purpose. I cried every night. I couldn't sleep at all. My older brother was starting to use drugs at this time and my parents were only concerned about him (as was I) and his drug addiction until he was old enough to get kicked out.\n\nOver some time the dramatic and painful sadness I felt every day faded away, into something I'd call a heavier/colder/numb feeling. I lived in a blur, barely absorbing anything around me. I was fading away in school, friends, everything. I went from gifted & talented A/B student to failing. I cared for nothing. I didn't cry. I didn't feel anything but cold and numbness. \\*\\*GRAPHIC SELF HARM AHEAD\\*\\*   \nI started cutting my upper thighs during this time. (The only place I ever cut) The simple reason for why is because I wanted to feel something. Pain was a real feeling. It told me I was still alive, and was enjoyable to me. It was the strongest release of self hate for me. It showed what I was feeling inside on the outside. I cut deeper and deeper. I cut every day, over the same cuts, more and more. I moved to bigger hunting knives and learned to sharpen them razor sharp. It was part of my evening bedtime ritual. Take a bath, cut myself, relax in the blood, go to bed. I started spraying chemicals like bleach and industrial cleaners on the cuts. Rubbing salt into the cuts. Strong acids. I tried to get them infected using dirt and rusty blades. The more pain the better.\n\nIt got progressively worse.\n\nFinally, when I was 12 I tried to kill myself the first time.\n\nI sat in my room, listening to black metal, and sharpened my knife. I ate a handful of sleeping pills and chugged them down with wine and got in a tub full of water and as I had many nights before, started cutting. I cut as deep and as much as I could. The water turned bright and then dark red, I laid back, and faded away. I don't know how long I slept. But I woke up extremely cold. I thought I was dead, but quickly realized I wasn't. As in life, I'd failed in dying.\n\nI continued day to day life, switched to online school, and ghosted everybody I knew except a couple people I thought were closest to me. I was too numb and callous to make any sort of new connection.\n\nMy 2nd attempt, probably short of 13.\n\nBecause cutting had failed, I thought I'd try hanging.\n\nSo I took my belt, tied it to the top pole of my loft bed, stood on a chair, leaned into it to test that it'd hold, then pushed my chair away. It instantly cut into my neck and I started bleeding, I kicked around for a bit, and passed out pretty quick. But again, I woke up.\n\nFlat on my face, with a snapped buckle next to me. I actually laughed at that one, I thought it was hilarious at the time that I was apparently incapable of dying. I just wore stuff around my neck for a while to hide the bruises and cuts.\n\nI started trying to reach out for help after that. For years, I'd told my best friend much of my struggles and we talked through a lot of it. One particularly difficult day, I told her I wanted to seriously kill myself that day. She said \"You want to die, go for it.\" I'll never forget the crushing feeling when I read the message. My most trusted and loved friend, didn't care if I was gone. Now that I knew I had not a single person to give a shit, in my mind at the time I had free reign to finally make sure I died. I started preparing immediately.\n\nI went to our medicine cabinet, took out every single bottle of pills. I read all the side effects. Every one that had death as a possible side effect, I set aside. When I was done, I had maybe 8 bottles of pills. I found some anti-nausea medicine, and grabbed that too so I didn't puke. I drained all of them, hundreds of pills, into a glass of water as that'd be the fastest way to take that many pills. In hindsight, a horrible idea. It was a brownish/pinkish(pinkish is important) pill slushie. The nasty taste you get when a pill sits on your tongue too long, multiply that by a thousand, and like drinking down rough sand. It took every ounce of willpower I had to put that drink down. I finished it, and went to the computer, put on my heaviest DSBM  (depressive suicidal black metal, check it out. Ofdrykkja, Coldworld, Lifelover, Xasthur, Psychonaut 4, Wedard), and paced around the basement waiting to die. My guts started lurching pretty quick. I got tremors all throughout my body within the hour. What people don't tell you about ODing to die, it's not easy. You don't just \"go to sleep\". I've broken 13 bones in my life, been burned by acid, among other very painful things. Overdosing topped all of them by 10 in terms of pain. It felt like an 18 wheeler was going forward over my stomach, then back, then forward, over and over. I wanted to scream. Then things started getting crazy.\n\nI started to see shit. I thought I was finally dying and was elated.\n\nThe room began to warp around me, I got weaker and weaker, and got hit by one final agonizing gut slam that torqued my whole body and drifted into black.\n\nNow bare with me, this shit sounds like bullshit but I promise you every bit of it happened. I'm not religious at all now, and wasn't then. There's also a scientific reason for what I saw (Has to do with the PINK bit of my pill cocktail). If you don't want to read a hell story, just skip down to the TL;DR, it's pretty jacked up and still messes with me and my dreams to this day (It's been over 10 years)\n\nI was falling into a pit at extreme speeds, smashing off the walls and scraping my way down, and I could feel every bit of it. After an insane amount of falling and banging off rock walls, I hit the bottom. Plopped right into a pool of oily thick liquid. Maybe knee high. My legs, cracked. My back, cracked. Everything, broken. I dragged myself forward in the solid black darkness, this thick goop tugging at me. All around, pained groaning. I could feel that I was in a vast chamber or cavern. The air was heavy, rancid, overall just dank. It was lukewarm. All sounds echoed off the far ends of the chamber. I didn't say a word but I heard soft sobbing, murmurs for help, people speaking other languages softly.\n\nI waded towards what sounded to be the nearest wall, pulling along rocks with my reasonably intact arms. I hit a distinctly brick shore, dragged myself up and propped against the wall. I could hear more people landing in the pool at different points throughout the cavern.\n\nSuddenly, a light shone through the dark. With the newfound visibility, I gazed on a vast black lake. Maybe a half mile in any direction. The light came as a small slit on the floor and got taller and taller into the shape of a door at the far opposite end of the cavern. There were thousands of people in the black lake, sitting or flopping. A figure appeared at the door, clearly massive given the distance and in comparison to the surroundings. It came barging out, I could make the shape of a trident in it's hand, and without a few seconds passing by; it started stabbing people. Skewering them on it's spear one by one, leaping forward in great bounds and impaling. Everybody was too broken to do anything. They cried out in agony and terror. People started piling towards me immediately. More figures came out of the light, also with an assortment of spears and weaponry. It was a slaughter. They practically glided through the lake, moving with ease, collecting the broken bodies and tucking them at their sides when their polearms were too packed of human shishkebab. They reached my end of the cavern in moments, swiping up the people climbing onto the shore, then this 12 foot tall demon grabbed me by the head and dragged my back to the door. Within 30 feet of the door you could feel the heat. It smelt and felt kind of like a fire that you thought was out, but the next morning you go and poke it with a stick and find hot embers still burning in the middle, and a breeze blows the heat in your face.\n\nI was dragged like a doll through a winding passage lit by torches. The screams tapered off. The walls and floor were smattered with blood and gore. Exposed organs quickly found themselves snagged on the torches as we passed through the halls. Entrails snagged and pulling out, then when the tension hits and all the slack catches up, a violent ripping and slingshot. Finally, we came to another chamber, this one adorned in massive carved bones from these very same creatures, and incredible engravings on golden brickwork. The chamber was rectangular, and about a football field in length and width. Here the demons stood in line, counting their kills to one another in a strange language and laughing at our plight. There was a great deal of commotion at the front of line. When we reached the front, I saw why. Here he stood, wearing huge plates made of stone across his body, deeply carved, 4 foot horns spiking off his head, charred skin, incredible musculature, 20 feet in height, leverman. To his left, our line, to his right, another hole with a very hot glow emitting from it. Several chains hung over the hole, and at the crank of a lever, the chains dropped and swung away, screams following it. When the lever cocked back, more chains emerged to replace. The gatekeeper grabbed me, stuck a hook through my body, and stuck me on the chain. He did the same to several others, hit the lever, and I started falling into the blaze IGNITING and THAT is when I woke up.\n\n\\*\\*\\*TLDR\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI wake up from hell. On my couch in the early morning sunlight beaming through the window wells (fire escapes for basements), I was positive I was dead and had just passed through into hell, and this was going to be a torture of some kind in my own reality. I looked down and felt completely disassociated from my body. After a few moments of this interesting state, I got a lurch like you wouldn't believe. My stomach told me I was not dead, but I probably would be some time soon. I crawled to the bathroom, my body the weakest I've ever felt it. I hurled half digested pills up (apparently I hadn't mixed my concoction too well) and barely had the strength to heave. But heave I did for about an hour, then lay on the ground. I heard my dad call and say breakfast is ready. I actually managed to make it to the table upstairs, sat and ate some eggs. He said I looked like shit and said I needed to mow the lawn, so I did. I'll tell ya what boyo. Mowing a huge ass lawn uphill while half dead with a push mower in 90 degree heat was pretty hard. I threw up a few times along the way. My parents didn't realize until that night that half the pill bottles were gone and asked me about it like I'd been trying to get high or something like my brother. But nope, I said I was just trying to die and of course they were shocked and heartbroken. They took me to church. That's it. No therapy, no hospital, just church lmao. I did hang out with the pastor and he was a pretty cool guy but I didn't have any sort religion in me but he was very kind and didn't seem to mind that at all. My body felt like absolute shit for the next week. I could barely function at all. My mind was scrambled. My insides ached. I didn't get back to normal physically for months. My mind took even longer.\n\nNow earlier, I said the pinkish/brownish mix was important.\n\nHere's why.\n\nI took BENADRYL. Pink fucking pills. Between 70-100 25mg capsules. I weighed no more than 110 at the time. (Skinny and I didn't eat hardly at all) If you didn't know, in quantity, they make you see shit because they have diphenhydramine in them. So I was tripping MEGA BALLS. You can take like 8 of those 25mg pills and trip whole conversations with people that aren't even actually there. So it's no wonder I went to hell listening to black metal and taking enough to die off just that shit alone.\n\nIf miracles or tragedy were real, my life would be both. A tragedy because I wanted death and couldn't die. A miracle because my body is intact after the abuse I put it through and I survived 3 serious attempts at death. But especially my liver because not only did I drink like hell, but those pills were enough to crush any liver. I never went to a doctor for it, but given I've never had issues I assume it recovered just fine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell everybody, I don't self harm anymore. I never tried to die again after that, I kinda figured if I couldn't die after trying that hard there was no point. Served me well.\n\nAm I better now, 10+ years later? Yes. My brain randomly still says \"kill yourself\" throughout the day. But I experience all the regular joys of life, I got married (got cheated on/lied too/hit often/stabbed/threatened with MURDER lmao, we're not together anymore & different story) and I have 2 kids now so I have good reasons to stay living. I have great friends and support network. My family is all good. I love my parents. I joined the Marines and did 4 years and make great money now (You can hide scars and medical stuff pretty easy. Full disclosure I told my recruiter I was crazy as a young teen and tried to kill myself and cut myself like a madman, he said he had faith that I'm better lol). I have lots of hobbies! This one is huge. Hobbies will SAVE your life. I'm not talking about building model planes here (unless you're into that).  \nFor me, I love playing/modding video games. I shoot guns, work on them, enjoy them. I build computers for friends and myself. I read IFLscience every day. I read books. I do house and yard work. I work on my car, modding/cleaning. The more to keep you busy, the BETTER. I find that when I'm idle, my mind wanders to the dark crap. So I stay busy and focused  most of the time on life and the moment and it works wonders. There was a time when waiting for the release of Skyrim was one of the only things keeping me from ending it, and I'm not ashamed of that at all.\n\nOverall, I'd say I'm vastly better and a more successful functioning adult now and can experience joy, love, happiness, and not just negatives. My depression is still there, just put away where I can laugh at and mock it sometimes when it tries to come out and pull me down.\n\nKeep your chin up and accept whatever darkness is in you. First step to kicking it. I realized I couldn't get rid of the darkness completely a long time ago, but for many of you, you can overcome these challenges completely with time and effort. I believe I'll likely live with \"kill yourself\" in my head the rest of my life. But that's okay, and I just laugh about it now. But seriously try every option before you take the most drastic one. Talk to friends, family, your parents even if you hate them. Get real help, if nobody will help you get to real professional help, you have to get it yourself which can be hard I know, I've been there. When something really really rough happens to you, don't just fall into the pit. Take a long moment. Breathe. Process it all. Accept it. Move on. Get outside, get fresh air, exercise, do what you love doing, all of these things will help, and with a plan you can move past it and kick suicide in the stupid face. Or at the very least, cope long enough to learn how to manage it, which sounds sucky, but it's not. I promise.\n\nGood luck, and whoever you are, you are loved.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fbsf4o/my_storyends_on_a_positive_note/", "title": "My Story-Ends on a Positive Note", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Roktis", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1583059395, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fbsf4o/my_storyends_on_a_positive_note/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422328.9587054, "replies_charged": false}
