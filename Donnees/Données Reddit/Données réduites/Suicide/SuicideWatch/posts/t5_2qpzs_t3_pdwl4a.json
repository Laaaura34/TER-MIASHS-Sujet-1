I want to sleep forever. \n\nI'm sick of being ugly. I'm sick of being lonely, no friends or partner. I'm sick of struggling everyday. I'm sick of getting paid only 300 dollars that can't afford me shit. I'm sick of being the \"unaccomplished\" child. I'm sick of my life. Im sick of corona. I'm sick of studying my ass off at uni knowing I'll probably never get a job. I'm sick of seeing myself in the mirror. \n\nI'm sick of living and its only a matter of time before I kill myself. No one cares. I'm alone and lonely.
