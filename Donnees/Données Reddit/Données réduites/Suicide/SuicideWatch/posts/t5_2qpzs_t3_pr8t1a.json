I am only 16 years old and not only have I made life harder for my family, they have made it hard for me too. I don't know exactly why I want to kill myself, but it's a combination of a few things. And one of those is that I hate myself sooooo much. I had big dreams, wanted to be the greatest footballer of all time but during these past few days, everything just seems so pointless. And it's not like I have anybody to talk about these issues with. I look forward to not existing, just nothingness, and I really hope that there is no hell cause definitely don't want to spend an eternity there. Anyways, this will probably be the last post of mine unless I change my mind tomorrow.
