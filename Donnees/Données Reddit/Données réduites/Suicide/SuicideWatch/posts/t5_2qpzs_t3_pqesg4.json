I\u2019m having some of the worst anxiety I\u2019ve ever experienced after doing this and I think it\u2019s my body telling me to come clean. I have no idea how to tell him. \n\nI want to give him a huge explanation but I tend to get caught up in the details and end up loosing focus on whatever I was trying to communicate. \n\nHis sister (19) passed away this year from a heroine addiction, but he speculates about suicidal intentions often. This is one of the reasons why I feel so terrible about this. First of all, I feel selfish for almost inflicting another tremendous loss and, secondly, I attempted with the drug that took his sister\u2019s life. \n\nI texted a man I haven\u2019t seen in almost two years and asked him to bring me the supplies and he came quickly. When he got here I did an amount that I thought would get the job done but I just ended up getting knocked out. I\u2019m not really sure of everything that happened after that. I vaguely just remember him saying he has to leave and then I think I remember seeing the door close behind him. \n\nMy bf is not a very trusting person and he\u2019s had issues trusting me in the past when it comes to cheating and being cheated on. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that he\u2019s going to leave me because he thinks I cheated on him. \n\nI know I have to tell him because he\u2019s probably the one person on the planet that I\u2019ve ever been completely honest to but I have no idea where to even start. If I mention that I didn\u2019t cheat then I think he\u2019ll be even more suspicious. I know the more important thing is that I\u2019m honest about my attempt but he\u2019s one of the only things keeping me on this earth at the moment and I don\u2019t want to risk losing him. I suppose that sounds selfish but I\u2019m also scared to tell him because of the pain it will cause him. Like I said, his sister passed this year and they were very close and I can\u2019t bear to tell him that I nearly caused him more pain. \n\nPlease help me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pqesg4/how_do_i_tell_my_bf_that_i_attempted_while_he_was/", "title": "How do I tell my bf that I attempted while he was on a trip?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "This_End_3356", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631935185, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pqesg4/how_do_i_tell_my_bf_that_i_attempted_while_he_was/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427940.215221, "replies_charged": false}
