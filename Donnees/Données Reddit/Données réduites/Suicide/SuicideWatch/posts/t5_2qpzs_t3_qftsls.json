For 2 years, I developed this unhealthy obsession with a celebrity athlete. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her all day and I wouldn\u2019t eat or sleep. I would just look up any content I could find about her all day. I was distracted from work and quite frankly from life. I would cry at night not having her next to me. I\u2019d research her for hours.\n\nI built up the balls to discuss this with my therapist (not currently in therapy) and psychiatrist. I was able to let her go.\n\nThe last time I \u201cgoogled\u201d her was last June.\n\nToday I relapsed and looked her back up online and the obsessive thoughts are back full force. I don\u2019t know why I did this to myself.\n\nI\u2019ve been crying for hours and can\u2019t shake it off. I see her on Instagram with her girlfriend and I just want to jump off a bridge.\n\nWe live on different continents. Chances are I\u2019ll never meet her.\n\nKnowing that hurts. \n\nEven if I do meet her, she wouldn\u2019t want me in that way.\n\nKnowing that makes me want to die.\n\nNone of this is her fault or problem but at the moment I feel like out of my mind and can\u2019t shake this off.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to live for.\n\nI\u2019m in too much pain. Not just Over her but everything.\n\nThis cycle of being depressed and obsessed. I\u2019m tired of living.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qftsls/i_relapsed_today/", "title": "I relapsed today.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "loneleelesbian", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 15, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635206124, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qftsls/i_relapsed_today/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428087.3973987, "replies_charged": false}
