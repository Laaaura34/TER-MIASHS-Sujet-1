Because I was depressed after the divorce, family called a suicide hotline who wrote some generic/untrue bullshit they used to have me committed to an asylum (never done a drug in my life for example).  As a result of the commitment, family and I parted ways.  Ultimately lost my job and career (government, commitment is fireable offense, was great money, could've stayed till retirement) and my only real friends who were coworkers, many who were closer than my family.  Spent the last year unemployed, living off savings which will be gone in a few weeks.  No friends or family left, massive anxiety/ptsd about the asylum/lockup nightmare in addition to deep depression that I've had for decades.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnly thing that gives me pause at this point is that it could be months before my body is found which makes me sad and grosses me out for some reason.  Ultimately it's coming though as I have no money and no real recourse left to improve my situation.  Been through therapy/medication countless times with no benefit.  A little afraid of what I'll feel and think in the last moments after the bang, but I imagine that's not uncommon.  I worked so hard my whole life to have people I don't even know throw away my life for nothing that I still have trouble believing it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, that's my rant.  Thanks to anyone who might read for making me feel like someone understood a little bit.  Hope you all end up in a better situation and with happiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  FWIW, I just wanted to say thanks for all the responses; it's the most compassion I've felt in some years.  I really appreciate your time and your experiences.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ls3tb3/couple_weeks_money_left_then_checking_out/", "title": "Couple weeks money left, then checking out", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "omwo444", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 154, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614249751, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ls3tb3/couple_weeks_money_left_then_checking_out/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423043.4379442, "replies_charged": false}
