And because this indecisiveness i thought not leave anything at all, i guess everything it doesn\u2019t really matter that much right?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cnscwc/should_i_leave_a_note_for_my_family_or_not/", "title": "Should i leave a note for my family or not", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "yesstoday", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1565299793, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cnscwc/should_i_leave_a_note_for_my_family_or_not/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426687.2838013, "replies_charged": false}
