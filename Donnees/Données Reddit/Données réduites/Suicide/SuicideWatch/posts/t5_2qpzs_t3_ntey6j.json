I truly don\u2019t know what I would benefit from. But at this point in time, I think about ending my life numerous times a day, I have plans to do so, and I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nI have BPD and my thinking is exclusively black and white and it\u2019s been this way for so long I feel hopeless about trying to correct it. I lash out at people I love on a daily basis and I don\u2019t know why anyone even tolerates me anymore. \n\nWhat the fuck am I supposed to do? Why is life so difficult? Why does getting help seem so hopeless?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ntey6j/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/", "title": "I don\u2019t know what to do anymore", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "gawjuuz", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622959103, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ntey6j/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427128.20832, "replies_charged": false}
