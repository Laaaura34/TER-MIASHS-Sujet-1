I see people laugh, and smile, and seem so genuinely happy and enjoying life, and to me it\u2019s just so bizarre. I can\u2019t even seem to recall what that actually feels like. I can\u2019t help but be so envious about it. And how I keep trying to reach for a taste of it, and only pull back sadness, or raw apathy.\n\nI\u2019m trying so hard. I really am. I do my best to follow my doctors\u2019 and therapist\u2019s advice. I always try to push through my wretched life each and every day. But I just can\u2019t find anything. I can\u2019t find any enjoyment in any task or hobby. I can\u2019t find motivation to follow up on anything remotely interesting or important. I can\u2019t find a way to fill this gaping maw of loneliness in my heart, or to even feel like more than just a reject of a human being.\n\nI almost killed myself a couple weeks ago. The pain was just too much. I was going to just stab myself endlessly with a knife, until I couldn\u2019t feel anymore. If my family wasn\u2019t present at the time to calm me out of it, I probably would be in a grave by now. I want to keep going, to keep hoping in the future. But a part of me is disgusted at myself for cowering out of it. For choosing to continue to stay in this nightmare, rather than freeing myself for good.\n\nI\u2019m trying so hard. But I\u2019m so tired of trying.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qb9cm8/is_this_what_it_feels_like_to_be_completely_dead/", "title": "Is this what it feels like to be completely dead inside?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TheOverlordCrono", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634642259, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qb9cm8/is_this_what_it_feels_like_to_be_completely_dead/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425427.2875285, "replies_charged": false}
