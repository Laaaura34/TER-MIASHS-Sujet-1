Its late, it is what I can only assume is an incredibly busy time of year and its the Chat option. All of those factors likely don't add up to me seeing much in the way of help quickly... But still... I feel like the organization should be afforded better resources. \n\nAnd for what its worth, I know I could call and likely receive help faster... But I won't for two reasons.\n\n1. I don't want to be heard. I am in a crowded house for the holidays. A phone call at this juncture would draw attention.\n\n2. When talking I can never say what I really mean. Its just easier for me to type it all out. Less stressful that way.\n\nAnyway... Not really sure what I am getting at here... Just a venting sort of thing I suppose.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kgopzw/i_have_been_in_the_chat_queue_on_the_suicide/", "title": "I have been in the chat queue on the suicide prevention lifeline for nearly an hour.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AnAccountForFrens", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1608443557, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kgopzw/i_have_been_in_the_chat_queue_on_the_suicide/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427855.2444272, "replies_charged": false}
