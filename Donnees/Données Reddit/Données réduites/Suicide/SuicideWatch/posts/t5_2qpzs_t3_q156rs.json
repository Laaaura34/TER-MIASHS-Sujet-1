I only applied to one place because I didn\u2019t care. I just wanted to leave home. So I just found myself going through the motions but all the while I wanted to die. Just floating through.\n\nThe city I\u2019m in has a bridge that spans the Mississippi. At the time I thought about walking on that bridge and jumping off. I had no car. An Uber probably wouldn\u2019t let me get out up there. Scared of heights too. I put it off.\n\nFound myself in a toxic relationship. I was emotionally abused. Manipulated. Cheated on. Not the best thing for an already suicidal person to go through. One night it became too much. Couldn\u2019t Uber to the bridge so I Ubered to the hospital. \n\nA few years later I\u2019m still in college. I have a car. Way less friends. Way less hope. I think maybe I could drive up there myself. Park. Jump. But I put it off. Kept on floating.\n\nFound a new bf and he has kept me anchored to this world. Don\u2019t know how long that will last but I\u2019ll cross that bridge when I get to it I guess.\n\nRecently something fucked my head up tho. I don\u2019t know how I even feel about it. A girl who went to the college I went to drove her car on that same bridge. Parked. Jumped. Then floated down the Mississippi.\n\nEverybody assumed it was homicide. They blamed her bf and all but I knew. I had the same exact plan so I knew. \n\nI feel like the news of this should have made me want to live but it didn\u2019t. Seeing her family and friends mourn her should have made me feel SOMETHING. But nope. I realized I would still do that shit. And that\u2019s very fucked up. Even after seeing the aftermath, I would still do that shit. \n\nI could either be floating through life or floating down that river. Right now it\u2019s hard for me to see much of a difference.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q156rs/identical_suicide_plans/", "title": "Identical suicide plans", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ButterscotchAnxious7", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633353225, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q156rs/identical_suicide_plans/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426738.4855447, "replies_charged": false}
