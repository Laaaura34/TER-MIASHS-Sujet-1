After letting a friend know what I had done, she called my dad who immediately called the emergency services. I was taken to the hospital and was hooked up to all sorts of things and had my stomach cleaned while conscious, it was extremely painful and I'll never forget a single second of it. My mom revealed to me that the nurse had told her I had a little less than 10 minutes before it was too late to save me recently, and it shocked me. I'm still depressed, still going through a lot of struggles, but I'm deeply thankful I'm alive.\n\nTo anyone who's considering ending their lives, who's also reading this: Please, don't do it. You will regret it. You can get better. Please take good care of yourself and believe you can improve.\n\nSending you all love and best wishes.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pad4cy/one_month_after_my_suicide_attempt/", "title": "One month after my suicide attempt", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Codename_Striker", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629767227, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pad4cy/one_month_after_my_suicide_attempt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428537.818108, "replies_charged": false}
