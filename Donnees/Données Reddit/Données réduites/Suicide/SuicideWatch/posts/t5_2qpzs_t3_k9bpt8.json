I\u2019m not going to do anything. I told my husband and he is freaking out and acting crazy.  He says I\u2019m an abusive person. He deserves better.  He really does. Poor him marrying me... why would he do that?  Honestly he is quite the perfect catch and I still don\u2019t know why he ever married me.\n\nNo one knows I\u2019ve been suffering for 25 years.
