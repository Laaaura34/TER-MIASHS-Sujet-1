It is there but I've nor yet succumbed to that omnipresent shadowy friend.\n\nI've never actually attempted because I'm scared of failing and becoming worse off AND I'm scared of divine judgment if I succede. \n\nIn more recent years I have contemplated venturing out into the wilderness without food and water in order to simply disappear without any fuss or mess and without subjecting my family to discovering me.\n\nI see the posts on here and on other subreddits and I wish I had an answer. I read them and I fell them. I want to say, \"me too.\" But that's all I am able to say. I relate to your words and share your pain... But I am powerless to help and that saddens me. \n\nIts not all bad. I find distractions. Somehow I manage. I don't know how sometimes, but I do. If anyone wants to talk, I am here. Like I say, I don't have answers but maybe I can distract you for a bit?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q7924s/chronic_suicidal_ideation_for_20_years/", "title": "Chronic suicidal ideation for 20 years.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Interesting_Job209", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634124280, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q7924s/chronic_suicidal_ideation_for_20_years/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427197.8246443, "replies_charged": false}
