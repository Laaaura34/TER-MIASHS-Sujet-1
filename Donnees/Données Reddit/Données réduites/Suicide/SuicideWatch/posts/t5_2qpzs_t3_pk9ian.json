It\u2019d make things so much easier, wouldn\u2019t it. If they understood what goes on in my head because of my depression and suicidal ideations and possible schizophrenia and anxiety and self injurious tendencies and anorexia and so on.. I just wish they cared that much..maybe they do but they\u2019re busy? I don\u2019t know. It feels awfully one sided.. they want me to get better but don\u2019t bother to understand why I\u2019m not okay in the first place.
