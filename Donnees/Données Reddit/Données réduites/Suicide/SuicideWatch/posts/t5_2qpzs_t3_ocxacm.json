Felt like a dream. Admitted my feelings. She didn't realise I had intense feelimgs all these years which is understandable since she has had multiple boyfriends in that time. She did it as a *favour* but it sucks when you do someone a *favour* and it turns extremely emotionally. She hasn't left my head in 4 years and I compare every single other girl who approaches me to her and do nor want their love or nothing. Only hers. But its getting harder, to not tell her brother who i was supposed to be visiting and I ruined my close close relationship with her. It was just starting to get into the *friends with benefits* stage and I fucked everything up. However ive decided im ending my life as soon as I return home and not write a single letter. I feel defeated and my emotions are everywhere. It's okay tho. Ive been considering suicide for around 2 years now but I now know I can never truly get the girl I wanted all my life and am deciding to eliminate me from the picture. That way I know the problems removed from her life. Ive only told her ive attempted suicide 6 months ago on pills but only took 3/4ths of the lethal dose required because i was afraid. I know regret not doing it then.
