It's both watching a stranger and myself do these actions.\n\nWell where to begin?  The big catalysts were breaking up with my girlfriend of 3 years and being laid off from my job within two months.\n\nI spiraled pretty quickly out of control.  I bought crystal meth from a friend and started doing it almost every day as I survived on unemployment checks.  I got little jobs here and there as I was a web designer, there was always a bit of work for me.\n\nI went to all night coffee shops and wrote and obsessed about my ex.  I was brutally and hopelessly depressed.\n\nI drank.  I started smoking.  This is coming from a guy who was the picture of health.  I used to run, go to the gym, eat healthy.  I didn't think this lifestyle was having an effect on me.  Later I would hear from my sister that when she saw me for the first time during this period of my life, she thought I looked like a skeleton.\n\nI started going to therapy.  After crystal meth though I did get hooked on pain pills I stole from my roommate at the time.  But eventually those ran out and I had no choice but to become somewhat sober.\n\nMy therapist meant well but I lied to her, trying to be the person she wanted me to be.  I did get a job and felt like I was getting better.\n\nWhat set me off next was seeing my ex after a few years.  Seeing the house that she bought.  The house she was living in with her new boyfriend.  Seeing how happy she was and what the fuck was I doing?  \n\nI got pain pills, valium and cocaine from several sources and began using, all the while lying to my therapist about it.\n\nI got into a car accident going to work while I was high on valium.  Nobody was hurt so the cops weren't called.  There were to be no drug tests.\n\nI started hanging out with a guy who partied a lot.  We'd go out to clubs and do a lot of drugs and try to meet women.  I shudder to think how I looked to those women, high on coke and alcohol, reeking of desperation.\n\nThe main thing I can say about how it all lead to a suicide attempt was it felt like a snowball rolling down a hill.  I knew what was happening but there was nothing I could do to stop it.  It was going to end, one way or another.\n\nOn a Saturday, everything felt dark.  I felt like I was underwater.  There was so much pain inside of me I didn't know what the hell I could do.  So I took valium.  And pain pills.  And I drank vodka from the bottle.  I stumbled around my apartment.  And still I hurt.  I didn't want to live.  This was not life.  All this pain.\n\nI called my friend and left a message on his voicemail.  \"Do you ever think of death?\"\n\nI grabbed a belt from my closet but couldn't find anything to hang from myself from.  So I drank some more.  I was so completely out of it, I thought I would die soon from all the drugs.  I went to bed and laid down face down into my pillow, hoping to suffocate if the drugs didn't kill me.  Then I blacked out.\n\nWhen I woke up the next day, there was the deepest grief I had ever felt.  I failed.  I did not want to be alive.  I hated everything.  I grabbed a knife from my kitchen and dragged it across my forearms.  Not to kill myself.  I just wanted to feel something besides the pain inside of me.  It made me feel better.\n\nI called my therapist and told her what happened.  She wasn't pleased.  She told me to call a friend over otherwise she was calling 911.  She also told me she couldn't be my therapist any more.  That she couldn't handle me.  At the time, I thought it was harsh but I didn't feel anything.  I was dead inside.\n\nBut embarrassment overrode everything and I called a friend lest I be hauled out of my apartment by EMT in front of my neighbors.  My friend came over, clearly over her head.  She did flush my drugs down the toilet which I know appreciate.  If she hadn't, I probably would've finished the job that night.\n\nShe cried when she was the cuts on my arm.  And all of a sudden I was comforting her.\n\nI'm not really sure what happened after that.  My memory is pretty fuzzy from all the drugs.  But being off the drugs, probably helped a lot.  I plodded along.  I found no joy in anything for a long time.\n\nSomehow, I hung on long enough to realize that my life wouldn't always be that way.  And that was the hardest thing to believe.  Because when I was ready to die, I thought that was my only option.\n\nI don't know what advice I can give about coming this revelation yourself.  Maybe you need to get that close to the edge before realizing you don't want to go over.  And some people make it and some don't.\n\nI think about killing myself every now and then, still.  But it's fleeting.  And not very real.  A fantasy.  A day dream.  It's been 5 years.  I love life, even when it sucks.  Because fuck it, that's all we know we have.\n\nIf you're out there, if you're thinking about offing yourself, i'm not going to give you a list of bullshit reasons not to.  To tell you the truth, only you can figure out a reason to live.  But it only takes one reason.  One spark to keep going.  And if you make it one more day, hour or minute, that's something.  Don't think about the rest of your life.  Think about this moment.\n\nWell, that's all I have to say.  Send me a message if you need someone to listen.
