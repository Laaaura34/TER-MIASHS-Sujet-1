I am only ever truly happy sleeping and I can never stop the distraction and pain.\n\nEssentially, I constantly am at worry over the chance I could be, or will become a pedophile, as well as fears over zoophilia, incest, and practically anything that revolts me. \n\nThis has led to months upon months of checking and trying to \"figure things out\" about me and has drained all my energy from me. I haven't been able to genuinely get into or enjoy a hobby or something that I have enjoyed because I'm always back to googling and trying to find out what POCD is.\n\nThe questioning and checks are so deep that I'm often questioning why I ask questions. Starting to think of plans of what to do next if I ever figure out that yes, I am a pedophile/zoophile/anything disgusting like that.\n\nDo I just find it sexually appealing and my morals are preventing me from enjoying it and I'm in denial?  \nShould I put a bullet to my head if I am?\n\nDo I really have OCD, or is it just me refusing to accept the truth?  \nDo I have both POCD & pedophilia?\n\nIs it just an obsessive fear that means nothing?\n\nShould I preemptively cut off all social contact with anyone else and try to overdose or find some kind of way to castrate myself?\n\nI try to elaborately tie these questions together in my head every single day. It occupies 3/4th of my time on a good fucking day. \n\nIs that a \"\"groinal response\"\" or am I sick in the fucking head?\n\nThe worst part is that it feels that I go from emotional highs and lows all the time. I move constantly between them. I try to measure and compare arousal of scenarios I make in my head. None of it is conclusive enough. \n\nSometimes I'm afraid there are questions I avoid asking myself subconsciously because it would prove beyond a doubt I am filth.\n\nAnd beyond that I have the audacity to feel bad for myself. The audacity to want to take an easy way out. The audacity to go boo hoo, woe is me on a public forum when there are people who suffer from abuse everyday and I'm just crying about how I'm probably a nonce.\n\nThe funniest part is I'm this kind of person than I should just waste my life away working to benefit other people and it would hopefully have made up for being a sick fuck by the end.\n\nAnd despite that option of cutting everything else and focusing on being a positive influence on the world its hard not to want to find a way out. I contemplate it all the fucking time despite having the idea I could ever be selfless enough to make up for being this way, if I am.\n\nIt has taken so much of my power to not just take as much from the medicine cabinet as possible until I black out and hopefully die. So much.\n\nAnd the worst part is the logic for me is tipping into the favor of me having these disgusting desires...and the fact my history of porn has had some baffling shit that I'm only now understanding and freaking out about. I try to use anime porn and trying to gauge my disgust, my desire, to prove shit to myself and its always a mixed result and I keep scaring myself further and further. \n\n\"Is that just a checking behavior and a part of the OCD or am I genuinely attracted?\"\n\nI don't want to live the rest of my life being disgusting. I am so, so fucking scared, all the time. I hate myself. I would do so much to be able to be a good person and avoid having to even worry about this.\n\nBut no, its looking more and more likely I'm falling into the same group of people that operate exclusively off their desires and hurt other people for their own gain. If someone pointed a gun to my head right now I would be the most at peace.
