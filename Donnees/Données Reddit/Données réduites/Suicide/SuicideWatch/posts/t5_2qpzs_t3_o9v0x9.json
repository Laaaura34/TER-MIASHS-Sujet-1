I'm in a better place financially now than ever in my life, thinking about buying a house. Every now and then I get this feeling that I don't deserve to be in this good place, makes me want to gamble hard, or take some drugs, do something to make my life situation as miserable as I feel in my mind. In the past it manifested as feeling like I wanted to end my life but I'm not there yet. How do people enjoy life so easily, even in a position to move my life forward I have some unseen force pulling me down. I'm 41 years old and haven't lived a day of my life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o9v0x9/self_destruction/", "title": "Self destruction", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "PoopknifeLife", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624919435, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o9v0x9/self_destruction/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422531.5142987, "replies_charged": false}
