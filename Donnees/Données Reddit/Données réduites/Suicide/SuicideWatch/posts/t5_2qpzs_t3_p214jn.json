I failed at being young, and I failed at being an adult. I have a lot of pills, I wish I could swallow them all right now, but I\u2019m doubtful if it will be a fatal overdose. But I have 5 more months until the insurance takes away the coverage to pay for them.\n\nIf I don\u2019t kill myself, the sudden withdrawal of three different medications probably will, at least I hope so, because the SSRI withdrawal sounds worse than dying.\n\nI can\u2019t just keep trying to distract myself and ignore reality. It IS a ticking time limit, and at that deadline the coverage WILL END. My mom also just reminded me \u201cthis house will also not always be here\u201d.\n\nI think that\u2019s why she said I need another job that provides health insurance AND PAYS MORE.\n\nA bunch of idiots on the internet have told me \u201cage doesn\u2019t matter, life isn\u2019t a race\u201d, but now it LITERALLY DOES AND IS.\n\nI\u2019m too broken, I can\u2019t deal with this, but like everything else, I\u2019ll probably wait until the very last second to kill myself.\n\nI\u2019m probably going to either end up homeless or in the prison system in the not so far future.\n\nAGAIN, my mom is saying I NEED TO LET HER GO INTO THE DOCTOR WITH ME. Makes me want to go even less.\n\nI can run away, but it won\u2019t be long until I end up homeless, in prison, and/or dead.\n\nI can\u2019t function as an adult, and the system doesn\u2019t make sense to me, I don\u2019t really care if my family will be hurt if I kill myself, they\u2019ve been mean to me a lot, my sister hates me, my dad did nothing but constantly criticize me, my mom is severely overbearing, step dad has severe anger issues and is delusional about conspiracy theories (IDGAF if this country does collapse, or the world, I don\u2019t care anymore, it\u2019s a terrible place anyway) and I just can\u2019t compete in, life.\n\nI feel like even if by some miracle I completely flipped around, and everything was perfect how I want it, I\u2019d still never be happy, just because how much has passed and how bad it was, and that it had to take such severe threats to get to a better position.\n\nI can definitely afford a gun. Maybe I\u2019ll be able to rent my own place, and immediately kill myself there. \n\nI have no right to even think about having a girlfriend or anything romantic or sexual, I couldn\u2019t even complete the basics in life.\n\nFuck the American healthcare system, being so \u201cfor-profit\u201d obsessed we have such insane prices and \u201caffordable\u201d health insurance being tied to employment, CONDITIONALLY (you still don\u2019t always get good, if any coverage at all).\n\nI can\u2019t go from nothing to everything in just 5 months, I\u2019ve barely made any real progress in job/career (no career at all) in the past 5 YEARS.\n\nI would never reproduce, whether any women wanted to do that with me or not. I\u2019m more ANTINATALIST than I\u2019ve ever been.\n\nWhy is it so hard to live in \u201cthe greatest most prosperous nation in the world\u201d?\n\nMy only realistic options (no guarantees, but literally nothing is guaranteed in life) is try therapy (take Uber and go BY MYSELF, and start telling them EVERYTHING that I tell strangers on Reddit, and see if they have any realistic solution, keeping in mind that I can\u2019t afford to wait for \u201clong-term\u201d healing like everybody always says you do in life).\n\nMy mom even told me \u201cit only gets harder after the insurance cutoff\u201d, I KNEW THAT WAS TRUE. People online LIED TO ME and told me there\u2019s \u201cno rush for anything in life\u201d I KNEW THAT WAS A LIE.\n\nI hate American capitalism, I think this whole \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d game is EVIL, and not even technically correct in our \u201cmodern civilized\u201d society.\n\nI can\u2019t leave the US, because I have no education/degree which is required for citizenship.\n\nI\u2019m becoming more and more shocked that people are just left to starve and go homeless here, and left to drown in 6-7 figures of medical debt from an EMERGENCY.\n\nI have nearly $10,000 in savings, is there anything I can do to quickly turn that into more or something? \n\nI can\u2019t keep being a grocery bagger/cart pusher for less than $11 an hour, even if they did provide decent health insurance.\n\nI can\u2019t learn to drive with someone yelling at me, and I can\u2019t deal or react to anything normally when I\u2019m having PTSD flashbacks and my entire body is shaking.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t really WANT to kill myself, I just see no realistic options to fix my problem as soon as I need.\n\nIf it\u2019s not already clear just from this post, I cannot join the military, I wouldn\u2019t genuinely want to anyway, I\u2019d probably be yelling in pure rage/fear back at the instructor and begging them to shoot me to death. Plus, I was already told I can\u2019t join just because I need medication.\n\nSeriously, I hate this society and this system, that my family loves and praises so much.\n\nWhy did you bring me into this world? I could never do that to someone who can\u2019t even consent to their own birth, it\u2019s sickening.\n\nAside from all moral issues, it\u2019s just too expensive to have kids anyway, too many people can\u2019t afford to support THEMSELVES, even with more than one fulltime job\u2026\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t think there is a solution, not that will help me as soon as I need anyway. I\u2019m scared, I\u2019ll never be able to be happy even if it does somehow get better and I avoid any withdrawal and/or homelessness, because I\u2019ve already been too traumatized to ever be able to just \u201clive in the moment\u201d even if my life was good and how I wanted it. \n\nI can\u2019t trust anyone, so forget about any healthy long-term relationships just based off of that, without even counting the \u201cbeing unable to be independent\u201d factor.\n\nSeriously, fuck American capitalism, it\u2019s nothing but a way to \u201ckill the weak\u201d who didn\u2019t even consent to being born in the first place, and we don\u2019t live in environments intended for us, religion and politics ruined the world.\n\nShould I just, throw all money on lottery tickets? Seems like winning the literal lottery is my only hope now, and it\u2019s not as if my money will have value to me when I\u2019m dead, so it doesn\u2019t matter if I just lose it all.\n\nI don\u2019t know what else to do.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p214jn/realistically_this_may_be_my_best_if_not_only/", "title": "Realistically, this may be my best if not only option at this point.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "breakingpoint26", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 106, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628638608, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p214jn/realistically_this_may_be_my_best_if_not_only/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635426874.7618387, "replies_charged": false}
