So the problem isn\u2019t the anorexia, but my fam forcing me. And so I really feel like it kinda is their fault that I am commiting suicide, but I have never heard that, like it is always it is no ones fault, you could have down nothing about it etc. But I do kinda feel like it is someone\u2019s fault I am feeling like I feel and I am ging to do what I am going to do. Is this odd??? \nAnd also in my suicide/goodbye letter should I put it in their, because I want to be honest but I also don\u2019t want to blame them and have them feel guilty.
