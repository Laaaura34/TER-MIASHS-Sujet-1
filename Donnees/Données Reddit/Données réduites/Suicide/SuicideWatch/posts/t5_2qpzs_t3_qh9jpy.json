As a gay male, dealing with the gays I know I\u2019m the problem (sort of), I don\u2019t handle being habitually blown off by guys. It angers me. It angers me when guys then tell me they got fucked raw in the interim essentially showing and stating I\u2019m not worth it. Over and over again.\n\nI\u2019m sick of not being good enough for anyone. I\u2019m sick of everyone listening to other people about me. I\u2019m sick of all the people that can\u2019t give me the literal fucking two minutes of their day to me. \n\nI\u2019m super abrupt with texting and direct. \n\nToday a guy hates me because he explicitly stated four times how far I am but what a catch I am. Then why the fuck can\u2019t you visit.\n\nI\u2019m sick of being a downer to my friends.\n\nI\u2019m sick of my tms sessions getting pushed back.\n\nI\u2019m tired of being average.\n\nI\u2019m tired of being unwanted.\n\nI know I\u2019ll die alone. I just want to experience someone caring.\n\nI work all day. Come home home to an empty apartment. \n\nThe only thing that\u2019s keeping me here is my dog because he would be lost with out me. My mom most likely would go catatonic because she would blame herself even though I\u2019m just not really meant to be alive. Living.\n\nIt\u2019s like my best friend from childhood died in a crash. He was intelligent had friends going places. I\u2019m just some fucking disease of a person that clearly kills anything he touches in terms of a relationship perspective.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qh9jpy/just_over_it/", "title": "Just over it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "thedemoncowboy", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635377482, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qh9jpy/just_over_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426889.4094234, "replies_charged": false}
