I am not as patient or creative as I should be, let alone trying to deal with being suicidal while working with children. I have one or two friends, but one is far away and I've never met her, the other is a colleague and we're both always busy, and another is simply trying to take advantage of me by having me doing things for her. The friend I've never met is my closest friend ironically, but I don't want her to try to meet me because I know she'd cut off contact or even worse, slowly let it taper off and become disinterested. \nI'm tired and unhealthy, and I talk too much. Nobody wants to hear it, and I can't blame them. \nI feel trapped by my responsibilities and I am afraid that my husband and child would struggle financially if I was gone. My work would survive, I'm expendable. I need to make a plan for my family so I can go.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qaa0l7/suicidal_teacher/", "title": "Suicidal Teacher", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "purplerose_44", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634512166, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qaa0l7/suicidal_teacher/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635428288.4734583, "replies_charged": false}
