He spends as much time as he can working because he's worried about university. We don't talk very often and when we do it usually makes me feel extremely guilty because he stops doing whatever he is doing so that he can make sure I'm ok, and then I just sit there feeling shitty while he asks what's wrong and I just tell him that there's nothing wrong and I'm just feeling bad in general, and then he ends the call and probably feels shit for that as well.\n\nI don't want him to feel guilty for my problem. I don't want to  force this on to him and make him feel like he needs to sacrifice his time and energy just to make me feel better. I'm not sure telling him will even help me that much, there's a good chance it will just make the guilt a lot worse for both of us. \n\nIt's just that sometimes I get periods where it's all I can think about, and it makes it difficult to talk about anything else. I just want someone to sit with me all day and distract me from my own head and  tell me it's all going to be ok. But I feel extremely selfish whenever I even consider that someone might do that for me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m0lcpg/would_it_be_selfish_to_tell_my_bf_about_my/", "title": "Would it be selfish to tell my bf about my suicidal thoughts.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "IamJustOverreacting", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 0, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615225690, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m0lcpg/would_it_be_selfish_to_tell_my_bf_about_my/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428265.1623976, "replies_charged": false}
