I\u2019ve been clean for a year and a half now, but heroin is always my easy way out if shit gets too hard. \n\nRecently I\u2019ve been kind of self destructing very slowly. Doing things I know that I shouldn\u2019t, my girlfriend questioning me about behaviors and lying, and then feeling bad about it. I don\u2019t mean like \u201coh I feel bad this sucks\u201d, I mean \u201cI\u2019m such a dumb piece of shit why did I do this to cause a problem that could be so easily avoidable\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve been falling asleep to voices speaking to me and bringing me down, literally laying in bed, my own bashing itself, doing nothing but staring at the ceiling. \n\nIt sucks that I\u2019ve been arguing with my girlfriend but it\u2019s more about arguing with myself. If I am just going to fuck this relationship up by self-destructing, why not just go back to Old Faithful and hope for the best", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/klxiuz/slowly_selfdestructing_on_accident/", "title": "Slowly Self-Destructing... on accident?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "harryboyzandco", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1609184971, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/klxiuz/slowly_selfdestructing_on_accident/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422546.2628849, "replies_charged": false}
