All else is mere baiting or pity seeking \n\nI appreciate this space tho \n\nMany comments provided a fresh perspective. I canceled my motel reservation. I still have the materials. I still have a plan. I'm holding off tho. I definitely feel like life is one big fat fucking joke, a fluke, and that its meaningless. I think living exclusively out of guilt for others is really stupid. But I realized I was also being so rash \n\nI cant tell anyone, not my therapists, not my friends, or family. I cant be written off as an attention whore, nor do I want to be stopped if I go thru w/ da big sleep \n\nThis is the only place I feel safe discussing heavy ass shit.
