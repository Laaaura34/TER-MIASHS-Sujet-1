A father I never met   \nbut resent nonetheless, a mother who inadvertently destroys every path I lay out for myself, an autistic brother who has essentially become my child to raise in my mother's place, and a world of financial, physical, and psychological burdens dropped on my shoulders due to actions on others' behalves when I was still playing with Polly Pocket. At the age of 22 I juggle between my body cracking and aching every morning I wake up, a head is riddled with gray hairs, the money I make not being mine to spend, the college education I've been working on being extended from 4 to 5 years worth of debt due to my family, and serving as the acting mother of a 48 year old woman and a 14 year old impaired child. I only had three friends I truly cared for, but even their names and any records I had of them were lost to time. I kept living so my family won't have to mourn me, but I no longer have any reason to care about their feelings as they've failed to care for mine. The only thing I can't leave behind is my cat. I adopted her in the midst of a depressive spell 3 years ago, and she's the only one that's been a source of comfort at every time I needed her. She certainly doesn't understand how crucial a role she played in maintaining my sanity, but to pay her back I want to ensure she lives a long, happy life. She is expected to die in 8 years, at which point I will be 30, my student debt, medical, and living expenses--as well as my family's--will control my wallet, and my body will be further worse than wear for the age. Whatever happens in these 8 years, I don't care. Love, success, joy--it's worthless striving for them when all my life I've pushed beyond my limits to achieve them only to fall flat at every turn. All I want is to repay my debt to a sweet calico with white paws and a kind of ugly looking face, and end the fucking misery I'll have on my back once I'm done.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ohzevj/i_die_when_my_cat_dies/", "title": "I Die When My Cat Dies", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TraditionalStock1478", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625985265, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ohzevj/i_die_when_my_cat_dies/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426800.1898139, "replies_charged": false}
