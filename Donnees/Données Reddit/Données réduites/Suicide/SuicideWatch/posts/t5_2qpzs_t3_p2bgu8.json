Next week it is going to court and I'm not sure I can handle it. I only ever wanted them to have a good life, I love them so much and I'm so hurt that someone has taken their innocence from them when I thought that there life would be different from mine. I just want to disappear. I slipped into anorexia when I found out and have struggled myself ever since. The only saving grace was my boyfriend. \n\nThis week I found out he cheated on me at the start of our relationship. I had built my life around him and he was the only male I trusted. I have told him I will stay because I don't want to make him upset. I don't want to stay or go, I want to die. I cannot kill myself because my siblings have already had too much pain. I cannot handle anything more, I just want peace.\n\nPeople are aliens and they make this world a horrific place to stay.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p2bgu8/everything_is_too_broken/", "title": "Everything is too broken", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "luocey", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628682481, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p2bgu8/everything_is_too_broken/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422260.8676825, "replies_charged": false}
