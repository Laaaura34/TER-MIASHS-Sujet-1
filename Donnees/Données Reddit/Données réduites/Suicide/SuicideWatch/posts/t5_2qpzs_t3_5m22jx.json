She alternates frequently between being very depressed and a cheerful, cutesy demeanor. She is slightly overweight and is constantly overly worried about her appearance. She has been starving herself for about a month, only eating perhaps one meal a day. Her family is extremely unsupportive of her and tells her that she is ugly, childish, and stupid. She looks up to me, I suppose (17, male) because I try to encourage her as much as possible... She's really a great friend who I hate to see stuck in low self-esteem and depression. Last night she cut her arms (I believe for the first time ever) leaving a lot of marks... not deep or overly hazardous to her health, but it's another step towards suicidal behavior... I've had a few friends this past year take their own lives, and I'll do anything in my power to help her. I've tried to get her to see a professional, but her parents say that she's just exaggerating and won't take her to see anyone. I really don't know what I can do to help.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5m22jx/what_do_you_do_for_someone_who_cant_or_wont_get/", "title": "What do you do for someone who can't or won't get help?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "IamCarbonMan", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1483566558, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5m22jx/what_do_you_do_for_someone_who_cant_or_wont_get/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425260.623586, "replies_charged": false}
