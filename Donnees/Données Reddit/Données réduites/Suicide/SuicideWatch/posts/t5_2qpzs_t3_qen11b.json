I punch and hit both of my arms and legs until they turn red, then I just sit, cry, and soak in the pain. \n\nI understand how bad cutting can be, and my form of self harm may not hurt as much as cutting does,  but I just want someone to recognize that I am in fact, hurting myself. \n\nA google search of \"self harm that doesn't leave scars\" leads me to fucking nothing. And once again, I am in no way trying to imply that cutting is less important than other types of self harm, but I just want to be seen. I don't think people like me should grow up thinking that the only way you can harm yourself is by cutting. I've been doing this shit since I was 9 and I thought it was an okay way to express my anger because no where in media have I ever seen someone recognize this as a form of self harm.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qen11b/people_only_care_about_forms_of_self_harm_that/", "title": "People only care about forms of self harm that leave scars.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Succmylemon", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635059173, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qen11b/people_only_care_about_forms_of_self_harm_that/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426861.5695682, "replies_charged": false}
