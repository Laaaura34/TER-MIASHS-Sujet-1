I need to dissociate. It's okay. It's not your fault. I just can't deal with the bulimia and drug addiction anymore.\n\nIf this dose ends up being my last, I'm sorry. I promised you I wouldn't, but you know how much my words really mean. But you mean a lot to me. Our years together were the best of my life. You made me feel like a real woman and helped me through so much. Our time together was so special.\n\nIf I really do die tonight, it's not your fault. Just please, don't let my family know the truth. I have nothing left. If anything please let me die with dignity.  I can't let them know I'm a failure addict \n\nI'm sorry, I love you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fz4k92/if_i_dont_make_it_tonight_it_isnt_your_fault/", "title": "If I don't make it tonight, it isn't your fault", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ToastNoodles", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1586609443, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fz4k92/if_i_dont_make_it_tonight_it_isnt_your_fault/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422947.4696317, "replies_charged": false}
