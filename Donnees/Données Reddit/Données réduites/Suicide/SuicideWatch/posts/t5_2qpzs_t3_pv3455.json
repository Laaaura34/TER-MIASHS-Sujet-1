A little too sweaty, so people can grumble about how hot the weather has been the past few years. A stale breeze in the air, birds are chirping as they fly from tree top to tree top. No rain, a few clouds in the sky.\n\nI want people gossiping about their lives, making lame jokes and snide remarks. I want the world to continue. I do not want to be remembered or do I want to be mourned. I just want to fade away. And I would love for that day to be as mediocre as possible.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pv3455/i_want_to_die_on_a_mediocre_day/", "title": "I want to die on a mediocre day.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "sadvodka", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 332, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632560417, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pv3455/i_want_to_die_on_a_mediocre_day/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426724.3896368, "replies_charged": false}
