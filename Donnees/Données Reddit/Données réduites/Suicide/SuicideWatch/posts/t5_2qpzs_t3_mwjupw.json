I\u2019ve never posted on Reddit so I am sorry if I\u2019m annoying. On the outside, I\u2019m married, two children, a great job and a nice home. No one at work would ever suspect a thing. Inside, I\u2019m dying. \n\nMy children are all that keeps me alive. I want to leave my husband , but I cannot handle a divorce/moving the kids/etc right now. I just want to open the safe, pull out the 45 and lights out. I broke down hysterically last night at the thought of my kids finding me like that. I\u2019ve tried \u201chelp\u201d and meds and more help and nothing works. \nI have 1 friend and she\u2019s so busy, I rarely speak to her. It\u2019s just me, my 2 kids and the husband that doesn\u2019t even care for me. I\u2019m so lonely and isolated. Im going to be 35, I can\u2019t go \u201cmake friends.\u201d I\u2019m so sorry for whining, I just never thought I would be so lonely. I just need a friend. I\u2019m sorry for wasting your time with this long message.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mwjupw/i_feel_so_much_guilt/", "title": "I feel so much guilt..", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Gloomy_Pair_3476", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619140642, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mwjupw/i_feel_so_much_guilt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426198.2535439, "replies_charged": false}
