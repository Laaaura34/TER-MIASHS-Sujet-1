She was the one holding me up for the past couple of months and now she was texting me at 4am venting to me hoping she didn't wake me because at the time all she could think of was holding me as we faded away. I was still awake but held the strength at the time to not invite that outcome and to try and cheerlead her. Same then goes for yesterday again...\n\nWell I've invited her over with the intent that i just need to be held right now. I'm trying to hold strong in any way I can but Ive been ready for so long. I've been trying to help myself by helping others this past week. reaching out and trying to encourage and just listen to those who have similar pain and are also at risk. Ive also been venting on another throwaway acct in a long forgotten suicide watch post because i was too weak to really reach out any longer. Well here I am trying my hardest but my heart so dearly just wants me to fail. For she and I to fade away.\n\nplease help", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/9bh154/fading/", "title": "fading", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "CatOnEdge", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1535608392, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/9bh154/fading/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427731.4098163, "replies_charged": false}
