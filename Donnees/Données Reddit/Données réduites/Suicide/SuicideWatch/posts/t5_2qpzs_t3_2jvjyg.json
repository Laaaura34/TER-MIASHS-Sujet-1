I have always been suicidal, and by that i mean, i have been craving to kill myself since the age of 4. (earliest I can remember anyway) so, ya. I have nothing in my life that brings me any joy. I have tried many, many things to get out of this thought processes. I am 20 years old and i have a fit, and some would use \"sexy\" body. I was always one of, if not the smartest guy in class. I was never really \"bullied\" in my years attending school. I do not have any obvious situation or tramatic experience that would have put up red flags for my friends and family. I happen to appear very outgoing and confident to others. But deep, deep down i always want it all to end. There has not been a day since I can remember that i didn't try, or think of suicide. I have been \"good\" about it for over a year. And to be fair, i have never really tried. I would say they were more calls for attention/help. Without telling anyone, i purchased a kel-tec p11, with only a 50 rack of 9mm of WOLF 115gr ammo. I have shot it 2 times, still have 8rds left, and one is saved for a specific purpose. I don't know whats wrong with me, i do feel regret even though i haven't done it yet. I feel regret for letting my mother down, my aunt, uncle, sister, brother and damn near my entire family. I feel like a selfish piece of shit for ever considering this. But when i think like that i keep getting deeper into my destructive depression. So.... last call. I will not take the 911 route ever again. They do not understand where i live. They think locking me in a room with a shrink 10 hours into their shift is going to make me happy all of the sudden. Well, as many of you know it doesn't. I don't know what to say anymore. I don't know what to do anymore. All i really know is death has been calling me for a while and im about to answer the call......\n\nIm not looking for a sappy \"it'll all be over soon\" or \"this will pass\" and especially the \"whats wrong\" bullshit spiel.... just, idk. I don't give a fuck anymore soo, do what you want.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2jvjyg/self_destructive_patterns_are_becoming/", "title": "Self Destructive patterns are becoming increasingly obvious", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "selfdestuctive", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1413887274, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2jvjyg/self_destructive_patterns_are_becoming/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422562.9547746, "replies_charged": false}
