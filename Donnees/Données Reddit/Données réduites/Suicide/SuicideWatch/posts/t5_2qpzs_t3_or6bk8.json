I don\u2019t have a horrible life but it feels so routine and it\u2019s exhausting. I find myself wanting to just end things because it\u2019s just SO MUCH easier. But every time I have thoughts of suicide I just think about how  my mom already lost one son and her husband, I can\u2019t put her though that again. \n\nI can\u2019t hurt my family and friends that I know care for me but I just don\u2019t feel close to them anymore. I feel like the affection or compassion I show towards them are fake. All my emotions I show them feel so forced. I can\u2019t even say \u201cI love you\u201d to my family without cringing. \n\nI just want to rest peacefully and the thoughts of hurting the people around pain me. How is that fair! It\u2019s not their life, it\u2019s mine. I should be able to do what I want. It\u2019s selfish that people want me to say alive because they\u2019ll miss me. \n\nThis constantly battle of wanting to die but I can\u2019t kill myself hurts and I just bottle it up until it all comes out in tears and I\u2019m just left sleeping of exhaustion.\n\nI\u2019ve never attempted to kill myself but I\u2019m afraid one day, probably when my mom goes, I\u2019ll end up doing it. And I can\u2019t bring myself to talk to anyone because I can never be so open with anyone, not my family and not even my girlfriend to an extent. Maybe I should try therapy but every experience I hear from people is horrible. So I\u2019m just forced to sleep it off and when I\u2019m asleep it all just goes away\u2026the pain, the exhaustion, the pressure. It\u2019s the best feeling in the world.
