I stopped looking for happiness a long time ago. That's not because I'm positive I won't find it, but it just doesn't make sense to me to search for it, and shooting for mild contentment caked in a dull ache seems like something more attainable.\n\nI feel like I have spent the past 15 years waiting for this bullshit to abate. I think about suicide every. single. day. I can't remember a time when I didn't obsess over it. I'm 17 months sober from roughly eight years of constant drinking, and a dash of a nasty cocaine habit toward the end. Drinking got me out among people, which isn't normally my nature, and I miss the convivial spirit I had getting blotto with some strangers or friends. With that ebullience came some severely dark shit for me, though. I was subject the the whims of my emotions, and violence and/or destruction was a common occurrence. Add to that the eventual inability to hold my hand still enough to take my first drink of the day, and the increasing frequency of pissing myself while passed out on the floor after blacking out from insane quantities of liquid poison, I had to go to rehab.  \n\nHaving spent the last year and a half with my faculties raw and hypersensitive, I've made through some tough things, such as getting divorced and hearing about just how much my ex-wife was cheating on me. (Spoiler alert: it was *a lot*.)\n\nI still feel like I'm just biding my time before I lose reasons to hang on. If I didn't care about destroying my parents, I would have killed myself long ago. Sometimes I just think about when I'll have no one around me left to negatively affect, and then I'll be free to let go. \n\nI'm also diagnosed bipolar, but what's just amazingly fantastic is that I am most often in the pitch of hatred and hopelessness. It is rare that I feel good or am at all on an upswing. It happens, but it is rare. My one severe manic break happened four years ago. At first it was a little exciting and I felt like I had the answers to the world's problems. I didn't hold back in telling everyone I possibly could about my theories. It was a little weird. I would have regular panic attacks and would obsess over the movie Barton Fink, taking pages and pages of notes every night. Sometimes I would watch it three or four times a night. I remember counting around 70+ pages of notes about every single scene, every single line, and I believed that it was by providence that I was given the messages that I found in that film. I mean, it's an awesome film, but I went overboard.\n\nAdd to all of this, my anhedonia extends its grubby grip into my sex life (if I'm lucky enough to have one) as well. I take a long time to get comfortable with a girl to the point that I can have sex with her. My most recent tryst companion apparently doesn't feel like waiting because she mentioned on her blog wanting to text someone else to come over and fuck her. I just never care to. I don't feel pleasure from anything. I play and record music by myself because I feel like I have to. It's not exactly fun or cathartic, and I'm never really pleased with the result, but I keep doing it.\n\nI have no job, I'm in a city where I don't really know anyone, and I quit the program I was in school for because it wasn't what I wanted to do. I know I have talent in some respects. I get by with several musical instruments and can craft parts of songs that I know are Quality with a capital 'Q'. Those parts are surrounded by fluff and bullshit, so don't think I'm thinking too highly of myself. I just know some parts are legitimate. That means nothing if I can't see a song through to an end. I've also got a good eye. I studied photography with incredible professors, some of the remaining living legends in the field. I know I've got talent there. But I rarely do anything with that anymore. I've also been told that I can write. I'm confident that I can, but I'm also painfully aware that I have a shit imagination. So all of these things I know I have some sort of talent with, I don't know how to use them and they are therefore essentially useless to me.\n\nI'm recording songs because I'm afraid I'm going to voluntarily cease all activity within my central nervous system and become a pile of ash before I can get some songs out. Maybe people will know me a little better if they can hear me play music. It may not be the best stuff in the world, but I give it everything I've got. Maybe my brother or sister will want to hear it when I'm gone. Maybe an ex-girlfriend or my ex-wife will want to hear it once or twice in a blue moon when she feels nostalgic and wants to indulge in a memory. I wouldn't bet on all of that, though.\n\nI can feel myself letting go of reasons to stick around. I've felt suicidal for years, but I feel the desperation coming to a frothing boil.\n\nThe best part? I'm medicated. I'm plenty medicated. I've slowly been put on several different medications, and their lack of effect has pushed me to their maximum recommended dosages. It doesn't really help that much. It makes things more tolerable, but I still walk around in a daze, wishing I was hanging from the bottom end of a taut, swinging rope. I feel like pulling a move like Kate Chopin's The Awakening and swimming out into the sea with no intention of turning around. I want to asphyxiate like John Kennedy Toole or Sylvia Plath. The only thing I want to do *before* I call it quits is to write, play music, and photograph. I still fully intend on ending my life if and when I feel like I'm able. I just want to do a few things first. At the same time, I know it's a useless waste of effort toward self-preservation. Shit's going to blow up, burn out, or dry up eventually. Maybe it's more so someone can witness that someone else noticed beauty in pain, documented one facet of it in text, light, or sound, and left it to be observed by others, just in case they need some psychic commiseration with some dead alcoholic guy who liked art for a little while as he spun along with the globe. \n\nThen again, I think fuck that, everything I just thought seems lame, pretentious, and phony. So I'm at square one again. Suicide ideation and depressive obsession leave little room for other subjects.\n\n ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ue8il/it_just_seems_like_a_matter_of_time/", "title": "It just seems like a matter of time.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "theSuezEye", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1338488590, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ue8il/it_just_seems_like_a_matter_of_time/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425165.7292497, "replies_charged": false}
