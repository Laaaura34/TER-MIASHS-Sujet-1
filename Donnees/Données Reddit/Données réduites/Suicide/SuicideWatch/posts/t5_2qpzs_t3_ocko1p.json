She lost interest with me and everything I did to her was annoying, she was my safe space so I called her when I had a breakdown and treated me like shit. Blocked her on social media after seeing a story with some dude because back then I couldn\u2019t handle it to be honest then she called me asking \u201cWhy you got me blocked\u201d I told her I am moving on this way and I don\u2019t want to contact you anymore and please stay away from me. It was hard moving on but when I finally woke up and I don\u2019t miss her. It was good for a couple of hours but then boredom and being unmotivated to do anything just broke me. It has been weeks and I am just staring all day not doing anything, thought about suicide many times but it wasn\u2019t that serious it\u2019s just...life doesn\u2019t make sense to me anymore and everything to me is just wasted effort. I don\u2019t know how to explain this but my life is like \u201cMeh\u201d", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ocko1p/can_i_please_get_help/", "title": "Can I please get help?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Scary-Drawing-6550", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625263593, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ocko1p/can_i_please_get_help/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427044.345318, "replies_charged": false}
