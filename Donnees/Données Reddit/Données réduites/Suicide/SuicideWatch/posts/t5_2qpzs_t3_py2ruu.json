I feel like I\u2019ve aged 20 years in half the time. I\u2019m growing so very frustrated. To think of the experiences and opportunities i\nI\u2019ve lost to this illness is like getting stabbed through my fucking skull.\n\nIt started with social anxiety and low self esteem. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to take risks or out myself out there. I was so afraid of everything. As I spent each Friday at home alone, I became intensely aware of time, and how my time was slowly ticking away, but I remained paralyzed. \n\nI\u2019m 22 years old now: I haven\u2019t had a single real friend in my entire life, and I have only had one girlfriend, which I fucked up in 3 months time. \n\nThis loneliness is my greatest wound. I don\u2019t know how to make friends. It\u2019s embarrassing to say at 22, but it\u2019s true. My desperation shows itself when I meet new people. \n\nIt\u2019s just too much, thinking about lost time, and having no faith for a better future. I\u2019m lost. I\u2019m empty. I want so badly to connect with someone but it\u2019s like an indecipherable puzzle that I can\u2019t solve. \n\nIt\u2019s all I want. I\u2019d live in poverty and obscurity for the rest of my life if I could at least spend it with people I love, and I\u2019ve loved many people in my life: I just never brought myself to get close with any of them.\n\n\nI feel like such a fucking loser. I hate myself. I hate my life. The only thing keeping me alive is how my death would affect my family. I just want to hold someone, to be there for them. To share my life with them. \n\nIt\u2019s all I want.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/py2ruu/10_years_of_loneliness_fear_and_failure/", "title": "10 years of loneliness, fear and failure.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TheOfficialSanityAcc", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632943819, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/py2ruu/10_years_of_loneliness_fear_and_failure/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426924.3270454, "replies_charged": false}
