We had a lot of issues and we were very toxic to each other, but he has always been the one person who has been there for me consistently in my life. I am estranged by most of my family, but he has always been here for me.\n\nHe was my best friend and we did literally everything together. About a year ago, we broke up, and during our break up I saw other people (it was rushed and definitely not a good decision). we got back together about two months later, but ultimately, he broke up with me two weeks ago because he couldn\u2019t get over the fact that I could do that to him.\n\nas it turns out, 4 days after we broke up he went on a date with a new girl. they escalated very quickly, and are supposedly dating and exclusive. they go on cute dates (the same activities we would do together, mind you) and they spend days on end together. he said he really can see a future with her. i think this is bullshit (how can you like someone so much 2 weeks after ending a 5 year relationship?) but nonetheless it is what it is.\n\ni didn\u2019t find this out until a few nights ago, when i went to his house with his favorite snacks, flowers, and a handmade card. he invited me over, so i figured it was a good sign and was determined to win him back. turns out, he invited me over to let me know he was seeing someone. \n\ni have never felt so much pain in my entire life. i sobbed and sobbed and cried nearly nonstop for days. i barely slept and i lost my appetite, to the point where i didn\u2019t eat for like 30 hours and the thought of food made me sick. the thought of him giving his heart to someone else destroyed me. the thought of being replaced destroyed me.\n\ni started thinking that maybe there isn\u2019t a point to this. i am all alone now. i have friends who support me, but i don\u2019t have the connection with them like i did with him. nothing fills the hole. i would do anything to end this pain. i am not interested in anything and i am not exaggerating when i say that every moment is excruciating.\n\nNow, a few days later, i convinced him to go out for dinner with me as friends. i am desperate for any kind of attention from him. it culminated eventually with him cheating on his new girlfriend, with me. i know this is a horrible thing, but you have to understand that i was desperate for any type of way to numb the pain, to see if maybe he liked me better than her. we had intercourse multiple times over the course of 2 days. i spent upwards of $300 on him in the same time span because anytime he asked for something, i would buy it so he would stick around.\n\nhis girlfriend is back from her trip now and it has dawned on me that despite my desperation and any hint of a connection we had, she is the one that he went back to and is with now. all i can think about is them and i just don\u2019t see a point to it anymore. it hurts every day and i literally cannot focus on work or school or anything because all i can think about is how to get him back, or the horrible realization that maybe it was all for nothing and i\u2019ll never have him.\n\ni don\u2019t want to be with anyone else because it won\u2019t be the same. if i can\u2019t have him i literally want to just not exist. i know it is dramatic but the pain that i feel is unlike any pain i have felt before in my life. it is exhausting. i can\u2019t even open up to him about this because i know it would be manipulative.\n\ntl;dr: i was dumped from a 5 year relationship and two weeks later he is in a new relationship with someone he \u2018sees a future with\u2019. despite this, he still is intimate with me, but he still always go back to her at the end of the night. i am desperate for a way to end the excruciating pain.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/luubsy/feeling_so_overwhelmed_by_breakup/", "title": "feeling so overwhelmed by breakup", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "go_to_sleep_already", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614556560, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/luubsy/feeling_so_overwhelmed_by_breakup/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427136.909273, "replies_charged": false}
