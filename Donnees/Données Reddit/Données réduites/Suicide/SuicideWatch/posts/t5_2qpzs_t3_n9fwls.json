I have posted on this sub last year, with this same account, feel free to read the previous post. But every time I have had suicidal thoughts, the one thing that saved me was my mind. Even if everything around me was bad, I could always find relief in my deepest thoughts, in my internal monologue, in the lucidity of my mind. And now I've lost it. It's been a week now that I haven't been able to focus on anything, to think rationally or even to clear my mind. I'm convinced I've got some sort of brain damage, and even if everybody keeps telling me it's just anxiety, I don't see the difference. Either way it's not going to get better. Even if it really is just anxiety, it's gonna keep rising and getting constantly worse in an endless cycle. I'm incapable of breaking my fixation, so the belief of having brain damage is indifferent from having brain damage itself. The only thing I could rely on has stopped working. Tonight I cried for the first time in five years, I thought it would make me feel better but I was just left more broken. I'm going to kill myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n9fwls/i_have_broken_my_mind/", "title": "I have broken my mind", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "anotheraccount2358", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1620680294, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n9fwls/i_have_broken_my_mind/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428111.3459797, "replies_charged": false}
