Try my hardest and attempt to better myself and enjoy life. and if it didn't work out I'll off myself when I graduate.\n\nA year later I am feeling better and I'm actually doing ok in schoo, but I still catch myself day dreaming about killing myself. I think being a virgin is greatly hindering my improvement but I simply don't have the balls to flirt or even get a prostitute.\n\nI think, after I graduate I'll fly to Thailand and finally try to pay for sex. If I still feel the same way. Then I might follow through with my personal pact .\n\nI love my family and friends but this illness I have hurts so fucking much that it out weighs my love I have for them. To be completely honest, I don't give two shots who I hurt if I follow through. I just want pure fucking silence.\n\nSorry for the rant, I got triggered recently and suicide is all I can think about.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pynyis/my_suicide_pact_with_myself/", "title": "My Suicide Pact with myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "gibocracy", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633021070, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pynyis/my_suicide_pact_with_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427694.794374, "replies_charged": false}
