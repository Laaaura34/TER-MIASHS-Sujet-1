I want to look for help but I don\u2019t wanna live my life anymore. I\u2019m doing my best to be the perfect daughter for my mother and be the perfect sibling but every time they don\u2019t trust me and they searching everything in my room to find what they can use against me. \nBut in general I can\u2019t talk with anyone in my family about my feelings. It\u2019s like a taboo in our household. I\u2019ve got anger issues and since a couple of weeks I\u2019m getting panic attacks because I overthink too much. I\u2019m stressing too much. I\u2019m going on walks without anyone knowing so if I want to disappear for good they won\u2019t know it.\n\nThe reason I don\u2019t talk about my feelings with my friends is because they wouldn\u2019t understand all the pain I\u2019ve been through. I see my feelings as a weak point which I don\u2019t ever have to share with anyone. The person I\u2019m projecting is someone who doesn\u2019t feel affected at all and doesn\u2019t have much emotions to share but when I\u2019m alone all those things are getting on me. \n\nIt has officially become too much to handle and I don\u2019t ever want to share my feelings so I\u2019m getting bad thoughts on how to end it all. I hope that if I\u2019m gone someday they will finally accept that sharing your feelings will help others and that they learn a big lesson. My voice doesn\u2019t count so why would I share my feelings with them?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jq2ekr/i_cant_even_talk_with_someone_about_my_feelings/", "title": "I can\u2019t even talk with someone about my feelings so why would I live longer like this (don\u2019t mind my English)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "wuppiebaby", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1604797278, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jq2ekr/i_cant_even_talk_with_someone_about_my_feelings/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428481.699575, "replies_charged": false}
