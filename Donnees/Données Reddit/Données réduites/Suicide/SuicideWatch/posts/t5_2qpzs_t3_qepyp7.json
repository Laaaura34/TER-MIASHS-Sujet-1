I suffer from insomnia so I\u2019m forced to suffer through 20 hour days I recently had Covid and couldn\u2019t leave my room so I was stuck repeating my whole cycle. Nothing makes me happy I tried to hang out with friends but I feel nothing. Every night in my bed I imagine blowing my face off with a shotgun I\u2019m not even bothered by it and with every second passing it starts to feel like a good idea when it first started I tried contacting my doctor it says I\u2019ll have an appointment in 2 months I don\u2019t even know if I can do another week of this", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qepyp7/ive_thought_about_killing_my_self_everyday_for/", "title": "I\u2019ve thought about killing my self everyday for about 3 weeks", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DeathDayDreamer", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635073273, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qepyp7/ive_thought_about_killing_my_self_everyday_for/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426524.9864085, "replies_charged": false}
