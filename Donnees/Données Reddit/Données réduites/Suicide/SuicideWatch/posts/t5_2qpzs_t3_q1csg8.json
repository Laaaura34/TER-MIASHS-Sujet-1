I have to speak at both. \n5) grandmother dies while in college, I say my last words to her over the phone as I hear the cries when she finally does pass. I am the only one not present. \n6) aunt dies unexpectedly in June\n7) mother is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Not matter what, this disease WILL kill her.\n8) COVID happens as I start my new job in a new city. Lockdown prevents me from making connections. \n9) all of this affects me to the point where I do so poorly in my job I am now at risk of losing it.\n\nAt this point I ask, what\u2019s left? Really. Barely any family, no friends, not even a successful career. But hey, at least I have two cats I never see due to work!\n\nI don\u2019t know what curse was given to me, but I\u2019m tired.
