I take my medication like I\u2019m supposed to, and even though I am more stable than I was for over a year, I still am just fixated with the idea that I don\u2019t belong here. That at any point I can choose to end it all. It\u2019s a comforting idea more than anything. \n\nI just don\u2019t want to work anymore. I don\u2019t even want to try. I don\u2019t even really want to get better. I\u2019m just tired of the pressure that I feel is on me to get better. I feel like I\u2019m wearing everyone\u2019s patience thin because I just don\u2019t get better. My parents want me to be able to be a functioning adult, but I don\u2019t think I ever will be. I hate being an adult and I feel like my childhood was stolen from me by trauma and abuse.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lamyac/i_just_feel_like_such_a_failure/", "title": "I Just Feel Like Such a Failure", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "rainbowtrout97", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612238616, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lamyac/i_just_feel_like_such_a_failure/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428137.270481, "replies_charged": false}
