I never feel relatable to the quote like 'every failure leads to success'. it never does, it's bullshit. My life will still be the same even though how much I try. For the next five years or ten years, it won't get better. I'm suck at living and I think people on this subreddit also quite feel the same as me I guess, which I'm glad I'm not the only one.\n\nI also fail at my hobby even though I've practiced it so hard my entire life, only to find out I don't have talent. And I suck at it. I'm tired. I don't give a shit anymore.\n\nAnyway to whoever is reading my rant, thanks.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ppbggr/im_such_a_failure_i_fail_at_what_i_used_to_love/", "title": "I'm such a failure.
