Everyday is like a broken record played on fucking repeat and I\u2019m just tired of it, I really am. Everyday I wake up at the exact same time, I go to school, work my fucking balls off and get way too tired to do anything else, there is nothing in life that is enjoyable anymore. The desire to just end things grows stronger and stronger everyday, it\u2019s so easy to end thing, just fling myself off a building and just be done with it. \n\nBut then some days are better than others, sometimes I smile and laugh but within a short period of time, I feel the dreaded sense of boredom again. Everyday, I just want to lock myself in my room and stay there, I don\u2019t want to talk to anyone, nor see anyone. I want to just curl up in bed and never fucking wake up.\n\nIm just tired, I\u2019m so tired and I really don\u2019t think I have any will left in me to survive anymore, I think I\u2019m truly done with life. The only thread holding me back is the disappointment I\u2019d imaging seeing in everyone else\u2019s eyes. \n\nI shouldn\u2019t even be complaining anyways, I was born into a loving family, my parents were always nice to me, treats me with so much love, I have friends who I will forever to grateful for, but it\u2019s just not enough for me anymore. This might make me sound greedy and I do feel greedy and needy but at the same time, I also have this weird blob behind my fucking brain just haunting me everyday screeching and I just want to fucking shot it out of my head.\n\nI really don\u2019t know what to do anymore, maybe I will build up the courage to actually do it or I might pussy out and go through the same fucking cycle again. I just wish that something bad will happen to me and the world would relieve me of that responsibility.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/d0h6c6/boredom_and_frustration/", "title": "Boredom and frustration", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Sianna_Cooke", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1567779026, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/d0h6c6/boredom_and_frustration/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427059.492797, "replies_charged": false}
