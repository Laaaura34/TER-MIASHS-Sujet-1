My curiosity and commiseration has led me here, and I'd like to talk about my current situation and social dilemmas (more about my current situation, and how I feel). Well, for one. I feel like total dogshit right now. I've had the chance to improve my science grade in school to get a 4.0 award. This is one of the things I have been looking for, for a long time. Since the first quarter of 8th grade I've been trying to get this award so it might give me some peace and happiness; but my science teacher wanted more of me. Even though I have gotten a really good grade in science, and exceeded a 4.0 grade (102%), I still haven't gotten the award. Now you might be thinking, is it justifiable to say I want to kill myself for just not getting an award. Well, yes, it is. Is it plausible? Yes. The real reason I want to kill-my-self is not because I didn't get the award today, but because for over the past year and a half I have been constantly suffering from generalized anxiety disorder, neuroticism, and \"minor\" depression as my pediatrician calls it. The neuroticism led to hypochondria of brain damage and the hypochondria led to generalized anxiety disorder. Eventually this all led up to me having changes of my brain composition from the constant anxiety and, pretty much having brain damage. My ego and the feeling of being competent as my friend and being \"intelligent again\" is very intoxicating.
