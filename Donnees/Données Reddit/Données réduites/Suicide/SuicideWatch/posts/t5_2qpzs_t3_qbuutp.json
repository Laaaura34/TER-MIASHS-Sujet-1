We all walk on eggshells around her and if we cracked one she won\u2019t hesitate to yell, scratch or punish us. To this day since birth I don\u2019t ever remember calling her out her name but she\u2019s done the same almost every other day.\n\nLast Christmas the whole family was together where her gift to everyone was reading a note explaining she\u2019s been wanting to commit suicide because she felt no one loved her and she\u2019s been working to keep a roof under our heads but didn\u2019t feel appreciated. She refused any love, affection and gifts we gave and she even blew up at me for calling suicide watch numerous times.\n\nThe past 10 months my brother, sister and I all moved out the house but I\u2019ve temporarily moved back to my moms house so I can take care of my disabled dad living with her. Her birthdays coming up in exactly a month and all she wanted for her birthday was the entire family to come together and spend one night with her.\n\nIs it wrong for me to feel like she might murder suicide or just kill herself In front of the family? She\u2019s extremely abusive dealing with depression, she doesn\u2019t want anyones help, shes felt used, she wants the family to spend one night with her when she barely contacts anyone, she stays in her room closet everyday. And it\u2019s odd that she knows there\u2019s only two rooms, her and my dads room and the one bed guest room for 2 brothers and a sister all adults. Wouldn\u2019t a family member that loves you doesn\u2019t want you to sleep on the floor for fear of bacteria and bugs etc., or why 3 adults in one bed?\n\nI\u2019m seriously thinking about this to the point where I\u2019m planning what steps to take if anything happened. If she was going to shoot the family one by one, she\u2019d kill me first the strongest, then my brother, sister, disabled dad then herself.  If she was going to shoot herself she might do what she did last Christmas and read a suicide note then put a gun to her head.\nShe could make us drink poison at the same time, or have a bomb set to detonate. I want to get police involved but I don\u2019t have proof that it could get this serious other than her history.\n\n\nTL;DR: should I be worried about my abusive, depressed mom wanting to commit suicide or murder suicide on her birthday by having the family she doesn\u2019t talk too spend one night with her as her gift?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbuutp/should_i_be_worried_about_my_mom_committing/", "title": "Should I be worried about my mom committing suicide or murder suicide?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "CokeJersey", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634712718, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbuutp/should_i_be_worried_about_my_mom_committing/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428317.9911664, "replies_charged": false}
