But the fear, however real, is irrational. If there\u2019s no afterlife, then you won\u2019t care that you\u2019re dead. You\u2019ll go to sleep, and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s actually quite a comforting thought. No worries, no boredom, no anxiety, no depression, no fear, no anything. If there is an afterlife, then maybe the problems that plagued you in the mortal world won\u2019t do so there. I don\u2019t believe in hell so I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be going there. If there\u2019s an afterlife, my hope is that it\u2019s like the one in the good place. We can work out our problems and faults, then go to heaven. \n\nI\u2019m done being a hamster on a wheel. Eat and shit and jack off and watch youtube and sleep. Too depressed to do anything else. 300 pounds and every time I try to lose an ounce I just end up binging. I hate it here. I\u2019ve driven up to a small town. I didn\u2019t want to do it in a big city. I wanted serenity around me.
