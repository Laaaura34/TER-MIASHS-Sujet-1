The low feelings aren\u2019t new but I\u2019ve been really struggling lately with feeling like I\u2019m never going to achieve what I want (not even sure what that is) or like I don\u2019t have anything worth living for (like I just work, pay bills and exist, I hate it). Really struggling to find passion for anything or a desire to keep going.\n\nI\u2019ve been close with my mom forever, talk almost every day. I am open with how I\u2019m feeling and the last few weeks have been rough. She was blaming my need for dating / finding love / disappointment when that doesn\u2019t happen for my depression and I was getting frustrated with the convo and told her not to contact me.\n\nFor context I went on a date today that didn\u2019t go well and I was feeling extremely depressed.\n\nWas I over dramatic probably but I was frustrated that everyone thinks that\u2019s the only reason for my depression.\n\nAnyway we hung up and she texted me \u201cwhy do you hate me so much\u201d ???\n\nAnd I called her back and she was upset as if my suicidal thoughts and wanting distance were because I hate her (which I have never expressed) and I\u2019m sorry and sad I\u2019m upsetting her but idk I can\u2019t stand the guilt trips to stop someone from suicide \u201cit\u2019s a selfish decision\u201d etc\n\nShe then expressed that she\u2019s depressed but doesn\u2019t discuss it because she worries how it will affect me and like yeah she\u2019s right and now I feel like shit (work, lonely, ugly, mediocre)\n\nHonestly there\u2019s a lot of things that contribute to my depression but I really think it would just be easier if I just died. Yes maybe some people would be sad but then they would grieve and move on and just enjoy their lives w/o me being a burden (I hate that phrase but idk how else to say it).\n\nTried a hotline and the lines busy so idk\nNot doing well", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/moj6n8/im_tired_of_being_made_to_feel_guilty/", "title": "I\u2019m tired of being made to feel guilty", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "inmychoose", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618110891, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/moj6n8/im_tired_of_being_made_to_feel_guilty/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422930.2699587, "replies_charged": false}
