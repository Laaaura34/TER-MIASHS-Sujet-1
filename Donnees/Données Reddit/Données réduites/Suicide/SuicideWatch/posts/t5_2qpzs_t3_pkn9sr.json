I talk to someone and then I don\u2019t hear from them ever again. I text people, they ignore me. I Snapchat people, they leave me on delivered. I want to cry, I want to bury myself in a cave, but mostly, I want to die. Please someone, what do I do? Committing suicide would be so much easier. I just miss my family so much\n\nUpdate: I ask people to eat with me and they all say they\u2019re too busy or just don\u2019t answer. Wtf!! I didn\u2019t think I was this fucking weird.
