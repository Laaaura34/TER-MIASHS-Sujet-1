After I moved and began school, my life has seemingly been great. My job pays well, school work is easy, and I finally live away from my parents. But for some reason I cannot find it in me to be happy about any of these things. I find myself day after day wishing for death, thinking of ways of how I\u2019d kill myself. Now please don\u2019t misunderstand, I don\u2019t currently want to commit to killing myself, but I am having thoughts and I won\u2019t lie they are very tempting. My biggest problem, though, is I don\u2019t WANT to feel this way. I know that therapy and talking to my family will help, but I have no idea how to even go about talking about that to my family. \n\nI think my biggest problem is that I mostly self sabotage, and tell myself that I\u2019m just doing all this for attention. I don\u2019t want others to think that about me, so I\u2019m very nervous to talk about it. \n\nAdditionally with these self sabotaging and suicidal thoughts I\u2019ve also been having major mood swings. Like one moment I am doing fine and literally not even two minutes later I\u2019m on the verge of tears because I\u2019m so upset, about nothing most of the time. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if this is a bit rambly but any advice is appreciated.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9bc3b/feeling_suicidal/", "title": "Feeling Suicidal.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Aggravating_Poetry_7", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634388487, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q9bc3b/feeling_suicidal/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427658.1737995, "replies_charged": false}
