I feel empty yet I feel everything all at once. I have post partum depression on top of having borderline personality disorder, depression, anxiety and bulimia (yes ha ha a fat chick with an eating disorder). I don't feel like my child is even mine. My grandma died 2 weeks ago. My dog got really sick (shes fine now). My fiance thinks its funny to make jokes about my PPD. Every time I reach out for help I get brushed off or given the \"that sucks\" and then start talking about their problems. I started cutting again. My medication isn't working. Therapy isn't working. I'm so tired of feeling like this. I honestly cannot take much more, i want to slit my wrists. I want to hang myself from the banister. I want to jump off a bridge. I dream about killing myself every night. It's been 15 years of feeling like this off and on. It'll never get better. I can't do it any more.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/c1vyok/back_on_the_edge_again/", "title": "Back on the edge again", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "crazylostunreal", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1560820963, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/c1vyok/back_on_the_edge_again/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422953.3180747, "replies_charged": false}
