It\u2019s beyond not just not feeling but also not being present. It\u2019s like I don\u2019t exist or maybe I do and nothing else does. Nothing really affects me anymore. \n\nIt\u2019s to the point where I\u2019ve tried doing drugs and drinking to do anything but it just makes me feel either flat or like I\u2019m sinking. During the past school year my school has been threatened to be shot up and bombed (separate occasions) but it didn\u2019t bother me. No risk even occurred to me even when I tried. Nobody ever talks to me and the last time I really felt anything was when a good friend was moving and their last word about me was \u201cyou know, you\u2019re too sad all the time.\u201d Now I sneak out when I can\u2019t sleep which isn\u2019t often cause I usually sleep close to 14 hours a day. I spend most of my money on drugs just cause it might bring me something to experience. \n\nI have rope in my closet if I ever want to leave and honestly I\u2019m not sure why I haven\u2019t already. There\u2019s nowhere to go. Not down or up. I don\u2019t cry no matter how much I try and I can\u2019t get anyone\u2019s attention to possibly just give me a hug or maybe I\u2019m just that unbearable. I\u2019m not scared that I\u2019m not liked and even hated by some people and in fact I\u2019m extremely passive about it. I wish I could just be worth a dime to someone. Even that statement is part of the problem. I become physically sick and disgusted with myself whenever I get physically or emotionally invested with people one on one. It frustrates me but not even emotionally, just mentally. Fucking Christ I just want to drag a razor across my face. I want to rip myself open and tear the meat right off my hands with my teeth. Someone has to die here and I think it\u2019s gonna be me.
