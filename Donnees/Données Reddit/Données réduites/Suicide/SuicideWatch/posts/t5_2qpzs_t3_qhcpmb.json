I used to have savings and not worry about money as much. \n\nI now sit in my classes and I have a notebook where I write a detailed suicide plan several times a week. It\u2019s very solid. I\u2019m a senior in college and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing with myself. I\u2019m taking 20 credits for my engineering degree, working my absolute butt off, I have several jobs, and I have nothing to look forward to. I\u2019m constantly worried about my finances and I have no plans for when I graduate. \n\nLife keeps on throwing the worst fucking curveballs at me too. It\u2019s repetitive. As soon as things get slightly better something else happens and I\u2019m either financially ruined, or I have to fix a big mistake that takes a bunch of time, or I\u2019m an emotional mess. If it wasn\u2019t for my boyfriend helping me out with everything that happens I would honestly be so fucked I wouldn\u2019t finish school. My scholarship runs out next May so I have to get my degree by then or else I wasted four years. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I have no time to do things that make me happy anymore and it really breaks my heart. I\u2019m looking at selling my ski gear to make rent. Skiing is like the only thing that makes me happy and keeps me sane. I owe people money for bailing me out when I had absolutely nothing. My life is just not enjoyable anymore and I\u2019m sick and tired of being kicked in the ass when I\u2019m already on the ground. \n\nI have a bit of stuff to do before I go through with it and I\u2019m planning on starting that after work on Friday. Honestly, I just don\u2019t think I\u2019ll make it to the end of the semester. Things are getting worse and worse. Those little things that used to make life bearable are rapidly disappearing for me. \n\nMy only hesitation is making my mom sad. My boyfriend doesn\u2019t see a long term future with me so he\u2019ll be fine.
