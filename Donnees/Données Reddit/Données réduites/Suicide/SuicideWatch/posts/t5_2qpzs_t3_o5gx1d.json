I don\u2019t want to die but I just feel so disconnected from life. My friends probably hate me because I\u2019ve been so spacey and easily frustrated and cry so easily now with every little thing, I have a broken heart from a crush, and now I\u2019ve finally pushed everyone away under the excuse \u201cI need a break for my mental health\u201d\nNow what the hell do I do\nPost here? Burden more damn people with my sorry existence?\nAbout 85% of my brain is filled with static or at least that\u2019s the best way to describe it, 10% is heartache, and the other 5% is the small glimpse of happiness when people reach out and say they\u2019re here for me. That\u2019s the best way I can describe how I currently feel and I don\u2019t know what to do. My parents are the sort of people who are trying to understand mental health but would probably be reluctant or ask a ton of questions if I asked to see a therapist again, and I certainly don\u2019t want to be taken to a hospital or seem as broken for having suicidal thoughts. I\u2019ve only been diagnosed with GAD but I feel like I could have some kind of attention disorder or very slight autism since I just can\u2019t understand people sometimes (I hate self diagnosing but I worry so much I\u2019d like a test to just\u2026 relieve that I guess?) and since anxiety and depression are in hand and hand I want to get diagnosed with that ASAP but I just can\u2019t bring myself to ask for an appointment or ask for help outside of this subreddit where if I say the wrong thing I won\u2019t be escorted to a hospital or seen as wrong or a liar\nI feel so disconnected and just can\u2019t seem to find motivation anymore especially since it\u2019s summer where there\u2019s nothing to do to escape your thoughts \nI wish I had the balls to just take sleeping pills or od but I just couldn\u2019t, not yet at least, my family needs my help and support and so do some friends\nI just wish people would say they dare more without me seeming needy\nI wish people would ask how I am\n Wish people would care and not make me feel so replaceable, like I\u2019ll be here forever\nWhy is it so comforting to imagine people mourning me? Like I\u2019d matter more in death and at least then people could really care\nI just really needed to get this out since I\u2019ve pushed away anyone who would listen or even care at all thank you in advance if you read this far, I hope everyone has a wonderful day or night <3", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o5gx1d/increasing_suicidal_thoughts_and_numbness/", "title": "Increasing suicidal thoughts and numbness", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "anonymous183609", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624345687, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o5gx1d/increasing_suicidal_thoughts_and_numbness/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426801.1917732, "replies_charged": false}
