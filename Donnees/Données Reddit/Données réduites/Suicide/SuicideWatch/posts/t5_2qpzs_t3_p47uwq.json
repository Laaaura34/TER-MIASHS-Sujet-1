I see all these people living life and meeting people and having fun and everytime I try I just hate it. I\u2019m getting scared because I don\u2019t want to get better. I don\u2019t want to be convinced tht life is worth it because no matter what there\u2019s always going to be loss, mental and physical pain, heartbreak. I already have depression so things on top of that are just too much. I can\u2019t make eye contact anymore. I haven\u2019t gone out in months. i\u2019m tired of it all now. I don\u2019t want to exist. I don\u2019t want to be here anymore. I want everything to be over..
