It has expressed itself in an inner rage I feel every hour. I only want to harm myself. I don\u2019t think of harming others. I just want to escape but there is no where to run. My therapist appointments can\u2019t seem to get through. I just want to feel pleasure at any costs. I wish there was a true happy pill. I don\u2019t want to get on any stupid medication. I just want to cut. All I wanna do is get out. I hate this house, I hate this life, I just hate myself. I want to get away from this family and live in peace. Why can\u2019t I ever be fucking happy?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/meyza5/anger/", "title": "Anger", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DrakenJosh98", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616927617, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/meyza5/anger/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426837.1005838, "replies_charged": false}
