But I found that there is a low percentage of dying and it takes hours of pain to do. So, I didn't do it.\n\nI have thought about jumping from my room window, but I realized that I might only just break my back bc my room is on the 2nd floor (highest floor of my house).\n\nI have thought about roping, but I'm scared bc I had neck cramps before and I don't know where to hang the rope.\n\nI have also considered euthanasia. By 18, I will consider whether there is any hope in my life that I can get the life I want. I made this decision in freshmen hs at SeaWorld. I cried the whole day bc I was reminded how non-existent my own social life is. I just wanted to kill myself right there.\n\nBut I have never self-harmed. If I plan to die, I want it instant. A lot of my worries come with how I hate myself as a person, I hate how my family treats me like shit, and I hate that I have poor social skills for a social life.\n\nI have poor social skills - bad communication and body language. I cry many times - go to the bathroom when I notice my friends having a change in facial expression and eye contact with other friends. In summer school twice (I went to summer school 3 times in hs), I had 0 friends. I make an effort to make friends. People are just not interested in me bc I am quiet. It took 20 minutes to go to the cafeteria. I was so embarrassed to go alone, so I barely ate in those 2 weeks of summer school. I lost 7 pounds. Before in my life, I went through peer exclusion (kindergarten to 6th grade). I just sat alone everyday. I feel lonely most of the time. I am terrified of public speaking and I used to feel really conscious (think people are judging me for my appearance and body language along with conscious of how I walk, I would always cross my arms) when going into stores. Now, I don't really, but I'm quiet bc I overthink everything I say. I'm a complete wimp. I'm a coward and a loser.\n\nI also get stressed out with studies. I have pure hatred for it. Every year from elementary to middle school, the school threatened to kick me out bc of my bad grades. I was terrified of meeting strangers in a new school, so I worked hard. But I became an anxious person who would chant in my head to kill myself when things went wrong with work.\n\nI have also had terrible arguments with my parents. I can never have a proper conversation with my parents. I can't trust them. They complain about me, argue with me, and scream at me. When I was little, I got into arguments with my dad over me being rude. He said \"bloody idiot, you'll be miserable your whole life, disgusting piece of shit, I'll take you to a hostel, you're worthless, I'll break your bones, people will shit on your face\". When I cried, he would yell at me. My mom said it was annoying that I cried. I would get into arguments with my dad. When I said I'll wait to go to the bathroom after he is done shaving, he started kicking and punching me. There have been numerous times he has done this. One time, he got angry in the car that I was making a grumpy face and he jabbed his elbow into my arm. I screamed the f-word. He then went out of the car and punched in the face. I fell to the ground. I eventually found out I got a blue-green bruise on my arm. He never apologized. My mom didn't feel bad for me. When I was younger, I used to throw my stuffed animals at the wall thinking of my parents. When I was younger, I had murderous thoughts of skinning and blending my parents. Now, I don't anymore. I have expressed my frustration through a subtle way of showing the finger to my parents. During bad arguments, I mutter fuck you and go die.This happened after my dad started hitting me. He has taken me to the police station to disown me but didn't follow through.\n\n I have also had arguments with my mom. One argument got so bad. I hit her phone glass against the table, so I broke her phone glass.\n\nI have been obsessed with making plans. I cry in the bathroom when I see how other people treat my brother. I envy him. My parents respect him and treat him right. People have come to my brother to help guide their kids to become like him. People laugh around and love talking to him. He has leadership positions in tons of things. Meanwhile, I'm a wimp. \n\nTbh I don't have much hope in my life. But I just want 5 months for hope that I can really change.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/g7a4rq/is_it_normal_to_have_suicidal_thoughts/", "title": "Is it normal to have suicidal thoughts?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Quirky_King", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1587741278, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/g7a4rq/is_it_normal_to_have_suicidal_thoughts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427152.587957, "replies_charged": false}
