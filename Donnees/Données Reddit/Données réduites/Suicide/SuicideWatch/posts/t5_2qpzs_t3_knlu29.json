I can\u2019t help but feel trapped. It all happened at once, they found out about my cuts, they took me to a therapist, she found out, my dad found out about something with my gender, I can\u2019t even choose what I can tell people anymore. There\u2019s no reason for me to live other than my parents which makes me feel guilty, and I can\u2019t get HRT until I come out, and even then, I just don\u2019t know. My life is pointless, and I can\u2019t fucking end it. I\u2019m so tired, I want to die, I want to get high. I want to not be here. This is terrible. My mental health has been building up like this, and I just can\u2019t. I can\u2019t even kill myself if I want to. I don\u2019t have control and I\u2019m miserable.
