But I do, and even if it's all \"in my head\", that's a place I still need to escape from.\n\nI have my meds. They won't kill me, even a few weeks worth, but I hope they make me drowsy. I have chosen a place. I will take the meds and \"fall\" into the water once the overdose kicks in. Drowning is supposed to be unpleasant, but if I'm half-passed-out then it might be more peaceful. Regardless, it is worth a gamble. All I need to decide is which night to go, so I'm less likely to be seen or missed too soon. I haven't decided whether to leave a note. There are so many things I want to say, but a part of me wants to say nothing at all. \n\nMaybe I'm being selfish, thoughtless, overdramatic - maybe I'm not considering my partner, friends and family - but if all I hear is \"this too shall pass\" and \"it gets better\", why can't that apply to them, too? They can mourn me if they must, but it'll be a relief not to be burdened by me after the grief has worn off. They'll get better, and I will be better elsewhere.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbfzgn/i_think_there_is_nothing_out_there/", "title": "I think there is nothing out there.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Kefoxa", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634663359, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbfzgn/i_think_there_is_nothing_out_there/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426744.4158804, "replies_charged": false}
