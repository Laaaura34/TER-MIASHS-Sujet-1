I refuse to live outside of those terms because I can\u2019t see myself living for longer; I would have kms if I knew my life was going to be pointless.\n\n-The two people I have trusted are gone and I\u2019m too paranoid to talk about anything about how I feel.\n\n-I hate my job, I hate school, I hate just about everything in life except basketball, weights, listening to and making music, gaming, writing, anime, and making food. Living is very painful for me and everyday I am alive my soul is being eaten at.\n\n-Do you understand the feeling of being in so much agony that you regularly question if things are even real?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q4fd79/i_have_no_one_to_talk_to_cant_afford_therapy_and/", "title": "I have no one to talk to, can\u2019t afford therapy, and am starting to lose my sanity.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "YOUNG_SOSA_24", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633759441, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q4fd79/i_have_no_one_to_talk_to_cant_afford_therapy_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425183.6547132, "replies_charged": false}
