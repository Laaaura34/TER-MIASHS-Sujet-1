Everyday is fucking unbearable. I keep on fantasizing about suicide on the daily. I am failing at school and I am afraid I wont graduate.\nMy mom treats me well, I have plenty of friends and a loving girlfriend but still I feel miserable most of the time for no reason.\nCould be due to substance abuse. I used MDMA pretty frequently last summer.\nThese mood swings happen at completely random times even when I am around the people I love. I don't know how to help myself or what's causing all this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lxmpxs/constant_mood_swingsbreakdowns/", "title": "Constant mood swings/breakdowns", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "amess707", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614870850, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lxmpxs/constant_mood_swingsbreakdowns/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427625.0972757, "replies_charged": false}
