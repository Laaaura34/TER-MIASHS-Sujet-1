But this is not important, what important is that I can't take my life anymore. My mom is super strict and will yell at me if I don't do something simple. If I disrespect her, she will mentally manipulate me and say that how she can't live without me and all that shit. I seriously hate her, my mom is a mental manipulater and I don't like it. I'm considering to kill myself tonight, but I don't wanna die. Any advice please, it'll be much appreciated.
