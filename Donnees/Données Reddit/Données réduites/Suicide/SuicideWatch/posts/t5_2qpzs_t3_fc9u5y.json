Fuck, now that the roles are reversed, I\u2019m dripping with contempt for myself for ever trying to push them on someone whose world was falling apart and soul was somewhere in a dark corner of their mind, trying to hide and whimpering because the screaming and crying took their voice and the tears were all gone...for the moment. \n\nThe woman who I share a home and a bed with is supposed to be the one who opens her arms to hold me while I cry and to whisper those stupid platitudes to me. I thought that was the deal. That we signed up to catch each other, or at least fucking TRY, when one of us was falling under the weight of our world. To soothe me and tell me it will be ok. Even if it is a lie. \n\nBut she has long since passed giving a half-pence of a fuck about how things are in my head. She\u2019s focused on herself and where her life and her career are going. In her mind, she\u2019s done the holding and soothing thing a few times over the last five years and that should be enough for me to man up, shut the fuck up, and get on with life. \u201cThe world keeps moving with or without you!\u201d is what she tells me. Is it any shock that we haven\u2019t been intimate for at least five years?\n\nIt\u2019s the odd and/or shiny objects that get my attention. And keep it. For too long. I shouldn\u2019t linger in my gaze at a fresh pack of utility knife blades, or at the 12 feet of concrete in the upcoming bridge abutment off to my left as I drive. I definitely shouldn\u2019t look so intently at the lugs on one of the 480V feeds in an open cabinet while we service a piece of equipment at work. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever go that direction for the electrocution would be quick as it stops my heart but I can\u2019t chance my clothes catching fire and causing me to let go before my heart gives up. I can\u2019t burn. It\u2019s my worst fear and it haunts me. \ud83e\udd7a\n\nI\u2019m 42 and I have no fucking right to be complaining. SO many people have it SO much worse than I do! I have a good job that pays great. I have a family who loves me (except for the one I live with) and yet all I think about are ways to escape. To find a way to get away from it all. To find a place where I can\u2019t fall in love with someone and to know they love me back but to also know that, as soon as a younger, hotter, more chiseled, farther ahead in life or even just rocking a third leg, that love will dissipate like it never existed and the loneliness will swallow me whole again. \n\nI desperately want to believe that there\u2019s something better and I just haven\u2019t found it yet. \n\nMaybe there is......but I don\u2019t think I have enough left in me to make it that long. I only have a few \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re cute and all but...look at how cut he is.\u201d  and \u201cYeah, sorry, dude. You just aren\u2019t quite good enough.\u201d Left in me. \n\nThanks for anyone who read all of that drivel. \n\nTL/DR: I\u2019m not worth the full version or even a recap. \n\nGoodnight, all. Time to lay down and let the nightmares take me away. xo", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fc9u5y/tipping_over_the_edge/", "title": "Tipping Over the Edge", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MrCharmGeek", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1583142729, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fc9u5y/tipping_over_the_edge/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422329.8060834, "replies_charged": false}
