And I know I'll be letting them down one more time. But the last thing they need is to see me institutionalized after I completely break down. And unfortunately it's just a matter of time, weeks maybe a few months at best. I'm having more and more trouble holding on each day and I have started to be unable to keep the facade from crumbling in front of the children. They don't need to see me crying in the fetal position because something triggered a memory.\n\nThere is just unfortunately no ability for me to find that center, that faith and strength that you need to live and be open to the joy of life. My world is gray and bleak and lonely at best. Every memory I have cuts so deeply if I stop and think it will bring me to my knees. What used to bring me comfort and happiness reminds spreads misery and hopelessness now. The happier the memory is the more painful it has become a reminder of what I never had a chance to hold onto. If someone convinces themselves of their own lie it becomes their truth but to lose a decade and a half of my life, all the best moments I have had, and any hope for a better day in the future, to ghosts and accusations is more than I can stand. I am not the person they think I am but it doesn't matter they refuse to open their eyes and their hearts. They say they want you to talk and then when you do you get anger or silence. The only way I can get rid of this person they think I am is to get rid of me as well. It's causing me to lose my grip like there's another identity in my head..... Christ the problems that come from a lack of compassion and communication. Lack of care lack of heart. And now I have no heart left.\n\nIt literally feels like my heart has been ripped from my chest and somehow I still feel the pain. But nothing else. This is no way to live. This is terminal depression and I cannot wait for it to end. My body may live but my soul is gone and I simply must desert this life. There is nothing but pain, more and more everyday, and misunderstanding and hate. My hate for myself, this life and this false narrative. I have tried so hard for so long to correct it and such a short time ago everything was falling in place I thought. But I had been abandoned long ago. Abused or ignored for months. Watched the most sacred thing in my life tossed aside like garbage. So now I have fifteen years of menories that are each more painful than the last and I can't stop thinking about them. If I could fall out of love I would have by now. But it's the pain of loneliness or the more acute pain of being walled off from those you love even if they are right next to you. There's no option for the future that results in anything but more and more pain until I lose it completely. So the only option is to remove my future. This isn't impulsive this is considered and reconsidered and while weak and a bit selfish I cannot find an argument for another way forward. I can't stand the look of disdain and the thought that some of the horrible things you just accepted without seeing how ridiculous it was or even talking to me. The thought that you believed your husband didn't love you and only you. The confusion as to why you repeatedly broke the one promise I asked you to make. But it made more sense to you to just believe anything no matter how crazy rather than communicate, because it's easier maybe I don't know. And my biggest mistake was the drugs I am not condoning that. But I stopped months ago and confessed everything and have been transparent while you are probably still lying to my face.\n\nI know you're the worst poison in the world for me but when I gave you my heart I told you I couldn't take it back this time. And anytime the pieces start to get picked up it shatters again. I think I could actually stab myself or slit my wrists if I just focus on the relief coming after the pain. I am already in more pain than I can describe so it would not be too bad. I started cutting myself and that actually hurts less than thinking about the short time left in my life. It might even be like that.\n\nThe worst part is this is not how I want to feel or what I want to do. I've tried to find some way to right things and some shred of hope of happiness in the future but there's only one way I can stop loving you.
