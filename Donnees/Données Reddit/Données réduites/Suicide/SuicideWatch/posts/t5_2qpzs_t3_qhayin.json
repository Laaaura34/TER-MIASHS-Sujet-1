I\u2019m such an unlikable person though I deserved it. The numbing for the stitches didn\u2019t even work but I didn\u2019t say anything cuz I didn\u2019t deserve it. So I sat there and let them give me stitches feeling most of it. I\u2019m probably gonna do it again today lol. Laugh out loud soo funny. It\u2019ll be funny when my body is seizing out bc I have a stomach full of pills. Which I\u2019m about to do at this point. I\u2019m honestly a whore so I probably deserve all this shit. I give everyone I meet a reason to not like me. I try to be nice and making people dislike me is all I do.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qhayin/i_give_everyone_i_meet_a_reason_to_not_like_me/", "title": "I give everyone I meet a reason to not like me", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Garden-Dazzling", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635382020, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qhayin/i_give_everyone_i_meet_a_reason_to_not_like_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427001.1340966, "replies_charged": false}
