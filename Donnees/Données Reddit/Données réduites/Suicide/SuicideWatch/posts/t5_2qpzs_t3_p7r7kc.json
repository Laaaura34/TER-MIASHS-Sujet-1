I just lay around feeling miserable and wanting to go to sleep and never wake up. I\u2019m practically dead so why do people make a big deal out of me wanting to kill myself? It feels like I\u2019m in this weird stage in between life and actual death, and the way to achieve actual death and peace is to just kill myself so why can nobody see that? Why is everyone so selfish? They\u2019re \u201ctrying\u201d to keep me from doing it and being at peace for once. I\u2019m so fucking done with everyone\u2019s bullshit.
