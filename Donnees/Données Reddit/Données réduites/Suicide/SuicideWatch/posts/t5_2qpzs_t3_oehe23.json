And not romantic love exclusively, because even platonic love is enough..\n\nBut I just crave love.\n\nI have friends and family who care for me, but none in the way that I care for them.\n\nWhat I mean by this, is no one actively invests time and love into our relationship. It\u2019s passive and conditional.\n\nI guess what I yearn for then is a warm and considerate kind of love. Something I like to think I offer to everyone in my life. As best I can anyway.\n\nI put in the work to make friends, to be a better person (thoughtful, considerate, kind and patient), but rarely does it ever seem reciprocated.\n\nNot that I do these things solely to have something in return, but it\u2019d be nice to be the one cared for for once\u2026\n\nTo be supported and thought of, to have someone go out of their way for me because they see me as worth their time and efforts. To be held and just kept company when I express any form of melancholy.\n\nThe unconditional kind of love that makes you feel less alone, that you comfortably give in return because.. well what\u2019s life without loving. \n\nI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s something that shouldn\u2019t be so difficult to find in another person, but it is. And the seemingly endless trek of it is exhausting.\n\nI\u2019d almost rather seek it in the next life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oehe23/will_i_be_alone_forever/", "title": "Will I be alone forever?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Komorxbi", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625522431, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oehe23/will_i_be_alone_forever/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427119.0916464, "replies_charged": false}
