I\u2019m too scared to live too scared to be dead. I\u2019ve tried working out in the past, 2-3 times a week, 40-1 hour sessions, never really made me any different, maybe that\u2019s my fault for doing nothing. \n\nI moved to another country, not going to school, don\u2019t know anyone here. I feel like my morals have become skeletal, and my apathy absolutely obstructing. I don\u2019t care about anyone not even my self. I have interests, sure, but that\u2019s not the same as working out like everyone has said. I don\u2019t want validation, I want answers on what to do with myself and how to change my horrible mind entirely. I feel trapped in a hole covered up by a massive boulder. I don\u2019t feel sad or upset about my life until I\u2019m called out on it by a shitty meme that makes me self conscious. Am I validation seeking? \n\nI can\u2019t trust my mind. All my emotions feel invisible, I don\u2019t know if my emotions are real or not or some stupid made up shit of selfishness and hedonism. \n\nI don\u2019t trust my mind at all, it\u2019s a fabricator that can\u2019t get myself up to do shit for the life of it and it\u2019s all my fault because I can\u2019t get into it because I never really try, and I feel like it\u2019ll stay that way until one day I actually stop being afraid of killing myself and it ends there, another failure, I only hear of the people that made it or are getting there, never of the ones that are in the pit still and can\u2019t get started or the ones that actually are gone.\n\nPlease I don\u2019t know if this is the right sub I just want some guidance, I\u2019ve given up on myself, I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m able to be sad about this truly.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/px2lww/i_dont_know_where_to_go_i_never_did_any_kind_of/", "title": "I don\u2019t know where to go.
