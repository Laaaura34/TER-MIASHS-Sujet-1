I\u2019m an alcoholic and have been for 8 years. I\u2019m 25 years old. I\u2019ve slowly been ruining my life since 17 with poor choices almost exclusively caused by drinking, a post on my history shows one of hundreds of choices made when drunk. This next conviction due to my previous history of court appearances relating to alcohol will surely cause the court to throw the book at me for good.\n\nWhen I was arrested I had a passenger, someone who I\u2019ve never connected with so much in my entire life and was told today understandably that she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work. \n\nSince being released I\u2019ve had nothing but the thought of taking my own life, I\u2019ve had an attempt before where they almost air lifted me for transplant due to the injuries I sustained. I\u2019ve ruined my life for the last time I think. No friends, no girlfriend, ashamed family and I\u2019ve had enough with myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lrr7zc/i_dont_know_if_i_can_tackle_this/", "title": "I don\u2019t know if I can tackle this", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MadeforUp", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614211853, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lrr7zc/i_dont_know_if_i_can_tackle_this/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427145.3142624, "replies_charged": false}
