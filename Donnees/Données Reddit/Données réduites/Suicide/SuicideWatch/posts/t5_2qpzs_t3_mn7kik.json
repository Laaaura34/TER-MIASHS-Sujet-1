My wife spends lots of time cooking good meals for us and I let her down by doing this not to mention spent lots of our money on this. I really hate myself for having done this again and I want to die in order to prevent myself from continuing to make these same decisions that keep hurting her emotionally. I\u2019m so pathetic and worthless and cannot be trusted. I just want to die.
