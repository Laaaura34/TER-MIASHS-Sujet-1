I still have my daughters but they\u2019re young and I can\u2019t provide adequately for them.  I love them so much but I have failed to provide them a place of their own to live in. We are currently living with my mother and it\u2019s not the most positive place for them. My mental health is not the best and it gets worse everyday and the worst part is I can\u2019t even seek help for it because then Baby Daddy will use it as an excuse to seek full custody and they won\u2019t be in any better place with them.  Sure he\u2019ll provide the basic necessities but what about mental health wise? I mean is depression hereditary? Can one or both of my girls inherit my suicidal tendencies? My dark thoughts? How will he be able to take care of them when they get dark and negative thoughts? I\u2019m all over the place here I know but I just needed to get some things off of my chest.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qckkrj/suicidal_thoughts/", "title": "Suicidal thoughts", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Sakura3201", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634794405, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qckkrj/suicidal_thoughts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427348.2612603, "replies_charged": false}
