It was right after my parents and sister were fighting, we got beaten real bad. Im so fucking done with my parents, so i went upstairs and hung myself. No one found me. I stayed there for about 10 seconds and could already feel the unconsciousness hitting in. I got out of the rope, though i struggled against it. I still dont know why i did. My coward ass stopped another chance. It felt almost like adrenaline. Idk how to deal with anything anymore, im so fucking useless. Another failed suicide attempt.
