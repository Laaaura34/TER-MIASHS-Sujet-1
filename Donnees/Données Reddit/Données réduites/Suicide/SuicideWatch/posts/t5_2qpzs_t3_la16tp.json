Showering and brushing my teeth feels like a day's worth of accomplishment. I don't know what to do when my brain is this wired but every other part of me feels like it's gonna fall off. I think of myself as a strong person, I've been through way worse than this but right now the tiniest thing derails my routine that I'm addicted to. My heated blanket broke and the family I live with doesn't keep the heat on. It's probably 55 in my room right now and getting colder. I used to turn it on and put it on my back while I wrapped my front in my blanket then I could sleep for 3-4 hours but I'm just too cold. I don't want to kill myself yet, but I feel like that's an option that just popped up from how sucky life is. I might try to get in the bath and plug the drain and sleep in warm water for an hour or two before my foster parents wake up.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/la16tp/insomnia_exhausts_me_mentally/", "title": "Insomnia exhausts me mentally", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "marikosu", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612179438, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/la16tp/insomnia_exhausts_me_mentally/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426515.179092, "replies_charged": false}
