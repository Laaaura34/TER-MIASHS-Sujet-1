I would describe myself as empty, but I feel very deeply. I've come to realize that, at times, I lack an emotional object permanence. In simple terms, \"Object permanence\" is the understanding that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be directly perceived; you know there are crayons in the box because you saw me place one in there, yet your eyes do not make contact with the form of the crayon when I close the box. when I close the box. Emotional object permanence is where I understand that I have felt these emotions before and that they have existed in me, in some form, before this moment.\n\nA lack of that causes me to feel sadness, despair, anger or happiness in ways that I would describe as \"never having felt before\". Sometimes, I seem to experience certain emotions for the first time and it can be overwhelming. A caveat to this is that since I cannot recollect the last time I felt that way, I tend to believe that I have always felt this way and will continue to do so for all eternity. \n\nI think this is some kind of black/white thinking; these are some kind of distorted thoughts. It is what drives me into self harm and suicidal behavior. I am struggling with despair at the moment and trying to remind myself I have been here before.
