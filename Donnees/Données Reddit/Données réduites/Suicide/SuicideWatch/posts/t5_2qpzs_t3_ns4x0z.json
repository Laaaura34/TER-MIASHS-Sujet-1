It\u2019s selfish on everyone else\u2019s part to discourage me from doing it just to keep me around.\n\nI\u2019ve had more great life experiences in 30 years than millions of people will have in their entire life. What if that\u2019s enough for me? Why can\u2019t it be my choice? \n\nGo ahead call me ungrateful being fortunate with physical health, a good job and family/friends. But I\u2019m sick of being that awkward asshole that sticks out like a sore thumb and nobody knows what to do with. No I\u2019m not the only one with personal issues and no not the only one who deals with depression. But I AM ABSOLUTELY alone in the hundreds of people I associate with on a regular basis and it makes me hate everyone for having normal lives in comparison. Moving along with a smile on their face, improving themselves, not clearly hating themselves.\n\nMeanwhile I can barely look anyone in the eye. And like above everyone knows I\u2019m a mess in the head but doesn\u2019t know what to do with me. Not their fault.\n\nWhy is it that saying I quit is frowned upon so much. I have to stick around and sacrifice myself for everyone else I guess.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ns4x0z/what_if_im_satisfied_with_my_life/", "title": "What if I\u2019m satisfied with my life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Think_Form663", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622812674, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ns4x0z/what_if_im_satisfied_with_my_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428234.3399193, "replies_charged": false}
