I\u2019m tired and constantly daydream of finding that easy way out. I have a job that should be really fulfilling, but I just want to fucking blow my brains out after work day after day. I live alone and am constantly seeking attention from older men on Grindr. None of that really brings me happiness. I have friends that love me, but they all live in California and my job is in Connecticut. I have family that loves me, but I don\u2019t really feel attached to them. I really just don\u2019t see the point anymore. What, is it so I can keep breathing and eating? I jus want to not feel anything anymore. I\u2019ve been sober for over a year now and honestly, I don\u2019t feel better. I\u2019ve got Tourette\u2019s, Harm OCD, Bipolar Depression, Bulimia, etc and I\u2019m trying so hard to manage, but why keep \u201cmanaging?\u201d I\u2019m not trying throw a pity party, I\u2019m just a hundred thousand in debt and cannot see a happy future for myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mp4ppn/im_tired_of_all_this/", "title": "I\u2019m tired of all this", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Poopypants278", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618193487, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mp4ppn/im_tired_of_all_this/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422929.9614797, "replies_charged": false}
