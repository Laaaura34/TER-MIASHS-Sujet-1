When there is no external source of destruction you become your own source of destruction. Why do I want to hurt myself so badly? I don\u2019t understand how I can hate myself so much. If I like something about myself it\u2019s definitely my self hatred. There\u2019s something soothing about it. Something soothing to know I can end it all at any moment. Humans, we are so vulnerable, we can die just by...nothing, just by laughing while you\u2019re eating. I feel such relief to know that and also some pride, in knowing out of all the ways to die, I get to choose how and when. I guess that\u2019s what I like about hating myself so much, being able to control myself and my life.\n\nI spent my days ruminating of different ways I can hurt myself, ways to destroy my body by drugs, alcohol, starvation and ways to kill myself. I\u2019ve fantasized about my death since I was a teen, even smaller I\u2019d dare to say.\n\nI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s something wrong with me, sometimes I feel I\u2019m not actually here. I feel I'm doing things on autopilot, as if someone else is doing the things for me. Who is that other person or thing? Or who am I? What if I\u2019m the intruder? Sometimes I don\u2019t even feel my body, I\u2019m just...there, somewhere.\n\nI\u2019m not even getting started on the feeling of not belonging in this world or in my family. I cannot even explain what I feel...so disconnected from everything and everyone. I wish there was a way for me to canalize these feelings into something, create something while feeling understood or heard depending on my creations. I just have this mediocre writing that no one will ever read. If I were to choose a talent it would definitely be music. Sing, play instruments, produce, song writer or whatever that will introduce me to that world. I think we are all born with potential to do something great, but if our parents didn\u2019t push us, then we do nothing, such as.\n\nSometimes I don\u2019t even feel sad, I just feel so out of place, it\u2019s unbearable. I feel my mision, whatever it was, is over now and it\u2019s time to go. The only thing that will stop me, if I decide to attach myself to something, it\u2019ll be my mother, just wait for her to leave as well.\n\nWhen I think of killing myself I don\u2019t feel afraid, I feel peace, I feel as if I\u2019ve accomplished something...perhaps accomplished living, I feel ready, I feel ok with it. I do wish my death happens naturally though, just because I don\u2019t want my mother to suffer from my suicide. I think she will suffer more knowing I\u2019ve commited suicide than if I\u2019d die from other causes.\n\nI feel so confused and lost that the only way out is to leave this world. I don\u2019t think I can ever find \u2018\u2019my way\u2019\u2019, that has never been the case. You know when you\u2019re a teenager and just feel so lost? You don\u2019t know who you are, what you\u2019re doing here, what you\u2019re going to do, you just hope it\u2019s something good, I feel that ten times fold and I\u2019ve been feeling it ever since I can remember.\n\nLife is beautiful, I do think life is beautiful. All it\u2019s little things are so magnificent, how we have everything we need to survive and more, is it a miracle or evolution?  But once you get past that visual effect of a beautiful life, you can see what life really means...nothing. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a true meaning for life but to experience different ones.\n\nI feel very deeply, I experienced so much happiness that it couldn\u2019t fit in my body, made me feel electric but I also experienced that same amount of pain, made me feel dissociated, disconnected and so utterly empty.\n\nWhatever.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbve2y/thoughts_of_a_suicidal/", "title": "Thoughts of a suicidal", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Lost-Abroad-9796", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634715045, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbve2y/thoughts_of_a_suicidal/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427991.3646147, "replies_charged": false}
