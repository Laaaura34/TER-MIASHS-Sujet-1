Only someone who suffers with it could fully understand it . Anyway , that's not the only thing . Ive had this for about a year now and I'm pretty used to the zombie life by now . But I'm in my 12th grade . I have to work really to do what I want to do . It feels like Everything in the universe seems to be working . I feel like I'm being tortured . \n\nMy theory is that god or whatever created me , made a mistake . Like I'm a defected piece in the factory . Because nothing makes sense to me . I feel an alien in this world . How do I stay alive when I'm being constantly urged to kill myself . Honestly dude life is really overrated . I'm done waiting . ( Btw I don't really have the balls to take my life , so your right this is  just pointless)  .", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q38hxx/im_really_tired/", "title": "I'm really tired", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "jahnavi-bs43421", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633611412, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q38hxx/im_really_tired/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426548.956172, "replies_charged": false}
