I have female issues that cause my hormones to fluctuate drastically during my monthly cycle. The worst of it is when it causes me to have insomnia. The days that I haven\u2019t slept or I have slept 3-4 hours my suicide ideation is full blown.  If I happen to get 8+hours I am happy, focused, and don\u2019t think about death or how miserable my life has been... I just wake up and handle life. \nHas anyone else experienced this?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lq4s41/insomnia_and_suicide_correlation/", "title": "Insomnia and Suicide Correlation", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AsIf927", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614041004, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lq4s41/insomnia_and_suicide_correlation/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426511.1670556, "replies_charged": false}
