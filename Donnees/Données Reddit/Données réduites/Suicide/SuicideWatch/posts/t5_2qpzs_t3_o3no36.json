I have been googling this topic for the past day and found some similar instances on here. I don't know where else to go.\n\nMy best friend has been very depressed for some time now. She has mentioned killing herself before, but yesterday she was different. She was fixated on. She had a plan. The entire day she was saying, via text and phone, that when she got home from work, she was going to take her gun and shoot herself in the head. I tried to talk to her, but anything I said was not responded to.....only some variation of \"I am blowing my brains out tonight\" and crying. This continued on the entire day. I asked if she would come talk to me or have lunch with me; I said I would go to her. At that point I knew it was time for her to be off work. She had turned her phone off. I couldn't contact her. On top of it all, she has attempted suicide before by way of alcohol and a bottle of pills. I called 911.\n\nThe police were at her house when she arrived. They took her to the hospital. Now she is in the psych-ward for at least 72 hours.\n\nBefore she was taken to the psych-ward, she was was able to call and text me. The call was very quick and she hung up on me before I could respond. To sum it up, she said that she was pissed; she said I wouldn't be hearing from her, to never contact her ever again. She said she was venting and talking out of haste (about shooting herself).\n\nMy best friend. The kind of friend that comes maybe once in a lifetime. I am heartbroken and can't stop crying myself today.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o3no36/called_911_on_friend/", "title": "Called 911 On Friend", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "CincyEJ", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624130264, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o3no36/called_911_on_friend/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428112.1642983, "replies_charged": false}
