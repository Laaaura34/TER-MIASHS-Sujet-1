We had a very strained relationship. My dad is bipolar with borderline personality disorder, I haven\u2019t talked to him since he tried to attack me shortly after Mum died. I have one older brother. He witnessed and contributed to the abuse I dealt with.\n\nI was half way through my uni degree when Mum died. I\u2019ve tried to finish several times and always flunk out. I owe thousands for a degree I\u2019ll never get.\nI live in a rundown apartment, the best I can afford on my minimum wage job. \nI have no friends, my boyfriend dumped me citing my panic attacks a the straw that broke the camels back.\nI don\u2019t want to live. I\u2019ve tried medications, meditation, exercise etc. \n\nI always end up in the same place. I am alone and unloved. The only thing keeping me here was the one person who loved me. I\u2019ve reached out to everyone I thought would care if I died. No one responded. I have a few days off from work. I\u2019m going to clean the apartment and write my notes. There is nothing keeping me here.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this much, I thank you. That is more care than anyone has given me in a long time.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/j1nveo/i_feel_like_my_default_mood_is_suicidal/", "title": "I feel like my default mood is suicidal", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Purplerobot23", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 733, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1601336932, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/j1nveo/i_feel_like_my_default_mood_is_suicidal/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427613.8980796, "replies_charged": false}
