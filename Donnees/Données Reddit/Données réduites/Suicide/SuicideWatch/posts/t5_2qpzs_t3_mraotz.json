I look at my past and immediately find a fuck up in almost every interaction I've had with another living soul. I've ruined the to be best moments of my life so far with unneeded cringe behavior. I am at best mediocre in most things I do and the few things I do to satisfaction take unprecedented amount of time and energy to achieve. I have nothing, but an undeserved loving mother who carries me through life and couple of supportive people who overestimate me based on the fecad I put on for them... Oh and LOTS of ADHD and behaviours formed over years to appease the boredom that results from it.\n\nAnd here I am posting here for stranger's attention in a subreddit where they are REQUIRED TO BE NICE TO ME, knowing nothing can change my mind.\n\nMy state of being disgusts me and changing it takes way more energy than I seem to be able to put forth.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mraotz/i_hate_myself_original_i_know/", "title": "I hate myself..
