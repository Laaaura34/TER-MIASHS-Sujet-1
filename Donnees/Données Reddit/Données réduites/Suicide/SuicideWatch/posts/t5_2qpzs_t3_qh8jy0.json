do not misunderstand that place has never been my home but somehow the love of the sea has always stayed with me even as I moved to the Desert Paradise that is Utah almost as foreign of a place as Could Be Imagined comparatively but this is the place that I call home and will always be my early childhood was rather uneventful other than 2 life lessons I learned which were 1 that those surrounding me had little-to-no faith in me and 2 that I was exceptionally good at manipulating those around me including adults As I Grew Older I learned to use that ability to make my way through and to entertain myself at the expense of others the real fun started in my adolescence this is where I had my rude awakening to the harshness of life in the 8th grade watched a classmate getting stabbed in the chest repeatedly with a pencil in the middle of class for seemingly no reason this was the point when I learned life was not what I had been told it was life is not kind life is not fair and most of all it could care less one way or another so I learned how to take care of things myself the school I was going to at this time was primarily for violent kids to this day I still do not know how I ended up there but I had to learn how to survive and even thrive in such an environment early on I tried staying out of the way the best I could but that didn't always work so I learned if I could make myself valuable I would be safe my first step in this was creating a racket in the school system where we had a school store where the students could buy snacks on brakes the catch being you didn't get to take breaks if you were in detention which most of these kids were constantly in so I figured since I was never in detention I could collect the money plus a small fee for whatever they wanted I made a good bit of money doing this as well as earned my safety because no one would mess with the kid that can get you whatever you want this is not the only racket that I set up but it is what I built everything else upon I would also take upon piecemeal jobs one of them being many of the kids did not like one of the teachers we had so I came up with a plan to get them fired for them something very simple but very effective I would befriend her find out all the personal details that I could and use them against her along with the rest of the class to make her hate being there so much she would simply leave no questions and it worked much to my own amazement as well as the other classmates another one of these was teaching one of them how to distribute drugs with no fear of ramifications it was a simple enough process simply arranged quantities and prices beforehand and then dead drop the product and cash separately little did I know he was one of the most feared and respected kids there and by doing this I earned his respect after that day it was simply understood by the rest of the students they were not to touch me this allowed me to focus much more on my academics then constantly being on edge and looking for a way to appease those around me but this freedom allowed me to wander so to speak I started walking down a darker and darker path the typical story of running with a bad crowd starts with cigarettes in the church parking lot and then it just seems to work its way up from there experimenting with different things sometimes merely for the fun of it other times to try to cover up the day to day stress but everything changed when I transferred out for my senior year of high school leaving a school of violent criminals and degenerates to a school filled with snooty rich kids everything I had learned had to be thrown out the window one year in this environment was more stressful then my four years in the previous as I was now in a crowd of people I did not understand the one caveat of this was that I was able to take almost exclusively elective courses such as shop jewelry theater and debate and this is where I learned that I had almost zero aptitude for the traditional Arts but what I lacked in those fields I excelled in the technical fields in shop class I learned it took almost no effort to complete Advanced projects but my favorite was always debate as a seemingly could always find a way into a winning position in any argument especially the philosophical during this time I formed a love for psychology and philosophy as well as manual trades\n\nthis is my story from birth until 18 i am 30 now will share more if anyone wants to know", "url":
