It\u2019s just too out of character. I\u2019ve been so apathetic recently. I got to the point of being so confused I turned off my emotions. This is wild in of itself. I\u2019ve always been a feeler and empathetic but I just feel empty and worthless and so so nothing. That\u2019s just the feeling is nothing and I hate it cause normally I burn when things get this bad. I don\u2019t wanna talk to people cause I feel like I\u2019m being a burden but if I don\u2019t talk to them I won\u2019t be able to help myself. This feeling is awful and I don\u2019t have an appetite anymore which is scary and I don\u2019t want to relapse and self harm or redevelop bulimia. I\u2019m so lost and so scared and so cold. I\u2019m sorry this post is all over the place. This is the first time I\u2019ve gotten words out for my feelings in a few days.
