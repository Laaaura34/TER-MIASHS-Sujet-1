But the more I think about it, the more it feels like I would just be cutting off the infected limb - me - before my necrosis spreads and infects everyone around me, including those who hold me dearest. Those who I don't wish to hurt any more.\n\nI live in a coastal town. I think drowning would be the way that would leave the least amount of mess and bother for those left behind.  Yes, I think that's the way.\n\nBut if I was complete in my conviction, would I post here? Ah, who knows. None of you know who I am or what I am or anything about my situation, so none of you can truly want to keep me alive for any credible reason. I think cries for help can be legitimate, so long as they aren't solely motivated by the need for attention or aggrandizement. I'm also drunk, which is a thing I have taken to becoming almost every night, which I find lends a clarity of sorts to my thought processes. Muddy in some, crystal fucking clear in others. So let me summarize:\n\nI am married 10 years to a woman who loves me despite my shortcomings, who desires me despite my physical failings, who clings to me all the more tightly the more distant I become. I have, in her and in her love, something I know many people are never fortunate enough to have in their entire lives: someone who chooses to love them unconditionally. And I? \n\nI am no longer in love with her. \n\nThe story is too long to here tell; suffice to say, we have grown in 10 years into vastly different people than we once were, and the person I have become is incapable of finding her to be much more than insufferable, foolish, childish, and incapable of growing into a fully realized adult. Despite this, I cannot bring myself to leave her and thereby directly hurt her. Thus, removing myself from the equation at least leaves her with a fighting chance of moving on and growing beyond the fucking idiot she chooses to be.\n\nI'm a monster, I know. And my monstrosity hurts her more every day. She knows on some level that I am no longer in love with her. She asks me, more often than casually, why I am still with her. I do love her; that I know. I always will. But with every passing day, I find this life we have built for ourselves increasingly unbearable. If I am gone, she will at least have fighting chance at happiness once she heals.\n\nNone of this have I said to her directly. She has no idea how far gone I am. I hope that will ultimately make her transition easier.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/d5cdev/i_think_ive_hit_the_calm_before_the_end_but_some/", "title": "I think I've hit the calm before the end, but some part of me is idiotically holding on.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "NotTooMuchAnymore", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1568697061, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/d5cdev/i_think_ive_hit_the_calm_before_the_end_but_some/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426246.2953687, "replies_charged": false}
