But since this past week it\u2019s gotten to a point where I feel I can\u2019t escape it. I\u2019m in therapy and it doesn\u2019t seem to be working. My gf wants me to get evaluated which I do not want to do. Just the anger and depression over power ant positive thoughts I have anymore. I was diagnosed with severe depression but I already knew that. I would way rather be sad then angry but I\u2019m both constantly and it\u2019s so hard to bare. I lash out at people that I don\u2019t mean to. I plot how I\u2019m gonna leave then back to normal for a few hours then something triggers it again I don\u2019t know how to keep living with this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pucf13/my_anger_issues_keep_getting_worse_and_worse/", "title": "My anger issues keep getting worse and worse", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "HiddenH1", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632457995, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pucf13/my_anger_issues_keep_getting_worse_and_worse/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426815.58079, "replies_charged": false}
