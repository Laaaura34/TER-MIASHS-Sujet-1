I've gone through all the stupid short term support things and what-not, I've tried to find ways to motivate myself to live on. I've even tricked myself into thinking there is something out there for me, which is a lie.\n\nI haven't slept soundly in nearly 2 weeks now and I find myself sitting here thinking about the things I wanted to do, all of which seem unrealistic, and then I think about all the motivational speeches i've heard. They all said one thing in common \"people told me it was unrealistic, and that i couldn't do it - I proved them wrong\" But I don't have that drive, i'm here suffering over the anxiety and lack of belief in myself that i've tried to fix, i've tried so so fucking hard to find a way to stop it, but something everyone who hasn't suffered with anxiety forgets - it's not as easy as not caring, anxiety is a preset feeling or reaction to something. I don't choose to feel this way.\n\nI've thought for hours upon hours of what I think makes me happy in life, or rather, what puts a legitimate temporary smile on my face. (seeing as I haven't truly been happy for 5 years) and there is nothing I can do, absolutely nothing that I can do to bring myself close to those feelings. They are blown way out of proportion, way out of my personal ability with this stupid lack of drive (or lack of anything).\n\nI don't particularly have people to talk to, it's one of those things where everyone you see will tell you that you can talk to them any time and they will try to help, but that's not true at all, everyone has their own lives to deal with, I've never had someone I can really label as a legitimate \"best friend\" I can go to for anything. So I've ended up writing vicious and degrading notes to myself to express how i'm feeling on paper to try and get it out my head. At times I've lost all sense of reality and just walked out the door and just walked, aimlessly on autopilot with a strong feeling of just not wanting to exist, wanting death quite frankly.\n\nBut then I am scared of death very much. the pain it can cause yourself is unknown until you attempt it, what if it doesn't work and leaves you in an even worse, crippled state. So as a positive, yeah i'm pretty scared out of doing it, probably why i'm still alive, however the problem with this is I have no outlet, So during these times because I don't have the strength to end it all, I become frantic, I feel like I need to do something, But I don't know what, i've given myself bruises on my leg from just battering it with my hand. A year or 2 ago I viciously punched at a fire door, put a hole in it and bloodied my hand (still got the scars) and when I can refrain myself from doing things like this and just sat with my arms wrapped around my legs gripping onto them, I just don't feel alone, I can't stop frantically twitching and crying.\n\nSo then there's me now, right this moment. I feel empty, there are things i should be doing (writing essays and shit) and I'm not. I simply can't, I feel crippled and unable to do anything positive and that the next small thing will throw me into another frenzy, and I don't know what I will do.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dicvyt/its_not_working_i_truly_dont_think_i_can_do_this/", "title": "It's not working, I truly don't think I can do this anymore.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DC-InSomniac", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1571167308, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dicvyt/its_not_working_i_truly_dont_think_i_can_do_this/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422331.5617383, "replies_charged": false}
