I took 78 20mg capsules of prozac and drank about half a bottle of rum before falling asleep.\n\nI was found unresponsive three hours later and I was taken to the hospital in which I had suddenly seemed to be mysteriously in an unrecognizable place until I realized what I did to myself early that morning. Not only physically and emotionally numb (maybe it was the IV\u2019s) was I incredibly devastated to still be here. \n\nI was told that both my parents were at the hospital but had gone to get food for themselves. I had my stomach pumped and was under monitoring for a little over a day in which I saw a few people and spoke with them which ultimately lead to my release.\n\nIt\u2019s been a month since then and I\u2019ve honestly never felt better. To those who may experience the same or similar to me, you probably understand what I mean when I say that on most days you\u2019d much rather stay asleep forever than wake up and deal with the pain, hopelessness and melancholy every single living moment.\n\nBut right now I\u2019m doing pretty good. Not really doing much because of this covid shit (maybe I\u2019m just lazy as shit) but I\u2019ve been overall somewhat content being here and semi-excited to see what I can accomplish.
