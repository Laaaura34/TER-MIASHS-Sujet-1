Although, it sucks i went through all that shit when i was younger and isolated myself to cope. I was going to have problems one way or another its just the way ive been viewing myself as the woe is me type person has destroyed my social circles and the ones who i believe i love. I lacked moments to emphasize with people growing up due to the isolation. Im pretty sure theyd call it antisocial disorder. I want to reframe my self image but idk how. I want to express myself but now thinking about how ive been doing this for so long i wouldnt know where to start. Plus theirs the fact that everyone thats ever been in my life is gone and im left in a house with people i slightly resent while also understand that im a burden. Im in therapy, but dont have any motivation to better my situation due to thinking why does it matter, youre only going to keep being the same antisocial person you already are. Youll never feel real love and compassion and youll always find a way to feel bad for yourself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nj9dg8/tell_me_something_different/", "title": "Tell me something different", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "a_dash_of_communism", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1621781737, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nj9dg8/tell_me_something_different/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423021.4146528, "replies_charged": false}
