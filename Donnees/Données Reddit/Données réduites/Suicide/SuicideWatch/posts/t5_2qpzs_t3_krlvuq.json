Parents basically, unsuccessfully tried to keep it a secret from me - due to my past suicide attempt. I still am suicidal - but I hide it.\n\nI wasn\u2019t expecting this to affect me so much. I only met him briefly when I was a kid and a few years ago - a 5 second greeting that\u2019s it. But\nit\u2019s hard for me to not think of him - in his last moments of life...the visual of him standing there and contemplating at the edge right before he jumped.\n\nI can\u2019t sleep even more so - it\u2019s 6:00 a.m here, been awake for almost 24 hrs straight - I know that\u2019s not a lot but I feel like I really can NOT sleep at all right now or even later. I feel so uneasy. \n\n Probably gona go out soon to do groceries.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/krlvuq/the_news_of_someone_i_barely_knew_committing/", "title": "The news of someone I barely knew committing suicide is really taking a toll on me", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "boosasha", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1609931618, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/krlvuq/the_news_of_someone_i_barely_knew_committing/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428402.8966577, "replies_charged": false}
