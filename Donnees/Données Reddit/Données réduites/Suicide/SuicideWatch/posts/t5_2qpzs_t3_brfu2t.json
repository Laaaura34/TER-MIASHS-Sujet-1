I'm here, at home, curled up in pain and sadness. I opened the boxes containing my chemicals and am staring at them. All i have to do is mix them and then I'm free... my lover will be home in an hour. all they want of me is to wait for them. I'm trying so very hard to wait. to give them the chance to pull me up or die in their arms. I'm ready to leave. my eyes hurt from crying. my chest is tight from anxiety\n\n*update They aren't ready to fulfill the suicide pact themselves. They understand if I lose to myself but of course hope I can keep going longer. I'm going to go get high, drunk & fuck random people tonight. I need to feel something other than how I currently do. I still don't feel safe and fuck I wish so hard that I just don't wake up but they are the only person that's left holding me up anymore since I lost my family. I really don't want them to go through the pain of trying without me when we both know it would just end up in them killing themselves shortly after anyway and one of their biggest fears is dying alone. So if I can't kill myself today, I'm going to indulge in self destructive behavior and kill my mind for the few hours before i have to wake up and work again", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/brfu2t/trying_but_staring_down_my_method/", "title": "Trying but staring down my method", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "CatOnEdge", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1558472422, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/brfu2t/trying_but_staring_down_my_method/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427710.8414836, "replies_charged": false}
