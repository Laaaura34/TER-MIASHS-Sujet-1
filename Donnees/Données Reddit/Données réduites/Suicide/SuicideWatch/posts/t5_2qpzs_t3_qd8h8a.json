A lot of this feeling can be attributed to the fact that I started on antidepressants in June. More importantly, I never felt like I could kill myself because I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of ruining my immediate family\u2019s lives. \n\nBut honestly, I wish I was never born. I felt constantly sad and anxious for most of my life and I didn\u2019t know how to cope with those feelings the way I do now. This lack of ability to cope has had serious consequences on my life. Also, I\u2019ve always felt like I didn\u2019t belong; even when I had friend groups, I was always aware that their acceptance was mostly conditional on whether I abided by arbitrary conventions. \n\nAs I write this, I am not happy or sad. I\u2019m simply going through the motions of life. In the grand scheme of things, I\u2019m cognizant of the meaningless of my existence and the trivialness of my worries. \n\nI swore to myself to never have a child, for there is no purpose for them to experience the universe and any degree of inevitable suffering that it may bring.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qd8h8a/i_dont_want_to_kill_myself_but_i_wish_i_was_never/", "title": "I don\u2019t want to kill myself but I wish I was never born", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "burneraccount270", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634873946, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qd8h8a/i_dont_want_to_kill_myself_but_i_wish_i_was_never/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425327.9521523, "replies_charged": false}
