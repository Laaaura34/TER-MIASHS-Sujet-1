At the time it seemed like a minor problem, yah she had to have a huge boot, but it would be gone soon, so I thought. Through a myriad of bad doctors and complications, it took her 6 years to get better. This in and of itself sucked. To make matters even worse, when she was finally getting better, she got in a car accident around a week before she would be able to do \"regular mom things\". This brought back a terrible disease she had, RSD/CRPS a very painful and debilitating disease. To make matters worse, the accident was my fault. I know there's the \"it's not your fault\" speeches, I know it is. She was on her way home from a baseball game to pick up the drinks I had forgotten.\nOn the way home, my dad jokingly said that it was my fault.\nAlthough it was a joke, it was true. \n About two months later, I got in a car accident as well. This gave me chronic back pains that are still inhibiting me to this day. My grades have gone from all as to 2 ds and 3 cs. While I know it's possible for life to get easier, I don't want to wait. My only true friends are a group of about 5 people who I would gladly trust my life with. Other than this, my friendships are empty shells. I just don't know what to do. I don't know how long I can hold on. I was fine for about a year, but recently I've been having dark thoughts. I need help, and I'm too scared to admit why I'm so depressed to my family. I know they'll understand but it would kill my mom inside to know. I just need something to get me through this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1sovyq/i_really_need_advice/", "title": "I really need advice", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Penguingoum", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1386820084, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1sovyq/i_really_need_advice/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426484.5526037, "replies_charged": false}
