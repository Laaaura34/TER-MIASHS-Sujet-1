I experienced this before a few times in the past year.\n\nI think my therapist didn't take me seriously because I said I had suicidal ideation and not that I am actually suicidal.\n\nI don't know why I am suicidal. Everyday for the past week, I fell apart throughout the day. My head gets a bit fuzzy.\n\nI think I have undiagnosed ADHD. I will fight my Psychiatrist later because clearly I just have ADHD the inattentive type since I'm not hyperactive. (Or am I? I'm not a professional)\n\nI feel like I need to be on my phone constantly either texting my friends or listening to music to get through the day. Forget watching TV, YouTube or reading. I can't focus or enjoy it (anhedonia) no more this week.\n\nI want to go to the hospital but I will feel unstimulated. They will take away my phone. I will feel bored and want to die.\n\nI don't want to stay at the hospital too long either. I have Class. I hate to fall behind again this Semester. \n\nI read hundreds of articles online and none came close to what I am feeling.
