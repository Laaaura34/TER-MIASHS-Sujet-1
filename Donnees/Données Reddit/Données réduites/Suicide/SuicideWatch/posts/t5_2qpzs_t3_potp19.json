Heres my rant/vent ig\nAnyways, lately I\u2019ve been thinking about OD more than I used to. I always keep a bottle of pills on my just in case I want to go through with it. Besides that, I\u2019ve been pushing friends away and being a dick so they can stop talking to me and rid me from their life so I have nothing holding my back from killing myself.\nI feel like my feelings are invalid to others, if I have a meltdown, I usually do it in private so I don\u2019t make anyone uncomfortable. I hardly cry because of that. I always lie about how I feel, if someone ask if im ok, I nod or say yes, even when im not. I feel like my friends don\u2019t like me for some reason, even when they say that they love me.My mind doesn\u2019t believe it even though I want it too. People say that I could be depressed, I don\u2019t agree with them. I can\u2019t get a therapist because of money reasons, even then, I wouldn\u2019t go. I dont want a trip to a Psych ward, and I dont want to lie my way out of it.\nI honestly dont know whats wrong with me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/potp19/i_dont_want_to_be_that_dead_friend/", "title": "I dont want to be that \u201cdead friend\u201d", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "What_Is_It69", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631723750, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/potp19/i_dont_want_to_be_that_dead_friend/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425472.7718215, "replies_charged": false}
