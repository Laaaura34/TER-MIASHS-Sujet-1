Everything feels colorless, tasteless, meaningless, and pointless. I have no passion for anything anymore. I quit my career, stopped praying, indulged in many poor choices. \n\nI spent my whole life taking care of everyone and everything. I don\u2019t know who I am, just who others want me to be. \nMy nieces and nephews call me a loser, my aunt helps me out of obligation, I embarrass those around me. \nIt\u2019s like I don\u2019t understand the norms. I will never be up to par. Just sorry and pitiful. \nI\u2019m addicted to crystal meth. \nI hate waking up everyday. I can\u2019t even look at myself in the mirror. Getting out of bed is a struggle.\nThere is no place here for someone like me. Just a matter of time. Everything in this life seems like trash.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jp65x5/my_soul_is_just_tired/", "title": "My soul is just tired.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lstseoul430", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 124, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1604673419, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jp65x5/my_soul_is_just_tired/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425192.286698, "replies_charged": false}
