Of course she doesn\u2019t know about my suicidal thoughts\u2014or at least she doesn\u2019t know the extent of them\u2014so of course I know she didn\u2019t mean to make me feel bad by it. But I remember my first thought upon hearing that was, \u201cWell shit\u2026this messes up my plans\u201d. I didn\u2019t even realize until that moment how strongly I already believed I\u2019d inevitably die by my own hands .\n\nI think about KMS constantly, however I know going through with it would absolutely destroy my parents; it doesn\u2019t help that they\u2019re going through really hard times in life right now, either. \n\nI\u2019ve considered waiting until the sad day my grandparents are no longer around so they don\u2019t have to live to see a grandchild die. I STILL feel guilty tho that my young cousin would have to deal with it. My death would probably be the final straw that ends my parents marriage, too.\n\nSometimes I think, \u201cFuck it. Be selfish. Save yourself by ending yourself\u201d. But the guilt always creeps back in. And then I feel even more trapped and exhausted in this life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pmo0hs/when_the_guilt_is_all_that_stands_in_the_way/", "title": "When the guilt is all that stands in the way\u2026", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "insomniacslytherin", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631430400, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pmo0hs/when_the_guilt_is_all_that_stands_in_the_way/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426172.3480487, "replies_charged": false}
