I was just wondering, why is there a subreddit like this? do people really care if a complete stranger does himself in? If so, my hat goes off to those people.\n\n\n\n**Edit:** Just woke up and I honestly didn't expect this much replies, I'm touched, I'll try to reply to everyone, gives me something to do. Also, I'm calmer now, all my fear and desperation about becoming 30 just came out a few hours ago and I'm terrified. I don't want to be 30, I really don't.\n\n**Edit2:** I'm getting a status:504 error while trying to reply, I guess it's reddit's fault or something. Will try again a bit later. I'll leave what I had written in reply to MissCrystal here: \n\n> Those years were hell to me too. When I turned 20 I had been expelled from 4 high schools and had never had a job, I thought it was a pretty pathetic record at the time. So here I am now, I'll be 30 in 2 weeks, I've been to 3 different colleges and am not close to getting a degree and guess what? I haven't had a job yet. My 20 year old self was a winner compared to this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cou4n/do_people_in_this_subreddit_really_care/", "title": "do people in this subreddit really care?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "loserthrowaway", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 32, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1278980479, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cou4n/do_people_in_this_subreddit_really_care/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426290.4447608, "replies_charged": false}
