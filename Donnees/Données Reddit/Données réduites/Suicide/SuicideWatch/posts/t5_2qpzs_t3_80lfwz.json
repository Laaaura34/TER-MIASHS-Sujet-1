I am supposed to be moving out in atleast a month but I'm not looking forward to it. My mother scares me because she's abusive. I'm undergoing court-mandated treatment and am forced to take compounds that don't work. I can't take nootropics or try anything else because they think I'll abuse them and they interact with the meds they force me to take against my will. I get flashbacks and am in pain and have to go through this with no assistance, emotional, medicinal, financial, and otherwise. I'm completely isolated. If someone can try to provide me some solace I would appreciate it because this has been going on for a very long time. Oh, and Ive already been to psych wards. They don't work.\n\nI feel extreme comfort in my depression.\n\nEverything in my life seems delayed. It bothers me a lot.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/80lfwz/depression_rumination_isolated_thoughts/", "title": "Depression rumination isolated thoughts", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "FalseRide", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1519726961, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/80lfwz/depression_rumination_isolated_thoughts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428012.0283954, "replies_charged": false}
