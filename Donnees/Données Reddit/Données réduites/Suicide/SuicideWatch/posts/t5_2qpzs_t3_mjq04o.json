You are stalking me! \n\nI\u2019m so low and idle and useless. I contemplated suicide last where there\u2019s a high ledge for me to jump to my death guaranteed.  \n\nI was chronically ill for seven years and recently recovered.  I was a golden child destined for Ivy League and happiness. Now my life has been destroyed and am grieving as I lay in the gutter.\n\nI am crying often. My body hurts cause of lack of human touch. Recently I had some non-sexual skin to skin contact . I immediately smiled ear to ear and felt muscles that had been stiff for months if not years, relax.  It\u2019s that bad.\n\nIs there hope for health, success, and happiness?\n\nI want to talk.  Someone reach out to me!
