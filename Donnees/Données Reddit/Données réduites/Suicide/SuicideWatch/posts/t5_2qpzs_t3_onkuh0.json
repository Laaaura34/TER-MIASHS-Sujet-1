Basically, this girl added my tiktok and I, as some sort of ego boost, hit on her just to see what would happen. After some snapping, she left me on delivered a week ago and I didn\u2019t think much of it. Then, a week later the girl I was with asked for my hulu password which I gladly gave. Turns out, her and her friend were on FaceTime with the girl I hit up and she recognized my name from the Hulu login. Now, I feel like an utter douchebag, and the only girl i\u2019ve ever actually liked hates me. What can I do? I really wanna die right now.
