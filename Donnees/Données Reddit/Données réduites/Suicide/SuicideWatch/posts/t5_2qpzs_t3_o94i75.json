When I was 21, I met a woman who I truly loved, we had a kid, got engaged, and even though I struggled still, I was happy, and I knew this was where I was supposed to be. However, at the beginning of this year she left, taking my son with her. I understood why she left, we'd been having issues.\n\nHowever, all didn't seem lost, we ended up deciding we missed each other and would work on things and go back to being exclusive. About a month later, I get a text from her saying she doesn't want to fix things anymore and she'd been in an open relationship with some guy for the last 3 weeks. Needless to say, it tore me apart. Fast forward to now, I still have to maintain a relationship with her for the sake of my son, but she feels it appropriate to keep telling me about her open relationship and every single person she sleeps with in disgusting detail, also that she never loved me. I don't know why she feels the need to torture me like this, I wish I could say there were more to it, but there isn't.\n\nAnyway, the mental hell this has been for me on top of trying to rebuild the life and family I lost, I've found myself not sleeping, randomly bursting into tears and having constant thoughts of suicide. It's hit the point now where my original plan of suicide would take too much time to organise and instead I drift to thoughts of just jumping from something. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't want to die, I don't want to leave my son behind, but I can't live like this and I don't know what to do. I just want a hug.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o94i75/things_arent_good/", "title": "Things Aren't Good", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Long_Philosophy_1727", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624824269, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o94i75/things_arent_good/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427122.0181286, "replies_charged": false}
