However, whenever I cant sleep I get severe anxiety and begin to have a mental breakdown.  I have had so many mental breakdowns that its impossible to keep up with the number of times its happened. Everytime i lie in bed and realise i cant sleep i look at the clock and i realise theres one way I can sleep forever. \n\nHaving no sleep has been seriously deteriorating my life. Im currently a third year engineering student and majority of the time I am not able to pay attention in class because my eyes and brain are tired. When i try to go back home to sleep, I cant. And thats all I do everyday everytime. I feel so tired I cant do work and all I want to do is sleep. My grades are dropping. As for trying to get some help, the so called friends I have dont care about me anyway. Even if I was dying in the middle of the street, theyd laugh. \n\nOnly people I care about are my parents and its the only thing hindering me from killing myself. I really want to. I just want to sleep. But im scared. I dont know what to do anymore. Why continue to live like this when no sleep is going to kill my anyway.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fa31hs/i_have_severe_insomnia_and_its_destroying_my_life/", "title": "I have severe insomnia and its destroying my life.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bullcrap893", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 30, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1582761839, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fa31hs/i_have_severe_insomnia_and_its_destroying_my_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426529.1814976, "replies_charged": false}
