I didn't think much of it, I got pretty sick towards the end of the week, and again, I kind of like suffering, so I didn't bother myself. He emailed me yesterday saying he isn't feeling well, with similar symptoms to me, so I get worried and I went to the doctor today. Thats when I found out I have this bad infection. I will get better, no doubt about that. Him? if he has it too, which he almost certainly does, he might not make it. Or if he does make it through this episode, this virus sticks around for life, and he will have episodes again. last time he got a mild cold he almost lost his eyesight. What am I supposed to feel? He is already paralyzed from the waist down. He won't respond to my emails, I told him everything I know, I apologized and pleaded for him to tell me whats going on. I have no way of getting in touch with him except for email.\nWhats the point? I can't handle the guilt and pain of ruining another person's life through my own destructive carelessness. There is no way that me giving him this infection won't cause serious damage to his health.\nThere is no amount of apologizing that will make this okay. I don't even deserve this stupid online confessional. I wish I was dead for a little while.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1yo6mj/my_impulse_for_selfdestruction_is_broken_im_just/", "title": "my impulse for self-destruction is broken, I'm just creating a path of damage through everybody I ever meet", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "kangaroo_notebook", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1393121553, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1yo6mj/my_impulse_for_selfdestruction_is_broken_im_just/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422545.247872, "replies_charged": false}
