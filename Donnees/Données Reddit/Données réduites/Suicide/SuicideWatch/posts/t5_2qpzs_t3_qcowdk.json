Like my thoughts, emotions, actions, decisions- they are imposing and fuel the fall of my relations and of myself. Looking at my life from a bird\u2019s eye view is overwhelmingly disastrous, with the common denominator always being myself. I have subjected my loved ones to such pain, to such torment, with little regard towards their wellbeing. I am selfish and I do not contain the capacity to learn how to be selfless. \n\nI lay awake for weeks, months, years, on end with my consciousness continuing to torment what is supposed to be my one human escape, sleep.  \n\nI spend a currency I cannot see a figure on. I once did, but now it is blurred into the distance, disrupted by the fog of the horrendously gruesome beauty of succumbing to death. I spend this currency on my loved ones, I work so hard to make sure not to hurt them, yet every single moment of my existence is a struggle. \n\nI am drained. I am a tap, run empty, with pipes rusted and decayed with overuse. I am trapped in a body I was not designed to exist in. Every moment is a painful reminder that I am alive. I am gifted stolen moments of content, but they are always yanked from my desperate hands by the reminder of who and what I am. \n\nI am done. I am at the end. I have fought my battle and I have honourably fallen in action. I have mourned my own death; I am at peace with the embrace of death. \n\nGoodbye.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qcowdk/my_hands_are_shaking/", "title": "My hands are shaking.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lenarose01", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634812752, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qcowdk/my_hands_are_shaking/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426743.1278815, "replies_charged": false}
