I lost that Pseudo job a month ago...Bills are haunting me, depleted my emergency fund and broke many promises.. Never felt helpless and empty like this before. \n\nIt was my birthday 4 days ago and it was a lonely dinner. I miss the person who was always with me during those best nights. Sadly, she outgrown me... My girlfriend of 8 years broke up with me 2 weeks ago. She wanted to grow but she chose it to do this alone this time. Asked her to stay but she said she doesn't love me anymore, she thanked me for everything and moved on. She was my light, she was my purpose but now, I lost my light that kept me going in this dark cave...I wonder how can I go out?  \nGuess she sees no future in my but I thank her loving me.   \n\n\nAs the empty hours goes by, I try to battle these monsters inside my head. It's 1am and I feel like dying. As I light another cigarette typing this reddit post, I kept thinking about tomorrow. What can a disappointment  like me offer tomorrow? to be honest, I really don't know. I don't know what to do anymore. Maybe I'm just here to provide carbon dioxide for the plants. Hopefully, I still have the strength to battle these monsters inside head... We'll see.
