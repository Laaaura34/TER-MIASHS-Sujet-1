Smoked a gram in 6 days after being clean for 3+months. Feel like shit, if i had a gun it would make shit alot easier. Cant sleep or think straight. Lost my job. No gf. My mother babys me still for fucks sake im 26. Cant leave the house. Just play xbox and watch youtube. Whats the easiest least painful way to kill myself? Any help would be appreciated.\nCheers", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/artlfe/kill_me_now/", "title": "Kill me now", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TheFailedState", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1550466687, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/artlfe/kill_me_now/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426260.607169, "replies_charged": false}
