I talked about my friends not trusting me and he thought I was referring to a secret that he said he had but refused to tell me. He then says 'do you want me to tell you so I say yes seeing as he made it sound like he had a permanent mental illness and was endangered. He then tells me the secret and it's something quite different and now he's saying that I forced him to do it and he regrets it even tho he says he's happy to tell me which makes no sense. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI haven't spoken to him in days and he's my only friend and he's being so selfish he just misinterpreted my words which made him tell me and none of this is my fault from my perspective? Im just really not sure and want it all to end.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/on93yl/my_friend_acts_like_i_leverage_my_suicide_attempt/", "title": "My friend acts like I leverage my suicide attempt to manipulate him.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "rorys-alt", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626679295, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/on93yl/my_friend_acts_like_i_leverage_my_suicide_attempt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428558.2331197, "replies_charged": false}
