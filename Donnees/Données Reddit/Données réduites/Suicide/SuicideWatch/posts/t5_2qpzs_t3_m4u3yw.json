Over the years I started online business and pulled my way through. I ended-up immigrating few years ago to a much safer and more developed country. My business kept getting better, I bought a small house and met a wonderful and beautiful woman who I married.\n\nMy old passport is almost expiring and I was hoping after my marriage to a local and decent contribution in terms of paying taxes and being a model citizen that I would get a citizenship. The answer was no because the country I'm in think all people from my old country are bad basically. \n\nAlso following my marriage I realized my wife has serious sexual issues (we didn't have sex before marriage based on her request); sex is extremely painful for her, she has  vaginismus and can't get wet, mentally and physically she's not attracted to sex in general, regardless of what I do, she has the most negative opinion about sex I ever knew someone could have. This has been going on for over 2 years now.\n\nWe don't have children despite trying multiple times as well (awful times and memories as well).\n\nMy business is going down, the good news is I'm a big time saver so I saved most of what I made and can live comfortably since I started a small new side business. But my status living here is questionable and sex which was a dream for me to have is almost non-existent. Whenever my wife leaves home I start looking online at some materials and masturbate to them. I feel like the most happiness I could ever get I already got it sometime along the way and it's just a flat line of nothingness from now on. I can't feel any happier any more and I'm not necessarily happy, my new life is safer than the old one for sure but that's it. I went from dreaming to have a good life into having a good life locked behind a glass that I can only look at.\n\nSome people pre-judge me because of my background, others think I must be happy with all that I've done. Wife used to drag me to church which I hated but couldn't say no to. I'm thankful to lockdown since we're no longer going there. Maybe soon she'll be back at it again.\n\nWhat's the point of my life anymore, sooner or later I'll be kicked out of this country back to where I came from, even if somehow I manage to stay my life is a boredom. I drive every other day down hill with some turns. I've been considering if I should just floor the gas and go straight through one of the turns into the air. probably it'll kill me, I've been also thinking to use a higher cliff in the city where I live or just jump of a bridge in the near city that's infamous for suicide cases.\n\nyeah, I don't know what to say or do anymore. I worry that this will break my wife's heart. Sometimes I wonder why was I born into a poor family and inside the borders of a horrible country that I can't escape whatsoever and why couldn't I marry a normal woman with normal functioning sexual organ and feelings? What wrong did I commit?
