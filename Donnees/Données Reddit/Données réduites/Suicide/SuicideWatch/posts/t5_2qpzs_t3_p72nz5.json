I don't think posting anything else here on this subreddit. \n\nThe truth is I'm tired, I'm tired of trying to get help, I'm tired of giving up on killing myself, tired of wanting something in my life, tired of falling in love, tired of everything. I need to take one last step and sort this out. \n\n   I don't know if anyone else feels it, but I feel like inside of me there were two people, a melancholy who wants death and a euphoric wants everything. The closer to suicide I am the more the other euphoric personality gets strong, but it never gives me what I do, then the melancholy takes over again, until I want to kill me. So the cycle starts again, it's been like this for two years and it's tiring, I need either of the two personalities to win this fight.\n\nI can't stand being in my dark and lonely bedroom anymore, I can't stand it no longer have anyone to hug me. I will crack, before I was afraid of this, but now I know that only when I crack I will break free. Or I'm going to live like crazy, Or I'm going to die forever. my soul rotted and left my body, now I want to see how crazy I can become. \n\nI would like to thank everyone who has talked to me here, no doubt, talking to another suicidal person is much better than talking to a therapist or something like that.\n\ngoodbye", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p72nz5/im_a_lonely_and_ambitious_suicide/", "title": "I'm a lonely and ambitious suicide", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "kurtsacul", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629328391, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p72nz5/im_a_lonely_and_ambitious_suicide/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427497.6595242, "replies_charged": false}
