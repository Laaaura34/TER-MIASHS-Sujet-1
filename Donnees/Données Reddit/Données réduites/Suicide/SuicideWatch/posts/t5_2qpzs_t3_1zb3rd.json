I attempted suicide last October by swallowing a bunch of pills, but I threw it all back up.  I have been prescribed Zoloft and Wellbutrin in the past, but didn't benefit much from using them.  I have been recently switched to Lexapro but am hesitant to start it because I have felt like a zombie on past SSRI's.  I have talked to a therapist as well, but her assistance declined over time to the point where she hasn't even talked to me in a few months.  There are so many aspects of my life that I am not happy with and am letting it bring myself down further.  The two biggest issues I would say are my grades and socializing - especially with girls.  It is really difficult for me to focus on studying or even just my homework and I typically wait until the last minute for everything, as it is the only way I can find motivation.  I currently have a 2.8 GPA, which isn't THAT bad.  However, compared to high school, I was getting straight A's and was thoroughly enjoying life.  I just literally can not keep focused on my work whenever I sit down to do it, even after eliminating distractions.  I constantly feel anxious and am worrying about other aspects of my life (my future, girls, friends, grades, etc.) \n\nThis year it has been extremely difficult for me to socialize with people and make friends.  I have always been an introvert but in high school I was fairly social, had many friends, and could always make people laugh.  Now, it feels like I lost my sense of humor and I immediately freeze up whenever I talk to new people.  For this reason, I don't go to many parties.  Especially last semester, I pretty much just confined myself to my dorm room.  I know I am a good looking guy and I have good style, but I have never had the confidence or experience to approach girls to initiate anything.  I've never been in a relationship, and have only made out several times - each of which I felt really self conscious because I was doing it wrong.  Even still, girls have approached me throughout college with obvious intentions of wanting to hook up with me, yet I simply avoid the matter or didn't know how to escalate the tension.  Although I have had plenty of opportunities in the past to date or even just hook up with a girl, I have never had the balls to do it.  I feel like my lack of experience is blatantly obvious and that this may be a reason I never try to do anything with a girl.  However, if I don't even try, I never will get experience and I just further inhibit myself.\n\nI really don't want to miss out on one of the best opportunities in my life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1zb3rd/college_guy_desperately_in_need_of_life_advice/", "title": "College guy desperately in need of life advice.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ta493", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1393721359, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1zb3rd/college_guy_desperately_in_need_of_life_advice/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426489.253613, "replies_charged": false}
