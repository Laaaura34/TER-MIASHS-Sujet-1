I'm not saying I'm ugly in the way that someone would usually complain about being ugly, even though they're average or even above average. I mean I am actually, insanely unattractive. I'm 5'4 and 200 lbs. I've got acne and stretch marks. I've tried everything to fix my acne, I've been taking pills for 2 years and it's barely made a difference. For my weight well.. I know, and I understand that it's my fault. I used to weigh around 135 lbs a few years ago at my healthiest. I played water polo competitively, and I would workout around 9-12 hours a week. Playing that sport though, really ruined my self-esteem. My teammates bullied me for never being the best, or for being fat. Even back then I had acne too. I've had it since I was in grade 5. I remember my teacher showing me after school how to put on makeup, because she was afraid kids were going to make fun of me. In the end, I think she had good intentions, but looking back as a kid.. even then it was very clear. I was very ugly, and if I didn't fix it, I wouldn't ever be happy. In grade 6 I joined water polo, as mentioned earlier. In grade 8 I moved so I quit. I gained about 20 pounds from it, which really upset me. I started to cut down on how much I ate, counting calories, not eating sugar, bread, butter, or anything above 300 calories. Eventually my daily calorie intake was around 500 calories a day. I know that's nothing remarkable, but it was still quite low. I hated my body. No matter how much I \"dieted\" I couldn't lose weight. I started to get really, really bad depression. And that in turn made me binge. I knew what bulimia was, but I also knew it was useless and dangerous. So I gained a lot of weight and now.. now I'm massive. It's disgusting. I absolutely hate every part of myself. \n\nOne thing I've noticed is people always say \"oh you're not that ugly,\" or they'll say \"you're not that fat,\" but I know they're just being polite and it pisses me off. I am fat, I'm literally obese. And as for my acne, I know it's bad, I can see it everytime I look in the mirror. \n\nI just don't see the point anymore in living like this. It feels like nothing I can do fixes it, and I'll never be happy with who I am. If I'm constantly hating myself, why not just kill myself? What kind of a life is that? I'm just so.. tired of always being ugly. Like that's my only personality trait, like being ugly defines me. I'd rather die than live this life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cd79vi/ugly/", "title": "Ugly", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "superpuffballl", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1563133443, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cd79vi/ugly/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422952.1909993, "replies_charged": false}
