I want to tell them that I spent a week having a plan to kill myself after the weekend, but that I got there and said, \"I either have to work my ass off now to pull out of this, or it's all over.\" I want them to know how bad it's been, how scared I've been, and how I feel like the worst. I want my family to know as well.\n\nBut they're not therapists, and they've all been traumatized by suicidal behavior, from me or from others. I'm so afraid of making them anxious or hurting them, so I'm sitting on this alone. I keep asking myself what good talking to them would do, that it would be attention seeking, and detrimental to their health for no good reason because of that. But I also keep seeing advice saying to reach out and talk to someone you trust. But it never accounts for how I could hurt them. I don't know what to do here.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qfos5k/when_and_how_to_talk_to_someone/", "title": "When and how to talk to someone?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mastercrepe", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635191351, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qfos5k/when_and_how_to_talk_to_someone/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425244.9174287, "replies_charged": false}
