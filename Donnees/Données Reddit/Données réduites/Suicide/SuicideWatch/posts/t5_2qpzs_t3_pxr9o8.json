The only thing that helps is cutting. \n\nI\u2019m tired of being alive I\u2019m tired of constantly being put down and I\u2019m tired of the constant pain. \n\nI just want to end it. I\u2019m really thinking about just ending my life and getting it over with. I try to think of reasons to keep going but it just makes me realize how meaningless and pointless my life is. \n\nI\u2019ve been through so much and my life is barely getting started imagine how much worse it\u2019ll get.\n\nI\u2019m honestly just thinking of popping Benzos with opiates and oding or cutting my wrist open and finally escaping. \n\nI don\u2019t even have anyone to turn to or talk to. This is my last cry for help. If no one answers by the end of the night then I\u2019ll know my life has no meaning and I\u2019ll just get it over with.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long bumpy rough ride and I think it\u2019s time it came to an end. Thank you to anyone who showed me the slightest attention and may you be blessed. I think my life was one without meaning and it\u2019s time for me to go. \n\nThank you to anyone who read this. As one of my favorite quotes goes \u201cAnd when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice\nEvery time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that\nI'm lookin' down on you smilin' and I didn't feel a thing\nSo, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back\u201d\n\nGoodbye friends.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m getting comments but they aren\u2019t showing up, it says there\u2019s comments but when I go to check nothing appears so if you would like to reach out or talk PM or Start a chat if you would like.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pxr9o8/my_last_cry_for_help/", "title": "My last cry for help", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Slideitinhoney", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632905244, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pxr9o8/my_last_cry_for_help/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635426749.0406756, "replies_charged": false}
