And it didn't end up as expected, they left a lot of areas out. Were willing to give me a 2nd for free to fix it...and that just compacted the issue and left the sides and back of my head badly scarred...\n\nNow I feel even more hideous than before I went to get this fixed. And I am beating myself up every minute of every day because I had other doctors / clinics picked out in the days prior to going but I over-thought and eventually ended up choosing the place that mangled me despite having put a down payment on another place with much more consistent results.\n\nEver since I got home from getting it done, I can't think of anything else, I'm fixated on my hair and my scarring. I don't want to ever be seen again (and I am a professor & poet so this isn't possible). I don't want to be around my family for the holidays and all I do is get those who love me mad at me because I'm lashing out from my pain.\n\nI really am close to just swallowing a bunch of pills and ending it. I don't have much will to go on.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kdvwm6/bad_hair_transplant_leaving_me_feeling_suicidal/", "title": "Bad hair transplant leaving me feeling suicidal", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Peezus22", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1608070683, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kdvwm6/bad_hair_transplant_leaving_me_feeling_suicidal/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428142.58014, "replies_charged": false}
