Nobody in my life knew I attempted even once because nobody ever cares if I disappear for hours. I have tried to od on pills several times, but I wake up the next morning and go to school, feeling sick and unhappy, but I push through. Life seems unbearable now, just a speck of something that seems so bright and brilliant for those around me, but so bleak and soundless for me. I have amazing friends and a significant other who is one of the few people who makes me happy no matter what, but they can't keep protecting me forever. My home life is terrible, but I'm the only person who sees the monsters I live with. My parents are nice to outsiders and my sisters, but I'm the exception. I destroyed everything in their perfect lives. I enjoy school, I love to learn, but since my sister got into college early and is graduating again by the time I graduate high school, she is looked at as the golden child in our family. My sisters are both beautiful and thin, but only one person has ever told me I was beautiful, not just my eyes. This person, my SO, had made a huge impact in my life, and I could never forget that. \n\nMy mom wad never a mother to me, even when I was a kid and needed her. She was there for both my sisters, but me, I never had a mother. Never really had a father either. He's nicer than my mother, but he's never really around. My mother will yell at me for nothing, it could be about my grades to the look on my face. She yelled at me for 2 hours about my rbf, then slapped me and took my phone. I don't hate my mother, I just wish I had another mother.\n\nI'm being selfish, wishing I had someone else as a mother when some people don't even have a mother. I'm always selfish though, never can get that one quite right. I always get told from my family that I should think about others more than myself. I should really take that advice, but I can't change so easily. \n\nI cook dinner, I clean the house, I take my mom's dog on runs and walks, I make food for my mom, I take care of our pets. But it's never enough, I'm still selfish for wanting a few things every now and then.\n\nMy sisters had the perfect all honors with straight A's in high school. I only have 2 honors classes with a few B's and the rest are A's. I guess I can never live up to my sisters, they were perfect and I'm just a mess.\n\nI don't have control in my life, so I started controlling my food after my family continued to call me fat. I developed anorexia, bulimia, and b.e.d after awhile. I keep losing weight and I hope that I drop from not weighing enough. But I wake up, go to school, go home, opening the door to a disappointed look on my mothers face as she hands me the leash to her dog and I go for a run. \n\nEvery time I go to sleep, I hope to not wake up the next day, but I always do. I'm stuck in a hell where it's always in the same loop. Wake up, hate myself, go to school, feel pathetic and alone, go home, get screamed at for hours, stay up late doing homework, feel bad about my horrible grades, get an hour of sleep while wishing to never wake up again. Same loop every day. Nothing changes.\n\nMy best friend, he always jokes about killing himself, but I would cry and mourn his death if he ever truly did. I love him, he's a brother to me. I don't think he'd miss me though, he doesn't ever hang out with me outside of school or talk to me much anymore. That's okay, I wouldn't want any of my friends to mourn my death, I'm not worth it.\n\nIf you read all of this, thanks, most people in my life don't even listen to me for a second.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e7j0hq/signing_off/", "title": "Signing Off", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Machined_Wings", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1575748434, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e7j0hq/signing_off/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422949.925132, "replies_charged": false}
