My mom is really my best friend and every day I wake up to the idea that she could be gone very soon, my girlfriend was the only person that helped me to stay properly in the moment and now she\u2019s gone and I\u2019m scared she\u2019s gonna kill herself, and my path with music and videos is so far along no part of me wants to quit but I\u2019m getting genuinely lost on how exactly to progress for my audience.  I don\u2019t want to kill myself in the obvious sense but sometimes I don\u2019t know how I can be expected to just keep going down this shit rabbit hole.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oq66e4/23_and_have_never_had_suicidal_ideation_until_now/", "title": "23 and have never had suicidal ideation until now", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "thaguy901", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627058275, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oq66e4/23_and_have_never_had_suicidal_ideation_until_now/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427242.2813003, "replies_charged": false}
