This was the last straw for me, as in I waited to see what would come of this before I did anything. I\u2019ve been under home treatment teams and had nothing come of it too many times. When I aim to harm myself I mean it to be permanent, I\u2019ve never been remorseful and I make it clear I WILL do it again, but today they decided to purse ADHD. Fucking ADHD, because the main problem is my focus to them and the cycling in my moods isn\u2019t bad enough because I managed to keep a job for a period of time and had some sort of a relationship. Even if it is ADHD I\u2019m on a two year waiting list. In those two years I\u2019ve been told to practice mindfulness. MINDFULNESS. I never reach out for help, and I\u2019m not now. I guess I just wanted this out there somewhere. That they\u2019ve told a constantly active suicidal person that maybe low moods are just a symptom of boredom and if that\u2019s the case you\u2019ll wait 2 years to find out. Please get help now whilst it\u2019s not so bad, everything\u2019s a lengthy process. You\u2019ll need the help already in place if it gets worse. Please please get help now. I\u2019m out on my arse and even though I\u2019ve decided it\u2019s still not a great feeling.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kxsvie/anyone_kind_of_given_up_with_the_nhs/", "title": "Anyone kind of given up with the NHS", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "skintywannabe", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 24, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1610710688, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kxsvie/anyone_kind_of_given_up_with_the_nhs/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635427058.0644855, "replies_charged": false}
