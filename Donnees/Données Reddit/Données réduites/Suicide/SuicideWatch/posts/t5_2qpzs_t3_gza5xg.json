I'm still hung up on my lost relationship, because she meant so much to me but she still refuses to send me a single reply even after I was in serious danger. Being ignored like that hurts. I tried the suicide crisis chat multiple times and even THEY ignored me, I'm just that worthless.\n\nI've lost every friend I had, nobody will talk to me anymore. My best friend betrayed me and called the police on me when I was suicidal, which gave me an involuntary hospital bill of about $10,000, which I can't pay without sacrificing my medication and most of my food budget.\n\nI know I have no future, I'm somewhat mentally impaired and it's impossible for me to function in skilled jobs properly. I'm physically weak and sickly so most labor is also too exhausting for me.\n\nI had a terribly abusive childhood, and I just want the pain to stop and to be at peace already. I'll probably just end myself tonight, I don't have anything to left hold on to. I know I don't really want to die, I want to live and be happy, but I'm just cornered now and think it's for the better.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gza5xg/ive_lost_everything/", "title": "I've lost everything", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "cardboardUFO", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1591656287, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gza5xg/ive_lost_everything/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426138.5785813, "replies_charged": false}
