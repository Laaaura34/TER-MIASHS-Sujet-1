I was sheltered and home schooled by insane fundamentalist parents and almost never had any social contact outside of church; when I finally left the church I had no social contact outside my college and job. I have one close friend, and I think his being there for me has probably kept me alive. However, even he ignores me most of the time, for example if he has anyone else to socialize with he'll leave me alone without thinking twice about it.\n\nWomen avoid me like the plague. I'm not ugly (I've actually been told I'm above average), although my many years of being a loner have left me either very shy, or overly loud in an attempt to compensate. However, it's with women that this all gets complicated. I used to know a girl back when I was younger. At this point the thought of suicide from the loneliness was nonexistent. Anyway, she was attracted to me but I ignored her because my parents wouldn't have approved (at this time I was told and thought that obeying my parents no matter what the cost was the right thing to do). When I finally overcame all my inhibitions (several years later), she was (and still is) seriously involved with someone else and so I missed out. I've never regretted something so much in my entire life. The thing is, it's compounded with cognitive dissonance because, A)I'm not 100% sure it would have amounted to anything to begin with and B)I'm not sure if I could actually love her. Nevertheless, I can't help but think that she was the love of my life and I really screwed things up.\n\nAnd now I need to bring up my leaving of the church. I was a member of a somewhat crazy fundamentalist church, and when I was younger, was rather involved with it all. Now that I'm no longer a part of it, I feel guilty for wasting my youth and trying to encourage others to take part in it all. It's also the reason I missed out on several friendships and relationships. And now that I'm no longer involved with religion, I've lost all those friendships.\n\nSo around this time (I started considering suicide about two months before the \"missed out\" issue) I'm really, really starting to consider killing myself. One night I got up, grabbed a blade, and was about to slash my wrists open when I became determined to give myself one more week to find someone who will be my companion and help heal my emotional wounds. Exactly one week later, I met the first woman to give me a shot, online. She actually cared for what I had to say. She absolutely saved my life.  We were together for a little under three months, until she left me for complicated reasons. Even though we never even had sex, she meant (and still means) the world to me-- I'd never, nor will I probably ever, love anyone more. But she's gone now and out of my life, leaving me alone again.\n\nIt's been several months now, and everything is getting harder and harder. I'm close to dropping out of college because I have absolutely no drive to do any of it anymore. I was a straight A student and now I'm having trouble doing simple homework assignments. I try to be friendly to everyone I see but I'm mostly ignored. I ask out every woman I can but they always have some excuse. I try to ignore my past and think of starting with a clean slate, but I can't forget any of it, no matter how hard I try. I just want to die so that everything will stop. I don't want to deal with the loneliness and guilt and remorse anymore.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kx7u0/so_incredibly_lonely_its_unbearable/", "title": "So incredibly lonely it's unbearable ", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "WalrusLoner", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1317443316, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kx7u0/so_incredibly_lonely_its_unbearable/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426494.0091965, "replies_charged": false}
