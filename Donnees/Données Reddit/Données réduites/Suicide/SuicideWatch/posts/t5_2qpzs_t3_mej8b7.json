A battle that can\u2019t be seen by those around me, an abstract wasteland in my consciousness fighting for position. Intrusive thoughts acting as dictators deciding how I will interpret life. My real interest and true self only becomes a pawn. Brainwashed into action. Execute order 66. I can\u2019t un see the mistakes I\u2019ve made. I can\u2019t take back time. All I have is my thoughts and 50 years to sit here in sulk over it. Most of the time I just feel like a zombie. Hiding through life. The pride and defense mechanism that forbid me from accepting they are gone is getting in the way. Stuck in a grief process. Because I can\u2019t truly accept they want nothing to do with me. It just doesn\u2019t feel real. I logically talk my way through it, understand it and cognitive accept it. I think it\u2019s more then warranted but still them being gone leaves a pain even though that had every right to leave and made the right choice to. Im rambling on my break. Fuck this Job. I\u2019m so fucking depressed. I\u2019ll be bitching to myself in my head for the next 7102932 years if anyone needs me", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mej8b7/my_soul_is_screaming_to_be_let_free_suffering_away/", "title": "My soul is screaming to be let free.
