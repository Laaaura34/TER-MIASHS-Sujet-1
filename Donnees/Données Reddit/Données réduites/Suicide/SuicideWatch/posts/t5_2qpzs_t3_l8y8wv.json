In the last year I finally thought I had moved on, I began to get better, talk to people, genuinely feel included. It came to a point where I evan began dating, although for a short period. I think it all went south when I began to realise that I couldn't even keep up with school along december, this weird melancholy feeling me as I felt shittier and shittier, I got lazy, unmotivated, and in general I felt like my life was beginning to slowly burn out, me dating helped with that, I know people think that if you're not emotionally stable you shouldn't be dating, but I felt like I was in control, I felt like I was happy, but then all of the sudden the person I was dating broke up with me, I thought we were both happy, but along the last week of our relationship she grew distant, and just told me that she really tried but couldn't handle being in a relationship because she didn't feel happy. I didn't want to hold her hostage so I told her not to worry about it and to care about herself, in the end it would be pointless to be in a relationship where one party isn't happy. I never told her but the truth is that this sent me spiralling down to my old manners, I completly gave up on most things, I stopped talking to my friends, trying to exercise, and eventually it came to a point where I didn't even leave bed. Classes began again and we started talking, just as friends. It feels so nice to talk to her again, and I really am trying to get over her, she isn't the reason of my depression, she isn't why I'm like this, but this just hurts so much, because I just know how much of a fucking failure I am. I couldn't be in a healthy relationship, I can't keep up with school, I can't tell my parents how I feel because they don't understand, and instead of getting over her I have this stupid fucking thought that maybe we could try again, so I keep talking to her, because after all she isn't dating anyone and who knows? I know it's delusional, and that's what makes me feel even more like a fucking desperate parasite. I can't get out of bed, I can't breath properly, I can't fucking live like this. I don't wanna die, but my life is gonne, it really is, I'm burnt out.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/l8y8wv/i_dont_want_help_i_dont_know_if_im_going_to_kill/", "title": "I don't want help, I don't know if I'm going to kill myself or not, I just want to say it.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwawayjsdxn", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612047887, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/l8y8wv/i_dont_want_help_i_dont_know_if_im_going_to_kill/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427522.053035, "replies_charged": false}
