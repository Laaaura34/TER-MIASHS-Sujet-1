That's to say that I've improved enough for me to think I'm on the right track. But I've found that even though I'm no longer tormented by my suicidal thoughts like I used to be, I can't drop the habit of regularly having said thoughts. \n\nI've been thinking about it recently because a while back someone was telling me how they were suicidal at one point in their life. I don't know enough about them to know how that experience played out or repeated itself in their mind. But I remember not knowing how to feel about it because it was implied that for them suicidal thoughts etc. aren't a constant. For a long time I just assumed that some part of those thoughts always sticks around or is likely to return in a cycle.\n\nDoes anyone here have the experience of being suicidal for a shorter period of time and would be comfortable explaining how they got better to some extent?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q34ae0/habitual_suicidal_thoughts/", "title": "Habitual suicidal thoughts", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TiredOfWonder", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633593841, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q34ae0/habitual_suicidal_thoughts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427323.3767812, "replies_charged": false}
