Before I go, here are answers/rants to some popular arguments\n\n* People don't really care. Like misery loves company, the only benefit in my company was in commiseration. \n* \"Life is a struggle. Life sucks. Life can be hard. It's only a bad day, week, month, year, decade etc. But you have to stick through it.\"  Results have not changed for 5+ years. It would be insane to think that something would change now.  \n* \"Death is a permanent solution to a temporary problem\" I'm tired of banging my head on a wall and having it not work. And I don't have any money anymore to fund it anymore.\n* I opened up to my family. My mom turned it around and started complaining about her life. My brother didn't care. My dad said he was disappointed. \n* I tried therapy. I felt like I wasted 2 years of money on \"help\" that could be found in /r/GetMotivated \n* \"life is about the journey, not the destination.\" So why is everyone focusing on the destination of long life? Why struggle for 30+ years to have maybe one day worth living? \n\nIt's just not worth starting over from scratch again.
