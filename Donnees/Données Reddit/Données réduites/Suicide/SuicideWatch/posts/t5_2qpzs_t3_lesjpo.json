I\u2019m tired or every waking minute of my life counting back down to dread. I\u2019m not happy and i can barely remember what it feels like to be happy, i\u2019m tired of going day to day knowing that it doesn\u2019t get better, and that it just returns to the state of mental decay. So, i\u2019ve made myself a bag with a drawstring and bought some Nitrogen, im gonna kill myself in a nice painless way and at least die with some false happiness", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lesjpo/i_tried/", "title": "I tried", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Whydoyouwanna", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612723469, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lesjpo/i_tried/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426415.420141, "replies_charged": false}
