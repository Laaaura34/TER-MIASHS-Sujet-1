This happened when I was younger a lot. My mom knew I was depressed and would cut myself, so sometimes I thought if I killed myself then at least she would feel bad about not doing more to help me.\n\nAnd those sorts of thoughts sort of subsided as I got older. But I have a boyfriend ( this is my first relationsip) we've dated for like 7 months and broke up last month. But we just got back together. And we've been fighting a lot over text and sometimes I just want to kill myself during it. I think first to end the argument and then to make him feel bad about it.\n\nI think its because when I was young I would gage how I thought someone would respond to my death. Like in middle school I was really close, I had tried a couple times but just didn't have more lethal methods I guess. But I would write letter to like everyone in my class even if I wasn't friends with them, kinda messed up but I wanted the right people to feel guilty I guess? Like I knew what was pissing me off and I wanted them to know that. But I didn't know a better way.\n\nI never handed those notes out or anything obviously but idk kinda messed up when I think about it", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pj7sbh/anger_makes_me_more_suicidal/", "title": "Anger makes me more suicidal", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MaySenHana", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630960162, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pj7sbh/anger_makes_me_more_suicidal/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426817.1423047, "replies_charged": false}
