I would be calling for my bf. Hes having it hard and more so recently. He told me if i told his parents or someone like that about it we\u2019d be over. Should i ask him if i can call them for him first or do it without telling him. And same thing about him getting proper help. He is going to the school consoler tho which im happy for but once a week and just that wont be enough. What do i do. How do i do what i should do.
