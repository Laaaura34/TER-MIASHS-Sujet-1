I love writing screenplays, but in the four years I've been writing them they've never gained any attention or interest. I thought I was pretty enough to model, but apparently not and it really hurts. Programming games? I'm far too stupid to even comprehend it. No one wants to watch me stream unless I show my tits. Failure after failure, no matter what I try to do. I'm just so ambitious, but I know I'll never be able to do anything worthwhile yet I still get disappointed when I fail. I can't take anymore failure.
