I usually call when I'm feeling very suicidal (in the planning stages) and just want to have someone there to listen and to talk me out of it. Instead, 95% of the time, I get someone who asks me if I'm on meds, seeing a counselor/psychiatrist etc. Then they just tell me to go talk about my feelings to my counselor. Then when I tell them that I'm not talking to my counselor right now I'm talking to THEM, they don't seem to understand. I want THEM to help me, that's what I called THEM!!\n\nIt's so frustrating to get this notion across to respondents because they just think I am being difficult and \"misinterpreting what they say\" further placing blame on me, making me feel even worse. It's so hard to get a respondent that just \"gets\" it. \n\nDoes this happen to anyone else?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/iy4jb/the_one_thing_i_hate_about_suicidecrisis_helpline/", "title": "The one thing I hate about Suicide/Crisis helpline respondents...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "manyproblems", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1311477643, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/iy4jb/the_one_thing_i_hate_about_suicidecrisis_helpline/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426129.4575796, "replies_charged": false}
