I should have no reason to die. Yet I feel so numb right now. Due to a mix-up at the pharmacy I have over 5x the lethal dose of my meds. I know I'll hurt people, but it just feels like nothing right now. I don't feel a sliver of anything, much less guilt. I'm just staring at them. A painless sleep awaits me, just more of this numb feeling\n\nHell, it'll be my birthday in a week and everyone's been asking what I'm gonna do to celebrate. They want to celebrate it with me.
