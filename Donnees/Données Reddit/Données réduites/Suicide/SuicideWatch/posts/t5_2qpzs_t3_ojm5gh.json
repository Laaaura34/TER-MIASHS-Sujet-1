My family used to be semi religious and when I was probably 6, my mom had told me how suicide is automatically hell, but that a self sacrifice is automatically heaven. And I clung to that idea. At 6. At 6 is when I first started thinking about deliberately dying. And things only ever got worse for me. My father\u2019s abuse continued and escalated. I worse forced to spend huge chunks of my youth in a court mandated therapists office that I was too young to benefit from. Then my father just stopped trying to see me and I was glad, but he\u2019s my father. He should want to fight to see his daughter, right? So that one day he could walk her down the aisle. No. It was never that. It was power and control, once he no longer had that, he stopped caring. There\u2019s a part of me that says I should never have come heard about him because then he\u2019d still love me. I tried giving him a chance when I was graduating high school. He ignored me. I told myself that I was fine with him being gone. That I was happy. What a load of shit. In 5th grade, I had a writing prompt about a male role model. I broke down crying in class and was bullied to hell for it. Freshman year of high school, this rumor that this guy and I had sex went around, we didn\u2019t, and I was bullied for that. Attempted suicide in sophomore year by taking a shit ton of Benadryl. What an idiotic child. Woke up with a bad case of dry mouth and a looming sense of defeat. I didn\u2019t feel regret at all, just regret afterwards that it didn\u2019t work. Things got better for a bit and I think I felt the closest to happy ever? I have a gap year after high school because my family is dirt poor. It makes me feel like a failure and I spiral fully into mental illness and it\u2019s safe to say that at this point I\u2019m no longer just depressed and anxious. Signs of bpd start rearing their ugly heads. I essentially watch myself turn into an unstable manipulative mentally abusive monster with anyone unfortunate enough to get close. I kinda come out of that but I know I can\u2019t control myself so I just put up a wall to ensure I can\u2019t get close enough to others to let that happen again. Enter freshman year of college. Things are alright. Crazy roommate (rich coming from me, I know) and a handful of shallow friendships. I go to a party. I get raped. That was cool. I found myself unable to talk to men for nearly a year. I get disgusted at the sight of me. I put up thicker walls. I\u2019m constantly paranoid and scared. Is it the BPD or is it the trauma from the rape? Maybe it\u2019s maybelline. Freshman year ends and sophomore year starts and at this point, I\u2019m drinking nearly every night and missing classes and relying on my roommate and friend to smuggle me in and out of the communal bathroom between vomit trips. I snap myself out of it around thanksgiving. Semester ends. 4 days later, my grandma and most important person in the world is admitted to a hospital again. I start breaking down and people tell me it\u2019ll be fine as this is routine for her. It\u2019s not. She\u2019s got aggressive cancer. She\u2019s given 3-6 months to live. 2 months and 1 day later, she\u2019s gone after spending that last week or two asleep. The last time I spoke to her, I couldn\u2019t look at her because I didn\u2019t want her to feel guilty and I couldn\u2019t stop the downpour of tears. Bye Meme. I start getting sick. Have a cancer scare. Wait, nvm your thyroid is enlarged because your immune system it attacking it. Enjoy constantly feeling fluish oh and remember how you\u2019ve always had weight issues and were anorexic? Well here\u2019s 40 lbs and crippling dysmorphia. Junior year starts. I barely go to class. I\u2019m struggling financially. I drop out. My grandma would be so proud. I start talking to this guy at work. He\u2019s cute and charming and seems into me. Oh, here\u2019s covid and lockdown. Tbh it was only a minor speed bump for us as we weren\u2019t the most covid safe and I feel bad about it, but I\u2019d probably not be here if I took lockdown seriously. Sorry people. Things start to go well with him and I. Except he gets scared of having people know we\u2019re dating. We live in a smallish town and everyone knows some gossip about me. He\u2019d be embarrassed. He starts talking about other girls he\u2019s interested in. I cut him out. For so long, I felt disgusting and unlovable and he changed that. That change quickly was undone. It\u2019s been about a year since then. I\u2019ve spent the past 6 months in a near dissociative state. Things just have had this vague falseness to them and like nothing matters. For the past 4-5 years, I\u2019ve been clinging to these reasons to live. They\u2019re mostly gone. Some have even turned into reasons to die. I don\u2019t really feel passion or drive to do things I once liked. I just wanna disappear. I want to stop hurting. I don\u2019t want to feel like a burden. I only feel alive while being reckless or while drunk and it\u2019s not enough. I feel disgusting and unlovable. I feel like a monster. I feel lesser. If someone were to fall in love with me, I think I\u2019d be further driven to suicide to free them from the curse of me to free them of selling themselves short by going for something lesser like myself. I think I have about a month left. There\u2019s one other thing I skipped over, but I could probably say it in DMs. I work night shift, so I\u2019ll probably fall asleep after posting this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ojm5gh/think_ill_be_doing_it_soon/", "title": "Think I\u2019ll be doing it soon.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AliasInvstgtions", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626202211, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ojm5gh/think_ill_be_doing_it_soon/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635428207.109519, "replies_charged": false}
