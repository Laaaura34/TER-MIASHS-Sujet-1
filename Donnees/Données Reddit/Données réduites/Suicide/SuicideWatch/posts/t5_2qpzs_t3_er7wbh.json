Basically in a nutshell when I was about four years old I knew this life was going to be cruel and hard. I feel like I've been fighting for survival ever since. You see, I am a child abuse survivor, both mentally and physically and the battle is getting rather tiring. Back in 2010 I met the love of my life and for what seemed like a few moments I felt at peace. We moved in together, got a dog and built a life together for 11 years. 3 years ago I discovered crystal meth and fell into addiction. I was back in the battle before I knew it and as of recently lost it all and  I mean all of it. My home, family, friends, my dog, my job and husband. I'm in a group home, in recovery and have a sponsor who  I consider my  brother, but these few things are not strong enough to stop my love for meth. All this hardship isn't strong enough. So what is then? I am back in the same hell I was in as a child. Only this time  I  am completely alone.  I  am afraid of dying, but wish  I was dead already.  I think  I will kill myself soon. Respond however, just wanted to give this voice.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/er7wbh/how_did_i_get_to_this_point/", "title": "How did I get to this point?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TimmmmayWibLaa", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1579493868, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/er7wbh/how_did_i_get_to_this_point/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426252.2077935, "replies_charged": false}
