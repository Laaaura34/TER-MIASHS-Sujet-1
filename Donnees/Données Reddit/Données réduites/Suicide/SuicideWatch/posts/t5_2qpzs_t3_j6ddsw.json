I stopped trying just parasuicidal attempts where someone could save me, I just felt the need to move on to all or nothing, the will to really end it all. And so I prepare everything. Always the same ritual until there's only one foot left to jump. I'm shaking, thinking about everything I will leave behind, but still they're not enough to keep me here even if I'm crying a river. It's the fear that always stops me. The thought of not knowing what happens next. What if hell really exists and it's possible to suffer even more? What if I'm forced to see my loved ones hurt by my death over and over again? What if it's just a black void but my soul or whatever that can be left is always \"awake\"? It's that unknown that scares me so much and stops me from ending this stupid life and so it makes me suffer even more.
