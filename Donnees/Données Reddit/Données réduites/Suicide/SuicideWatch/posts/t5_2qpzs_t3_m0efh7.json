Realizing that happiness and fulfillment will never happen for me is too much to deal with.\n\nI'm 38, I'm not terribly happy in my relationship, but won't ever find anything else better, I'm fairly content most of the time though.  I work an okay job, but I make less than a professional my age and don't have enough saved for retirement.   I have a shit ton of debt.  I'll probably never have a family and never own a home.\n\nBasically I'll just be alive, existing, going through the motions, paying rent, paying unending debts, in a relationship which fills my needs to keep me from dieing of loneliness, and gives me a companion to get through some of the harder shit in life that is hard to do alone.  \n\nI'm not sure if living is really even worth it any more.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m0efh7/over_my_suicidal_ideation_but_i_dont_really_want/", "title": "Over my suicidal ideation, but I don't really want to be alive either.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "the_grate_throwaway", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615205579, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m0efh7/over_my_suicidal_ideation_but_i_dont_really_want/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427279.3429015, "replies_charged": false}
