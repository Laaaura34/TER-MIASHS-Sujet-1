About how I can\u2019t trust anyone anymore to really care about me and look through my flaws, I\u2019ve went to work and home exclusively for almost seven months and they just relish the fact that they had such effect me on me. I\u2019m just a big fucking joke in my home town, known for crying drug abuse and letting a bunch of crackheads and whores walk all over him. I live with my parents and neither one of them will admit but they\u2019re so so so unhappy with how I turned out. My dad especially. My mom forgives me and loves me unconditionally but that just makes it worse because I know I\u2019m just gonna die in a couple years either from suicide or accidentally overdosing or some shit. Idk. I just wanna shut it all off.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p7ohtl/i_already_lost_life/", "title": "I already lost @ life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "RieGuy1027", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629409768, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p7ohtl/i_already_lost_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427109.365095, "replies_charged": false}
