For the last ten years I've been socially isolated, unable to connect with people or form relationships. While people around me reach milestones like losing thier virginities or even getting married I feel like I have all the experience and social skills of a twelve year old. I know the problem is two-fold, I'm pretty profoundly unattractive; I'm black, obese, have manboobs, have been balding since I was 13, stretch marks birthmarks all over my body, an ugly face, and a small dick. I also have a shit personality. I'm unable to take risks, I'm quiet and inhibited, insecure, have no passion or ambition for anything (I don't even have enough motivation to play video games, let alone a real hobby), and my mind is blank whenever I'm around people so I can't have conversations which means I can't have relationships. I'm terribly lonely but it's the envy that's killing me as much as anything else. It's gotten to the point where I break down in tears when I see young kids in public who already have more social skills and friends than I do and are obviously much better looking than I'll ever be. yeah I know woe is me. People given a lot less than me have achieved a lot more and that makes me the pathetic one. so I'll be killing myself at my first available opportunity. I found a site that'll ship a pistol to a local gun store for me to pick up for $550. I've been watching youtube videos how to use guns and I think I'll be able to use it. Right now I have $390 saved up in my suicide account and I expect to be paid $180 on my pay day tomorrow so that should cover it. I'm not sure why I'm even posting this because I know there's nothing that can help me. I've already done years of antidepressants and therapy and that didn't do shit for me. truth is, I'm looking forwawrd to dying because it's better than the shit life that I have laid out in front of me.
