We talked after her attempt and she says she's fine besides the general disorientation. She says she knows from her experience that in the ER they will only tell her to go home and sleep and they don't pump stomachs on overdose? Is it true? Can someone tell me what to do please and if I should be worried?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o6oz3d/friend_attempted_overdose_on_hydroxyzine_what_to/", "title": "Friend attempted overdose on hydroxyzine, what to do?
