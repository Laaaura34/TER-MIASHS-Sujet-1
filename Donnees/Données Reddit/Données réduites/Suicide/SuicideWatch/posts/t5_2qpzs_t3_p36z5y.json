I know where and to whom my valuables and possessions will go to. Almost everything is set. Shit, I\u2019ve even already asked for the days off at work. I\u2019m going to purchase a fire arm and drive to up to Colorado, then shoot myself in the head after spending some days enjoying the snow in the mountains. My panic attacks are always soothed when I think about killing myself. I always think, \u201cyeah it\u2019s fine, you\u2019re gonna die in December anyway\u201d and then I\u2019m calm. It would be easier to do it if I didn\u2019t have loved ones. I\u2019ve successfully isolated myself from friends. Although I\u2019ll still participate in my best friends wedding, I won\u2019t be seeing him much before then. I\u2019m a vain, selfish, egotistical, manipulative, grimy, disgusting, and repulsive person. Waking up everyday in my body and in my mind gives me an overwhelming sense of regret, fear, anger, and depression. I hate myself more than anything and anyone I\u2019ve ever met. I do not deserve the good people around me. I do not deserve to be attended to or loved in any way.   People will start to see how badly I plagued their lives. In their last stages of grief they will come to realize that I was a disease. I deserve to die right this second, but I have to wait. Idk whether it\u2019s selfishness or honesty. But I want to give them good memories of me in these last months. I want people to think that I\u2019m turning my life around, taking time to heal myself, and making the right choices so that they don\u2019t notice how bad things really are for me.
