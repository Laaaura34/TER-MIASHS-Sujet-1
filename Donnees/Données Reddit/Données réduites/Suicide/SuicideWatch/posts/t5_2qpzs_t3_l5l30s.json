I keep thinking to myself over and over that I am a terrible person, a rapist, and the like. Recent events in which myself and others needed to confront a friend of ours who sexually assaulted someone made a lot of these thoughts and shame come back to me and I\u2019m scared about what I will do to myself now.\n\nWhen I was a 12 year old I\u2019d just sort of discovered what sex was. One night my sisters friends and I had a sort of slumber party in the bedroom, and while this girl next to me was asleep, I was curious, and I put my hand down the front of her pyjamas because I wanted to know what it felt like. I didn\u2019t really know where anything was. I soon realised in my head \u201cthis isn\u2019t right\u201d in some way and I stopped. \n\nSince then, I\u2019ve grasped with it at various times. I\u2019ve spoken to friends and they say to me \u201cman you were 12, who cares\u201d but I don\u2019t know. I feel vile. I feel like I\u2019m betraying people, like my girlfriend who obviously doesn\u2019t know this happened. I am plagued by this thought and it hasn\u2019t left me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/l5l30s/molested_someone_at_age_12_dont_think_i_was_aware/", "title": "Molested someone at age 12.
