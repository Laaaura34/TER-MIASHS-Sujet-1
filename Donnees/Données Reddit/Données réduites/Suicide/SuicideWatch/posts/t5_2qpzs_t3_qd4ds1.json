I was going to drive around and ruminate while I waited for the pawn shop to open, I was to purchase a gun from them and shoot myself sometime that afternoon. I had been watching some porn on my laptop I used to use for work. I decided to go home and clear my browser history as I left the device pretty accessible to my family. I then had a conversation with my mom asking me why I left so early. It was nice small talk and fresh air from nagging. I checked my emails and received an offer letter for a position I was looking forward too. \n\n I have been depressed for at least 10 years, I am a 22 year old father. My child is nearly 4 years old. He was taken from me last year, and brought to me this spring with a speech delay and behavioral issues. I have quite a few issues myself having experienced ostracism and also being that I was a foster kid and my bio mom diagnosed schizoaffective. \n\nI\u2019m on mobile so please excuse the sheer incoherence, i\u2019ll leave this here :D", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qd4ds1/forgetting_to_clear_my_browser_history_actually/", "title": "Forgetting to clear my browser history actually prolonged my life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "getmetfoffthisrock", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634859587, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qd4ds1/forgetting_to_clear_my_browser_history_actually/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427992.3550735, "replies_charged": false}
