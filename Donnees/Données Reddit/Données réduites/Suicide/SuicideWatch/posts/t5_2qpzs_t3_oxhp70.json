This was during some foggy days that I simply can\u2019t remember no matter how hard I try to think about it. I now believe I was in a psychosis. I\u2019d like to not go further into that part because I\u2019m awaiting a professional opinion and treatment. \n\nHowever. At the hospital I had to go through some treatments to recover. Scared and confused I wasn\u2019t sure if I should tell my parent or not. After a long talk with the doctor I decided they could tell my parent in case they where concerned. I truly regret my decision now. \n\nMy parent went into some sort of panic mode and almost harassed the hospital I was in. Calling the doctors all the time asking all kinds of questions demanding them to keep me there etc. I asked my parent to stop their behavior because it was causing me unnecessary distress. Trying to explain to them how I felt and so on. My parent refuses to listen to what I have to say. Telling me I\u2019m ill as if this is completely new to me. This is something I\u2019ve been dealing with for years and I\u2019m trying to make sure I get the help I need. My parent have always been aware of my mental state because I\u2019ve been expressing this a lot over the years. Now I believe they haven\u2019t really been paying attention to me being open and honest all along. This hurts me very much. \n\nMy parent have almost been bashing me over this very incident ever since it happened some weeks ago. Telling me that I\u2019m unstable. Saying that I should\u2019ve come to them in advance even tho I have, they just didn\u2019t listen. I also gave my doctor consent to tell my parent because I trusted them expecting this to be kept between us. Now a lot of family members I don\u2019t even speak to knows. And my parent feels the need to tell me \u201cThey don\u2019t know about it\u201d totally random in any conversation if we talk about someone. (Conversations that\u2019s totally unrelated to this topic)\n\nMy question is have any if you experienced anything like this? How did you deal with it?\n\nI\u2019m trying to get past this and recover and not be dragged right back to that awfully painful event. It\u2019s almost like my parent is trying to make me a prisoner in my own past.
