I think I was pretty lonely at the time, but never got to notice until now. My father remarried, and we had some family problem's along the way, I think the worst was when I was left with my suicidal mother in fifth grade, and my sister saying I at least got to stay with our parents and shouldn't complain. I finally had some company when I finally got a dog, but she sadly passed away last may.\nOften, there are days where I feel like I have no one to talk to, or even the right to talk to someone, cause I sometimes don't even know how to explain why I'm sad; i think i have lots of friends, from the ones I made in kindergarten till the ones I made through the years until now, but still, I always feel alone, like I'm in the dark. \nI never even once liked myself, I always tried to at least live with it, accepting the fact I wasn't as pretty as everyone else, but now, I don't think I can keep up with that; I'm just tired, so tired, I just want to disappear, to be forgotten, and be at peace with myself, I always thought that the simplest way out was through suicide, but I didn't want to be an hassle as a corpse, or with the cost for the funeral or maybe scarring my friends for life, it would be meaningless at that point. \nI always suppress my feelings with everyone, I think I'm not that sad to ask for help, cause I always compare my problems with other's, and honestly i always thought i had no right to feel bad since there were people who got it much worse; but I never fake a smile in front of my friends, I'm glad they see me as cheerful and lively, I love each and every one of my friends in a unique way, and I really love hugs and to pamper them too whenever I get the chance. \nBut you know, I think I just had enough, that I did everything I wanted to, cause there's not much i look forward to in life anymore. I always thought that if something happened to me I'd be okay with it, i'd accept it, of course I'd feel sorry for everyone, but I think they'd forget me with time, I just don't wanna be me, it tires me too much, but this opportunity never came, and I don't wanna wait for it forever.\nI just want to go, but I feel like I'd just mess up big time, even if it's my last. \nI'm sorry for the vent, I think I just wanted to let someone know.\nEdit: I thank everyone in advance for reading all of this and for texting me privately/commenting on the post! If anyone is feeling the same way as me, I'd gladly have a chat with you and maybe even keep eachother company a little!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m6jd7j/i_16f_had_enough_with_myself/", "title": "I (16F) had enough with myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Afriendlyfroggy", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615928621, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m6jd7j/i_16f_had_enough_with_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423038.1062522, "replies_charged": false}
