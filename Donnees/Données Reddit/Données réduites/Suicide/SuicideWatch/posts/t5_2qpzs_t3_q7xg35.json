Its just that life is so boring, I cant seem to find enjoyment from anything. Waking up is the worst thing in the day, and going to sleep is such a drag. Does life get better, its not like im always suffering, or at least i dont think i am. Its just that every day is so dull and unsatisfying. I dont want to die yet, but i dont really wanna live either. everything just sorta happens, with me getting drawn into whatever suggests. I cant commit to anything, and that just makes me feel even worse. Because im sure if i tried to kill myself, I would dip out at the last second and decide not to. At this point im just going through life hoping a bomb detonates under my feet, so i can escape this boredom without any guilt. at least that way there wouldnt be anything i could do.
