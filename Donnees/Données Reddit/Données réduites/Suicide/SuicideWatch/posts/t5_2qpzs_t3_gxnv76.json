I had goals and I was meeting them! A big one I had was my weight lose, I was so close to being under two hundred pounds! And then around February I started to get depressed. I have always gotten depressed but it would last about 1-2 weeks and then be gone. It wasn\u2019t the case this time. I gain back 20lbs in a two months and I could feel it. My girlfriend at the time told me to go to a therapist but I didn\u2019t want to because it always passed. \n\nSo a few more months went by, still depressed. But I was able to go to Florida with my girlfriend and hang out for a week out there! We had a great trip and it was fun! And for that week I felt amazing and no depression! Or at least it felt like it was gone, but it was just waiting for the high to wear off to come back. \n\nI was with my girlfriend for two-ish years and I thought to myself that she was the one! I bought her a beautiful ring! I asked her to marry me and she said YES!! I was feeling indestructible! All of our friends were so happy for us and it felt great! But I was still depressed and gained a little more weight and I was about 230lbs then. \n\nShe loved me so much and I her! But depression was still there scratching and screaming to be in full control. Around September my fianc\u00e9e and I were talking about breaking up because she was starting to resent me. It was hard to give someone my full attention when depression was demanding so much. But I wanted to work it out and I said I would go to therapy. The lady I was talking to was really nice but I felt like it wasn\u2019t going anywhere. And I was open to it and I was sharing everything with her. I told her I kept feeling The Call of The Void. Every time I went out on a motorcycle ride I was okay if a deer ran out in front of me and killed me. Also thought a lot about a vehicle hitting while I rode. If I saw it coming I would welcome it. The therapist said it would be best if I got started on antidepressants. My Doc put me on Wellbutrin, at first it game me lots of energy. I was way more talkative than usual. And then it started to mess with my head. Thoughts of suicide would pop up more often. But I stuck with it. \n\nThen my fianc\u00e9e didn\u2019t want to be with me anymore. She couldn\u2019t handle my depression anymore. She told me that she wasn\u2019t a good person and she wouldn\u2019t be able to stay with me because she doesn\u2019t know how to deal with it. And at this point I was completely destroyed. My heart just got broken and I felt so alone. The person I wanted to be partners with for the rest of ours abandon me. And at this point the Wellbutrin was grabbing a hold of me, I have never been so scared. I thought about killing myself 5 or more times a day for a month straight. I put my gun in my mouth several times to try and end my torment. But I always thought about my family to have me back away from that ledge. \n\nI finally talked to my Doc and she put me on Zoloft and it helped a lot. Still thought of suicide would pop up once in a while but I would never do it. So I feel my world crumble around me and I just stayed laying in the wreckage.. And then food became my help. I kept eating and eating. To the point we\u2019re now I\u2019m at 300lbs or probably more. I went for a check up and I\u2019m pre diabetic, high blood pressure, and now a thyroid problem. I know what I\u2019m doing is hurting me but down , this is just another way to commit suicide and this wouldn\u2019t hurt my family as much as if I would put a gun in my month and let go. But I\u2019m on medication to help with reversing what I have caused and I\u2019m going to talk to my doc about changing my depression meds. I\u2019m on a max dose of Zoloft and it does nothing for me. I\u2019m just scared to try another one because of what Wellbutrin did. This is a struggle I\u2019m going through right now and it doesn\u2019t help that Covid is around. I just wanted to put this out. I\u2019m usually not one to share what\u2019s going on because it makes me feel weak but I need to change how I think.
