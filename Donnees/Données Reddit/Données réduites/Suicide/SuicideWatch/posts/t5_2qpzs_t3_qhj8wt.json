I've had multiple friends in the past commit suicide and was curious on what kind of intervention they might have had of they called it. I was connected with what I can only say was an older gentleman and after talking with him for a few minutes, after kinda a sad lonely night, and telling him my reasoning for calling was greeted with nothing but honesty and compassion. He assured me to call anytime when you feel like there's no one to talk to and I can say that he made my night incredibly more easy. I thanked him for the service he was doing and then we said goodbye and hung up. My question is tho.. was I wrong for calling when I know I'm not suicidal?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qhj8wt/to_the_people_who_work_suicide_prevention/", "title": "To the People who work suicide prevention", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Montanamade317", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635413736, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qhj8wt/to_the_people_who_work_suicide_prevention/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422993.359963, "replies_charged": false}
