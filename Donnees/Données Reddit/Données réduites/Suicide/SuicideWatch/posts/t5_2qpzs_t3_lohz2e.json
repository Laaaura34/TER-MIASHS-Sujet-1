Long story short, back in September of 2020 my body started deteriorating. During my stay at CamH, I coughed up a huge chunk of throat tissue and my body experienced other abnormalities. I attribute my symptoms to severe insomnia, depression, boredom, and inactivity. I literally did nothing for several weeks straight because I was so depressed. To sum it all up I basically can no longer exercise anymore and my libido is low due to the medication I am on. My body is weak and frail, I have do deal with pains every day. I'm thinking of ending my life. Should I? What are your thoughts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Thinking of suicide because my physical condition is weak/permanently damaged  due to severe insomnia and depression.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lohz2e/im_thinking_of_suicide/", "title": "I'm thinking of suicide", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MoodyBuzzKill", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613858908, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lohz2e/im_thinking_of_suicide/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427073.424114, "replies_charged": false}
