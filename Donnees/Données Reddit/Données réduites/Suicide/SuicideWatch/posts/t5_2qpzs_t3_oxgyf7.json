I have a prescription for Xanax, but I just can't bring myself to using it.\n\nSame for my insomnia. For obvious reasons I don't have sleeping pills anymore, but my doc prescribed Lorazepam in case my anxiety/insomnia got extremely bad. But I really can't get myself to taking any of it.\n\nOn one hand I'm so proud of my self-control, but on the other hand it annoys me that I'm making my life more difficult.\n\nI do have a plan of action for my anxiety. I researched a few anxiolytics and found a couple that isn't sedative/hypnotic. I'll definitely be asking my doc if they're options for me. I still don't know what I'm going to do about the insomnia though.\n\nEdit: It's currently 2:35 am where I live.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oxgyf7/not_wanting_to_rely_on_medication_to_treat_my/", "title": "Not wanting to rely on medication to treat my anxiety and insomnia is a double edged sword.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "The_cowardly_fog", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628037281, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oxgyf7/not_wanting_to_rely_on_medication_to_treat_my/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426508.678974, "replies_charged": false}
