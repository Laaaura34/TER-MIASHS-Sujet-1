I choosed to not have job because I don't know what i want so I stayed unemployed for the majority of my lifetime. I am now 27. But I dealed with depression and anxiety for maybe about 10+ years what kept me in my room watching adult sites to have coping mechanism from all the pain I have. Now I am close the be free from bad addictions but still suffer from wrong mindset and regret about my past. Sometimes I think of ending my life and never come back. I wished I have a normal family life, married and having children, but itsn't seems like that. I lose hope when times go by.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p4t2zk/my_life_is_full_of_failure/", "title": "My life is full of failure", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "APerson114", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629032816, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p4t2zk/my_life_is_full_of_failure/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426976.2490053, "replies_charged": false}
