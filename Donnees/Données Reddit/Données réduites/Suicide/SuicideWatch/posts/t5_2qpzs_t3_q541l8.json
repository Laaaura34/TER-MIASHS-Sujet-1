I\u2019m premed taking bio and chem together (the hardest known courses at my university: didn\u2019t know at the time I registered). I\u2019m failing out of school and I\u2019ve been pretending as if I\u2019m fine/ perfect to my peers and family (family doesn\u2019t handle mental health issues well). I\u2019ve been having overwhelming suicidal thoughts to the point where I genuinely believe it\u2019s the best option and whatever is the afterlife or whatever I\u2019d go is better than what all I\u2019m going through. I have a therapist but I\u2019ve been hospitalized (when I was younger) and I hated it and pretty much was treated like an animal. I can\u2019t go to another one again. I don\u2019t know who or if I can admit to how I genuinely feel; I genuinely have suicide plans thought out of 4 different ways I could quickly end my life. I feel like I\u2019m drowning at the bottom of the ocean and almost each night so far (~3 nights) I cry myself to sleep and have a hard time breathing because how overwhelmed I feel. I called the Suicide Prevention hotline and it was the worst mistake of my life: he didn\u2019t care and genuinely invalidated my emotions and I honestly lost it in the restroom after that. I\u2019ve lost my mental health at the point and the last thing I can loose is myself at this point.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q541l8/can_i_be_heard/", "title": "Can I be heard?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "PaleontologistOk2726", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633854397, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q541l8/can_i_be_heard/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635427873.4580944, "replies_charged": false}
