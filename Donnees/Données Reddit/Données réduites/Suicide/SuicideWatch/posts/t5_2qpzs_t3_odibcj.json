I've been suicidal since i was 9 or 10 and I've never thought I would have made as far as 17. When the pandemic happened and crushed my dreams for 2020 I still held on for more than a year and will probably live to see it end. I hate myself with a passion but at the same time I will admit that I'm proud of myself for making it this far. I truly never thought I could do it. Even before the pandemic I endured abuse, social exclusion, and intense loneliness at school for years. I even got to graduate high school. But all of this has taken such a hight toll on me and I just don't have it in me anymore. I seriously can't do this anymore and I don't see much of a point either. I recently decided I would pull a middle finger on the universe and I finally realised that all this pain wasn't worth it. In fact it was all for nothing. Well it looks like I have lost to depression and sometimes I have this feeling if this pandemic didn't happen victory could have been mine. I don't have a method yet but when I obtain one I will be on my way. When that time comes I'll die knowing that I gave it all I had.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/odibcj/ive_lost_the_battle/", "title": "I've lost the battle.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LuckyLincer1916", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625396854, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/odibcj/ive_lost_the_battle/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427105.0527563, "replies_charged": false}
