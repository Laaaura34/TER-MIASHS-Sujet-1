I don\u2019t want to say I\u2019ve had a bad life, just a sour enough of one to leave me unable to look forward.\n\nI grew up in an unstable home life - usual never met dad, alcoholic mom, abusive and racist step father (I\u2019m \u2018only\u2019 half white) - had my runs in with verbal and sexual abuse as a child and bounced between family members.\nI developed numerous chronic health conditions, all of which inhibit my life and are painful.\nI began engaging in self harm and it\u2019s been a struggle since. I was diagnosed with depression/anxiety but never saw therapists long term.\n\nFast forward and I thought id \u201cbeaten it\u201d living to most what appeared as a productive and busy life. But I still constantly struggled with thoughts of self harm, made an attempt on my life (was back at work in 48 hrs), couldn\u2019t make friends, and felt so overlooked and unwanted. I was put on lexapro.\nThan I began succumbing to substance abuse as I realized I\u2019d put my all in it but still felt so insecure, isolated and hated. Like everyone was biding their time till I \u201cdisappeared\u201d so they could move on, I was simply an annoying roadblock to dispose of. I began feeling relief from these thoughts with alcohol and inevitably lost all control\n\nThan 2020. I was fired from a long term job (my fault), destroyed a long relationship (Also my fault), and began engaging in a highly volatile relationship - both of us substance abusers, we swung from \u201cyour my soul mate I love you\u201d to \u201cwho can leave the biggest bruise this time\u201d. But I remember how desperately I just needed to feel wanted - I just so badly wanted to feel like someone wanted me around. He did that\nI had managed to isolate myself - with no contact from anyone I\u2019d previously surrounded myself with. Than the pandemic and the only person I had to support me through was this abusive partner. Both lost jobs, left financially with nothing, unsure how to even eat. \nThis continued before I was found with a .34 BAC in the middle of an unknown lawn - id been sexually assaulted. \n\nIn august I\u2019d been baker acted (3rd time in the year) diagnosed with PTSD, BPD, and severe depression complicated by anxiety. Now I was put on Effexor, Remeron, and Prazosin \n I lost everything - home, car, no job. My family found out about the abuse and helped separate me. They\u2019re now trying to be of support; worried about how I\u2019ve always repressed emotions in an attempt to ignore everything starting from childhood - if it hadn\u2019t been for my siblings they would\u2019ve never gotten the \u201cfull story\u201d. \n\nMy previous ex reached out and we began seeing each other again after rumors that I was involved with a known domestic abuser got back to him. (Apparently how volatile this man was was common knowledge in our area unbeknownst to me). He\u2019s trying to offer support as best he can and has openly helped me cut contact.\n\nStill it\u2019s gotten no better, I feel like everyone around me is annoyed waiting for me to get up and do something - to \u201cget back\u201d. But I have no will to do so. I felt like I\u2019d built myself up, like I was in the brink of possibly having a \u2018successful life\u2019 (top achievements at work, making steps in my dream career, lots of hobbies and exercising) and even than I was being eaten on the inside, and had so easily destroyed it all in the matter of months. I don\u2019t have to energy to try again. I have no hope for what my future but hang around to \u201cnot be selfish, to keep my head up, it gets better etc\u201d\nI feel like I\u2019ve completely lost the ability to swallow my emotions and have been left completely raw where every emotional touch fucking hurts. I\u2019m so all over on a day to day basis until i finally feel shut off and numb\nI\u2019m terrified of going out in public and purposely try to shop at female dominated stores. I\u2019m constantly in this fog. I have constant panic attacks, can\u2019t stop replaying events and how awful id been and how quickly I burned my life to the ground.\n\nI wake up and cry that I\u2019m waking up. My entire insides ache at the thought of trying to push through another day. Went from being independent to \u201cbabysat\u201d constantly. I\u2019m resentful towards everything and everyone because they\u2019ve already proved how much they can live life when I\u2019ve just \u201cvanished\u201d - I\u2019m not even a second thought which isn\u2019t even their fault but I\u2019m angry.\n\nI can\u2019t get a therapist (turned down, health insurance doesn\u2019t cover) and the one I had a session with asked if I\u2019d spoken to my assaulter..... to Get a better understanding or his thoughts on what happened.\n\nI don\u2019t want to keep going. I don\u2019t want to try anymore. I\u2019m exhausted. I feel so used, gutted and discarded. I\u2019m sober since august but feel no better - I miss how nothing mattered when I drank and the days all blurred together. I feel like I\u2019m simply burdening everyone, completely unable to try and progress past this. I just can\u2019t seem to find it. I just don\u2019t want to participate in it all anymore - I want to be alone, away from everyone, left to rot by self somewhere. \nI\u2019m not even sure why I\u2019m here - just hoping if maybe I lay it all out there... idk. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for this dump, if you read it all thanks.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kpqkgx/i_dont_want_to_participate_in_life_anymore/", "title": "I don\u2019t want to participate in life anymore", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Astrugglingnobody", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1609700659, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kpqkgx/i_dont_want_to_participate_in_life_anymore/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426417.27692, "replies_charged": false}
