My name is Juli\u00ebtte and I'm 19 years old (soon to be 20). My whole life I've struggled with normal behaviour. and with that, I mean that my family is messed up, and even though that shouldn't influence me as it does, cuz I know how to behave like the best person ever, literally. I am seen as the social bubbly person who is nice to everyone and can laugh about everything. That is true, however, that's not how I really feel anymore. It is such a big mask I can't bear anymore. At the age of 8, i developed anorexia nervosa and at 16 the exact same thing lol. But the second time my brain switched literally from not being aware and just existing to being over-aware of myself and overthinking every move, but more like observing and testing. Maybe it's some sort of BPD, maybe it's just a normal way of thinking idk. Also, I'm in my first years of university studying biology. That made me hate our biological system and temptations more. Like are we really that dumb that we ruin a good relationship just for sex, bruh? That's so fkin dumb and stupid. I'm a woman and my boyfriend explains to me that in the end, I can't have male friends, cuz they just wanna fuck or just don't stand a chance and lay themselves down to that idea. Just everyone cannot contain themselves, it's so sad to see. I think we are a very weak species and shouldn't continue living, even tho we are so proud of ourselves. The only 2 human beings I stay here for, are my wonderful sister and my boyfriend. They both also feel kinda this way and both wouldn't mind dying too, but have to outlive our enemies, right? He almost certainly has BPD and wanted to commit a few times vice versa, my sister. Together it feels good, but apart I just don't see a point. Like DAE feel this way? For sure, but maybe you can help me how to put sense into this life.. hehe \n\nTL;TR\nI find our species dumb and don\u2019t feel like living, advice?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n13g3u/us_humans_are_dumb_just_dont_feel_like_it_anymore/", "title": "Us humans are dumb, just don't feel like it anymore", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SharriSchwab", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619699990, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n13g3u/us_humans_are_dumb_just_dont_feel_like_it_anymore/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422274.3896866, "replies_charged": false}
