I'm a pretty terrible person. The only good thing I can say about me is I have a working moral compass because I know I'm not following it. I know to stay silent about the truly horrible things I've done. Society wants nothing to do with me and society's instinct is correct, even though it's for the wrong reason. Every person who has given me a chance realized I was a terrible person and left me but most people assume I'm a decent person but they just don't want to have anything to do with me. I want so badly to say everybody abandoned me but I do not feel cutting terrible people out of your life should count as abandoning someone. \n\nLet me explain to you how terrible a person I am. I had only attempted to end my life once before and literally nobody knows about it. Just so you know this isn't a pattern of behavior. I contacted the only people who ever claimed to care for me before I tried ending things and they didn't care. They left me long ago for how terrible I was, and they're kind, giving people who constantly put others before themselves but they do not care that I am \"dead\" at the moment (I should be dead and they for sure know that's the case but they don't care).\n\nThe stupid thing is I've spent the last few years dramatically improving my life through therapy, medication and general self improvement but at the core of everything I am just a person I despise. The people who legitimately loved me realized how terrible i am while they only hady a surface level understanding of how awful I am and they decided to leave me to die. I have the full picture, and it's much uglier than the one the people who used to know me decided to remove from their life. So why wouldn't I remove it from my life as well?\n\nBefore they left me I had this idea that I could turn things around and ignore all the terrible things I've done but I legit hate everyone at this point. I felt like as long as my hatred was pointed inwards it was possible to redeem myself. I hate the people who left me. Other people's pain actively makes me feel good. I used not to be this way. Very recently I used not to be this way. A disaster would happen like 8 months ago and I'd literally become so saddened by it that i couldn't get out of bed. Like, I'd think of the Challenger disaster and just lie in bed depressed as fuck crying thinking about how terrible it was. Nowadays I feel like I'm on the verge of literally masturbating when terrible things happen to people because it's such a pleasure to me. The kinder the person is who is hurt the more pleasure I feel. My ex-friends were very kind people and if they still knew me and something bad happened to them I do not think I could hold back from indulging in the satisfaction my hatred brings me. I was not a good person before people's suffering brought me delight but it's driven me towards being monstrous. And I'm no exception. Terrible things happen to me is also a delight. I literally am begging for my world to fall apart.\n\nI am not sure what I hope to accomplish with this. I attempted the big deed recently and I removed all my accounts on everything but i couldn't delete this one because I don't remember the password so I signed out of it but it's still on my phone. I'm signing out of this account on my phone once I finish writing here. I hope I am not around much longer. I think what I want to accomplish is to cause someone to feel saddened by the pain I feel at this moment. I do not want help. If Reddit didn't remove certain subreddits, I'd be posting in a community that encouraged the actions I'm planning.\n\nI am signing out of this account and I'll not be able to respond to any interaction I get on here. I would actually discourage anyone from talking to me regardless.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ojxhkv/i_do_not_understand_why_im_still_around/", "title": "I do not understand why I'm still around", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DisplayOk23", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626239697, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ojxhkv/i_do_not_understand_why_im_still_around/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423066.3873446, "replies_charged": false}
