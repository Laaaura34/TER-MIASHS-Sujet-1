Keep in mind that I'm sleep-deprived and completely shitfaced while writing this sooooo.\n\nI'm pretty sure that I've got no one that actually cares about me. And that is a fact, my parents have neglected me throughout my life so I've had to teach myself how to behave in social situations. I've been picked on quite a fair bit throughout my life, I'm 5'2 17M. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've now come to the realization that I might have a massive problem with narcotics, I use something at least every other day. I've kind of completely forgotten who I even am, I don't recognize myself anymore, I'm constantly paranoid, constantly delusional. My mind is going mental and I don't know why!\n\nLoneliness has completely ruined me, I don't want to exist anymore but I don't want to leave at the same time. I keep hearing these noises, it's like a constant beeping bit not at the same time. I feel like this is all just a test given to me by some form of an entity. Loneliness is scary and I fucking hate it I really do. Why can't I be the one who actually gets something nice for once? Why does it always have to be me that gets beat and shit, like it isn't fair!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBoredom is a danger that needs to get broken.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/i5zvqd/how_do_i_prevent_myself_from_doing_dumb_shit_to/", "title": "How do I prevent myself from doing dumb shit to avoid boredom and loneliness?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Vic__B", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1596896368, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/i5zvqd/how_do_i_prevent_myself_from_doing_dumb_shit_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427037.176697, "replies_charged": false}
