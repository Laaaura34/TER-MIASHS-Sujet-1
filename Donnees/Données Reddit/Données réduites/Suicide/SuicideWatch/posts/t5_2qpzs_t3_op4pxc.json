When the thoughts spiral too hard I get stuck in thinking what\u2019s the point of it all? \n\nI only ever wanted to pursue my passion in life, and I did. I made huge leaps and bounds after a lot of hard work and sacrifices. I\u2019m a primary name in a major motion picture soon to be released. People are proud, jealous, or look up to me. Idk. \n\nI wish I could get behind the perspective that this is a huge jumping off point for me, a huge step in the right direction\u2026 but I can\u2019t. The storm hit a few months ago and I\u2019m broke and living at home again. The work it took for me to get where I did did a number on my health. Which wasn\u2019t great to begin with, thanks to genetics. \n\nI still have stories I want to tell but the world is so fucked, who is it gonna help anyway? If I can even get it out there. I\u2019ve been on the inside. It\u2019s gross. \n\nI\u2019ve been depressed for years but I\u2019ve only been juggling with suicide for the past nine months, on and off. \n\nI\u2019m medicated. I exercise twice a day. I eat healthy. I sleep. Sometimes I drink and smoke, but I\u2019ve cut down a lot. I don\u2019t feel any better for it? \n\nI\u2019m single with no hope for love. I don\u2019t care about having kids, never have. I just wanted my career. Now I don\u2019t feel like I want anything but to die. I\u2019m tired of all this. \n\nI dont know what to do.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/op4pxc/looking_for_someone_to_talk_to/", "title": "Looking for someone to talk to", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwmeawaytoo22", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 18, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626920748, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/op4pxc/looking_for_someone_to_talk_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428193.3807483, "replies_charged": false}
