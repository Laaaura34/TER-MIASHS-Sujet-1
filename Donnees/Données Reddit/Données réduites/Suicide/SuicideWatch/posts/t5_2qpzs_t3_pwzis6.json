I made a list of people I'd leave notes to. If I try to kill myself, I need to succeed. I want to jump off a bridge, but the highest one in my city is only 50 meters high. So, I would probably also swallow a lethal dose of morphine just before jumping. I already have it. \n\nAll that is left to do is to find a way to jump over the 1.5 meter fence that is curved in towards the pathway to protect people from suicide. If I find a solution to that problem, I think it is over for me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pwzis6/planning_my_death_has_been_consuming_my_thoughts/", "title": "Planning my death has been consuming my thoughts lately", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "UnfairlyAlive", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632807068, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pwzis6/planning_my_death_has_been_consuming_my_thoughts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427454.2402682, "replies_charged": false}
