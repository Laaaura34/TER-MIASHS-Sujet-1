I've recently come back from a psychiatric hospital and I feel like it hasn't done anything for me, i wasn't feeling as bad as I did at home but I still didnt have any will to live and now I still want to end it and  I feel like all my friends and even my girlfriend are abandoning me. I know it's not necessarily true but they barely ever respond to my messages and I'm starting to wonder if I'm not the problem or if I'm just overthinking again. I have a few difficulties expressing myself so I dont even know if seeing a therapist is worth it. I've seen 3 already and none of them really helped me. I'm currently seeing one but I don't know if she'll be helpful. I just want to end everything God damn it, I'm so sick of myself. I hate my body, I hate my personality (if I even have one, sometimes it feels like I'm pretending to be someone) and I just overall need this pain to stop, I wish I could just make my brain stop overthinking about everything, being scared of everything, etc.. I don't even know if what I'm writing right now is making any sense, I'm unstable.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ppfgjz/im_tired_of_fighting/", "title": "I'm tired of fighting", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "NymousNymous", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631805924, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ppfgjz/im_tired_of_fighting/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426388.1882641, "replies_charged": false}
