Whenever i feel anger and hate all sadness and depression vaporises and I start to burn inside out. I dont want to lay down in bed. I want to do something, punch, smash. I want to change things, just make someone pay. But it never last long, for some fucking reason I cant stay angry. I am not easily tempered, get anger, just dont care about anything overall but when I get angry, tempered I cant be sad. Could we use such a force for change, create a diffrence for non changing depressed state that holds us and fucks our mind ?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lsxhyv/anger_and_hate_can_be_cure_for_depression/", "title": "Anger and hate can be cure for depression ?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "nebretemmahum", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 15, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614345438, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lsxhyv/anger_and_hate_can_be_cure_for_depression/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426824.3019018, "replies_charged": false}
