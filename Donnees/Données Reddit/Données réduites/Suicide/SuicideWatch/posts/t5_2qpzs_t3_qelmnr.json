The first night went rather well and the spiralling only started near the end, continuing after the game. The second night, I went full dissociation shortly after starting. I felt alone and like I didn't belong and just wanted to leave and lay down. Suicidal thoughts keept spiraling through my head all game, while we talked after the game and are still present now, after I have slept. Writing this post is the first thing I am doing, this morning.\n\nDuring the second night I felt very alien and like I didn't belong. It felt like I wasn't able to contribute at all and like I shouldn't be there. I didn't belong. I also started to feel like the other players didn't like me being there.\n\nBonus question: Could this mean that I'm a covert narcissist?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qelmnr/heavy_suicidal_thoughts_while_being_with_friends/", "title": "Heavy suicidal thoughts while being with friends", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwaway407392", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635052801, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qelmnr/heavy_suicidal_thoughts_while_being_with_friends/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427299.4171183, "replies_charged": false}
