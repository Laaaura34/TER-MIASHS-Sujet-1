I have *zero* access to firearms/drugs, and yes, I even tried not drinking at all, but that failed too. I can't be truly happy, I'm always worrying about shit, from school to friends to my parents, who, at this rate, will be get divorced and my mom will almost certainly be dead before I graduate. I feel like a monster for wanting them to get divorced, but I do, I do,  I do. I've brought up suicide around my friends a *lot,* but either they don't care (which is pretty likely, actually) or they're just oblivious (only really one of my friends). The friend, who I really like is getting an arranged marriage. My other friends are so, so far ahead of me at everything and I am the running joke. I feel like shit. I am, at any time, two seconds away from having a mental breakdown. I'm supposed to have died anyway - twice, really, and I think my time is up. Writing this, I feel like I should grab the wine in my fridge and some Tylenol and shut the door, but I won't. I can't. I'm a fucking coward. I don't wish I was dead as much as I wish the pain would go away. Anyway, I don't know what I'm asking for. Help? Advice? Techniques? I'm desperate. Please, if you can, try to help, please?
