She told me I can't heal because I live with the people who gave me that trauma. Does she think I'm made of money? I can't move out. I can't even hold a job. Fuck honestly, I can't even apply. The only thing on my mind are the ropes in my closet. But, I've tried that so many times and I can never convince myself to go all the way. I am a failure, through and through. No one will ever care about me. No one will ever love me. No one will feel even a hint of sadness over my lose. They're all waiting for it, calling my bluff always. They all know they don't need to get involved whatsoever unless I am a danger to myself. No one will support me with anything, but everyone will prolong my suffering. You're all a bunch of selfish cunts & bastards and I wish I'd get what I need for once. Instead of everyone else always getting what they want, and telling me to \"just be better. I did it. You can too.\" \n\nI don't care that you did it. I. Just. Want. To. Die.\nNothing else.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q0mt4z/tired_of_these_setbacks_i_wish_i_could_end_it_all/", "title": "Tired of these setbacks.
