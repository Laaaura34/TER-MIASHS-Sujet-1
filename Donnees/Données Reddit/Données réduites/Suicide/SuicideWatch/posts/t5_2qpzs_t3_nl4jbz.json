I am also indecisive and hate making decisions because the results are never good, by way of explaining why I'm not dead yet. I'm relentless, stubborn, and I keep trying. But so far, at age 60, life was not worth it and is not worth it. \n\nNew experience:  Past couple days, I just stop what I'm doing and sit and hang my head. I think of my method. I think of how I don't want to be here, alive. I have no reason to live and no one who cares much about me. No connection, no place for me in this world. And I think about my method(s) and refine it, though I'm set on one method in particular. Thanks to Geo Stone, I have more than one method. If it's good enough for a medical doctor, it's good enough for me.\n\nAnd I feel like I might just do it. The thoughts are more intrusive. I know how I'll kill myself, and now I have the where, as well. Really should do my will, so my money goes to a conservation org instead of the government, but that's all that's holding me back.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nl4jbz/strange_new_experience/", "title": "Strange new experience", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throw-me-away-out", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1621990459, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nl4jbz/strange_new_experience/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426626.353992, "replies_charged": false}
