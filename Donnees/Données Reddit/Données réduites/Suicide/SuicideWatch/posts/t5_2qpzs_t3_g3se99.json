I want to die so badly, and I can't even remember the last time I was happy. I feel so hopeless, and I really feel like it's time for me to check into a mental hospital. \n\nHOWEVER, I'm really scared of a few things. The hospitals in my area have been affected by COVID-19, and I'm scared that I'll catch it, if I go. I also don't feel like I'm a priority - all medical attention should be focused on the current global crisis, right? Asking for attention right now feels so selfish and stupid. \n\nAlso, I just don't know what to expect. Will they take my phone? What are my parents gonna say? Where am I actually going to go, once I tell someone I need help? What's going to happen?\n\nI'm so scared of these questions that I might not go at all. But if I don't, I think I'm gonna end it. I feel so trapped, absolutely paralyzed by my own indecision.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/g3se99/i_wanna_check_into_a_hospital_but_im_scared/", "title": "I Wanna Check into a Hospital, but I'm Scared", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "stargazeryo", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1587234625, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/g3se99/i_wanna_check_into_a_hospital_but_im_scared/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426658.5387197, "replies_charged": false}
