All the sayings of \u201cits not an option\u201d or \u201cits a long term solution for a short term problem\u201d but what if the problem is long term? What if the problem is me? Not just low self esteem but a ton of trauma. A ton of amnesia. A ton of uncontrollable mood swings. A ton of fighting until you cant fight anymore. And I cant fight anymore. \nI stopped fighting the sadness and vibe with it.\nI stopped fighting the anger and let it take control.\nI stopped fighting the eating disorder\nMy dad\nMy relationships\nI stopped fighting\nAnd maybe for the first time\nI feel like its the right thing\nJust letting go of all the control\nI fell back into my bad habbits of drinking, smoking and self harming but honestly? It feels like I belong here. Why fight that life when the fight never stops?\nI think the same about suicide now.\nRight now I\u2019m just thinking about it\nWrapping my mind around that calming thoughts \nBut one day I will be back on a bridge\nBelow me the stormy water\nAnd I will let go\nBecause fighting those thoughts costs energy\nAnd theres so little left of that.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pzynim/suicide_isnt_an_option_until_it_is/", "title": "Suicide isnt an option until it is", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "littlechili02", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 48, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633192904, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pzynim/suicide_isnt_an_option_until_it_is/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426851.3200226, "replies_charged": false}
