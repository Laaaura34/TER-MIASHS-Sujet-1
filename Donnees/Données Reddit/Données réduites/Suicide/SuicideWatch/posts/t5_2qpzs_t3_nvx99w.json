Yet somehow woke up 18 hours later. I had puked at some point all over. It looked like blood, about a pint.\n\n\nStill I felt ok, just sleepy. That was the best sleep I'd had in years.\n\n\nLooks like the dosage wasn't high enough. I feel like I'm done eating, talking, whatever. I'm just gonna take the remaining pills and end it.\n\nI just wish I felt better about ending it, because life does have nice things. I'm just not allowed to enjoy them.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nvx99w/suicide_attempt_failed_but_today_i_leave/", "title": "Suicide attempt failed, but today I leave", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "teeamor", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 57, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623248910, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nvx99w/suicide_attempt_failed_but_today_i_leave/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428545.5348074, "replies_charged": false}
