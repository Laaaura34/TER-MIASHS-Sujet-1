I\u2019m seeing my boyfriend at the end of this week but that doesn\u2019t even matter. I love him but we have to be long distance now. He is 9 hours ahead. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll see him after this and I don\u2019t know how long I can handle this. I don\u2019t want anyone else I love this man and only him. But who cares. My rooms a mess I\u2019m a mess and I want to die. This is a new account but about a year ago I posted here and got help. \nNow I\u2019m back again. I relapsed with self harm and bulimia. I don\u2019t care. I just want to die. I don\u2019t make sense I know and that\u2019s because my brain is fuzz. I can\u2019t make it till Friday to see him. I can\u2019t even make it through the fucking day. \nSomeone kill me please.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/demf26/i_want_to_fucking_die/", "title": "I want to fucking die", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "sadpeachgirl", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1570468237, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/demf26/i_want_to_fucking_die/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422942.5567627, "replies_charged": false}
