It's close. Mentally I can feel it. The ability to keep fighting slipping from me. It's, cathartic in a strange way. I feel my chest tightening. A part of me is fighting my decision but it's not loud enough. \n\nThe future holds so much I'll never get to see it. I'll miss the new hollow knight game, I never got to play ps5, I'll miss rocket ships and scientific discoveries. Shit man. Crazy to think the world just keeps going no matter how dead I am. Have I always thought in such a 1 world view way? I haven't even figured my whole self out. Oh well. \n\nSorry I couldn't be stronger for my family or my friends.  It's just to much now. Will the hanging be painful? I don't want to find out but I'm about to. No more pain. No more ringing in my ears. Finally just silence and bliss. I'm ready. \n\nThis is it. This is really it. Such an exhilarating feeling. Goodbye.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qgsbsy/this_is_my_suicide_morning_i_just_need_to_speak/", "title": "This is my suicide morning.
