Kinda like Romeo and Juliet. Maybe I have some very toxic codependency issues but that way of dying seems so beautiful and romantic to me. I keep attracting lame \u201cuptight\u201d a holes. I have not attracted anyone who\u2019s damaged like me who\u2019s just want to die. I want to show my scars and my pain to someone else and vice versa I want to heal and cut. I want to bruise myself, I want to hate and hurt myself but also get nurtured. A constant cycle til one day we decide to just do it. I know it sounds like a fantasy but like a beautiful one to me. Me and my lover wouldn\u2019t be strong enough to overcome our trauma. I want to leave this crappy place with them. And disappear and lose touch with reality. Kinda like this movie called \u201cbug\u201d back from 2006. Two a strange, mental ill yet lonely ppl kill themselves after finding each other.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qexxiz/i_want_to_kill_myself_with_my_lover/", "title": "I want to kill myself with my lover", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "HopeLoveLess_", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 65, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635099922, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qexxiz/i_want_to_kill_myself_with_my_lover/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635425296.0151348, "replies_charged": false}
