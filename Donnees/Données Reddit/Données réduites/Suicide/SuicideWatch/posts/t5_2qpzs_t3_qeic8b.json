I can\u2019t stop feeling like my life is already over.\n\nI\u2019m in so much debt and I\u2019m leaving school because I can\u2019t afford to put myself in more debt for a degree that might not even help me secure a better paying job.\n\nI don\u2019t have a car because I struggled with awful driving anxiety for so long. I\u2019m trying to get my license now, driving nearly every day. It\u2019s not easy and I\u2019m still so scared of hurting someone. I was able to get a job finally but I\u2019m trying to work fuller hours since I\u2019m leaving school but it all depends on if they can give me a schedule where my roommate can take me to work. Buses near me aren\u2019t reliable enough to depend on and I can\u2019t have many attendance issues or I might get fired. \n\nI\u2019m trying so hard to be optimistic but everything just feels so heavy, and my thoughts are just getting darker everyday. I keep having thoughts of just driving a knife into myself. I know I need to get help but I can\u2019t afford it. I tried to get help before but it just made everything worse and I had an awful breakdown that even put me on short-term disability for a month. It was terrible and I never want to feel my mind shatter like that ever again. \n\nI just want to be okay again. I haven\u2019t felt okay in so long. I finally stopped covering it up with alcohol, but I just want to go back to being a mindless drunk. I feel like there\u2019s nothing for me here and I\u2019m going to be working shitty jobs just to make ends meet forever.\n\nWhat\u2019s the point? Why keep fighting for a life I don\u2019t want? Why keep crying every day? I don\u2019t want to deal with anything anymore. I don\u2019t want to keep trying. I can\u2019t, I just can\u2019t. I\u2019m too tired.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qeic8b/i_cant_stop_crying/", "title": "I can\u2019t stop crying", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ForeverAdorable", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635039702, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qeic8b/i_cant_stop_crying/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635426830.4696748, "replies_charged": false}
