Now I am trying to join group I can't find a religipus group or something for me. As normal groups what I see always I felt like I have been betrayed by humanity. Whenever I look somewhere in earth, wheter real world or any sites on internet people are pure evil. Harming without any justification. Literally no compassion in this world. This is my last post on reddit. Than I won't post anymore and I will avoid from people too. I can't avoid anymore from my feelings anymore. Hate is wrapping all of my body.
