My hip is damaged from a very bad fall back in 2008, needless to say I am in constant pain to the extent it interferes with daily life. I take muscle relaxers and narcotic pain killers, but they only help so much. Most days I feel like eating a bullet (today is one of those days). I have access (I own  gun) but I also have kids. I can't do that to them. I am getting help to fix my back issues and I hope they will do something about my hip. I am NOT depressed, I am in constant pain. The type of pain killers I am prescribed is barely enough to ease the pain and it is because of drug users I can't get anything stronger, and I am afraid of asking for something stronger because I do not want to be labeled a 'drug seeker'. I once went to a pain management clinic in a near by town years ago (2011) and the doctor there said I was too young to be in this much pain. I told him he was a piece of shit doctor and to fuck off and I said loud enough for everyone to hear, later I found out he got hooked on drugs and fired from that clinic. Later I went to a another pain clinic in my town (it was new) and he was the one running it. I saw a lovely PA there and she couldn't prescribe me anything but belbuca which didn't work, and to get anything stronger I would have to see the doctor who ran the facility which was none other than the piece of shit who said I was too young to be in that much pain. I did see him briefly as the PA was discussing my case with him just outside my room, and I got up went to the threshold of the door and said \"am I still to young to be in this much pain, or is the spinal damage just in my head?\" Oh he remembered me. He said nothing and walked away. I yelled at him, you're still a piece of shit doctor. That was the last time I went there. It has taken a LONG time to get the help I am finally getting. Biggest problem is getting doctors to believe I am in pain even with the evidence in front of them they still refused to get me the help I really need. Anyway I finally got a group of doctors to take me seriously, I just wonder if I got the help I needed WHEN I first needed it maybe I wouldn't be in so much pain right now. I am set to see a specialist who might be able to fuse my vertebrae which will limit my mobility, it would also relieve my pain. I am hopeful I can finally be rid of this pain and maybe even work again. I think that has to be the hardest thing of all. I can't work. Honestly it makes me feel less of a man because I can't work. If you made it this far, thank you. I am not going to hurt myself, I just have suicidal thoughts when I am in pain, but I am not going to act on it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q49ybu/not_depressed/", "title": "not depressed", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "brightshadows069", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633737307, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q49ybu/not_depressed/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422907.0935304, "replies_charged": false}
