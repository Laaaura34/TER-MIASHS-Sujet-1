Also, it\u2019s not just one thing. I have done at least 5 actions on social media that are considered illegal in the US, and that\u2019s only for last week. I don\u2019t live in the US, I live in Egypt. And I wanted to share a fun fact with you, I am turning 14 tomorrow (on the 17th). I haven\u2019t slept and it\u2019s exactly 12pm while I am writing this sentence, yes, not 12am, 12pm. I woke up at 5pm so I have been awake for 19 hours. My sleeping schedule is really messed up. Anyways back to the main topic, the reason I decided it was a \u201csmart\u201d idea to break the law online was of course, I needed attention. I tried getting positive attention and it didn\u2019t work out. I am feeling suicidal, but I also feel like it would be better if I don\u2019t kill myself and just wait until I go to jail and get executed, cause I deserve it. I used to go to a therapist before quarantine. I feel like things are getting worse and worse after I recovered from my depression phase in 2018/2019. I really need some support, doesn\u2019t matter what you do, even if you say \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d or post a cute cat pic, I would still appreciate it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kygdvx/wish_i_could_die_without_committing_suicide_like/", "title": "Wish I could die without committing suicide, like getting executed, but I am 14", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SuixidalGhost", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1610791593, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kygdvx/wish_i_could_die_without_committing_suicide_like/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428389.4744306, "replies_charged": false}
