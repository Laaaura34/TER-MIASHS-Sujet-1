I live in a big city and I have a secret clove that while not unknown is neglected. It\u2019s 20 stories plus up. And guaranteed death. No one ever comes to this area. You can sit for hours...\n\nHere I go. I have no reason to live.  \n\nThe things that have meant most in my life is my love of music, my love of philosophy, my love of having fun, and of course the girls I have loved.\n\nFight the mental illness stigma. OCD is a disease just like diabeties. Don\u2019t abuse mentally ill people! They deserve your compassion and humanity just like you wouldn\u2019t hit a cancer patient. A disease of the mind is still a disease of the body\u2014the blood of a diabetic is just as much a part of the body.\n\nThat\u2019s all I want to say.  If I get the necessary medical treatment I needed I could of had at least five healthy years of my twenties I spent sick instead.  \n\nGoodbye. Despite everything I love everyone that makes an attempt at being and/or doing good.  And for the good people I love all of them equally.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ml7a06/im_going_to_a_high_ledge_tonight_i_could_jump/", "title": "I\u2019m going to a high ledge tonight.
