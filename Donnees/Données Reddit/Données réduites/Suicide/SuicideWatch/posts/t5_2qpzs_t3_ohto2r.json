I kinda always knew deep down it was a very implausible ineffective method. The first time I only lasted two days without eating, the second attempt was four days. I did it when I was home alone but both times I had to start eating again because my sister arrived at our place. I had to pretend that everything was normal so I had to let her see me eat at least a little until she left again, but when she did I was no longer committed and didn\u2019t continue my attempts even after she left.\n\nIn in a much better place now. I\u2019m no longer attempting suicide, I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m writing on here now so many months after. I guess i hadn\u2019t even processed or hadn\u2019t admitted to myself the fact that i have actually attempted suicide twice now. I guess I just needed to get it off my chest. It\u2019d be nice to hear from some of you guys.\n\nLooking back I can\u2019t help feeling so pathetic for picking such a stupid method. Im not anorexic or anything, if anything i wish I could put on more weight. I have severe gastritis and heartburn issues so it really hurts to eat, march was particularly bad. I just wish I could eat without it hurting again I\u2019m tired of the chronic pain.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ohto2r/suicide_attempt_by_self_starving_twice/", "title": "Suicide attempt by self starving twice", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ibelieveinyoualways4", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625960859, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ohto2r/suicide_attempt_by_self_starving_twice/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428567.5477037, "replies_charged": false}
