I\u2019m 25, have General anxiety disorder and mildly depressed with an unhealthy mixture of laziness I think. To be honest I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m lazy or if I\u2019m just running away from daily problems...\n\nEvery single day I imagine myself committing suicide. In all types of ways. It\u2019s like I can picture each step.... up until the moment when I picture my mother finding out about my death. Then I stop and feel guilty. Like I said, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d do it. I wouldn\u2019t be able to hurt others around me but sometimes I just wish that I didn\u2019t have to wake up and be a burden anymore.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hyjfeo/is_it_normal_to_picture_yourself_committing/", "title": "Is it normal to picture yourself committing suicide every day?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ThrowRA-stickers88", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 194, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1595814977, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hyjfeo/is_it_normal_to_picture_yourself_committing/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428385.5974169, "replies_charged": false}
