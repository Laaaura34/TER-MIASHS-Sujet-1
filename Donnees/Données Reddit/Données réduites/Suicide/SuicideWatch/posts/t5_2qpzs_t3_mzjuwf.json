My rope broke but I was already unconscious when it happened and when I woke up, it was at the time my mom saw me and I was bleeding and very purple and everything is swollen, even up until now. No one really understands how frustrating it is how I can't ever express the pain I'm feeling, so I always took it out on myself. It would've been nice if my attempt was successful so I don't have to deal with myself anymore. My schoolwork is piling up, and so does my suicidal tendencies.\n\nEdit: I came here not to look for sympathy, but just dor help and understanding or a little conversation about what it's like to go through this. I guess it doesn't go that way.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mzjuwf/my_suicide_attempt_failed_today_i_have_no_one_i/", "title": "My suicide attempt failed today.
