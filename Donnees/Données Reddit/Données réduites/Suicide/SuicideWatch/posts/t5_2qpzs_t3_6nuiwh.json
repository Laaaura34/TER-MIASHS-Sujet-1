Just lost five games in a row despite winning a piece in the opening in the last one. Been studying and playing chess for 32 months but it just doesn't matter. Unique to me, I never improve at anything, never accomplish anything, no matter what I set my mind to. My career is the same way. Spent 4 years in STEM, broke myself in half to get a degree, and it just didn't matter. I still couldn't hack it, and now I'm unemployed with nothing to show for it at all. \n\nBasketball, videogames, table tennis, learning a new language. Same thing. Put in thousands of hours with absolutely nothing to show for it.\n\n*I'm not looking for commiseration. I'm looking for a fucking reason.* There are other losers like me, but none of them have tried so hard to escape. That situation is completely unique to me. Right now my best hypothesis is that I've already died and gone to hell. I'm aware that sounds insane. I didn't say it was a good explanation. But it is the best.
