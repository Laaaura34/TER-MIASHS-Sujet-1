Idk if I'm looking for support, I just want this out there. \n\n20s male. \nI'm going to be as honest as possible throughout this post, even if it comes across as selfish, cold, or self-congratulatory. Apologies for the stream-of-consciousness rambling. This post probably won't serve many purposes - I just need my thoughts to be out there. Maybe this belongs on offmychest, idk.\n\nGuilt: I tried to kill myself twice within a week last year. I did it with little prior thought. All I remember is breaking down one night crying and immediately attempting it without thoughts of consequences (I have amnesia from it). Occasionally, I remember what I did and try to physically shake it out of my head, it's like denying a nightmare that actually happened. My family will always remember what I did. It's contributed to a general sense of awkwardness in my home. \n\nSelf-obsession: Occasionally, I think of how people in my life would have reacted if I completed the suicide successfully. Would they be sad? Given I don't really see anyone anymore, would people be surprised? I feel like these thoughts are egotistical, but I have them nonetheless. My favorite part of the day is when I get to go to bed. I like to fantasize while falling asleep. Sometimes I remember the fondness of high school, but most of the time I just explore power fantasies.  \n\nFuture: I've had little luck with HCPs trying to treat my depression (not even sure I have it? although I am diagnosed) and social anxiety. With my current socio-economic privileges and my university course, I have the \"potential\" for what could be considered a successful life. However, I don't really have any interest in it. My main motivation in continuing to study is to get good grades, to prove my intelligence to myself and my family (ego). This is one of my biggest insecurities. I think that I'll only be worth something once (or if) I manage to get PhD. I know this means nothing, but it's what keeps me going. I know the life of being a researcher will be a fucking miserable grind, but maybe less miserable than working hospo/retail. Due to a neurological condition, I have a limited capacity for independence (e.g., I can't drive, and any sort of independent or remote travel would be dangerous). I foresee a life of living alone in a condo, with no friends. I'll probably spend all my resources on materialistic shit for myself. I don't see myself having a partner, as I would be a burden. I think having children would be fulfilling, except I know they would turn out fucked up because of a history of mental-illness in my family and my genetics. \n\nInevitability: I'm probably going to wait until both my parents die before I kill myself. I have this ever looming feeling that it will be the way I go. At this moment, my current social contacts are hanging on by a thread. By the time this becomes a viable option for me, no one will notice.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pmrhul/inevitability_guilt_and_selfobsession/", "title": "Inevitability, guilt, and self-obsession", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Few-Opposite836", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631448369, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pmrhul/inevitability_guilt_and_selfobsession/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426177.876768, "replies_charged": false}
