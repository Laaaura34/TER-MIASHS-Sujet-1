I succeeded in both hooking it up, and having COLOSSAL meltdown.\n\nIt was so bad that I called the Suicide Prevention Hotline. Nice lady, but she couldn\u2019t really help me. \n\nTo clarify, hooking up my new WiFi included hooking up Chromecast. That\u2019s what sent me off the deep end, I think.\nWhen I discovered Chromecast was just for streaming,and  is just a crappier version of a RoKu, and it did not allow for local broadcast stations, or Chief\u2019s games!\n\nwell, I was in full on conniption. Blubbering like a fool over some horrible conversation with a stay home google representative. \nI was fully expecting to have to go to the emergency room, tonight.  I took two clozapam, which I do not like. But I\u2019m feeling a little better. I also smoked a little weed, which I love. \n\nI used to be capable of performing very technical tasks, But , since I lost my mother three years ago, I can\u2019t seem to do anything without overwhelming anxiety. I have a fear doing challenging things because they might set me off. Such as walk away from a half prepared meal, because of some silly little thing that goes wrong.\n\nI have no support system really. Not outside work. And they\u2019re not really the most supportive people in the world. \nI really have no choice I guess,  I\u2019ll try to get an appointment with a doctor in my Insurance network. But I know, that I will either find out he\u2019s not accepting new patients, or I will talk myself out of going.\nI just don\u2019t know how anyone can find good mental health  where I live. They just tell me to come in any fill out a bunch of paperwork and tell me that they will put me on a waiting list. Nice.\n\nI\u2019ve searched for doctors before, but I quit looking after Covid. And, I don\u2019t know if I can justify $280 Expense to Better help. But, that might be my only option.\n\nSo , guess I\u2019ll unload this hear.
