But slowly im starting to not care about religion and thinking that my sister will be fine after a couple years. what can i do to stop myself before i actually get the courage to go through with it?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ntfx81/i_love_my_parents_but_they_drain_my_soul/", "title": "i love my parents but they drain my soul.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Haunting_Oven_21", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622963040, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ntfx81/i_love_my_parents_but_they_drain_my_soul/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425178.0423648, "replies_charged": false}
