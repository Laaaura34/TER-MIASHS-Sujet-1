I don't want to survive suicide, especially in a way other people find out. I'm already a massive disappointment. Surviving suicide has a clear chance of disappointing the few remaining people in the world who don't dislike me.\n\nEdit: Just a suggestion, instead of giving money to reddit for awards, please donate it to charities trying to make people's lives better. It's amazing to see how so many of us relate with the same feelings and fear but your money could help groups of people trying to alleviate some of the pain that people like us feel. Show solidarity by helping those charities if you can please!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m5w0d4/at_this_point_the_only_thing_stopping_me_from/", "title": "At this point, the only thing stopping me from committing suicide is the fear of surviving it.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "whenthetimesgettough", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1301, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615853585, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m5w0d4/at_this_point_the_only_thing_stopping_me_from/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428335.130166, "replies_charged": false}
