I'm stuck here until he decide to take a quicker but more painful way out.\n\n\nLooking at old pictures of myself i can't help but cry. Such a little guy with so many dreams, was done horrible things to so many times and turned out like this. I couldn't stop anything that happened, and to this day, grown up, having taken up martial arts, working out, I'll always feel weak and small because of what happened. Even if i know i'm not weak, what happened will never allow me to fully accept that. \n\n\nI try to be vague (to not bother people too much) about what i went through as a child, and what I'm going through now, at least somewhat, but it's becoming harder and harder to stay vague as the pain becomes worse and worse. I have never told a single person what exactly happened and i don't plan on ever telling anyone, all it gets me is pity and a fake sense of authority on the subject, it's not worth exposing anyone to these stories, it doesn't help anybody. I hope these drugs destroy my memory. Just because i'm in pain and can't stand living doesn't mean i hate you, or that you're not enough.\n\n\nI just want the night to take me, fuck it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qcexaq/fuck_it/", "title": "Fuck it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "long_shlong_mgee", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634775500, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qcexaq/fuck_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423156.124444, "replies_charged": false}
