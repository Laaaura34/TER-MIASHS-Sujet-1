I thought about how if my mom got one, she'd offer to share it with me. How she's neglected herself so chronically and deteriorated because of it. How I got three and didn't even offer her any money, even though I went no contact with her. The same childlike, sweet, innocent, self sacrificing mom. Is the same mom that has manipulative, narcissistic, controlling and abusive tendencies. But I feel conflicted when I remember the better side of her. I now have a restraining order against her. \n\nThe problem is I think about how my mom neglected herself because of me. How she'd give everything she has and I haven't given her anything (I'm broke). But she still gave me everything she could when she struggled. It makes me feel selfish and undeserving of love. The problem is the guilt over what I did or didn't do when it comes to the people I love, makes me want to kill myself. The second the trigger comes up, I want to end it that instant. That's why I don't have a gun. But I know that ending it would leave my loved ones in pain. So I feel trapped in a sense. I wish I didn't feel like I destroy everyone who crosses my path. I wish I knew if it was really all my fault or not.
