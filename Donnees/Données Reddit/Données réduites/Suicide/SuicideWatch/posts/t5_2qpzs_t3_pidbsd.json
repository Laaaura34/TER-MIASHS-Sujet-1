They also hit me, too much that I had to unfortunately hit back (I am so sorry) and obviously result was I was hit more...\n\nI am a 16 year old Indian and I am so sad... Exams, no good health... Uffff... I feel like I am worth nothing... I am an utter peace of crap... I feel like I won't even get friends, nor a GF, EVER... I feel lost, I am a coward and and an idiot... no one will ever like me... On top of that I am a PMO addict trying to escape from reality... This adds more to my rude behaviour due to parents hitting me... They scold me... This PMO results in low self confidence, anxiety, shyness, lower self esteem... And much more... I see more guys outside who live way better lives and their parents don't even hit them ever (I had a talk with my friends to confirm) though they are 10000s of times more bad than me... They abuse others, bully others, still no one stops them... And here is me who does all good, still lives in a miserable condition, my parents haven't done a single good thing for me... I am so sad... All I have are memories which are terrible... So much traumatic... I am sick of it... On top of it, my parents say and give examples of those abusive kids saying they are better than me, when surely they are not !!! This adds up to my depression... All I do is stay on the chair pretending to do classes, and them start masturbating as soon as no one's home... This is me... This is this crap... I feel like I won't get friends (good ones), nor get a partner ever... I would be a burden... Actually I am a burden... I am worthless... When all guys around don't even have an aim for life, I do have, I wanna be an astronomer... I love space science... I love it... Sadly this makes me wonder if I die this universe won't even change a bit, which might have been one of your suggestions to stop me from dying... But I know all of this... And I am tired, I am sick of it... I wanna exist, but at the same time don't... Other's parents are so good, they give them whatever they want... And here I sacrifice and still don't say anything... Still all I get in return is a bunch of punches, slaps and kicks... And depression... So much.. I am good to be dead... Please help me guys... I will stay forever alone otherwise... I am so bad... everyone's so bad but I wanna live a good life...\n\nPLEASE HELP ME PLEASE \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude2d", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pidbsd/this_is_a_repost_as_you_guys_didnt_come_to_help_me/", "title": "This is a Repost as you guys didn't come to help me :(", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "No_Fap_is_My_Life", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630849386, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pidbsd/this_is_a_repost_as_you_guys_didnt_come_to_help_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428182.828175, "replies_charged": false}
