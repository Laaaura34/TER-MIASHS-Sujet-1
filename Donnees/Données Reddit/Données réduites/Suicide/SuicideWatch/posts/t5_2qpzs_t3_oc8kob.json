I am full of hate and jealousy and a complete loser. I was paid 4 weeks wages last Friday and have no money left. I\u2019ve worked this dead end job for 16 years. I live with my mother at 34 years old. I own nothing, have no money, no skills, no attention span, no motivation. \n\nI am beyond fucked. I wanted a peaceful death from suicide but that doesn\u2019t even seem like an option anymore. I\u2019m going to have to kill myself and endure a bit more pain in the process before my misery ends for good.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oc8kob/depression_has_destroyed_my_mind/", "title": "Depression has destroyed my mind", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "fukthiscraplife", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 239, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625227106, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oc8kob/depression_has_destroyed_my_mind/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635422898.148912, "replies_charged": false}
