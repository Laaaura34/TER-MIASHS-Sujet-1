I\u2019m a 24yo Black man who never really fit the \u201cBlack\u201d criteria personality wise. I\u2019ve struggled with severe anxiety and depression since i was 14. I shrugged it off thinking my biggest problem in life would be coming out as gay but once i finally did i figured out that was the least of my problems, although I was outted to my parents at 20 buts that\u2019s another story. Point is I tricked myself into thinking coming out would solve all my problems when nothing really changed. I still have this black void in my heart that I have no idea how to fill. Over the years my mental health has steadily spiraled that\u2019s to me ignoring it hoping when i got older it would just go away now here I am. My anxiety and depression have killed my emotions I don\u2019t remember the last time I was happy, the last time I cried out real tears, the last time I was full of hope or joy, I\u2019ve lost all ambition. I\u2019m stuck in this state of limbo where I have no ambition to do anything let alone leave the house, get out of bed, shower. I just want to lay here and die of natural causes. I\u2019m jobless and hopeless with no idea what to do with my life just a burden to others. What hurts most is I can\u2019t help it. I feel as if my mental health is taking a physical toll on me now. I\u2019m having gaps in my memory, I can\u2019t sleep at night and when i do i wake with headaches, I can\u2019t stay focused on something for too long or it physically hurts, and I have these random mood swings where i say hurtful things or lash out on the only people left in my life. I don\u2019t know what to do or how to escape this hell I\u2019m in right now. My friends don\u2019t know what to say to me and my family acts oblivious like they no I\u2019m suffering but choose to not care or even ask if I\u2019m ok. Everyone just leaves me to my own choices and I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q7kpuz/24m_i_dont_want_to_live_or_die/", "title": "24M I don\u2019t want to live or die", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Exodusv4", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634159268, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q7kpuz/24m_i_dont_want_to_live_or_die/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427669.3390744, "replies_charged": false}
