Which is staring in the mirror, pointing out all my flaws, eating, purging and repeating the process for every meal. I\u2019m really done. I got sexually assaulted a couple days ago (at least I think it was sexual assault?) I have no support from my family, my mom is addicted to drugs, my brother is a drug dealer and I have no friends at all. I really want this all to end, and there\u2019s really only one way out. </3", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f3lgw9/bulimia/", "title": "Bulimia.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Adorable-Archer", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1581647761, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/f3lgw9/bulimia/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422921.6821778, "replies_charged": false}
