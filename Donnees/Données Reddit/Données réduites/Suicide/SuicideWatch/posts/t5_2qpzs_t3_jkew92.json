I know my mum could not handle it and trigger so much upset that it would just not be fair. \nI\u2019ve thought so much on this and how I would do this and the best way for me is to distance myself from them and to make it so that if I died they wouldn\u2019t care but with me still being young and still living at home I don\u2019t see how this is possible. \n\nI\u2019m very sure I have a hpd a personality disorder that makes me completely reliant on peoples opinions of me and I\u2019m easily influenced. I cannot think for myself and I\u2019m incredibly indecisive which leads to and has led to me being in a lot of bad situations. \n\nI\u2019ve never really had friends or anyone that I haven\u2019t manipulated to be there for me. To my friends I am extremely generous as they all come from rough backgrounds and I give them everything they need, whenever I can, just so they don\u2019t leave which I don\u2019t mind because I like giving but no one does it back for me which understandable but it\u2019s just like I\u2019m holding on to people just so they don\u2019t leave and I\u2019m on my own. I can not stand being on my own and that\u2019s when I get my worst and I really start to think.  \n\nI take a lot of drugs regularly so that I don\u2019t have to think. I am only here for my family and I just want someone to be there for me, someone I can talk to and be with without the fear of them leaving.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jkew92/can_someone_just_read_this_please/", "title": "Can someone just read this please", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "fuckinspack", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 18, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1603993837, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jkew92/can_someone_just_read_this_please/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426643.2568944, "replies_charged": false}
