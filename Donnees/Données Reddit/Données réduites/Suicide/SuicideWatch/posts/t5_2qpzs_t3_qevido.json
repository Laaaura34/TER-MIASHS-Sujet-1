I know I shouldn't have and its a bad thing but just having it feels weirdly good and soothing. I've been depressed for months, so anhedonic that I just can't feel anything. I'm doing all the stuff I'm meant to be doing, exercising, trying to socialise, eating well and sleeping as best I can. None of it is working, and it all takes so much effort to push myself to do all this stuff, and when there's no reward at the end it's so demoralising. I'm desperate for a little bit of dopamine but I don't think my brain knows that it's meant to make that anymore.\n\nI think of it like all the countries that have nuclear arms I guess. It feels safe and there is rationale behind having them but it's only really ok if you never have to use them. I know taking this would be the \"nuclear option\" but it gives me control (or a sense of control at aleast) and feels soothing. It feels like an escape hatch, if it get so bad then I have options. \n\nWhat do I do? Should I keep it and try to ignore it? Should I sneak it back into work? Should I flush it down the toilet? I don't know what to do.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qevido/depressed_and_making_bad_desicions/", "title": "Depressed and making bad desicions", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "anymorecoffee", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635092723, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qevido/depressed_and_making_bad_desicions/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422905.5005522, "replies_charged": false}
