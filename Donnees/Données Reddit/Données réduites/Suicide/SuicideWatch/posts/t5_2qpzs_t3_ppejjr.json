I have PTSD, GAD, MDD, OCD, panic disorder, cyclothymia, an attachment disorder, a substance abuse disorder, and chronic insomnia. My life is an emotional minefield. I spent my first several years in an orphanage, experienced abuse and neglect that made it nearly impossible for me to love/receive love as an adult. \n\nBecause of that, I haven\u2019t been able to fully let go of a toxic relationship. Despite loving family and wonderful friends, being with this man is the only way I\u2019m able to experience love that isn\u2019t excruciating due to cognitive dissonance, shame, etc. but due to both of our histories of abuse, it\u2019s virtually impossible for us to love each other healthily. I don\u2019t believe we can ever stay together, but god I LOVE THIS MAN. I no longer believe I can break the addiction and I\u2019m not sure I even want to anymore.\n\nI\u2019m going to spend my last days with him. I\u2019m going to book us an expensive hotel, we\u2019ll have mind-blowing sex, talk about everything for hours the way we used to, I\u2019ll take us to restaurants I wouldn\u2019t otherwise think I could afford, I\u2019ll visit my favorite places, and I\u2019ll buy a ton of food/supplies for every homeless person I see. It\u2019ll be short enough that things won\u2019t become volatile, and I can have that honeymoon phase one last time. \n\nThen, after he leaves, I\u2019m going to buy myself one last glass of Pinot Grigio, have an interesting conversation with a stranger at a bar, and jump off a skyscraper and die in my favorite city in one of my favorite outfits. I\u2019m so excited.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ppejjr/im_so_excited_to_die/", "title": "I\u2019m so excited to die", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ElvitaAdams", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631803049, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ppejjr/im_so_excited_to_die/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426547.406026, "replies_charged": false}
