I had one serious suicide attempt when I was 13 which failed--must have messed up the dosage. Once I hit 19 the whole teenage ups and downs died down so I figured that over time and with a little effort I'd get better but I recently realized it's only gotten worse. When I was a kid I might think of offing myself and being generally sad but I could still enjoy stuff, I'd be thinking of suicide for a week but for the next week I'd be a fairly happy camper (in a melancholic way). In contrast, the past 2 years or so I haven't really had an 'episode' but instead have progressively lost almost all ability to enjoy stuff like books, movies, food, socializing (of which I had had very little before). I have no real interest in anything, not even getting my degree (EE). The change over the 2 years has been very gradual and very consistent, which means that over the past few weeks I've gone from thinking I was troubled but okay in the long term to wanting to kill myself, due to realizing the change.\n\nWere the trouble with school, or money or physical health I'd get over it, but as it's been how I think, how my brain works, I can't really see a way out. As the past two post-puberty years have been so consistent in me heading towards becoming emotionally vacant and losing all motivation, it's not a difficult conclusion to make that it's not really going to get better.\n\nAfter thinking this through and realizing the pattern I've become seriously depressed over the past two weeks with a fairly concrete plan for offing myself with the variable being the location--I want an abandoned industrial building for preferrably a long enough of a drop so I can hang myself by breaking my neck with the intention that I'll be discovered by either a stranger or an emergency worker instead of my brother (less of an emotional impact).\n\nSo is there anything I can really do? I tried to make an appointment with the psychologist at my uni, but as they have queues that are over a month long, I don't think I can wait for that long. I don't have money to book a 'real' shrink and to be honest I'm prejudiced towards the sort of a help I'd get for free (either be it from my uni or some pro bono place, a'la a suicide hotline). I've read a couple of self-help books written by people with PhDs (ie stuff more worth the while) but haven't been successful in making them work. I don't want to talk to my family about it as they'd either be dismissive or treat it with derision and, in the end, I wouldn't want them to worry anyway.\n\nEnglish isn't my first language and I'm not in the right frame of mind to write a very thought out post, so pardon the errors in legibility.\n\nTLDR: Wanna kill myself, asking if there is any way to try to change the situation.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI don't really see much of a point in doing my lab reports so I'll just try to explain what the problem is exactly. Some of it is redundant due to the OP.\n\nIt's not that I feel sad or that I've been horribly depressed for the recent past. The problem is that my part in the world doesn't make sense. While I do exercise a fair amount of self-loathing and suffer from insecurities and anxieties, that is not what is informing my decision. It's almost like my brain is rotting and is gradually degenerating to a basic state which only functions to subsist. I can see myself dropping out of university to work dead-end jobs until I die in my 60s from alcoholism, not because I find life too taunting but because the part of me that is supposed to feel complicated emotions other than disgust and unease is shriveling away.\n\nI find it impossible to look forward to working as a trained professional with a sense of accomplishment and purpose, all I see is discomfort of earning my degree and the prospect of subsisting in anonymity. I find it impossible to work through my social inhibitions (sort of a forever alone) to create meaningful relationships with real people, all I see is the possibility of satisfying base sexual needs and having a few peers to whom I can refer to for gain.\n\nBecause I have lost most of my ability to enjoy anything other than on the itch -> scratch level, my thoughts have become almost automatic, and the part of me that wants to not die and live an actual life, that is to say myself when I have the energy and hope to search for meaning, has grown to hate my mind.\n\nAnd as I've said, while these thoughts are somewhat recent they are based on two years of consistent withering. I don't want to die, but I'd rather commit suicide than turn into whatever it is I'm turning into. I've tried to change the way my mind works since I was 13 which is when I had my first bout of suicidal thoughts and I've continued almost daily since then. I was never successful, but I always thought I could do it. Now, after 8 years of trying, I'm losing the very basis of evaluating my life. I'm almost too tired to try anymore, it is too obvious I am losing grip of everything meaningful--goals are burdens, people are strange and incomprehensible, books are dull, music is noise, food makes me sick and I can't remember what it was like to be happy. The choice isn't between an unbearable life and suicide but between a dead life and death itself.\n\nThat is as descriptive as I can put it.
