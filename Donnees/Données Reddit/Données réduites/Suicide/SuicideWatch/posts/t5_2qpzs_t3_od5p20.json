Some people manage to beat depression, while others do not and usually succumb to it via suicide. \n\nI feel like I have watched myself slowly descend deeper and deeper into the pit of depression over many years of my life. At first it was manageable and I was still able to go about my life. Things got harder and harder and my depression grew and became more debilitating. \n\nMy sense of identity diminishing as I became less of myself and more of just an embodiment of my own depression. Stage IV is the stage where it\u2019s hardest to overcome. Suicidal thoughts run rampant. \n\nThe suicidal thoughts grow and keep growing and slowly become what your mind is fixated on. At this point in my life I know my fate will be suicide. I know this is what I\u2019ll succumb to. My mind cannot keep going, it cannot keep enduring. This cancer of depression has spread and taken over my head. Some people get lucky, I am not. \n\nSuicide is not a matter of if\u2014 but when. Soon people will realize how much pain I have been and continue to be in. But that will be too late.
