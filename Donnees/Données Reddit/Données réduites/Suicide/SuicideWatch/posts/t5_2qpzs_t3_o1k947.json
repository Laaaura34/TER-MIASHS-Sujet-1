I am 20M and suffering from horrible depression and insomnia. 3 months ago I was the happiest human being ever, I was literally so full of life and had an awesome girlfriend and tons of friends. I started stressing from school and my stupid brain gave me the worst insomnia ever. I mean like 0-3 hours a night of shit sleep, and no naps during the day. I am completely defeated. Gf left me, and I\u2019m too dead to do anything fun with my friends. Lost a ton of weight and now experiencing erectile dysfunction. I literally can\u2019t go on and think about suicide everyday. I can\u2019t live with chronic insomnia. I just can\u2019t, if \u201cGod\u201d doesn\u2019t show me a sign or things don\u2019t get better before July 22nd, I\u2019m blowing my brains out.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve tried sleep hygiene, and sleeping medication (hydroxzyine, ambien, melatonin) nothing works.
