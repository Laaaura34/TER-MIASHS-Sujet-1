Unfortunately as the trick that these demons do is they make it feel better at times while on the whole still make us suffer.(it feels mildly rewarding to have this nihilistic Schadenfreude approach to life) I believe we stay in this cycle of suffering because we risk having even more suffering trying to break out of it. \nIt hurts a lot to heal, and it hurts less to stay depressed. \n\nOf course it would be all too simple if I could just accept love wouldn\u2019t it. The social anxiety makes me incapable of getting outside the cycle( the suffering required to heal)\nWhy does life have to be a double bind like this?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mgthtc/what_is_more_self_hating_committing_suicide_or/", "title": "What is more self hating: committing suicide, or accepting a life of suffering.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ienjoyagoodcashew", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617148967, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mgthtc/what_is_more_self_hating_committing_suicide_or/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428366.2220907, "replies_charged": false}
