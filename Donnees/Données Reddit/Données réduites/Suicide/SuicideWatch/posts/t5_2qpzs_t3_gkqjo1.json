Every day that goes by just makes it harder and harder for me to just inhibit my depression. I just don't want anyone to be worried about me. \n\nActually, no, to be honest I don't think they even care about me. They'll definitely stab me in the back if I express my feelings to them. I'll just be told I'm a fucking weakling, over and over and over again. It's impressive how much I've cared about them, but nobody has the willpower to at least ask me if I'm actually fine. I don't think I can possibly recover from this.\n\nThis makes me feel I'm falling into a bottomless pit. I might just... try killing myself for the third time and see what happens.\n\nI'm really sorry if I seemed selfish but that's how I truly feel.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gkqjo1/ive_faked_my_happiness_for_long_enough/", "title": "I've faked my happiness for long enough", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mourn3r", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1589613539, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gkqjo1/ive_faked_my_happiness_for_long_enough/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426420.7623272, "replies_charged": false}
