She\u2019s really nice, but seeing her also form a relationship makes me feel worse for myself.\n\nYes, I\u2019m successful with school and my activities, but all of the good in my life comes by staying in my own bubble with order and routine. I do this because I tend to the introverted side and I also can come off as awkward to some people as a person on the spectrum.\n\nBut I hate being reminded of how behind I am socially. I feel like this is where everyone can be happy and live life. For me, I opt to stay to myself and go to bed early. Do I save myself? Yes, but I also prevent myself from taking risks and finding true happiness.\n\nHonestly, if I could, I would sacrifice grades and routine for more happiness.  That might sound simple, but I don\u2019t know where to start and I feel lost and hopeless about making a change if it means living life or finding love.\n\nThat\u2019s why today I considered ending it so I don\u2019t have to deal with my own discontent about how unhappy I am.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o7zzd0/i_just_hate_myself_for_not_waking_up_and/", "title": "I just hate myself for not waking up and experiencing life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tegar9000", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624666755, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/o7zzd0/i_just_hate_myself_for_not_waking_up_and/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635428231.363738, "replies_charged": false}
