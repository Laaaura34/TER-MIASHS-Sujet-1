I am 41 and started suffering from mental health about 4 years ago when I lost my friend to cancer.  \n\nI took a year off work and used the benefits I pay into so I could take the time I hopefully needed to realign my thinking.  I have 3 daughters, a wife, a mortgage etc.  \n\nI never got better, I got worse in the time I was off... trying new pills, going to therapy, all the stuff you do to help with how you feel and think.  I found very little works, I started cutting so I could focus on something other than suicide and feeling like crap every single day... that worked for a little while.  Today on Friday the 13th, I was brought into the bosses office and put on unpaid leave because mental health is not good enough of an excuse to miss time or to feel bad.  I have to get shit filled out by my specialist in 5 days or I get fired, mental health is no excuse at my work.  \n\nAs the title suggests, I am so very tired... so tired of feeling like shit all the time, feeling like a poor father, a bad husband, a terrible worker, and I think I am going to go out to the garage, take a bunch of pills and hang myself for good measure to get the job done.\n\nI am not looking for anything specific, or anything at all, just throwing out there like a lot of others how I feel.  It's still sad we live in a world where mental health is taboo still and places rather look away than help.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jtv5r9/i_am_very_tired/", "title": "I am very tired.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Isabi1025", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1605325419, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jtv5r9/i_am_very_tired/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428477.2396653, "replies_charged": false}
