Nearly every single time, there was no reply.  However, my mind just thought of something which is giving me tremendous anxiety.  What if the people I messaged were underaged, even though I didn\u2019t know about it?  I always subconsciously assumed, due to those subreddits having an 18+ limit, that I would only be messaging adults, however my mind is going insane thinking that they may have been underaged.  I never thought that I was messaging anybody underaged, and if I ever had reasonable suspicion that a person was, I would never have even thought about messaging them.\n\nI don\u2019t know how valid it is, but I\u2019m just thinking that what I did is a horrible crime and that I\u2019m going to get sentenced to prison for multiple years for what I did.  I\u2019m incredibly anxious that I\u2019m in some kind of legal trouble due to what I did.  This is my sole cause of the anxiety.  If there is any lawyer or person with extensive legal knowledge, could they please comment and let me know if I am going to go to prison for this.\n\nI swear, I never knowingly messaged an underaged person.  To this day, every person I have messaged, I do not have a single reason to believe was underaged.    All the subreddits that I found the people I messaged were strictly 18+.  It\u2019s a question of what if.  This is really bothering me, please help.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/i24pqf/extreme_anxiety_over_potential_crime_advice_needed/", "title": "Extreme anxiety over potential crime, advice needed", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ending733", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1596335609, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/i24pqf/extreme_anxiety_over_potential_crime_advice_needed/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428063.5264661, "replies_charged": false}
