And it's eating me alive.\n\nMany ppl have asked me, do you really want to kill yourself? You can't even hold a knife (I'm afraid of them since I stabbed my hand with one after not being very careful) but I have come up with a better plan :) to dress up and look like a handsome young man, get drunk af and throw myself into a river a few miles away in the middle of the night. Just the thought of doing that turns me on, I won't even feel anxious :) just all the pain will fade away.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kx21e4/suicide_seems_an_easy_solution/", "title": "Suicide seems an easy solution", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "crisg813", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1610614757, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kx21e4/suicide_seems_an_easy_solution/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428050.1092114, "replies_charged": false}
