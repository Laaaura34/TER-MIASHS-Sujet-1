They all tell me I\u2019m a bad parent. \n\nI feel like I have fought so hard for their well-being and tried to keep them safe, but none of it matters. I don\u2019t know what I did that was so wrong. It hurts so much. I just want the pain to stop, and I am so exhausted from trying so hard. I just don\u2019t think I can do it anymore. I don\u2019t want to do it anymore. \n\nNothing I do matters. I am not good at anything. I am so tired. I\u2019m sad I will miss out on so much, and I feel badly that I\u2019m not as strong as I should be. I just can\u2019t anymore. \n\nI can\u2019t reach out to anyone. It\u2019s too taboo to feel this way. Work, family court, friends and family can\u2019t know. I\u2019m tired of that too. \n\nThe world is on fire anyway, and everything I see or hear is awful. I just want to stop feeling, because everything is painful.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pa5n52/worthless/", "title": "Worthless", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tossedaway0", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629742864, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pa5n52/worthless/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428428.8930058, "replies_charged": false}
