I have no hope for therapy in helping since it wont resolve what I'm depressed about. I hope meds can let me ignore most if not all of it and succeed in life and move on. But I know the problems will never go away, so how can I stop thinking about them? Especially if they affect me. It's not like meds can make me ignorant to it all. If meds don't work I'll probably just off myself eventually. The only reason I haven't even attempted it is because I don't want to destroy my parents since they're good people and they care about me, and if I kill myself I'm not gonna do it in a way that'll fail. 100%. But if the only reason I have to not kill myself is to avoid the world of hurt it would put my parents in, I can only go on like that for so long. I love you Mom and Dad, you raised me well but you deserve a better son then the pathetic specimen that I am. At the very least you can be proud of your other son who's in university with a brighter future then me. :( \n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S - Please don't post help lines for suicide/depression resources in the comments, I know they can't help me but I know where to find them if I need.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qefxrr/its_horrible_knowing_the_things_making_you/", "title": "It's horrible knowing the things making you depressed will get worse, especially if you have no control over them.
