I\u2019m currently recruiting for a paid research study on real-time individualized monitoring of suicidal thoughts.

I\u2019m specifically hoping to recruit people who (1) have engaged in suicidal behavior in the past year and/or (2) have frequently experienced suicidal thoughts in the past month. If you qualify, you\u2019ll be asked to complete brief daily surveys (1 min to complete) multiple times per day on your smartphone for a 15-day period. For this, you will be compensated up to $50.
