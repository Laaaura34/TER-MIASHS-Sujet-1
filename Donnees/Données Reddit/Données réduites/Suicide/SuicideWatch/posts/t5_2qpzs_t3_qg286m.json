 or that because i don't use her as my therapist like she does with me, that i'm somehow not affected by it. some of her anger was justified because tbf my unchecked hypervigilance and ptsd responses were making me act like a crazy hurtful bitch. but also our \"non monogamous\" relationship was basically just an excuse to constantly cheat on me so. it's my fault for not recognizing that i completely lost my trust in her after having it confirmed that she also sees it as cheating and wants to Actually Be with her other partners. idk why i ttold myself i could trust her again when building that trust was never her priority afterwards and she immediately started dating again after that incident. i blamed my intense fear and discomfort on the other partners she brought home but really it was all towards her and i was just stupid dumb and told myself otherwise. even after seeing her make jokes online about cheating on me! just a funny joke haha:) i have no self respect lol. and eventually she just stopped telling me about the romantic relationships she would build until they've been together for nearly a year and then the first time i'm alerted to their existence its \"oh this is my lover that is going to move in with us next month and also i'm going to have his baby that we will raise together!\" and thats just something i have to cope with. why did i let that happen twice before i decided i wanted out of this relationshiP? turns out you can be extremely unhappy and in a bad relationship wwithout it being abusive! who knew! not me! oh and she's defintely dating someone who may or may not be dangerous and abusive but its ok bc he only beats women when he's worried about their safety. and i'm the crazy one for being worried.\n\nnot like i have any room to talk bc then i cope in the most stupid stupid stupid way by getting romantically involved with \\[redacted\\] right after my marriage ended. really fell for some classic manipulation and let myself believe that this dude wanted to be committed to me and take care of me! and i got my traumas played on by a textbook predator <3 only to have him lose interest after getting what he wanted <3 i am so mortified and deeply deeply deeply ashamed at what i let him do to me. he prayed with me and then preyed on me :( comphet and bpd are not drugs to be mixed.\n\nand i get to endure the stupid pain all by myself because i have completely isolated myself from friendships for years and my family doesn't+cant ever know the scary and important parts <3 therapy doesnt bring me any help anymore because i'm sick of someone just lookingat me like <:) while i talk about the crazy scary things\n\nand i'm still trying! to be optimisitc and postive and hopeful and sweet. trying s o hard to actually apply the skills ive learned. the only thing i want badly in life is to raise children and i know i have to get better to do that but my body cant handle pregnancy and i don't know if anyone would love me enough to raise children with me and i don't know if i would ever be in a position to be able to adopt and raise a child by myself. \n\n but i feel rotten inside and i'm so scared that i only produce rotten fruit. i want to have healthy friendships again and belong to a community but i'm so fucking ashamed that at my age i have nothing going on. i feel like a walking red flag and i just want to keep myself away from other humans incase i'm really as unstable and terrible as i think i am. which i know is counterproductive because a lot of my issues stem from not having support. make it make sense! \n\nand i feel so stupid for crying over wanting to be held n be told it'll be ok (specifically bc it was something my ex mocked me for) but i just want to be comforted by another human without also being used for sex. i'm afraid this is path im stuck on forever even when i try my hardest to change it. the thought of never being able to raise a family or never being able to escape abuse or never forming a friendship again hurts so fucking bad. and im just so exhausted!!!!!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qg286m/stupid_mad_dumb_angry/", "title": "stupid mad dumb angry", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ashkenazty", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635238608, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qg286m/stupid_mad_dumb_angry/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635425595.4472704, "replies_charged": false}
