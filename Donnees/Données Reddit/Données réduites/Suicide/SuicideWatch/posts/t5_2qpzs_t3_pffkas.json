She left me without even so much as a fight. I still love her with all my heart and she already is with someone else and I havent had contact with her for about 6 months. My heart is crushed and I'm left haunted by the memories and the dreams i wanted to make reality. Not a day goes by where I dont think about her and what we could have. I hate waking up everyday. It's a struggle to everyday to get up and do the minimum to keep myself from losing everything I have. I feel drained second of the day. I dont want to even breath and my mental state is getting worse by the minute. I'm at an all time low and falling deeper into depression. I try to keep myself busy with work and friends but it's not working anymore. I lost myself when she walked out on me and I'm running out of options. Everyone says time will heal it but I know my heart will never be whole again. She was my everything. My sunshine and my peace. She was my home. I dont know how much time I have left here.
