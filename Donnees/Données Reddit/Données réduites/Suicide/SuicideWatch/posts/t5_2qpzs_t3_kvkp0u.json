This is the first major action I\u2019ve taken toward my suicide. Everything before this has just been thoughts, and now I\u2019m scared. For one, because it\u2019s fairly likely that I may commit suicide very soon, and agin,  evaluate of death. I am at a point where I am not fearing the pain of it, but rather what comes after. Will it just be nothing? Heaven? Hell? Purgatory? Could I walk into the afterlife to find the god of a dead religion who smites me down for not believing? My first day of school after winter break happens this morning, and I might just not make it. Please, tell me what you think of this.\n\nAnd if anyone is wondering, the divide itself is a knife fastened to a copper wire to wrap around the wrist, putting the current in the veins and arteries for a quicker death, and preventing the knife from slipping out of your hands while being shocked.\n\nI want to emphasize this, **DO NOT GIVE ME THE \u201cDON\u2019T DO IT, YOUR LIFE IS WORTH IT\u201d SPEECH OR ANYTHING SIMILAR WITH THIS. I WANT GENUINE THOUGHTS ON THE MATTER**\n\nThis was mainly just to vent anyways", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kvkp0u/i_just_made_a_small_contraption_to_ease_the_pain/", "title": "I just made a small contraption to ease the pain and risk of surviving suicide by electrocution, this is the first big step I\u2019ve taken toward suicide, and I\u2019m afraid.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwaway5248425", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1610427031, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kvkp0u/i_just_made_a_small_contraption_to_ease_the_pain/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427936.3380384, "replies_charged": false}
