I try at least a couple times a week now...but taking a razor to oneself *hurts so much.* I am so weak, I want out of this miserable life *so badly.* I am *so lonely,* and the aftermath of every attempt enforces this. It has been over 12 months since I had a friend. I've thought of reaching out to the subreddits for making friends...but why bother? Depression robbed me of my interests long ago. Nihilism/suicidal behaviors aren't exactly characteristics people want. \n\nWhy do I have to be such a chicken to pain. I need this more than anything. I have been suffering with these ailments for years now.
