Even though I know it's how you express sympathy it's just not what I need to hear and it means practically nothing to me. I feel harsh saying that because you know I'm not a harsh person. I've always been a kind and understanding person but I'm getting to the point where I've lived with this for so long and I've lived without the support I need for so long that this is where I'm at. The good news is I know what I need. Maybe not what I need to get out of this hole I'm in (still working on that in therapy) but I know what kind of support I need. The bad news? I'm not getting it and I don't know how to ask you for it. What I really need from my you is love. I need to be hit over the head with it because it just won't stick in my brain. I just need to know that you care, love me, need me, would miss me if I was gone etc. I need to know what makes me worth something because I feel so worthless. I need to know what are my good qualities? What do you like about me? Because it hit pretty hard in therapy recently when I was asked what I like about myself and I had nothing that wasn't tainted with negative thoughts. Even things I like have negative aspects attached to them and that's all I can think about. I know I need to do the work in therapy but I need help too. I can't do it alone. I just don't know how to ask you for it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/km43em/i_dont_need_your_pity_i_need_your_love/", "title": "I don't need your pity, I need your love", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "GG-92", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 0, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1609205823, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/km43em/i_dont_need_your_pity_i_need_your_love/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423126.0864491, "replies_charged": false}
