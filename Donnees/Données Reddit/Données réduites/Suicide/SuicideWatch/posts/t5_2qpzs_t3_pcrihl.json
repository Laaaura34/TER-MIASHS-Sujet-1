Another follow-up question, is there like a global hotline where they do the same thing as your country's hotline but in english or do they just switch it to your country's hotline? I've heard something about this international/global thing but I'm confused about it. By the way, I do not need any \"it will be okay\"s, really, I just need the answer- I feel like it's best to call but I don't even know anymore, does every SPH have a texting option or only the more 'popular' ones like in USA? I'm from Europe and I'm not sure if we've got things like that. Sorry for not knowing but the websites of the hotlines are often so miss-leading and badly designed it makes me feel like an old person browsing the web, I'm so confused.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pcrihl/i_have_a_question_how_does_a_suicide_prevention/", "title": "I have a question, how does a suicide prevention hotline call look like?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "FlookyFlakyX", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630084023, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pcrihl/i_have_a_question_how_does_a_suicide_prevention/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427813.7518313, "replies_charged": false}
