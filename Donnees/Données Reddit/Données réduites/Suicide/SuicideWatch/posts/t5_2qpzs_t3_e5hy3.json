I used to be capable of socializing and making friends, but ever since high school ended I seem to have lost all capacity to make new friends.  College was a bust, I sat in my room alone, listening to other people party.  Every attempt I made was a miserable failure.  I went to philosophy club and activist meetings and did work, so there were a couple of people at various times that would talk to me, but despite my best efforts signs of my seriousness and unhappiness crept out and they didn't really want to deal with me more than they had to.\n\nI graduated and moved back to my home town to try and pep myself up with the way my life had been.  But my father's comatose, my mother's a mostly horrible person, my sisters despise me as a loser.  My high school 'friends' started hating one another, breaking into groups, and one by one developing an intolerance / hate of me, I never see them the few who are polite have ceased any act (it's popular to rag on me), I have no friends of any degree left except for the sad sack I used to commiserate with who I urged to move in with people who now love him, and while he's a trooper he only tolerates me out of a sense of obligation.  The housemates (once upon a time friends) I live with are kicking me out because they hate me.  I have no where to go.  I can't make new friends, I never get more than a few messages into a discussion on OKcupid before they abandon ship.\n\nAnd the thing is, I'm amazing at socializing, I have a genius level mind.  I'm able to instantly see where people are coming from and all the dynamics at play.  This served me incredibly well in high school but now it's an impediment.  I'm bored to death by everyone, and despite my best efforts this boredom (and resulting irritation) creeps in eventually no matter what I do.\n\nI'm hugely motivated by an ethical desire to make society better (I have a very concrete and extensive analysis of it as well as a strategic analysis for improvement), but despite all the angles of attack I can't do shit with zero social capital.  And while I'm usually able to shrug off things and work by myself, shit builds up and there'll be a stray moment when I care what people think and realize there's nothing to cling onto, no one who'll have my back.  And this debilitates me.  I know I can't really deal with what it would take to build and retain a superficial sense of community.  I crave honest substantive connection with another human being.  I feel like I'm the only person in the world to actually give a damn about others, ethics, vigilance and logic.  Nobody shares my views, in a radical activist community I'm defacto ostracized because I disagree with the bits of group think they've clung to for community.   It's been over a decade since anyone posed an argument to me I hadn't already thought of and examined all the way through.  I'm rarely, rarely surprised, and never consistently by any one person.  It's been over a decade since things diverged into cutting edge stuff I think about and what other people are on a level to move up to.  That chasm is bothersome in the extreme.\n\nOh and I slept through all my physics courses and B+ them with the minimum effort so all my old professors dislike me and won't return my emails inquiring about references for grad school (plus I was depressed as hell which couldn't have been fun to be around).  I'm cranking through textbooks on my own, but it's painful to know there's shit all I can do at this point to follow my dreams.  Plus it's a struggle not to get distracted thinking about my loneliness and failure at everything.  I'll see 3/4ths of a perfectly composed editorial in my mind that'll have certain useful effects if placed precisely and as I'm about to type the easy remaining bits everything'll shatter and my brain will focus on trying to solve some tendril of Forever Alone / failure / no friends.  I'm useless to the world, I'm only leeching off of people / occupying space, this has gone on for 7 years and I can't figure out how I might even have a chance at getting out.\n\nPeople would be better off without me.  What the fuck is there to live for but the betterment of all consciousness in the universe?  All I've ever wanted to do as far back as I can remember is help people and it's hard to see any hope of that.\n\nOh and I've never been in a real relationship.  I slept with an unattractive housemate to lose my virginity in college.  And six months ago I made a concerted effort to interest the only person in my spheres of interaction I saw any hope with.  And things were wonderful, brilliant, I felt that I had finally found something of a peer (albeit one with next to no active altruism much less comparable, and while hella intelligent no where near my realms) and shit was great.  But she was interested in someone else which caused drama for her and (suffering from similar depression) had came to very different life conclusions from me.  I tackle and engage with the hard shit, she runs away.  So she has broken off all communication (I never even got a break up talk) and she's explicitly committed to having totally trivial social interactions devoid of connection or intensity.  She was afraid of how much she loved me and how much we connected so she's changing her life completely and never talking to me again.\n\nFFFFUUUUUUUUU", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e5hy3/im_out_of_friends/", "title": "I'm out of friends.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "outoffriends", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1289629106, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e5hy3/im_out_of_friends/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425167.6490479, "replies_charged": false}
