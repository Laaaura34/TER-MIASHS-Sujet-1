I\u2019ve been trying to change my behavior but I\u2019ll do the same shit over again. Today for the first time the thought of committing suicide felt like a relief, as something to look forward to. I don\u2019t manage to change the same behavior I hated with my father so much when I was a kid, it drives me insane. I cannot grasp yet why I am such a miserable incapable idiot, that got all the opportunities to build a good life but only destroys himself, does anyone know what this is?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m5uid1/i_just_keep_showing_the_same_selfdestructive/", "title": "I just keep showing the same self-destructive behavior, suicide is starting to feel more and more as relief (23M)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwaway1913555", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615841347, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m5uid1/i_just_keep_showing_the_same_selfdestructive/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422542.5764737, "replies_charged": false}
