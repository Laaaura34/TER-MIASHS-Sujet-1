I have bouts of intense suicidal ideations - usually I am able to deflect them, when I manage a reality check. Recently I'm falling asleep excessively with my mind racing about these things.\n It's been hard to seek help during Covid, with massive waiting lists. Suicidal ideations are one of those taboo topics, and are often deflected with \"things will get better\", or \"you just want the suffering to end, not to end your life\". I can't bring myself to argue against the latter. I sometimes want to leave it to my body to decide what happens to me. When and how are pointless questions to ponder, when we let ourselves hope.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pqxqmx/a_losing_battle_against_ideations/", "title": "A losing (?) battle against ideations", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "luv2mange", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632010979, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pqxqmx/a_losing_battle_against_ideations/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428428.6182866, "replies_charged": false}
