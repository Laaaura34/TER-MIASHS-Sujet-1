And I'm not having the best flashbacks of my family right now. It's almost as if I was never supposed to be brought into my family, or on this planet for that matter. The more I go through life the less I want to do with people.\n\nI spend a lot of time thinking about my past mistakes. But to be honest, my family spent a lot of time bringing up my past mistakes too. I don't really like myself. And I can't really stand my mother anymore.\n\nI don't get why I exist. I don't get it. My mother brings me down to the point where I question my own value.\n\nA lot of my life has been lonely. A lot of my life has been incredibly boring. And a lot of my life has been very, very depressing. So many times I have wanted to kill myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kjf9ue/so_how_do_i_prevent_myself_from_committing/", "title": "So, how do I prevent myself from committing suicide today?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Leko00", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1608815762, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kjf9ue/so_how_do_i_prevent_myself_from_committing/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428393.3112032, "replies_charged": false}
