I feel so alone and would feel better if someone else read this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n .... is used in place of names.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFebruary 29th, 2020\n\nDear Reader,\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this, I\u2019m probably dead or in the hospital by a failed suicide attempt. The weight of the world was too much, I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I cannot shake the crippling anxiety, depression, stress, fear, and guilt that I have. Every day my thoughts are plagued by everyday fears and evils, why would God want me to live like this? My home was my safe space, now I don\u2019t even have a house anymore. It\u2019s not mine anymore. Octobyr died in that home, and I wasn\u2019t there for her. To some people that may just be the death of a cat but it wasn\u2019t just that, she was my cat. She was mine, she trusted me, she loved me, and I left her. She seemed so sad, and she died when I wasn\u2019t even there to help. I couldn\u2019t have made her final moments any better. If I was there for her, If I stayed she would still be alive. She didn\u2019t have to die like that. If I called Rudolph in the night he went missing, he would still be alive. If I had said more to .... , she wouldn\u2019t have killed herself. She could still be alive. She greeted me every day, \u201cHey Lord of Sealand!\u201d She made my days happier and less stressful and what did I give her? Just a hi back. Not a how are you, not a \u2018let\u2019s do something\u2019, just\u2026 a hi. We lost such an important life and I can\u2019t shake the responsibility of the role I played a part in or should\u2019ve played a part in. I never sent in that letter to Mrs. Stevens. I told myself over and over again that I would send her a letter to tell her how much I appreciated her and how incredible of a teacher she was and\u2026 she died. She\u2019ll never know how much I cared about her. All because I procrastinated. One of her favourite students didn\u2019t do anything in her time of need. I organized a whole ceremony out of guilt, and for some reason It took me, a student, to organize and write an announcement as well as organize a banquet for her and everything. Why didn\u2019t the school care about her life? I felt sick, everyone turned to me like I was some nice hero when In actuality I was just crippled by guilt. Massive guilt. We had a page for XXXTentacion, a rapper no one knew in the school- a rapper that beat up a gay guy and his girlfriend. He got a page for free and I had to push for our own teacher to get a page. What kind of FUCKED world is that? I\u2019m sorry Mrs S. I\u2019m sorry Robyn. My Grandma died when I wasn\u2019t there, I was at band camp. Our grandma took us to concerts, shows, her house, she did so much for us. She made up for her being a bad mother by being a perfect grandma. To us at least. She was so kind and went so far out of her way to pay for things for us. If she was here, college debt wouldn\u2019t hurt so badly. I wish I could tell her I loved her one last time, and that she could\u2019ve seen me playing baritone saxophone just like her husband. I wish she could\u2019ve seen me play my first solo. I wish she could\u2019ve seen me succeed. I miss you, I\u2019m sorry for being away when you pass Grandma. \n\nI think about my dad a lot. My dad that allegedly hit me so hard against the wall I could\u2019ve died. I think I can feel the mark on my skull. I think about how my mum said he was a terrorist for the IRA, and I wonder if he would\u2019ve ever accepted me if I was gay. When I think of my dad, I think of the time my mum said that If there was a man here, we wouldn\u2019t treat her this way. Of course, it was just a heated argument that went sour since I was defending my twin since I loved him and viewed he was right, yet my opinion was invalid since I was \u2018just going to his aid\u2019. I think about that quote a lot, maybe more than dad. Was that a dig at me being gay so I would respect a man? Or did she really think I was a sexist pig? She brought up fear, how we would fear him. I don\u2019t want to live in a world where I would suppose to fear my father. My relationship with mum was complicated. I love her, undyingly so, even if she has said some things that still cut so deeply to this day. She\u2019s denied a lot of it, but what are you going to do. Only my twin and I heard it so its void. She shifted over a new leaf after going to England, and besides crying on our birthday about how awful we were\u2026 on our birthday\u2026 it had been better. She was nicer, calmer, she snapped less at ... and was overall just nicer to be around. Religion seemed to change her a lot, she was happier so I was happier. Her relationship with ....... seemed to be far beyond repair, even if she refused to acknowledge that she treated ..... differently in the past. ..... just seemed done with her. After her berating him, telling him how useless and evil he was, after actually attacking him a couple of times- he was done. Done with her. Just as mum had been done with Grandma after she put up with too much shit from her. I hope the circle doesn\u2019t continue with ..... I love mum, so much. I wish she didn\u2019t leave. I wish she didn\u2019t leave us. I wish she didn\u2019t leave our siblings with the burden of me and my twin. It\u2019s so awful, it\u2019s so awful. They have to help pay phone bills now, they have to worry about so much when still young and trying to deal with their own lives. Seeing how sad .....  was after having to cosign my loans broke me and has continued to break me. She can reassure me it\u2019s fine all she wants, but I can see it in her eyes, her expression. I\u2019m hurting her future, I\u2019m hurting her chance at grad school. I\u2019m ruining my sister's future. My future isn\u2019t certain. If I\u2019m a failure it\u2019s all for nothing. If I kill myself now, maybe things will be better. \n\nI wish I could sacrifice myself for my family. I wish I could kill myself and as a result, .... music grows extremely popular as it deserves to be, .....gets the chance to work and succeed among the best artists of all, Mum gets to live her happy dream life as a nun, all family tensions are gone and everyone\u2019s happy and most importantly, I wish I could sacrifice for .... success. I want ..... to succeed most of all. He deserves it. He has been the best twin anyone could\u2019ve ever asked for. I hate it when people say he\u2019s the bad twin, the evil twin, it makes me sick. It makes me absolutely sick when they say he doesn\u2019t care or when people insult him. He has been through so much shit and he\u2019s the nicest person I\u2019ve ever met. Nicest person to me. He\u2019s always been there for me, and I love him for it. I want him to be happy most of all. I also want Sebastian and Kaspyr to live long happy lives surrounded by love, what the other cats should\u2019ve had. \n\n... is my sister, the closest person I had for the longest time. Even now I feel so locked with my sister, so connected with her. I feel like we have the same mindset. If we fail, it\u2019s over- i\u2019m over. The stress is too much but It\u2019s all I\u2019ve known. Mum told me to defend her no matter what since she counts on me, I was going to do it anyway. She\u2019s the one that really gets me in a way of work and stress as well as animals- even if we don\u2019t talk about it. I feel like we\u2019ve gotten less close but I think that\u2019s just myself, it\u2019s hard to talk to people I feel like I\u2019m actively hurting via my loans. She has such a big heart, especially for animals- like me. Scott is so perfect for her. Scott makes her so happy and I love Scott for it.\n\n.... is my brother, he deserves the world. Stop calling him sensitive, and mum- for the love of all that is holy\u2026 be nicer to him. You have no idea how many times he\u2019s stood up for you, how much he\u2019s done for you. He\u2019s given you money, he\u2019s paid for internet, garbage, he\u2019s done so much to help you. When you say he doesn\u2019t love you, that takes the most out of him since he\u2019s the one that really does the most for you. Please be nicer to him. .... is an angel, he may be the best of us. Never have seen someone so giving and willing to sacrifice so much. Please start to respect him more and show him you love him undylingly. Stop questioning Liz, that was years ago- get over it, please. He\u2019s done far too much good for you to be held down by that burden. He has fantastic music and really is the best of us. Erin is now, and Erin is great. She\u2019s so kind and seeing her interact with .... makes me happy.\n\n..., my mother. Sorry if a lot of this mentions you and stuff you\u2019ve done, I don\u2019t mean to hold you down by your past. You\u2019re in no way responsible for my suicide. I love you mum, more than you can ever know. I know grandma fucked you up badly, you deserved a better childhood. A much better childhood. We love you, we all do. Just please, know that, accept it, and let us know you love us too. This family has a huge issue if not letting each other know how much we care, we get too comfortable with the aspect of us being a family that we get comfortable. We aren\u2019t that close evidently, I learned that this winter break when I got closer to .... than I had ever done before. Mum you have a big heart, don\u2019t let it get crowded by fears and doubts and negative feelings. I can see the doubting you do of yourself cloud your own heart. You feel as if people are out to get you or that you aren\u2019t loved which is probably because of how awful the world treated you. We love you, so much. Let us in. Let them in, let the family in. We aren\u2019t here to attack you, we\u2019re here to love you. I love you a lot mum, even if things have happened before but all families fight. \n\n...., my twin. I don\u2019t know where to begin, I don\u2019t know where to begin. I love you, more than anything else in the world. You are so much to me. Even if I\u2019m shit at actually letting you know it. You deserve the world, I mean that. I would give anything and everything to see you smile and succeed. When you\u2019re sad, when you doubt yourself, it hurts so badly. I can\u2019t let you doubt yourself, your talent, your personality. Thank you for always being there for me. Thank you for always being the one closest to me. Thank you for always making those sweet breakfasts, for always comforting me when I was sad, for all the jokes that you made and continue to make. I love our past, our childhood, what we did together. Everything we made. I wouldn\u2019t trade those memories for the world. You\u2019re my other half. Please continue without me. I know it\u2019s selfish for me to have done this, and I\u2019m sorry for the great grief I\u2019m causing you and everyone\u2026 but keep going, for me. Please. You deserve better and to keep going, I\u2019m sorry for this large obstacle I\u2019m giving everyone, especially to you. Keep moving forward, don\u2019t doubt yourself. Don\u2019t let anyone doubt you or insult you, don\u2019t let that get to you. You are NOT useless, you are NOT evil. You\u2019re more than everyone else is and more than all others can comprehend you. You\u2019re my brother, and I love you.\n\nSchool is cripplingly bad. How do people get through this? They just have these hours of work? All these deadlines? They just manage it? They somehow come out on top without feeling like a shell of their former self? All I can think of even now is that If I don\u2019t follow through with suicide, how much homework I\u2019m gonna have. All this debt can\u2019t be for nothing. The first semester was alright, I tried so hard and I succeeded but now\u2026 It feels like I\u2019m somehow trying harder, giving my everything and it isn\u2019t even close to good enough. What kind of shitty veterinarian am I going to be if I can\u2019t do this shit second semester? What kind of student and person am I? I can\u2019t do it, I can\u2019t make it to vet school. If I can\u2019t become a vet or a vet tech, I have no purpose In life. I may as well kill myself anyway, I\u2019m going to no matter what basically with how my future is going. Every failure is just a nail in the coffin, proof I\u2019m not good enough and never will be good enough. Proof that the pain I went through for all of high school was worth jack shit, proof that my sisters cosigning and hurt future, as a result, was all for nothing, that I\u2019m a failure. There is no other plan, this has always been my plan since kindergarten. I\u2019m so scared. It seems like I\u2019m tearing chunks out of me and giving it to this school, my studies, over and over again to barely scrape by and then- what about when I have nothing left to give? What happens? Maybe I\u2019m at that point already. I probably am if you\u2019re reading this letter. It\u2019s too much, too much is riding on this. I have no job, no money, and it feels like everything is coming to bite me in the ass. I can\u2019t talk to anyone, I don\u2019t even know where to begin. What can they offer me? What is there to offer me?\n\nWhy do I feel so sad all the time? Why do I feel so weak, so helpless? I lose the will to go on and to do everything more and more every day. I feel so alone, so sad. Every day when I\u2019m alone, those awful thoughts push into my brain. I didn\u2019t mind being gay at first, but every time I go out, I realize how alone I am in that regard where I am. I don\u2019t get it. Why do I feel so apathetic to everything and yet sad at the same time? I feel like those are my only emotions most of the time. Like a robot. I don\u2019t want to be a robot. I don\u2019t want to be Aromatic. Sometimes I don\u2019t even want to be gay. How far my pride has fallen. I hate seeing people discriminated against because they\u2019re gay or killed for it, it means I\u2019m not right or valid in so many peoples eyes. I\u2019m by default a failure.\n\nDr. ... stared into my eyes and kept listing why the lab report was so bad. I couldn\u2019t even succeed in Bio, the one thing I have to be good at. She looked so disappointed, I remember forcing a smile and then going into the bathroom to cry. She expected so much more from me, and I failed her. I\u2019m such a failure, my future will be a failure. This school has really given jack shit about me. If they really cared, they would let the counselors help. The counselor I had for one meeting, Crystal, made me feel human and not crazy and recognized that I should have a stress animal, and if she was given that power, Octobyr may still be alive. She would be here, happier. With me. This school faults me for faults that aren\u2019t mine. I get help from people and turn in projects that fail, under the guidance of helpers and professors and yet it\u2019s still wrong, almost as if I\u2019m being sabotaged. The fact that an advisor told me the wrong price of this school after I asked over and over again to make sure and that led for the loan I got to not be close to good enough is not fair. And for the ones in the financial office to look at me like I\u2019m the one at fault and that I\u2019m crazy when my advisor mysteriously disappeared from campus after he helped. What is this school? Fucking Jigsaws school for trapping and mental torture? That burns me so much on the inside. Why. Why. A part of the reason I went to this school was BECAUSE it was cheaper than ..... It literally became my biggest reason. If this school ended up being bigger than ...., I would\u2019ve gone to .... I should\u2019ve gone. Why lie to me?\n\nI don\u2019t mean all of that. I do love the school here. The staff is amazing and I\u2019ve met some great people here. The professors care so much about the students and they\u2019re well beings and literally try so hard to be there for you and get to know you. Why does the rest of the staff feel so cold and far away? It only adds to the loneliness I feel. I can\u2019t ask my professor to help me with my loans so I can continue to go to school or cry in front of them about all these issues. But it honestly feels like they would do more for my issues than the rest of the staff at financial aid. Fix that before you have another suicide on your hands. \n\nI thought about listing all my friends and saying something about them. What\u2019s the point? What If I forget someone or a paragraph isn\u2019t big enough and they internalize that forever? There really is no point in doing that. There are far too many to list anyways. All I can say is that\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry it had to be like this.\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n.....", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fbi2vh/i_just_wrote_my_suicide_note/", "title": "I just wrote my Suicide Note", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "BigSadHours666", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 25, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1583006221, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fbi2vh/i_just_wrote_my_suicide_note/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426230.5155745, "replies_charged": false}
