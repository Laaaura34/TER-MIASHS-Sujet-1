I have taken basically every antidepressant, mood stabilizer, antipsychotic you can think of and never felt any better. Talk therapy has never helped or has made me feel much worse. I\u2019ve done 2 rounds of TMS therapy which didn\u2019t help at all. On the outside I seem pretty high functioning and even though I\u2019m vocal about my mental health with the people around me (family, friends, drs) no one seems to care enough to step in and really help me. Most recently I tried Ketamine treatment but had a terrible panic attack on my 7th treatment and haven\u2019t been back since because the drs full on ignored me then and still haven\u2019t called after I\u2019ve missed several appts. I\u2019m so frustrated because I really want to get help but no one gives a fuck. I don\u2019t know what else to try. I let drs and family know I sometimes have suicidal thoughts (and have had 4 failed attempts over the past 5 years) but drs keep giving me more meds and family just looks at me like a failure who can\u2019t buck up and grow up. I have been unemployed since February this year because my manager was sexually harassing me (I reported it and was gaslighted) so now I\u2019m broke, traumatized to get another job, have no reason to get out of bed, moved out of my first apartment and am back with my parents. I want to disappear permanently or at the least move away or travel the world but all that seems impossible with covid restrictions and lack of job opportunities. All my friends have abandoned me or are moving ahead with good jobs etc and I\u2019m here falling apart more and more everyday. I wonder who I could\u2019ve been if this wasn\u2019t my situation. It\u2019s exhausting and the pain is never ending I want it to stop", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q25tvy/overwhelming_suicidal_thoughts_all_the_time/", "title": "Overwhelming suicidal thoughts all the time", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Bipolar_femmeartist", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 18, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633468629, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q25tvy/overwhelming_suicidal_thoughts_all_the_time/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427322.0472558, "replies_charged": false}
