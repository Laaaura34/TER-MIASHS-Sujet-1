So big that I will lose all of my memories, something like a car crash and I want everyone to think I'm dead because they couldn't find or identify my body. Here is my reason for this: I want to go far far away but I know that people will search for me. So, I want them to think I am dead but also if I go away, I will feel guilty about the people I will leave behind. So, I want to lose my memory. No memory, no guilt.\n\nIs this a bad thing to wish? I know that lost memories mostly come back but this is a wish. Does anyone else want this sorta of thing?
