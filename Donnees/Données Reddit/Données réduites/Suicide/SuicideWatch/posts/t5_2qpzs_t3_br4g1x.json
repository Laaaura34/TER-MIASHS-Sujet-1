In the case of martyrdom, a belief has its grip so strongly on a person that they are willing to die for it. In that case in point, the belief drove a person to die, and other (generally more numerous than before) people are then gripped by the belief.\n\nI am being had by the belief that oblivion is preferable to continued life.\n\nHave you ever woken up from a dream and found yourself exhausted, wishing you hadn\u2019t dreamt the night before? Have you ever woken up from a dreamless sleep and wish you had dreamed? In my case, I have many times felt more tired after a night of intense dreaming than a dreamless slumber. Countless times I have wished to not have dreamt even if the dreams themselves were pleasant, and not once have I woken after a dreamless night wishing that instead I had dreamt. I liken my ongoing suffering of life to a similar experience.\n\nLife can be good. It can also be very, very bad. Whether it is good or bad, there is one thing that is constant: effort. Currently, I have been scraping by on the borrowed strength of guilt at considering how my family, especially my mother, would react to my passing (not to mention suicide). And it works for now, but this is no way to live out one\u2019s days.\n\nNext week I visit San Francisco for the first time. I\u2019m excited to see and walk out on the Golden Gate Bridge. The solemnity of places like that have always touched me in a way I can\u2019t fully describe. And when I\u2019m out there on that bridge, on a place where so many finally had the gumption, facing the long walk back to a safe albeit exhausting life on one side, and the call of an endless dreamless rest on the other... it\u2019s hard for me to guess in the moment which path I will choose.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/br4g1x/im_being_had_by_a_belief/", "title": "I\u2019m being had by a belief", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "hot_and_crizzly", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1558403444, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/br4g1x/im_being_had_by_a_belief/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427481.1825004, "replies_charged": false}
