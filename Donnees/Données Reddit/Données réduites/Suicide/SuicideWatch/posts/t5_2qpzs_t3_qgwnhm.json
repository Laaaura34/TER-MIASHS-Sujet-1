First time writing here, but I hope someone can share their experience with the same problem. \nI have diagnosed depression, I took pills and visit my therapist twice a month. \nI have a decent self control and my family is kinda protective, I don\u2019t really want to die, but sometimes I have really negative thoughts. And it happens really sudden and randomly. It scares. \nI am 24/7 home doing nothing, last year I\u2019ve lost my job, dropped a college and moved back to my parents house from the city I lived. At the same time I\u2019ve lost almost all of my friends, and now I feel myself lonely. I see no future, but I can struggle with this. But sometimes I can start to think about all crappy stuff happened with me. My inner voice tells me I am a failure, tells no one loves me and never needed. I am afraid someday I won\u2019t be able to deal with that and just end everything.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qgwnhm/afraid_of_randomly_appearing_suicidal_thoughts/", "title": "Afraid of randomly appearing suicidal thoughts", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "pesosamurai", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635341143, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qgwnhm/afraid_of_randomly_appearing_suicidal_thoughts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427324.2035491, "replies_charged": false}
