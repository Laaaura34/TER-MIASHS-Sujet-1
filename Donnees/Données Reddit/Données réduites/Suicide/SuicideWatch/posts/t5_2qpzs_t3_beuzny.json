It\u2019s honestly the worst thing I\u2019ve ever had to deal with and it feels like it grows every time I wake up. \n\nI attempted to overdose on what were obviously counterfeit Xanax bars on December 1st, 2018. I had taken about four or five by 7:00pm that day, since a week or 2 previous I had punched through 3 windows at my girlfriends house for cheating on me (2nd unfaithful relationship in a row) and my hands were cut, and I was dealing with the consequences that followed, including dropping out of my courses because I couldn\u2019t even leave my apartment for 5 days. I decided that night that everything I had been through the past 3 and a half years had been enough. I texted my Xanny guy and had him bag me up 20 more, under the guise that it was for my other friends that hadn\u2019t gotten in on the last sack. I walked over there and then back to mine in such a daze that I\u2019m surprised I had completed the transaction and made it home. I proceed to lock my door to my room, untie the plastic bag of \u201cXanax\u201d, and pop two at a time and washed them down with PBR until there were no more left. This was between 9 and midnight, but I\u2019m sure at this point you can give me the benefit of the doubt about specific times.\n\nI didn\u2019t plan any of this, this was a compulsive attempted suicide, and the Xanax had taken away any fear of actually dying. \n\nAs soon as I was done dosing myself, I began to take what I thought were the logical next steps; I wrote a horribly short but powerfully hurtful and selfish suicide note simply reading \u201cI hope you\u2019re happy now motherfuckers\u201d, I deleted all of my social media accounts (again), and emptied my bank account via CashApp and sent it to the aforementioned ex-girlfriend. I was truly ready, and although I can\u2019t exactly describe what I saw, I felt the most piercing light in my eyes for a couple moments before waking up at 4 or 5 pm that next day to banging on my door (Arsenal v Spurs had been an insane 3pm match apparently). \n\nThat was it. I\u2019d tried to kill myself and I\u2019d failed after thinking that it was a sure thing to down as many Xanax as I possibly could. I was in one of the longest and most melancholy dazes that I\u2019d ever been in, and I\u2019ve taken 4 or 6 Xanax WITHOUT the purpose of causing mortal harm. I felt like even more of a failure than previous, and nothing changed. In fact, I felt worse because I wasn\u2019t dead and the people I blamed for my attempted suicide were not finally realizing that they mistreated me in such a way that I\u2019d felt like another day was not worth it anymore. Retrospectively, how selfish once again. I left that city soon after and moved to another after New Years while spending some time at home with my family. I had only told a couple of people that story, minus some of the more fucked up parts that surely would have made them feel even worse, so I spared them and restricted those demons to my own domain. \n\nI sought help once only because my father had basically forced me to see someone, and that\u2019s where I picked up the Major Depressive Disorder tag. From that day until now, I have yet to see another medical professional regarding this event. I\u2019m truly embarrassed by it and it may be the single worst thing I\u2019ve ever done or attempted to do. \n\nSo here I am, in my new city, hundreds of miles from the closest friend or family member, and I am feeling the same way, if not worse now. The weight of many things has been haunting my sleep, my ability to make new friends, and my work ethic. I\u2019ve been through two abortions that my girlfriends of the past have had to have done (one date tattooed on the underside of my right wrist), multiple times catching someone I thought that loved me being with someone else, and my mother having multiple spinal fusions over the past 5 years, each having greater and greater risks, and the last one was in progress the very night I had taken all those Xanax. \n\nI do not know what to do anymore. A counselor heard a diet version of what I\u2019ve just told you here at my new school and they got me withdrawals from my classes this semester because even though I was getting As and Bs, the past two weeks have crippled my ability to get out of bed in the morning, and my suicidal thoughts are creeping back like a relapse. I am so truly disappointed and disgusted with myself that I don\u2019t even care that I don\u2019t have anyone around me anymore, because I wouldn\u2019t want them to see me like this.\n\nI\u2019ve been in this new city for 4 months now, and the only new numbers I have in my phone are drug dealers. I work obviously, but I am very distant and cautious around my co-workers and I don\u2019t open up to them at all, they must think I\u2019m this crazy loner that came out of nowhere. \n\nI\u2019ve slowly begun to figure out ways I can end it again that don\u2019t involve pills, mostly because I can\u2019t find them up here. I truly want to be happy, but when I think about being asleep for the rest of my life, it actually starts to feel like everything is going to be alright, because I won\u2019t have to wake up to my problems anymore. \n\nI know I\u2019m super fucked up, and I shouldn\u2019t be like this. I\u2019m trying to read articles and posts on here to find something I can hold onto and keep me from feeling like this, but being alone all the time in real life is pretty inescapable when you don\u2019t even know what trying to not be depressed even is or feels like anymore. \n\nAnything you can offer will be greatly appreciated and I hope one day soon I can use this as something to look back on. Hell, it\u2019ll probably end up with me having one more tattoo.\n\nThank you for listening,\n\nRGP.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/beuzny/it_feels_like_im_spiraling/", "title": "It feels like I\u2019m spiraling", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AnonymousSpur", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1555647125, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/beuzny/it_feels_like_im_spiraling/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427582.06681, "replies_charged": false}
