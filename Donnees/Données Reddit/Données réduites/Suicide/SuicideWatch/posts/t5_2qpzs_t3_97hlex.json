I don\u2019t want to die so much as express grief in a strong way. Maybe I should draw or paint or something. \n\nSome stronger currents of social anxiety today. Felt heavily scrutinized in various stores and on the bus. Some people are always stern and untrusting but for some reason it begins feeling personal. \n\nI never like feeling this fragile. It\u2019s like I have no voice for who I am. I feel a nobody. \n\nAt other times I was acceptably motivated and entertained and in a decent mood. I still have some more severe stuff going on but I was able to pull back a little today which was cool. \n\nI don\u2019t want to feel worthless again. I\u2019m watching Ghostbusters and cheering myself up. \n\nIn a few weeks I will probably want to post again.  There are some stressful weeks ahead. I should be more proactive now but I\u2019ve settled into just having a good time before I have to work really hard for the year. I don\u2019t want to waste these weeks worrying. \n\nI still have bad relationship feelings with family but am managing. \n\nUnderstanding that I\u2019m due for some stress ahead I want to be managing my anxiety and depression more and making the best of my time. \n\nI\u2019ve been feeling alone and I don\u2019t think I can do that anymore. I might need to try making friends so I don\u2019t feel isolated like I can. It\u2019s too hard on me. I\u2019d like sharing the burden. \n\nI like admitting what\u2019s too hard for me and I\u2019ve had some help as a result of admitting such.
