My perspective on life, and the way my fucking brain functions? There are moments when I feel her kick that I feel ultimate bliss, what can only be described as \"god's\" touch. This soon fades, and I return to my selfish ugly self. I always thought I would be a good father. I thought, \"My daughter will never suffer because of my actions, no, she will live a happy life in a mother and father classic story.\" Unfortunately, I no longer see this. I feel I will not have the patience or motivation to live out a happy life with my baby. I will be a terrible father; One that will lose the woman who has demonstrated such powerful love. A goddess that sacrificed so much and never gave reason to doubt such love. She is unreal.\n\nMy tiny will also one day take notice of my shit self; They will leave me and be happy once more. In light of all this, how pathetic is it that I'm still thinking about myself? Children having Children, no bueno.\n\nYet, my tiny remains and will remain strong. She floats there just doing as she pleases. Whether it be practicing her latest IPMAN jabs and kicks on her mom's stomach, or displaying her gymnastic squirming skills. She's such a weirdy lol. When getting a sonogram, she actually had her toe in her mouth on one occasion. I don't know what purpose we're meant for, or how we should live. We may be potential gods meant for much, or we may be nothing special at all. Just another average species that got lucky with a bit of intelligence, but this I know, My tiny is strong. She will learn to live. She will exist as she should and make a path that defines a worthy human life.\n\nI've struggled with depression for a long time, and it's something that's escalating little by little over the years. I'm afraid of stress because my attitude has gotten very explosive quite recently and I run with my emotions. Restraint isn't something natural for me; I notice people that handle things like it's no big deal but I honestly have trouble when it comes to relaxing. There are times when I reach clarity over a situation or life in general, but this has always been very brief. Hey, I have a credit score of 690! Awesome! Oh what's that carmax? I can't get a car? You douche. \n\n\n\nDanza Kuduro, way to cause some venting.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/iil13/suicidal_behavior_is_getting_worse/", "title": "Suicidal behavior is getting worse", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "itsnotrea1", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1309999129, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/iil13/suicidal_behavior_is_getting_worse/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425244.212634, "replies_charged": false}
