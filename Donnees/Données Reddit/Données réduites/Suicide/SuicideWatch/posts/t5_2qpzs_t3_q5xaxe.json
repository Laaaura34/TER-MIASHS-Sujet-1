And don't convince me to not kill myself I have already decided , whenever I feel good for half a day there comes a week of depression and wanting to die so badly, if you could just give me tips on what to write in the final messages to my 2 friends so they don't get that depressed and forget about me soon.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q5xaxe/15_going_to_end_it_all/", "title": "15, going to end it all", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Different_Abroad_384", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633963201, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q5xaxe/15_going_to_end_it_all/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635426746.0558326, "replies_charged": false}
