I'm sorry I'm probably just gonna ramble for I have no other place to fully vent and the therapist isn't the best place for me right now. I'm 24 years old and I live in a third world country where I get harassed on the daily if I go out. Can't wear anything but pants or risk being kidnapped or worse. I was raped as a 7 year old by my brother's friend which was our neighbor and well he also molested my own brother and his sister tried his way with my own sister. Their family was crazy and I was often left to be watched by their mother while my mom ran errands. At 14 one night which I'll never forget there was a funeral outside my home. a lil idea about funerals here its very haunting its just a big tent with a bunch of people and a Quran reciter with a shitty microphone with an echo effect that sends chills to my spine everytime. The tent can be set up anywhere in any street really. Preferably next to the dead person's house. Anyways I was going to drink when I heard that and for some reason I couldn't breathe and collapsed to the floor and my dad was back from abroad for like 2 weeks. I felt like I was going to die and my perfect idea was to sleep next to my parents as a goodbye and well they'd find me in the morning. And ever since then I literally couldn't breathe. For the next year or so I had to either be sitting up or laying down for a while in order to be able to breathe. For example it took about 30 minutes for me to be able to breathe properly when I sit down if I lay down it takes another 30 minutes and so on. So sleeping, walking, even peeing in the middle of the night became a heavy task I'd cry and panic every single time. I've been to numerous doctors they all said I was healthy. It drove me even crazier that my pain was categorized as healthy. I'd cry and wish they'd find something wrong with me so I'd be able to be treated. Of course the doctors saying I was healthy didn't stop them from giving me a shit on medication though. I had a big bag of medication everywhere I went that if I went anywhere. They gave me inhalers too. Until the age of fucking 20 I've never seen a therapist or was recommended to see a therapist. Until I broke down. My first experience with a therapist was the worst. They said I was just a little too sensitive from the first session. The second session didn't amount to much either she said I'd get better by my own and that I should just stop being so damn sensetive. I didn't tell her about that I was raped because I didn't trust her really and I had told her multiple things other than that about myself and how my life was ruined by how I felt and she still said I was too sensitive and that was her diagnosis. I thanked her and left crying my eyes out that my pain over the fucking years was for nothing. I was the most awkward person to be around I was sad almost all the time. I had stopped going to school when I was in grade 9. Schools here mostly don't give a shit if u don't go. Tutors are a big thing where I live so you'd get better grades going to tutors anyways. People didn't like me at school and considered me too weird. They spread rumors about me all the time even tho I didn't hurt anyone. Boys saying I brush up against their dicks and shit I didn't even speak to the boys in my school. I spent the years from 14 to about 16 in a constantly daily fear of dying and death. Every damn day I thought I was gonna die. Even now whenever a minor little pain happens I think I'm gonna die. Also nowadays i have a constant pain in my chest that accompanied the whole entire time since I was 14. It would come and go. Sometimes It hurts for months and sometimes days and sometimes minutes. Again been to many doctors did many tests and absolutely nothing is wrong yet again. when I finally went to a proper therapist they told me I had depression, and anxiety and as time went by I was diagnosed with PTSD and BPD. College on the other hand will be probably the death of me. Where I live dropping out shouldn't even cross your mind. That's one giant taboo and well Goodluck getting a job or even make a career for yourself. How u get into which college I consider highly unfair but I worked hard regardless got screwed over by a math tutor in my last year of high school. In the Last year of high school you chose from 3 departments mathematical, scientific and literature. I suck at my own mother tongue and literature meant more and more of it. I decided to join the mathematical department like my sister did before me. And it being the mathematical department that meant math was the majority of my score and I sadly didn't score high enough to get into the college I wanted which was fine arts my overall score was 84.6% and the asking grade to join fine arts was 91%. I ended up studying archeology for a year and then i joined the English literature department looking for a quick way to graduate or so i thought. English is clearly not my mother tongue but I find it easier than my own or that I'm more used to it than my own language. But I'm still stuck in the English department. I'm now in what should be my last year of college but i have 24 more courses to go. I dropped many subjects and i didn't attend many midterms and finals. I stopped caring about my future and what's to come. I mostly feel empty on a daily basis. And now I'm a fucking drug addict I smoke hash everyday and if I don't have hash I try to get it from anywhere. Being without it causes withdrawal effects to kick in and not to mention I already take antidepressants. I'm scared and terrified of my future to the point that I shut it out. I stopped going to my therapist because I have been on and off with them over the course of 2 years and I don't think I'll ever get help because I myself am not willing to help myself anymore. I don't know what to do and it terrifies me that I might just end up killing myself. That's how i always look at the future. That I regardless of what i do will die at the hand of myself. And there is nothing i can do about it. I'm sorry for this incoherent shit show.. I just needed to vent. I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm just sick of feeling uncomfortable every waking moment. I just wish I was able to function like a fucking normal human being and go through shit and shut it out and not shut down once anything happens. Again I'm sorry for the long incoherent shit..
