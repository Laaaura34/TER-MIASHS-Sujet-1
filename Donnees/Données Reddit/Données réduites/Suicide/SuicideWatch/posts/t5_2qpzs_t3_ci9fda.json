If you're only a pussy, at least you aren't a fuck-up and have less of a reason to do it anyway. \n\nFrom an outsider's perspective, this must be pretty funny. I'm a fuck-up that's better off dead, yet too much of a pussy to do it. Very reminiscent of a sitcom plot. Every episode I try to kill myself, but always pussy out. Then I whine and complain about how life sucks and I hate living and *blah blah blugh*. The comedy comes from how pathetic my character is. So indecisive, live or die. The only grief that should be felt is knowing these people share a species with such a pitiful individual. I wish I didn't, however the character is me so I don't have a choice.\n\nBy the series finale, my character will realize they spent their entire life wishing they were dead. On one hand, they'll be very happy it has finally arrived. On the other, fully realize how pathetic their story is. I would say wasted potential, but my character had no potential to begin with. This realization will strengthen both their excitement and sadness about their natural death. What a sad, sad person.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ci9fda/its_not_fun_being_both_a_pussy_and_a_fuckup/", "title": "It's not fun being both a pussy and a fuck-up", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Iveaquestion4u", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1564179737, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ci9fda/its_not_fun_being_both_a_pussy_and_a_fuckup/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426706.4301863, "replies_charged": false}
