I can't even think straight I cant even write this down But I don't know what to do at this point I just feel I want to end this.\n\nI am sorry in advance for the English and grammar.\n\nI am 21M lives alone. Pursuing masters and a Business Man. My parents always accuse me of being so cold at family gatherings and not respecting anyone.\n\nSo when I was a kid my father and his family was not in the picture until I was 8, so my mom used to work full time and I used to stay with my grandpa and grandma, I remember when my teacher asked me whats my father name I said \"grandpa\" suddenly he comes back and starts being nice so we shift to a different city with him.\n\nI was admitted to a very high demanding school which was hell for me, I was not good at studies and I was humiliated in front of everyone because of my grades and everyone always told me that I am nothing and I cannot do anything in life and I won't be successful in life, always used to get in trouble because of this every one used to look down upon. My parents were called often to have meetings with our headmaster and even principal and it was the worst because my parents used to beat the sh\\*t out of me whenever there was a call from my teacher, meeting, or whenever I showed my results to them.\n\nAll of it was horrible like my father used to punch me and thrash me like I was a punching bag he used to pick me up and throw me on the floor or pin me on the wall then proceed to punch and slap the sh\\*t out of me or my mother would just use sticks and leather belts to beat me up while I used to be in my undies, one day my father hanged me upside down from the terrace of our house I was naked and I pissed my self I always used to piss my self whenever I was punched or pinned on the wall because I knew what was coming. I was not good at studies or sports when there was an annual event for sports every year my father would yell at me in the stadium in front of everyone and when I come last at a race or I lose my breath he used to always tell me \"u are nothing u are worthless clearly belts are not doing anything to you I will surely get a leather hunter for you\" and these statements were in front of everyone like my classmates, their families I would just be numb standing there looking down just trying not to get him angrier this went on for years and years whenever I try to scream they would just pin me down grab me by my trap muscle beside my neck like literally, my father would force his two fingers in that little space between muscle and bone which would cause immense pain and then with another hand he would grab my lips and twist them to shut my mouth all of this while I was all pissing my self. I was not allowed to pay outside I had 6 hours of school 3 hours of homework and  2-3hours of extra classes in all this my teachers had all the permissions to do whatever they feel fit to punish me everywhere I would go I used to hear that I was not a good person I was gonna do nothing in life and I was just wasting my parent's money. I was broken I wanted to die because I believed what everyone said. I felt like everything was my fault and I am the only person responsible for everything. My mom always used to say this to me while beating me \"I hope you just die\", \"I hope I gave birth to a cold rock\". \n\nI had enough and I was loosing my mind I didnt knew what to do, I had no friends I had nothing I was a sack of sand who was punished for everything in 2013 I had my results of the midters and I failed in every subject possible I was so afraid of going home I decided to throw my self under a vehicle but I couldnt mustre enough confidence to do it I sat there for 2 hours just staring at the road, ( there was a rumor in my school that whiteners were poisonus and you could die if you dink the white liquid ) so I just open my bag and took out my compass box and took out the whitener and opened the cap up for and drank it, I totally drank it empty, then I went home went into my room and just slept in hope that i won't wake up  but I did and I was so terified that I didnt die I was so broken and terified of them that I felt easy to die rather than facing my own parents so I went down stairs to see whats going on and surely my mom found my result in my bag and was just waiting for me to show it, i was just getting some water inmy bottle and suddenly she asked did u got your result today? I went numb my feet and hands went cold I said no I dint got it boom she slapped me and I was on the floor and she found her stick and then she hit me with it multiple times and then locked me in my room then my dad came home from work she showed him my result and he was livid he just wanted me to die that day he came to my room and started to slap me and it went on for 30 to 40 mins so eventually I started being in my room, eating alone, sleeping alone, crying my eyes out every night I just wanted someone to smile at me, talk to me, be nice to me.\n\nI just didn't understand what was my mistake, I didn't do anything to hurt them, I never argued with them, but I was the one blamed for everything. I grew colder and colder to them eventually moving out and starting my own business but I have some serious issues I struggle to trust people, I still have episodes of the past and I often wake up at night all having nightmares about it. I still have no friends and nor do I have a family, I am alone. I have no faith in any god because if THE GOD all mighty is there and knows everything and sees everything then he is not here to help. After all, if he was there when I was suffering he would ease my pain at least ease it by taking my life.  I am broken to hell and I don't have anyone to share my feelings so this is the reason I am writing this, just to get things off my chest. I don't know how long I will handle this pain and loneliness anymore.\n\nThank you for reading my shit story. \n\n\\- DEFECTIVE ONE", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pv0j6r/i_quit/", "title": "I Quit!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Fallen_onee", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632548001, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pv0j6r/i_quit/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422998.9897056, "replies_charged": false}
