Through the majority of my life suffered from depression with intrusive thoughts. I kept it all in my head up until the last two years, and don't think the damage done is reversible. \n\nI'll be honest, the depression isn't nearly as bad as it was in elementary school through high school, I can at least function. The intrusive thoughts, on the other hand, have gone into overdrive. I started using psychedelics as an escape last year.  The first 12 or so times I did it, it felt amazing and made it all go away, but during the last trip everything came back suddenly at the peak. My inhibitions were temporarily snuffed out and I came very close to killing myself that night. I somehow came down enough by the time I got to the hospital to lie my way of the situation, then did the same when my parents started asking questions. I now regret that, nothing has changed. Oddly enough after the attempt I didn't have a single intrusive thought for a couple days, it was the clearest my head since I was in elementary school, but this was short lived.\n\nRight now its been so bad that I've failed the past two semesters, I'd only hear half lecture because for the other half I'd be staring off into space thinking about slitting my fucking throat. At work I constantly forget special requests within the time span it takes to turn around and walk two steps. It's like my body is running on auto pilot while my brain is thinking about suicide. \n\nI'm now acting impulsively. I used to have a few thousand dollars in the bank, but now there's only a couple hundred. I spent it all trying to distract myself. Lately I've just been giving into the compulsions. I started obsessing about my current weapon of choice, so I went out and bought it(a box cutter). I've been carrying it in my pocket for the past three weeks, I need to. \n\nI have a appointment with a psychiatrist in two months, and I honestly believe I'm not going to make it that long, somethings going to snap. This problem that was a hurdle in my childhood and teenage years has become an impass. My life isn't going to progress until this is fixed or its just going to kill me.\n\nSorry if my writing seems a little unconnected and lacking of detail. It took me an hour to write because I kept losing myself in thought.\n  \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2q5jiu/i_dont_know_what_to_do/", "title": "I don't know what to do", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Throwaway_320199", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1419317933, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2q5jiu/i_dont_know_what_to_do/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426493.2414284, "replies_charged": false}
