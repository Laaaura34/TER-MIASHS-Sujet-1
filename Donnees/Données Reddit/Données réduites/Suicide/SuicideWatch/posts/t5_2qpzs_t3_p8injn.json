I\u2019ve always been an embarrassment, school just highlighted it.\nI\u2019m indecisive, I\u2019m lazy, I\u2019m talentless, I\u2019m slow, those are just a few of the major flaws in me. I cant assert myself, and end up creating so much discourse by doing so. I am my own worst enemy. But everyone is to a certain point, right? I\u2019m just not strong enough. Im tired of the anxiety attacks, overwhelming myself to where I get sick, and tearing myself down when I make mistakes. I\u2019m tired of the stress eating. I\u2019m tired of being misunderstood. I cry myself to sleep almost every night (sorry that\u2019s weird), and get hellacious pains where I almost faint from stress. I don\u2019t wanna do this anymore. I don\u2019t want anyone else to deal with me too. Sometimes I get babied around by teachers because I have so much stress. I feel so guilty. I don\u2019t want to make anyone\u2019s life any harder than it already is. I just can\u2019t calm down. I feel like it\u2019ll  be better for everyone in the situation if I just killed myself. There\u2019ll be tragedy, but everyone at school will forget, and my parents will move on and finally live the life they want. I\u2019d prefer if everyone just forgot I was ever here, so they don\u2019t have to waste any time. I just wanted someone to listen before I might go. Hopefully I can be strong in another life.
