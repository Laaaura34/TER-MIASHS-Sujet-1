I have never experienced suicidal thoughts or anything before this event... I decided to try out the dark web and use a search engine called Not Evil (worst mistake of my fucking life) I saw a bunch of ads for mainly drugs and black markets and then one for porn... I got curious and clicked on it and it was CP (Child)(Porn) and I got aroused by it... For the past month I've felt nothing but disgust in myself and I don't think I can live because of it anymore... Am I an actual pedophile, do I have POCD, or am I just a stupid fucking teenager aroused by taboo shit...
