I (20/f) have struggled with depression since I was thirteen, around 17 I got my ed and now it\u2019s the worst it\u2019s ever been. I am in nursing school in Germany and it\u2019s so exhausting and tiring and it\u2019s just too much for me. I have been home for 3 weeks with burn out now. To all that my gf got thrown out 4 months ago and has been living with me. There\u2019s just the fact that I live with 5 other people in a shared apartment. (I was thrown out by my dad last year cause he choose his new gf of a year and their newborn son and didn\u2019t want me there anymore so I had to take this place) 3 are over 40 alcoholics and harass us a lot. Im addicted to weed since I moved out and the pandemic startet. The last 4 months have been one of the worst times in my life. For 4 months we have been trying to get a place to live but no one wants us and I have to take care of all that, because my gf is majorly depressed ever since she came here, which I can understand to 100% and I have no problem with that but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that it is exhausting. I don\u2019t really have hope anymore and we\u2019ve been in my room for 4 months it\u2019s just getting harder and harder. My gf is also getting worse and worse and I also don\u2019t know how to be a good supportive girlfriend since I don\u2019t even know how to get out of that state myself. I think about ending it more and more, usually there is a little feeling that I don\u2019t actually wanna die but it\u2019s slowly going away. I feel like a failure, my mom treated me like shit my whole life, my dad threw me out after being my hero for all my life, my grandparents stick to my dad and just make feel bad about everything I do, I feel like the worst gf in the world, lost most of my friends this year cause of depression and I\u2019m just tired. The only things making me happy are drugs and if that is the only good thing in life for m I don\u2019t think I want it anymore. I\u2019m done. Some people are just not cut out for it I think. I\u2019m really just so tired of all this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q8wh6n/i_dont_know_how_i_can_keep_going_on_im_tired/", "title": "I don\u2019t know how I can keep going on.
