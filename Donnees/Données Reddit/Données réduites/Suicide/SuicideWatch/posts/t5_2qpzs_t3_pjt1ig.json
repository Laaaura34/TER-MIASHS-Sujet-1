I wanna die. I can't achieve my dreams. I'm not even sure what I want to do in the future. I don't want the future anymore. I just wanna be in eternal rest. I don't want the uncertainty of life. I don't want to suddenly end up homeless. I don't want to continually sufferring. I can't find a reason to be happy because I'll be sad anyway. Whenever I feel happy, I feel like it's not right. Feeling sad and lonely for me is the right feeling I should feel. I don't care about the people close to me; they'll move on anyway. I just think that nothing's worth it in this life. I don't even know if I need help or what.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pjt1ig/i_wanna_die_i_cant_achieve_my_dreams/", "title": "I wanna die.
