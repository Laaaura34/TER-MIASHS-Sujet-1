I tried to strangle myself with a neck tie, and just before I could faint I heard a sound--it was some simple four note pattern. Anyways, my body immediately undid all my knots and brought itself out of danger.\n\nGuys, I'm scared--this isn't the first time, and god knows how many fucking times I've tried to kill myself. Jesus christ. I thought I was getting better--I've been getting therapy, going to groups, and taking hobby classes. For some while I've been doing nice stuff. But now I go and fuck up my current situation.\n\nI know it would have been great if someone I knew personally could have found me but given my current circumstances and some future events I need to play out (which this recent episode could jeopardize)--I just can't let that happen.\n\nFuck. Why the fuck did I take those two Zoloft tablets. Fuckers--I've been weening off of them for weeks and now I go and fuck it up by taking two before I go to bed. What the fuck--I thought I missed my interval dosage (I'm doing every few days so I can avoid withdrawal effects--I tried cold turkey and that was bad) so I checked my schedule--I didn't. Then I realized I would have some leftover after my schedule ended so I decided what the heck, why not? \n\nI've really fucked up guys--I host needed to vent this. I've been going through this period of suicidal behavior for a long time guys--and I'm trying my best. I know medicine can't heal me; a girlfriend won't fix me; fuck nothing external can really fix me. Goddammit I just need to fucking decide that I want to fucking live. What the fuck am I doing with my life--goddammit.\n\nIf you've read this far, thank you. I'm kinda done for now.\n\n**TL;DR Popped a double dosage of my prescribed medicine after trying to ween myself off for weeks. Had *another* attempt. Didn't go through. Now I'm here ranting.**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2yw4if/i_couldnt_do_it_and_im_glad_for_the_moment/", "title": "I Couldn't Do It.
