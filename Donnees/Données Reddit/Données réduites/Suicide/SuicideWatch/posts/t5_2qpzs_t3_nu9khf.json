I try and blame others look for a scape goat, make excuses, but its just been me. As I get older, accountability is something i\u2019m reminded of a lot. I do this to myself, i\u2019ve done this to myself. Ive been living chasing fantasies that\u2019ll never come real. I gotta be honest with me this is the best option.  Im so addicted to **** that does nothing for me. I just sit on my phone for hours, talk to myself like i\u2019m making a difference, watch people live life, wonder why shits the same. its been right in-front of me the whole time. Im gonna take back some control and do whats best for me and be selfish. I know the only way out. Ive done the same thing all my life but the people I feel most compassionate about helped me see beautiful value in the memories made. \nIm grateful they\u2019ll be what I remember in my final moments.\n\nIm saying this as a last wish, do not give me hope i\u2019ve had enough, tortures me everyday. Just a goodbye would be appreciated :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nu9khf/love_compassion_and_empathy/", "title": "Love compassion and empathy", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "EnvironmentCautious4", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623063494, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nu9khf/love_compassion_and_empathy/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422989.4644234, "replies_charged": false}
