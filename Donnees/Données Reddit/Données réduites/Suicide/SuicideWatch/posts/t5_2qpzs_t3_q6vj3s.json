I\u2019m not sure if this is nsfw but there\u2019s no pictures or graphic detail at all.\nI\u2019m 17 and I\u2019ve been taking mirtazapine for depression for a few months and have been seeing a therapist. When I first started taking the medication, someone in my house had to give me my pills every night as I wasn\u2019t trusted to have the whole bottle. As time went by my mom became more lenient with me knowing where the full pill bottle was. Last night I ended up taking all that was left, but I didn\u2019t die. I ended up taking only 400mg which I now know was nowhere near the lethal dose, but it was still really scary. I woke up the next morning and I just told her I had ran out of medication and she believed it. Im not sure if I should tell her what really happened as I feel she\u2019d blame herself for not hiding the bottle. She trusted me to get my pills last night and. However, now I don\u2019t feel suicidal anymore, and I\u2019m almost 100% sure I will never try to do that again. If I do tell her, I know everything will change and I\u2019d probably be sent to a hospital.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q6vj3s/do_i_tell_my_parents_i_tried_to_kill_myself/", "title": "Do I tell my parents I tried to kill myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Critical-Recording58", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634072274, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q6vj3s/do_i_tell_my_parents_i_tried_to_kill_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427426.904415, "replies_charged": false}
