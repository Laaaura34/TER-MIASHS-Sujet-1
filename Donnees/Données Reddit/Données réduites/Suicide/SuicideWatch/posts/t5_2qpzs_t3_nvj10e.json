Every day I ruminate on why my parents thought it was a decent idea to put a child into this world whilst having insanely damaged, dysfunctional and destructive psyches themselves. \n\nNo kind of therapy has helped. Not meditation, not yoga, making art, reading Philosophy or self-help. I don't trust anyone. I don't trust anything outside myself. I don't trust help or support. I don't  trust my therapist. I don't have any friends. I pushed everyone away successfully. Nothing and nobody is close or of any value to me anymore.\n\nI'll complete my thesis soon, quit my job, sell my things, tell everyone I'm sorry, wish everyone goodluck and goodbye, order a package of benzos from the dark net and eat the whole thing, then hang myself, just to make sure. I have no further business in this world. No further entanglements, no values or goals, nothing to strive towards or things to avoid. Nothing I want to feel, see or hear. I'm sick of all senses. The feeling grew inside me like a tumor since early childhood. I have been completely unable to relax since years. My mental faculties are severely impaired by this intense depression. My psychosomatic symptoms only get worse. My physical form rots away.\n\nI'll let myself fall into the cold, slender arms of mother death and return to the source.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nvj10e/nothingness/", "title": "Nothingness", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "EggplantSpecialist", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623198950, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nvj10e/nothingness/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428038.5385697, "replies_charged": false}
