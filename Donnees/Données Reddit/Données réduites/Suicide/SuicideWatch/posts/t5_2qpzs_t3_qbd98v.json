It makes me so angry and most of the time I end up cutting myself because of the amount of stress I feel when I'm asked to do something. And the worst part is that I know I shouldn't react like that so I never express my anger so it all gets bottled up with along with every emotion I feel that isn't happy. I'm such a shit and lazy person for getting so mad over such small things, I'm honestly pathetic. Sometimes i complain to myself that my parents have never said they loved me or that I did a good job but then when I think about all the dumb shit I pull I don't blame them. I hate living, everyone would be happier without me", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbd98v/im_so_fucking_lazy_and_pathetic/", "title": "I'm so fucking lazy and pathetic", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "gayNsadrefrigerator", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 34, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634655512, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbd98v/im_so_fucking_lazy_and_pathetic/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426848.4019883, "replies_charged": false}
