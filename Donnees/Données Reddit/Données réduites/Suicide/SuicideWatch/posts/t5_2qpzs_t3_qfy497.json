Then i started taking these migraine pills that made me lose my appetite and i lost a lot of weight but not in a good way, and on top of that i wanted to try new things, i tried drugs like weed, alcohol, molly, and cocaine, then i slowly developed a nicotine addiction. i started getting really hooked into vrchat to the point where i drank 3 days every week socializing on vrchat and it was nice, but i stopped paying attention to friends and family and later on my boyfriend broke up with me and i didnt care at the time, fast forward i never graduated high school and all i cared about was doing drugs and partying, but u know i was like fuck it who cares, and then i made some friends on vrchat and met this guy who i started fucking with, he's basically my sugar daddy, i wasnt in a good place with my parents, they were mad at me that i dropped out so they were being cold and stopped giving me stuff like gas money and i know im spoiled but i heard from my mother she said she gave up on trying with me and i dropped out because i had no motivation, thinking about it now i shouldve just sucked it up and stop being a baby and do the work to get over with school, i got to a certain breaking point when my father got mad at me for something and he said \"the actions you are doing lately has showed us you dont love us, and you are telling us we would be better off dead\" and i hated it when they said things like that, because it broke my heart so much, i was growing up and i didn't know how to express my love for them anymore when all they did was yell at me, so i took it out on myself heavy all the time and told myself im a horrible daughter, wanting to kill myself for the stupid things i did, so i beat myself, isolated and starved myself as discipline, and eventually i stopped trying with them and they stopped trying with me, i mean of course i loved them, it was hard for me to show it because i thought they were always mad at me, and now im just mad at them i would always go spend the night at my sisters house and they never asked me where i was at, i was always scared to go home and get confronted but they never said anything about it, and if they did want to kick me out i was ready to be tossed out on to the street and wander off but they never kicked me out, all of this was going on so coped by playing video games and giving my nudes online to strangers for validation and it made me feel better, i sold my nudes to the man i was talking to and he gave me money for it and it got me really excited, then i told myself i dont really need my parents, and got really attached to him, online, crazy righttt ahaha im a clown, anyways, i was planning to just live with my parents rent free and get a job, and im still doing that, but i am so lonely i dont even think anything is worth living for anymore, i'm in a relationship with some guy on the internet who wants to fuck me, he has two children and a job, and im here mentally fucking myself over because he's the only person i talk to now, he's my best friend, and i lost everyone because of it, i gave all of my attention to him and now my friends and family don't talk to me anymore. but he's great, he takes care of me and makes sure im okay, but i get in my head all the time, i have to give him my attention 24/7 and this is all my fault and my choice, i haven't cleaned my room in months, i barely workout or go outside, i barely eat, i stay in bed, i watch tiktok or youtube, and i take nudes for him, all while in a call with him everyday and every night, because i chose too, the only time im not in call with him is when im at work, if i mess up one bit, and that means, have an off tone, or fall asleep at the wrong time or anything, he gets upset and threatens to leave me and it happens every week, i cry and i want to kill myself, this relationship is toxic, i told him ill go crazy and run away and ill kms if he leaves, because i have nothing, i have no one and i have motivation for nothing, i don't care about working for money or anything, at this point i dont care anymore, i just want to give up and die, i dont even do drugs, i barely eat and when i do i want to throw it up immediately because i feel fat, and im too lazy to get up and do literally anything, the only happiness i get is when he gives me attention or when i watch tiktoks, other than that i feel so useless, we are planning to meet each other in vegas soon to fuck, and i told him he can do whatever he wants to me, and he's making me sign a contract for it and im fine with it all, the right thing to do would be to end it with him and focus on myself but i dont want to leave him, because i still love him, and if i did leave him i dont think ill be okay, i already want to die, and no one else checks up on me, i have gone a week without any interaction but just him and i couldve been dead, i hate having this much self pity because who cares, i dont even care, should i even reach out for help and do something about this or should i just suck it up and continue, i dont see a future ahead of me, and i would go out and have fun like i used to but all my friends are gone and drugs dont make me happy anymore, ill just think about him and get emotional and cry, then im all alone, i just have so much self hate, i hate the way i look the way i talk, im boring and i have no personality, i should work on myself but i have absolutely no motivation at all, i want to die thats all, maybe this is natural selection, the weak ones always die off if they cant make it in life, im weak and i get in the way of everything, i feel like it would be better if i killed myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qfy497/im_18_and_in_love_with_a_35_year_old/",
