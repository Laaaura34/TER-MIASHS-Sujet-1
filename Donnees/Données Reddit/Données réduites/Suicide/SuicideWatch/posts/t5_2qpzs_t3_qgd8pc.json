Won't get into the nitty gritty but obviously she carries an enormous amount of trauma.\n\nShe has severe depression, been very suicidal (and still has urges), gets some manic episodes (I suspect she has bipolar disorder, but what do I know) and self harms. \n\nWhat she told me today really fucked me up though. She told me that she hasn't felt a modicum of happiness since she was 5 years old. It's a distant and foreign concept for her. \n\nI wanted to tell her that there's hope, and that if she works through her trauma she could lead a normal and happy life. I couldn't though, because I have no idea whether that's remotely true. All I could do was listen. I'm convinced that she could better her mental state and mitigate the damages through therapy, but maybe her head has been shaken hard enough by the trauma that there's no way of reaching any point resembling normalcy. \n\nI guess my question is: can I tell her that there is hope for her to be happy? Would that be a lie, and if so, would it be a productive lie? Is just listening and encouraging her to continue therapy the best I can do?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qgd8pc/is_there_hope_for_happiness_when_someone_has_been/", "title": "Is there hope for happiness when someone has been severely depressed since early childhood?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DepFreThrAwa", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635274039, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qgd8pc/is_there_hope_for_happiness_when_someone_has_been/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422897.3037322, "replies_charged": false}
