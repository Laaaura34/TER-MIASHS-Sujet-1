I have always been depressed, but the non stop suicidal ideation over the last 6 months has been intense.  I've spent days researching the best gas for an exit bag and what materials I might need.  When I pick up my son from school I stare at the roof and wonder if it is high enough to end a life or if I would just be permanently disabled.  When I stand in line waiting for him to come out, I lean my face against the brick wall and think about bashing my head into the bricks over and over until my brain is exposed.  When I am making sandwiches, I think about turning the knife around and stabbing myself in the neck.  When I am in a rocking chair, I think about if the ceiling fan can support my weight.  When it is dark on my busy road, I think about running out of my house and jumping in front of a truck.  I love hiking but I have stopped as my impulsive jump reflex freaks me out.  I basically enter every new situation with a 'how would I kill myself here\" thought.  I am constantly imagining myself killing myself.  The steps I would take, the final 'fuck it' push to make the final move.  I can not shut off these thoughts.  I have tried therapy but every therapist I have seems incompetent and I am sick of having to spend energy speaking to someone.  I don't want to fucking journal or whatever other BS they tell me to do for 'homework'.  I thought about a psychiatrist but I can't get an appt for the life of me.  I call when I feel like I am in crisis and they don't have appts for four months.  My kids are my purpose but I suck as a mom.  I am short tempered and stressed and anxious.  I have weird tics like manic, rapid speech when I lose patience and it scares them.  More exposure to me is only going to turn into behavior problems for them.  They are great with their dad who is normal and patient.  I don't want to die.  I just don't know how to stop the non stop fantasizing, time sucking research, anxiety, stress, and shitty behaviors that scare my kids.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qc7g8e/non_stop_intrusive_thoughts/", "title": "Non Stop Intrusive Thoughts", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwaway__789789", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634754388, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qc7g8e/non_stop_intrusive_thoughts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425275.7461004, "replies_charged": false}
