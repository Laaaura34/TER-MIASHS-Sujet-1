It\u2019s kinda been building up in the back of my head for a while and I\u2019m dealing with a lot of stress with both my personal life and with school stuff (e.g. exams and failing classes) and it only really hit big last night. For the first time I really wanted to commit suicide and I immediately started crying for a bout an hour. All day I\u2019ve been thinking about suicide and I\u2019ll occasionally have these huge mood swings from being alright and chatting with my friends one minute then five minutes later I\u2019ll be sitting in silence trying not to cry. I\u2019m constantly dealing with intrusive thoughts and they\u2019re harder to ignore when no ones around to distract me. I\u2019m finding difficult to talk to my friends about it because we\u2019re all guys, and I know that sounds dumb but that\u2019s just how guys act, we don\u2019t talk about or feelings. Sorry if this was a bit too long but I haven\u2019t told anyone how I\u2019m feeling and it\u2019s tough dealing with this alone, I just really needed to vent.
