When I was in my last year of high school I bungled a (if I do say so myself, really well thought out) suicide plan by having a panic attack and giving in to the burning need to know what would *actually* happen if I told my father. He took me to the hospital and they kept me for a few hours and then spat me out at 2am to go home and come back to their shitty homophobic outpatient program where they didn\u2019t even listen to me and wouldn\u2019t put me on the dose of meds my GP had asked. They didn\u2019t take me seriously because I\u2019m a guy and that clearly means that if I had *real* mental health issues my suicide attempt would have been successful, and the fact that I\u2019ve permanently scarred my arms and my legs with the extent of my multiple-times-daily harming meant nothing to them. \n\nNow I\u2019m an adult and I just feel there\u2019s no point. I finally got diagnosed with bipolar (2) and PTSD because I\u2019m a plain but spicy bitch like that. I narrowly escaped an involuntary hospitalisation year before last, and I\u2019m wishing that my new psych would just... maybe step in and do the same. I feel like where I live a voluntary hospitalisation doesn\u2019t mean anything, they\u2019ll just send me home again, they did the same when my sister presented last year, just gave her some Valium and sent her home when she was ready. \n\nI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to make a successful attempt just yet (not because I want to live but because I\u2019m still responsible to my partner and pets) but I\u2019ve always been fixated on this idea of \u2018proof\u2019, that my self harming is me proving to myself that it\u2019s real, and I feel that since I fucked it up last time and it didn\u2019t really count I just need to prove to myself that this *is* serious, that I\u2019m *not* just being a drama queen, and that I really am feeling what I\u2019m feeling. My partner is always so upset when I confess I\u2019ve cut again to him, and I haven\u2019t told him tonight yet that I did it again, and properly this time. \n\nI don\u2019t know. I just... wish I could end up in hospital for a day or two, just to give my brain time to finally accept that I really am mentally ill and suicidal, and that I\u2019m not just making mountains out of molehills.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nmsqyi/i_want_to_be_able_to_trust_myself/", "title": "I want to be able to trust myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "blackrussianterrier2", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622188731, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nmsqyi/i_want_to_be_able_to_trust_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428109.2985814, "replies_charged": false}
