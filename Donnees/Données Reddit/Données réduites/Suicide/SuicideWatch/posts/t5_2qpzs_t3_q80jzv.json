Everywhere I go it seems like I can't go 5 minutes without seeing someone online or on this website telling me that I'm mentally ill or that I should kill myself. They make fun of my looks, my life, even using the bathroom causes someone to freak out. I'm tired of having to tell people that I'm a human being with feelings and wants, not a monster that preys on children. I don't care about censorship or cancelling anyone, I just want to live like anyone else without being ripped on all the time.
