I\u2019m not even actively suicidal right now, but I consider it often enough for me to realize that I\u2019m one of the outliers in society. So, over the years suicide has become more and more realistic, and has almost become a part of my daily life.\n\nWhat gets me though is how that\u2019s *totally* not the case for everyone else. If you mention suicide, people either freak out or just play it off as a joke as if the concept of \u201csuicide\u201d only exists in movies and books. And while it is sad, I actually find that kind of funny.\n\nFor example, I hate working. I fucking hate getting up early to sit at a desk doing shit I don\u2019t want to do for 8 hours straight. But if I tell anyone about that feeling, guess how the conversation will go?\n\nMe: man, I really don\u2019t want a job. I wish I could just sit around doing nothing all day.\n\nThem: well you need money, don\u2019t you?\n\nMe: yeah but I don\u2019t want to get a job.\n\nThem: tough, that\u2019s the way the world works, you lazy fuck. You\u2019ve gotta work if you wanna live.\n\nMe: well technically I don\u2019t *have* to, because i could just kill myself and not have to deal with it.\n\nThem: seriously? You\u2019d rather commit suicide than get a job? That\u2019s pathetic.\n\nMe: yep, I\u2019m pathetic. Thanks for reminding me, that\u2019s another reason why I should just kill myself.\n\nThem: wait, you\u2019re serious? Nooooo don\u2019t kill yourself you\u2019re loved and you have so much to live for!!!!\n\nI just find it funny that people don\u2019t consider how all of this bullshit could just stop immediately If I put a gun in my mouth. They\u2019re like \u201cif you don\u2019t want to live by the world\u2019s rules, you don\u2019t get to live at all >:(\u201c\n\nBut when I decide \u201cyeah that sounds fair enough, guess I\u2019ll just off myself then :)\u201d their tune changes and they can\u2019t fathom that anyone would choose to not live in this vicious cycle of suffering and guilt.\n\nOf course I can\u2019t say any of this shit in real life, because I don\u2019t think this attitude helps in the slightest. It\u2019s nice to think and rant about online, but if I started telling people how I really feel I\u2019d get thrown back into the psych ward. Or worse, people I care about would get tired of my moping around and they\u2019d cut me off, and then I\u2019d *have* to go through with it.\n\nEverything\u2019s fucked, and the only *\u201dreal\u201d* solution I can come up with is just opting out of life. And if I bring it up before actually going through with it, I can only expect to be mocked or bombarded with insincere attempts at \u201chelping\u201d.\n\nIsn\u2019t life fantastic? :D", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pekr41/i_find_it_kinda_funny_that_normal_people_see/", "title": "I find it kinda funny that \u201cnormal\u201d people see suicide as unimaginable or something that you\u2019d \u201cnever do\u201d.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "JarJarJacobs", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 863, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630338513, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pekr41/i_find_it_kinda_funny_that_normal_people_see/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635421088.0030036, "replies_charged": false}
