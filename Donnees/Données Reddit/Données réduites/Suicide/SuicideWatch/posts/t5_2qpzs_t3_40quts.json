An animal lover, compulsive flosser, botany enthusiast, artist, functional alcoholic, compulsive liar.\n \nI don't have any parents. I don't have any friends. I have people with whom I spend time, people who I go to bars with and commiserate over little gripes... but no one I would expect to pick me up at the airport or watch the Superbowl with.\n\nA month ago I was dumped by a man who admitted he began dating me because he was bored. I don't miss him and I'm under no illusion that he is anything more than a child. I've survived a lot worse than him. However, lately I've been feeling *unsafe* in a way that I am not coping with.\n\nI put myself out on a financial limb and he bailed. Now I need to make major changes to my living situation and I just can't seem to muster the wherewithal to do it.\n\nEver since I was a preteen I've had suicidal thoughts. Every day. Almost. When I was 15 I thought it would be a service to the world if I killed my abusive mother, and killing myself was part of the plan. When I was 18 I longed to drive into oncoming traffic. And now here I am... \n\nIt feels like I've been depleted of my all my energy. I'm too young for that, I know it, and it just makes me hate myself more for not being more resilient. In the past 5 years I've buried 4 relatives, been the victim of domestic abuse, ended a wonderful relationship for a piss poor reason, caused a lot of heartache, and failed to make any progress in my life that isn't superficial.\n\nPeople think I'm warm and safe, too. Recently I had to deal with an older woman in a professional setting. She was in her late 40's, typical coked up corporate lady with hair one treatment away from giving up. During our conversation she ended up confiding in me that she'd been depressed, she cried, told me she'd been wanting to slit her throat. We talked for an hour and she thanked me. Anther guy I dealt with, a father of three, told me that I was a ray of sunshine and a real pleasure to meet... the same morning that I'd been dumped by the aforementioned boyfriend.\n\nI don't get it.\n\nI just don't want to wake up anymore. I don't have the energy to aggressively attack the problems in my life, but my situation is completely insolvent and I literally can't afford to not take action.\n\nTonight I got trashed, punched solid wood until my hands were messed up, and now I'm posting to a suicide watch board.
