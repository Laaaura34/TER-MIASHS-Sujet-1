I'm incapable of doing anything because my inner monologue spends 20 hours a day telling me that I'm worthless. My mind is an incoherent mess that can't produce anthing but chaos and suicidal thoughts.\n\nMy mood changes in no time. For a moment I feel enlightened and able to analyze my problems. The next moment I fold in on myself and become incapable of the smallest task. The trouble is that my torpor extends itself over several days or even weeks, but my moments of clarity rarely exceed a few hours.\n\nI can't keep my room clean, I can't keep the rest of my apartment clean. Every activity turns into unbearable pain thanks to what I think is OCD.\n\nI have severe body dismorphia and hate my appearance. I feel like I'm in a foreign body every time I see myself in the mirror or in a picture.\n\nI need to find a job but all that's on my mind is suicide. I can get interviews or even get employed but sooner or later I collapse back on myself and go back to nothing.\n\nI used to be scared of death but now I'm ready to embrace it. The only reasons I'm still alive is because I have loving parents and I can't bring myself to end it all because of the pain it would cause to them.
