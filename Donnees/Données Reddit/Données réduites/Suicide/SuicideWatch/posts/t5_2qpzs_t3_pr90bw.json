I noticed once or twice a day I get overwhelmed by suicidal ideation. I'm not even sure if I'm suicidal but I just can't stop thinking about self-harm or commiting myself.\n\nI normally call the crisis hotline but I feel like I should go to the hospital. I don't know why the hospital helps me. Maybe because I'm in a new environment? It's a Safe Haven.\n\nToo bad I can't use my phone there in the Psych Ward.\n\nI hate going to the hospital everytime but everyday this week I have experienced suicidal mood swings.  \n\nIt always happens randomly! I have no triggers either. I just breakdown while minding my own business. \n\nI noticed this normally happens when I feel bored and understimulated.\n\nIs there a term or word for this? How do I better express this to my therapist?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pr90bw/suicidal_mood_swings/", "title": "Suicidal Mood Swings", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "No-Base8204", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632061863, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pr90bw/suicidal_mood_swings/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427605.7274954, "replies_charged": false}
