But living like this I can\u2019t get over the feeling that I\u2019ll die, and I won\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care enough to remember my meds, I don\u2019t care enough to avoid stairwells at times when my seizures are most likely. I barely remember to feed myself (I\u2019m medically underweight, and honestly after being told to gain weight I think I\u2019m developing anorexia in rebuttal). \n\nI thought hard about therapy again (I\u2019ve been before many times) but nothing can help me get over the constant feeling and temptation of knowing I have such an easy and painless way out. \n\nI have tried it before and I was on a sofa so no harm caused that time, but if I attempt it again I know what time and where about I should be prior to the attempt. I\u2019m almost scared I\u2019ll be successful but also glad I know how ITLL feel as I\u2019ve been there before nd I know how painless and numbing seizures feel to me. The perfect way out. \n\nHelp?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/p947ze/help_me_epilepsy_depression_easy_suicide/", "title": "Help me?
