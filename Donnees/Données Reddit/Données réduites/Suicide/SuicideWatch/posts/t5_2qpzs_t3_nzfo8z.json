At some point though, towards the end of my shift my emotions just took a dip for the worst and every thing I hate about myself, all my anxiety, all my insecurities, everything just kind of popped in my head at once. I let out little cry\u2019s for help, told my buddy in a joking manner \u201chey I really hope I wake up tomorrow\u201d ( we have a pretty fucked up sense of humor so jokes like this come and go a lot) sadly sometimes the jokes are jokes and sometimes I actually mean them. I also told him how I hate my life, this job and how things would be easier if I wasn\u2019t alive, he said that\u2019s not true and I said yeah it is and then we went along to another conversation. I leave my job on a delivery feeling miserable, the whole drive I couldn\u2019t help but think about crashing my car, at the very least I end up in the hospital and have an excuse to not do anything for a couple of days and worst case scenario I\u2019m dead and I\u2019ll have a permanent solution to my seemingly permanent problems. I don\u2019t necessarily want to die, I know my family would be devastated if I died, I know my actions could affect some one else\u2019s life and I don\u2019t wanna live with that guilt. But I feel so numb, throughout the drive I wanted to cry I could feel the tears well up inside of me but they never came, I used to be so good at crying, I\u2019ve cried rivers in my life and for some reason I just couldn\u2019t seem to do it, I want to cry so bad. I have a loving family, friends that would be there for me at a moments notice and yet I feel lonely. Throughout all this I\u2019m thinking about calling the suicide hotline, going back and forth in my head about whether I should or not, never really seriously considered calling them before but it was something that was on my mind for a couple of hours so it seemed like the right choice, especially since today, it really felt like something was gonna give. I get home leave my stuff in the car to go take a piss ( cause I didn\u2019t wanna talk to someone on the phone with a full bladder) hop back in the car and call them, chest pounding cause of my shitty social anxiety. First automated robot and then someone answers, they ask three questions are you having suicidal thoughts (yes I answer, have you ever tried to commit suicide before (no I answer, do you have plan to kill yourself today (no not necessarily and then they say could please give us a call in about 10 minutes I have a really important call to pick up, I say yeah ok and then that\u2019s it. I was fairly shocked by what happened and couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing, for a split second I feel shitty and worthless, like my problems are once again not important and that actually going to someone about my issues is not worth my time and i should just try to deal with everything myself but, then I realize I made the phone call, for once in my life I\u2019m making a legitimate attempt to talk about my problems (even though it didn\u2019t ended up how I thought it would). I\u2019m doing something that for some reason takes so much effort for myself to do and attempting to follow through with it. The call didn\u2019t go how I thought it would but, overall for today, what ended up happening helped me. For all I know tomorrow will be worse, for all I know my self proclaimed expiration date may still come to fruition but for today I think I\u2019ll be alright.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nzfo8z/i_called_the_suicide_prevention_hotline_and_was/", "title": "I called the suicide prevention hotline and was told to call back but weirdly enough I feel better", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "droptoocuh", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623648998, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/nzfo8z/i_called_the_suicide_prevention_hotline_and_was/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427834.5413685, "replies_charged": false}
