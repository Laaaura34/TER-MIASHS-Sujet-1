It escalated to a point where I scratched my neck with my fingernails so badly that it still has deep crimson marks all over it. I said them that I just want to die, and my mom put a knife down to the kitchen counter, and said \u201cdo it then.\u201d And I guess I lost it, cause I actually got up, and started making my way towards it, but my sister grabbed my hands and screamed at me.  \n\nMaybe this sounds twisted and weird, but in those moments when I want to do it, I want to make my family, (and ex-friends and exes, but that\u2019s an other story) suffer. Feel a pain similar to mine, cause I feel like I lost them already, but in life, not death. When I picture them mourning me, I feel kind of good? Validated? Cared for and loved, which I\u2019m not right now? \n\nCause I feel like they all hate me. Like I\u2019m just a big f*cking problem. Just an awful person. And maybe they want me gone.\n\nBut am I wanna be gone when I put aside everything?\n\nNo. Or at least, I don\u2019t think so. I mean, I booked an appointment to a psychiatrist later today.
