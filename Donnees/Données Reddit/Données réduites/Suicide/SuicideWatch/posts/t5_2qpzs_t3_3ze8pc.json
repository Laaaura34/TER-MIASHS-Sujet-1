Honestly, I don't even know where to begin with explaining the shit going on. \n\nI'm finally 18. \n\nI have a decent job with the best colleagues EVER. \n\nI'm going to school again next year (although I don't have the foggiest where and if I'm gonna like what I chose). \n\nI will be leaving this goddamn house and thus my goddamn parents.\n\nI got rid of my boyfriend and yes, that makes me happier than ever.\n\nYet still, every time I walk out of the doors from my job I think \"It's time. Let's pick the right method.\" \n\nOne of my colleagues who I almost see as the sister I never had (although I have two sisters) knows about my *past* of depression/suicidal behavior/selfharm/everything. I want to talk to her. A couple of times I was on the verge of telling her about how I feel recently, but every time it ended up getting so busy that we couldn't talk. \nShe works untill 2 PM today. I want to go there at 2 and ask her if she has time. No idea what I want to achieve by talking to her, maybe just someone who knows and who might be there to tell me what to do. The reason I haven't yet is my fear of refusal. What if she doesn't have time? Or she thinks it's stupid I tell her? I have no idea. \n\nWoo-fucking-hoo. That was my rant. Might as well just.. die. :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3ze8pc/my_life_got_so_much_better_yet_i_am_closer_to/", "title": "My life got so much better, yet I am closer to suicide than ever.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Virion_Silvyr", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1451902378, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3ze8pc/my_life_got_so_much_better_yet_i_am_closer_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635425264.398318, "replies_charged": false}
