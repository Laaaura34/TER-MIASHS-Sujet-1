Barely made it through school, never was able to memorize my tables to this day. Then somehow passed high school. While suffering two backlogs every semester in engineering, I made myself a promise : I'll get through this bullshit somehow, get a job and get prescribed, since my parents won't believe in and pay for mental help.\n\nSo I put up with four years of misery, barely graduate, get a job and visit a Psychiatrist.\n\nThis asshole tells me ADHD is when others are disrupted by your presence. When teachers complain about the restless noisy kid in class. Since I was able to graduate, I don't have ADHD. I just need counselling. I need to learn to organize myself. \n\nYeah as if I already haven't tried that. I use a hundred different apps and hundreds of reminders for everything. Todoist, Notion, Evernote, Notability, you name it I have it. As if reading a David Goggins book is going to restore my brain chemistry back to normal.\n\nI told him just one month into my job I already feel like quitting it. I was entertained by the novelty. But then was quickly bored when routine set in. Told him how I feel like pacing rooms and banging my head against the walls just to feel something. I'm so bored by everything. Nothing is new or exciting anymore. Not instagram , not reddit , not YouTube, not Chess , not Football. My unmedicated brain just lives in the constant state of boredom. \n\nHe prescribed me some expensive bullshit nootropic (L Carnosine) which has something to do with proteins and bodybuilding somehow.\n\nMental Health is a fucking joke in my country.  It is considered to be a first world problem. Every ADD medication is outright banned except Methylphenidate. That too you have to get the prescription renewed every month spending your earnings and time. I guess just killing myself is much easier than getting help. \n\nGuess I'll have to become a part of the first world to treat my first world problem. My only option is to study for GRE and TOEFL and go to the US , get a summer internship and then go to a psychiatrist there. That's going to be another year and half of me hanging by the threads, clinging to life, to somehow find relief. Or... You know - there's always that option.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pocqi3/when_killing_myself_is_much_easier_than_seeking/", "title": "When killing myself is much easier than seeking mental help", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Yash_Introversy", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631656978, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pocqi3/when_killing_myself_is_much_easier_than_seeking/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427016.1858675, "replies_charged": false}
