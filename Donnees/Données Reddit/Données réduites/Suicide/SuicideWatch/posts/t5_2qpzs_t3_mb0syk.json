I fucking chose this life. I left my toxic parents to marry a toxic wife to have three kids and pass on the generational trauma. Back then I thought creating my own family would fix me. I didnt see how broken I already was. I didnt see how broken my wife was. 14 years later and I am wondering how I have managed to still be alive.\nAt daytime I need all mental energy to mask my symptoms long enough to be able to make money to provide for my family. Had inpatient treatment for CPTSD multiple times now and feel it did have an effect. But my depression and anxiety seems to get worse. I cant cope with this fucking life anymore. I just wanna sleep!\nFucking insomnia", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mb0syk/suicidal_insomniac/", "title": "Suicidal insomniac", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "HarveyBrichtAus", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616455245, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mb0syk/suicidal_insomniac/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428049.2941003, "replies_charged": false}
