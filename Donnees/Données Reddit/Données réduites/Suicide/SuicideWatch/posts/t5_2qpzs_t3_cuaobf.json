I am humble, I do not claim to be perfect, I do not have all of the answers to the questions that you seek. I can not heal you, how could I when I am but half a man. I have never claimed to be a saint, nor a sinner, that is not for me to judge. In this world, choose your allies and those you let close carefully, because no matter how much it may hurt to hear, it is the ones closest which shall betray you in the bitter end. So ask your melancholy question, for there shan't be an answer, we all walk alone, we shall only hope to spend a fraction of time with a loved one, for in this cold life we endure, silently screaming in agony, all of these profound losses, for loss is as much a part of ourselves as happiness is. So, now walk your life bearing this in mind, don't live for materialistic possessions, but rather how will you change the world, for in the lonely end, everyone dies alone, with only their thoughts to comfort them, only leaving their stories behind\n\n-nfwitt", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cuaobf/poem_of_life/", "title": "Poem of Life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "nfwitt", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1566546500, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cuaobf/poem_of_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427568.1366274, "replies_charged": false}
