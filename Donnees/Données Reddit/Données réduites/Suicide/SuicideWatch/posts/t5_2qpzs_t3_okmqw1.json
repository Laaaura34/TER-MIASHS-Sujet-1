My mind is a wasteland. I feel like a waste of space . So low vibration. Dead and dark inside yet still around and moving. I feel like I sold my soul and got nothing in return. My heart is dead and smothered in darkness. I question is this even all worth it. Why is this existence so cruel. Or maybe I completely deserve this. Maybe I'm a failed creation. I feel worn out. Why do I continue this fight. I'm not even mad at anyone or anything anymore. I just feel so distraught from this life I have lived. I don't want to die but I really want to rest. Everywhere I go people ask me If I'm ok and if i'm just tired. I'm tired of telling everyone I'm tired. I'm dying inside and nobody can help. Even if I tried to kill myself i wouldn't know what to do. I'm just stuck", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/okmqw1/20yo_thinking_about_suicide_getting_things_off_my/", "title": "20yo thinking about suicide.
