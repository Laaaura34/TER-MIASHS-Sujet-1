I suffered from some terrible depression some time ago. It peaks it's head up time and time again. Occasional suicidal ideation. \n\nI'm sitting on the floor, looking out the window, thinking about what contentment means- the freedom we have to be content:\n\nIt's your life. Only yours. The freedom you have- truly you can do anything at anytime- is incredible. \n\nThey try to deny us freedom psychologically- we are bombarded with adverts for expensive things, lack of money being presented as a barrier against our freedom to be happy. \n\nLikewise, thanks to social media, we are taught that we need the approval of other people to be happy, that we need a romantic partner to be happy. \n\nThese are socially/ psychologically constructed walls, that attempt to prevent us from being happy.  Poison. \n\nWith a degree of mindfulness, clarity, awareness- choice- I believe it can be possible to be happy just sitting, looking out the window. I know this probably cannot apply to people to people who are suffering from grief or mental disorders, but for people like myself, at a point in life where cynicism and feeling miserable are the most dominant of emotions, maybe these thoughts will help. I hope they do.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ac2w8o/thoughts_and_ruminations/", "title": "Thoughts And Ruminations", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "whistlepoo", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1546496803, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ac2w8o/thoughts_and_ruminations/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428008.0477335, "replies_charged": false}
