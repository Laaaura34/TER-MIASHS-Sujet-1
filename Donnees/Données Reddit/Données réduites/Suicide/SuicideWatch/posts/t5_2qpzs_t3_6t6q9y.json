Every day is a struggle. It's only getting worse. Nothing is distracting me very well anymore. The only thing keeping me from trying to kill myself again is my lack of quick, painless options; despite that I am close to either jumping off a ~150ft bridge, getting drunk and cutting myself, or getting drunk and taking bottles of Tylenol cus apparently that fucking works.\n\nWhy do people look down on suicide as an option? Everyone dies eventually. Why try and force someone to be so utterly miserable their whole life? It's fucking torture. I just want this to be over. Nothing helps. Been in therapy over a year and it helps on the day of or something but my life as a whole is still a massive suicidal crisis. Why even bother. It's been 2 years since I've tried to kill myself but I don't see a point in trying to stay strong anymore...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/6t6q9y/so_alone_no_one_cares_why_do_i_even_hold_on/", "title": "So alone.
