Instead of getting better,  my grief seems to be getting even worse now. The pain of being without her is so unbearable I feel like my head is going to explode sometimes, I miss her so much every second. Sometimes I still get a huge shock when it hits me again that she's really gone. Today I felt so full of rage all day and I ended up hurting myself. I was scared as I felt I couldn't control my anger. I'm feeling misunderstood and let down,  paranoid about friends and remaining family. I have no motivation for anything since she left,  I feel empty inside, lost,  lonely (so lonely) and hopeless. Yet, I'm scared to die..I'm scared to live too.. what do I do,  I'm stuck in limbo. I'm seeing a grief counsellor weekly but nothing can really help me with this. I don't know why I'm posting this as I know no one can help me,  as no one can bring back my mum..I guess I'm just venting.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q7md6j/i_dont_want_to_die_but_i_dont_want_to_live/", "title": "I don't want to die but I don't want to live without my mum anymore either, stuck in limbo..", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "RoseQuartz1111", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634164428, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q7md6j/i_dont_want_to_die_but_i_dont_want_to_live/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426869.0444071, "replies_charged": false}
