I'm 20 years old living with my parents without a license or car, I work a dead end job I'm too afraid to quit, I have no talents and all I do anymore is play wow all day and feel sorry for myself. Today I pushed the last friend that gives a shit about me away over a stupid argument.\nOn top of all that bullshit is my mind telling me I should be a girl. I can't make up my mind because I'm indecisive and still hold the delusion I have a future as a male despite not seeing myself with a future at all. It's a constant war in my mind and I can't take it anymore. I want to be a girl but I don't want to be seen as a disgusting tranny. There isn't anything for me in this life, all i do is suffer and get pushed around. I'm really at the end of my fucking rope.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hbg42i/i_am_a_bad_day_away_from_ending_this_shit/", "title": "I am a bad day away from ending this shit", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "movies-like-juno", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1592492060, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hbg42i/i_am_a_bad_day_away_from_ending_this_shit/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426661.2756596, "replies_charged": false}
