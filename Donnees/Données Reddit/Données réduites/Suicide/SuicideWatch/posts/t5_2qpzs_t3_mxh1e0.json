Everyone I reached out to, didn\u2019t respond aside one person.\n\n2. That one person didn\u2019t fully ease the situation but at least he tried.\n\n3. Mum will refuse to say I have an issue with me bc it\u2019s taboo in my Chinese household (fyi, my Dad died 4 yrs ago)\n\n4. The girl I love most is pretending to be out of reach after I reached out for help, this was one of 2 dealbreakers.\n\n5. I recently won a court case for something I didn\u2019t even do, but holy crap I have been severely damaged by this: physically, mentally, emotionally. I just lost all bearings in life. Lost 7kg in a week. Didn\u2019t have my old phone to inform people since the police had it... I got it back but I couldn\u2019t bear to read anything nor use it again.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to come here because I fear no one\u2019s here to help - it\u2019s been an issue for 8 years now. \n\nBut here I am, somebody help me please!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mxh1e0/this_will_be_my_9th_attempt_please_help_me/", "title": "This will be my 9th attempt; please help me.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DovidCohen", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619258957, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mxh1e0/this_will_be_my_9th_attempt_please_help_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428434.2851987, "replies_charged": false}
