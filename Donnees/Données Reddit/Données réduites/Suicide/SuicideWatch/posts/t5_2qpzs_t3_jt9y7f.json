I don't believe good people have enough leverage or influence on the world. People are not good to each other. We all walk around with our heads up our own asses, unaware of how we should treat each other. The problem is not exclusively me, though I have my flaws. I no longer desire to occupy the world that we live in, nor do I have any faith that it will get any better, the incentives are all fucked up. There are no consequences for the privileged, because we are all whores.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jt9y7f/im_spent/", "title": "I'm spent", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Heretic2288", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1605239047, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jt9y7f/im_spent/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427156.173786, "replies_charged": false}
