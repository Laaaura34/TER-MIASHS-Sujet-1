It was better than I expected it to be, but not something I'd really like to experience again.\n\nThe real problem came when I got home.\n\nMy parents aren't willing to pay for my psychiatrist or medicine anymore. They said it's on me now.\n\nLast time a had a job I had to quit because talking anyone made me incredibly anxious and so I'd get poor ratings, which would make my boss upset with me, and I'd go home and cut myself to try and deal with my problems. This has pretty much been the case with 3 jobs now, and my first job I had to quit because I couldn't preform the heavy lifting required to do the job.\n\nSo today I applied for SSI, basically saying that my depression and anxiety inhibit my ability to work and that I need money from the government to survive.\n\nI feel like my mental illness is not as worthy of the money compared to a physical illness or disability.\n\nIf I get denied I'm probably going to try killing myself again, because going even a day without my medicine gives me terrible withdraws that don't go away.\n\nThis post is kinda all over the place, and I apologize. I'm really just looking for someone who might be getting SSI for depression to share their experience with me I think.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bgt5sb/i_made_it_through_the_psych_ward_and_now_my/", "title": "I made it through the psych ward, and now my parents won't help me anymore.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "JonSmith4369", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1556103301, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bgt5sb/i_made_it_through_the_psych_ward_and_now_my/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426442.3510697, "replies_charged": false}
