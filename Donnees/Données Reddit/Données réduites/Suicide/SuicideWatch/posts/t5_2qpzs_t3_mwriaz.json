My worst fear of killing myself is that, no matter how I do it, it will fail to work in the end. I know no one gives a fuck about reading this, but I'm still a person who has so much to say. All of my confidence is gone, my boredom, my hopelessness, my happiness, any emotions for music are just fucking gone. Their is nothing left of my innocence because I let some fucking assholes get in my head and drain it all away. I know I'm cursing as if I'm angry, though unfortunately I'm not, I lost all of my anger too. I've felt real hopefulness, but it just doesn't make you a better person. I really just want to be ny old young self again. And that will never fucking happen. I just worry that their really might not be an afterlife, and that's what I really want now. For a child to want to grow up, is just so fucking unrealistic. The only reason I wanted to grow up as a kid, is because I wanted to be able to live alone, and no one would have to ever do anything for me. So I can feel like a real person, and be with the right people.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mwriaz/i_came_here_because_i_wouldnt_be_allowed_to_say/", "title": "I came here because I wouldn't be allowed to say this in any other community.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "09Nazlyblue", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 24, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619170398, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mwriaz/i_came_here_because_i_wouldnt_be_allowed_to_say/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427054.3766406, "replies_charged": false}
