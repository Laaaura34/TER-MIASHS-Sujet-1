My classmates from school started bullying me, I was so innocent at that time that I wasn't able to defend myself, I couldnt comprehend that people could be that mean to each other (they bullied my verbally and physically). This resulted in very stressful situations for years, Day Dreaming and Overthinking became an habit for me and I would torture myself at home doing this toxic habit, the bullies got into my mind. My grades got real bad and lead my family to start treating my like an idiot/stupid because of it and eventually my family got into the bully circle and i would also apply my toxic habit to them. Sometimes I would talk to my family about the bullies at school and they would just laugh and tell me to \"punch them in the face\" (which I never did because that was not going to solve anything) I was a 15 old boy that wanted to die, convinced myself that life would be miserable forever because I havent experience happy moments for the last 7 years.\n\nI was 16 when something clicked my mind, I realized that I was letting the bullies affect me way a lot. I started to smile more, being more kind to everyone despite them bullying me, I suffered a lot but I was able to see more people approaching me in a friendly way, puberty hit me like a truck and girls from and out of school started flirting me. In a blink of an eye, I graduated being the most popular guy on school without HURTING ANYONE.\n\nFor 4 years after graduation, I felt unstoppable, nothing would affect or hurt me, I was able to do whatever I wanted without feeling inhibited, I was starving for knowledge and achievements. College was great, almost the best student. Bullies got into drugs, working on shit places and hating their lives so karma got in the way. But what got worse was my family, they are all engineers, doctors, lawyers and I chose Filmmaking. They treated me like shit for that. a useless piece of shit. It was (and is) one of the things that hurt me the most, my family.\n\nIt all went dark again, the high demand of filmmakers and low payment in a third world country lead me to have a 24/7 busy lifestyle for a budget. I made a team of filmmakers, stress came back. My team got very toxic with me because only my videos would help us grow and get more clients (idk maybe they were jealous). That lead to me doing all of the videos and got a burnout. I decided to quit and be on my own, they got serious mad, it was so hard to just rip myself off of them, had so many stressful situations and fights with them, I was 21 and they were 26 and living off of me!. So much stress I had a cardiorespiratory arrest and then a comma in 2017. It all went dark again.\n\nAfter the incident I became super conscious about my feelings, the foundations I created that made me strong just vanished, I was back in highschool. 2020 and I havent found a way to be strong again, met very bad people this last years 3 years that made my suffet a lot i even had my first anxiety attack, my family havent changed. My mom died, my dad abandoned me when I was 7. Luckily I just have lots and lots of friends.\n\nI'm not suicidal now, I learnt that life has ups and downs and i'm conviced i will be happy again, or at least, motivated to be someone in this world. But i'm just exhausted and sad now. I feel nothing is worth the effort.\n\nThis Coronavirus Quarantine is making me dig deep in my emotions, feelings and memories. I realized that if I die today, I would only have lived 4 years of true happiness and joy, out of 24 years. This sucks.\n\nMy goals and motivation are gone. I'm in the worst burnout ever. I hate everything I do, i feel like a stupid worthless person.\n\nI just have one goal in mind: once I get my mom's heritage I will get the hell out of here and start a new life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ghcy0u/fought_my_entire_life_against_bad_people_and/", "title": "Fought my entire life against bad people and stress.
