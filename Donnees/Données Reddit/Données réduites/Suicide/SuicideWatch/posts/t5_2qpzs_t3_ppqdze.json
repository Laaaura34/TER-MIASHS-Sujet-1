Every time I got more and more in depth about my problem I was hit with generic lines like \u201cI understand it\u2019s hard but these things take time\u201d or stuff along those lines. I mean no disrespect by this because I know being on the other end of someone struggling is arguably harder than the actual suffering of the person but idk I just don\u2019t even know what to do with my life anymore. If there was a painless way to go out that I knew of I\u2019m sure I would\u2019ve done it already. Why does life have to be so hard? I want to live, be happy, and just enjoy life but it\u2019s like everything is preventing me from doing so. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll even make it to my 20th birthday in October. Worst comes to worst I cash out some of my long term stock money (no point in having long term holdings if I don\u2019t intend on being around to see where they go) and just buy something that can do the trick with the pull of a trigger.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ppqdze/suicide_prevention_hotline/", "title": "Suicide Prevention Hotline", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "silkdashokka", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631841554, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ppqdze/suicide_prevention_hotline/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427812.7256382, "replies_charged": false}
