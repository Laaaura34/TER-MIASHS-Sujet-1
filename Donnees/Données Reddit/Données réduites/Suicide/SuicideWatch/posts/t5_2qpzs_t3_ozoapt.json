Even if my situation got better, I still don't see why I should continue to live.\n\nSomedays I feel guilty for having these thoughts as I see people in much worse situation who continue to live their life despite all the struggles they face. \n\nI have been nothing but a burden to my parents and society. I have no plans, I've no ambitions, I've no interests and I've no friends. I just get up, go to my shitty job, come back home, eat, sleep, repeat. My life is filled with nothing but boredom and suicidal thoughts but unfortunately I don't have the courage to kill myself\n\nI wish I could donate my life to someone who really needs it and can put a good use to it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ozoapt/i_want_to_donate_my_life_to_someone_that_needs_it/", "title": "I want to donate my life to someone that needs it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "72proudvirgins", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628318330, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ozoapt/i_want_to_donate_my_life_to_someone_that_needs_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427033.40954, "replies_charged": false}
