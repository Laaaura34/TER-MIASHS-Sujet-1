But I also vaguely like the thought of trying and not actually dying. Would it be somehow cathartic to do something that almost definitely won't kill me but feels like I'm killing myself just to see if I'd do it? I used to live in a place where I could just off the building, but now my only real option is to take a bunch of pills. I collected a bunch of pills from around my house and have them in my room. I have a glass of water rn. I could take them. I don't think I want to die right now. Idk. Every single day feels exactly the same. Last time I made a real plan to do it, it felt final. That day I felt that feeling of *today, today, today* (I never actually attempted). I feel like I'm just waiting for something to happen, for a day to feel different from the others so I can feel that feeling of finality, and just come upstairs and take all these pills. I guess if I actually wanted to do it, I would have stopped trying to do my schoolwork by now. I'm so scared of attempting and not dying. It would make everything so much shittier.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/olwyn8/risk_of_not_dying_is_the_main_thing_stopping_me/", "title": "Risk of Not dying is the main thing stopping me", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mars_was_here", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 23, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626494323, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/olwyn8/risk_of_not_dying_is_the_main_thing_stopping_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427903.5281637, "replies_charged": false}
