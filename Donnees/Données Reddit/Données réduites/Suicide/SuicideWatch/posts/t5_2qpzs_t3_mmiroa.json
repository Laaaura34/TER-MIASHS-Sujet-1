I have a family that loves me and has a good financial condition, I can't help feeling guilty about this feeling of wanting to die. I don't know the real world problems I'm a teenager, I never had a reason to feel this way, so why do I feel? I just wanted some reason to live, but not even my most hopeful dreams seem to be worth the sacrifice. I've tried to kill myself before and nothing has changed. the years go by and nothing changes, the pain doesn't change. I just want to end it all.\n\n I know I'm suspicious to talk but don't kill yourself, maybe you have a reason to live and you don't know yet. i know i don't have.\n\nif you want to talk to me by email: [ligiazacha@gmail.com](mailto:ligiazacha@gmail.com), we can try to find a reason for you to live, and who knows my reason for living is not to help you \n\n&#x200B;\n\nkisses, lygia\n\nI hope the best for you", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mmiroa/i_dont_even_know_if_im_going_to_post_this/", "title": "I don't even know if I'm going to post this", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Friendship-Fragrant", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617851601, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mmiroa/i_dont_even_know_if_im_going_to_post_this/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428263.1062832, "replies_charged": false}
