I had some unresolved childhood trauma that lead to a lot of problems. I self harmed from the age of 11-18. I\u2019ve been clean for almost seven years now and it\u2019s started to creep it\u2019s way back into my daily thoughts. I can be driving down the road and I\u2019ll have violent visual flashes of me dragging a blade through my skin, down the road not across the street. I don\u2019t even want to hurt myself anymore cause it wouldn\u2019t be worth it. It wouldn\u2019t be like it used to be where I could hide it under my sleeves and have no one worry. No, now I have a life and a profession and a beautiful girlfriend who wouldn\u2019t be able to handle me like that\u2026.\n\nEven when I\u2019m smiling, even when I\u2019ve just woken up and the world hasn\u2019t had a chance to make me sad yet, I wake up with this heavy feeling in my body. I feel like I haven\u2019t been able to truly feel joy without having to worry about the feeling disappearing from the slightest inconvenience or rejection. I smile through all of it but I swear everything is coated in a thick grey lens. It all feels pointless but I don\u2019t have the guts to end it all. \n\nI just wish the intrusive thoughts would stop. I wish I could stop being so sensitive to every possible bit of rejection. I\u2019m so tired of trying to be happy. I\u2019m so tired of living. I wish I could just shoot my self. Death has to be better than feeling like this all the time.
