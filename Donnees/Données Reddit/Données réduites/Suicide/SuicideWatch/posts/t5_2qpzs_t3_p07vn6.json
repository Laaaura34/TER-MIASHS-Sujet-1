My anxiety was at an all time high n I just felt so weighed down and suffocating. First I took my gun unloaded it pressed the barrel to my head and pulled the triggered multiple times to build up my confidence for the real thing . I repeated this over n over . Then I thought what a mess it would be even if I could do it didn\u2019t want my family or anyone to have to suffer seeing the graphic aftermath .
