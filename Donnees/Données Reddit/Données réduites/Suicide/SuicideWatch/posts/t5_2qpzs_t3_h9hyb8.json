My friend A (28F), my other friend B (28F) and I (29F) have been friends for around 14/16 years respectively. We're all Asians. A comes from a toxic conservative family that has regularly berated, insulted, threatened and mistreated her. As a result of which A suffers from low esteem, is very quiet and needs a lot of external validation. A has also fallen for extremely wrong men in the past and at our age, she is constantly pressurised into getting married. B and B's mother once had a talk with A and her parents because her first boyfriend threatened to leak photos of her and A's parents were very angry at her. This happened 8 years ago.\n\nA and B lost contact for around 3 years in the middle and weren't involved in each other's lives. In that time period, A was forced to go to the US for a course she did not want to do by parents, because her other option was to get married. \n\nFast forward to now, B is back into our lives and we all chat frequently over the phone (all three of us are in different countries). Since the past two years, A has made an effort to lose weight (another guy insulted her body after being intimate with her), moved to a different city, made a new friend group and become a little more engaging. She's also (supposedly) gotten therapy. \n\nThe thing is that even with therapy, there have been days where she says she's close to suicide. In the beginning we would go frantic and sometimes call her continuously for days, only to be told that she had forgotten to tell us later on that she was fine.\n\nHer relationship with her parents is portrayed as a dumpster fire. For example, she once told us that her father was quitting his job abroad and coming back to live with her because they had a deadline to get her married by her 28th birthday because now that she was living alone in a different city she was a 'loose woman'. We told her (as we have for 10+ years) that her parents are abusive and she needs to distance herself from them and she agrees and two weeks later she cries about them not supporting her and understanding her when she went to them for support. If it was a one time thing, I could get it, but this has been happening all her life and we're always surprised. There's a big hole of important information in her stories, she'll tell us inconsequential things like how lipsticks are important and she loves the shade red and when B presses for what's happening in her life she'll say nothing. Later on she'll accidently drop important things like a guy she met for marriage was amazing. We're told the bad things in her life constantly, but we are never told about any good things (like her interviews, her travels etc), we come to find those out much later through her or on social media. \n\nIn December 2019 she was talking to this guy (arranged marriage) and she seemed to like him. He works in a different country, so it was all messages and video calls. He came down in Feb 2020 and met her and liked her and she clearly liked him. All the while she told us that she was keeping him at an arm's length and that she was not so impressed etc. The families met and decided to get A and this guy engaged in 2 weeks and married by June 2020. The guy panicked, because he liked her, but was not ready for marriage so fast. She panicked at his hesitation and asked what she should do and how to impress him because she actually really liked him. This went on for 5 days in which she was hysterical, because he seemed to want to back out and she travelled 8 hours to meet him. We were on the phone constantly trying to calm her down. Then she says she feels suicidal, disappears for a day, then on further pressing, tells us that their families met and he agreed to date her before deciding on marriage. She was then asking happily about clothes and gym and work and we were stunned because we had been worried out of our minds.\n\nCome quarantine (march 2020), we all went into lockdown and she was stuck alone in her house. She told us she was low and alone and couldn't bear the loneliness, she was laid off and that the guy didn't reciprocate her feelings. We frequently worried about her. Last month we were on a video call and we asked her if she was still alone and she said yes and then someone coughed behind her. Turns out, her grandmother has been there with her. She claimed that her grandmother had come just two weeks back and that she was still crying out of loneliness. We were disturbed but let it go. Then she started talking about another guy that she met online and I kind of lost it, because this was one time too many that she had lied or held back information. I told her that she was ignoring the fact that she had lied to us and that we had been worrying about her for 1.5 months. B asked her why she lied and A disappeared. She wished me on my birthday and a few days ago said she missed us and whether we would be up for a call. B let her know that she is worried about her, but she couldn't invest herself until she got some answers. I told her that our questions might hurt, but it was necessary to move ahead and it was disrespectful to ignore us and pretend nothing happened.\n\nB is scared for A because she feels that A is mentally ill and might do something to herself.\n\nFor me, I am tired, I've had a tough year. My aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer and my uncle had a brain stroke. My dad paid for the breast cancer treatment and my cousin relied on my emotionally because he was alone while battling for his father's brain stroke (I paid a part of the initial deposit). My father's business is also struggling and he's a heart patient, so covid-19 is particularly scary for me. My professional exams are delayed and I might not get to do it anymore due to covid. I've struggled from depression in the past and due to my own toxic relationships, I've always seen my emotional investment in terms of what it does to me. I also tend to not discuss my insecurities and problems anymore, because that always comes back to bite me in the ass. \n\nA has had breakdowns quite frequently in the past 1.5 years and even with a therapist, B and me find ourselves doing a lot for emotional labour for her and it leaves us drained. It's a constant barrage of her messaging us for our opinion and us constantly being positive for her because we're so afraid she'll breakdown. We've received so many generic messages from her about how she's 'realised that self love is self care' and that she's 'fallen into a cycle of negative behaviour with her parents'. It was all impressive in the beginning but it never generated into action and the words kept repeating. She's also not taken much effort to ask us how we're doing or being there beyond the generic 'I'll always love you both' that we get. I feel gaslighted, hurt and angry because I constantly doubt myself about the the things she tells me and then holds back. \n\nI told B that I didn't think she would do anything to herself, but now I feel guilty. I still feel immensely hurt and I don't want to be an emotional garbage can for anyone to the point that I feel drained and for someone who isn't reciprocating.\n\nIs this wrong of me?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/h9hyb8/am_i_wrong_to_cut_out_a_friend_who_is_emotionally/", "title": "Am I wrong to cut out a friend who is emotionally disturbed?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "rottingcastudent", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1592233049, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/h9hyb8/am_i_wrong_to_cut_out_a_friend_who_is_emotionally/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422321.6202385, "replies_charged": false}
