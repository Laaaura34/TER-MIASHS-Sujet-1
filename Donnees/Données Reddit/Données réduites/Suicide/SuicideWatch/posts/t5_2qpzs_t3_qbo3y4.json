I attempted suicide 10 years ago and told myself in 10 years I\u2019ll be mentally healthy. But it\u2019s not like that now is it. Is life really worth living? I do my best to be the best for everyone around me but myself. My partner especially. I gave everything I could. But I am unappreciated. I am suffering from anxiety and it makes her angry. I am in my head a lot. I cant wrap my head around what is actually wrong. I want to take my life away because it eliminates the problem: me. I am the cause of all of the things that goes wrong not only in my life but also my partner\u2019s. I gave her the power to control and regulate my feelings and I end up wanting to die. I end up burning my hands with cigarettes, I punch myself and hit myself because I\u2019m not worthy of anything. And dying is the best solution. It will take everything away. All of my problems and the problems I give others will be eliminated.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbo3y4/self_destruct_mode_activated/", "title": "Self destruct mode activated.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "West_Increase_9226", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634687220, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbo3y4/self_destruct_mode_activated/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422534.3894882, "replies_charged": false}
