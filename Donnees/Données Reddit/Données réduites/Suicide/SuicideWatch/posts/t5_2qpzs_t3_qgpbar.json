I didn\u2019t want my friends and family to live with all the burden of sadness, even if they are part of my reasons why I felt like this. I put back all the drugs in the cabinet and didn\u2019t tell anyone about my mental state. Since that day I\u2019m trying to communicate more. I\u2019ve made new friends that support me, I believe that I seem happy enough. \n\n\nBut my suicidal thoughts won\u2019t leave me alone. At night I cry, and wonder why do I still hold on, why can I just die ? And that terrify me. I\u2019m supposed to be happy now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qgpbar/i_cannot_get_rid_of_my_suicidal_thoughts/", "title": "I cannot get rid of my suicidal thoughts", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Shorty_under_rain", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635312114, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qgpbar/i_cannot_get_rid_of_my_suicidal_thoughts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427321.3354928, "replies_charged": false}
