It\u2019s my first time posting here.\nI\u2019ve been on Zoloft for about half a year (combined with therapy for high anxiety and mild depression). I started coming off of it some time late July, and took my last pill over a month ago.\n\nI didn\u2019t reach for it since then because it also made me gain weight so I\u2019m scared of using it again. \n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to feel withdrawal symptoms for this long but recently the anxiety really came back and now during the last days I feel very suicidal, like nothing is going to get better, this is where it should end, anything else is just procrastination and a meaningless existence.\n\nDid anyone else experience this? How did you cope? Is it just the withdrawal or is this stand-alone?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pwebkt/suicidal_thoughts_after_going_off_of_zoloft/", "title": "Suicidal thoughts after going off of Zoloft", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TeaAgreeable244", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 0, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632738964, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pwebkt/suicidal_thoughts_after_going_off_of_zoloft/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427365.055234, "replies_charged": false}
