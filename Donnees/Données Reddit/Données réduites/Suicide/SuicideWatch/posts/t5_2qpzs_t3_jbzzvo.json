If I bottle up what I'm thinking any longer then I may finally go through with taking my life like I've wanted to do for years. I am failing almost all of my classes. I am disappointing all who support me and they all feel as though I'm throwing away this amazing opportunity I've been blessed with. They're right. I threw it all away. I have no work ethic anymore. The old me is dead. I have no ambition. I'm not a productive member of society anymore. Yes, I want to take my life. I contemplate death and suicide more than I think about anything else in my life. I am a worthless human being who has wasted his talents and can't get over himself. I'm an idiot. I've ruined more opportunities than I can possibly remember. I just wanted to say I want to be gone. Don't ask who I am. All you need to know about the life I live is I'm not worth saving and I'm not worth the time you would try and invest in convincing me otherwise. I don't want to hear it anyways. I've made up my mind. Maybe this time I can actually do it, then again I would hurt the few who actually love me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jbzzvo/i_dont_want_pity_not_help/", "title": "I don't want pity not help", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "556logan", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1602809330, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jbzzvo/i_dont_want_pity_not_help/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423147.1773083, "replies_charged": false}
