I've done all of the home remedies I can and would consider going to an immediate care but then I'd have to get into the scars and I don't want to (some are a few weeks old. i'm fine now.)\n\nSo question is: has anyone else that's cut had experiences where you had flareups around the healed scars?\n\nI would literally lay (lie?) in a kiddie pool filled with ice if i had one.\n\nI don't know if it is stress related or what. nothing new that I can think of and it was sudden onset. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do have surgical scars and they are burning but not as badly and I wonder if its due to the healing process of the surgical scars having been properly stitched as opposed to celoxed and bandaged...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nanyone with similar experience, please let me know what you did to fix it.
