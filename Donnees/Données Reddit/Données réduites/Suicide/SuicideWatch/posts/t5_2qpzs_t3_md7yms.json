Usually there is nothing. I\u2019m unsure why I have kept going or trying but I have and some people may think that that is a good thing or something to be proud of when really it is pathetic. This naivety that things will change/improve. \n\nI don\u2019t have anyone I\u2019d be leaving behind. I don\u2019t have \\~family\\~ and I\u2019ve cut ties/distanced myself from friends. I\u2019ve got a partner but he\u2019s on the other side of the world anyway and I\u2019ve not seen him for a long time and it is unknown when I\u2019d be able to again. Feels like I\u2019m alone a lot of the time. That\u2019s not anyone\u2019s fault though.\n\nI don\u2019t have any responsibilities like a child or pet or a job that would be difficult for others if I didn\u2019t show up anymore.\n\nThe only goals and aspirations I have are so simple and yet so unreachable. They no longer feel real or obtainable. \n\nYet again I\u2019m typing onto some stupid document I\u2019ll archive or delete or ignore because I\u2019m trying not to cut or kill myself, but for what purpose? I\u2019m only going to be feeling the exact same tomorrow and the next day and the next day\u2026 an endless cycle that I\u2019ve suffered through for so long. I feel beyond help. \n\nI keep having the same visualisations. Cutting deep into my thigh, I see the blood and the fat and the blade in my mind. I also keep picturing myself drinking and overdosing. I can\u2019t get the images and thoughts out of my head. I really want to let myself give into them but for some reason I hold back. I don\u2019t know how I haven\u2019t cut myself this year, I really don\u2019t know what has been stopping me and yet still I haven\u2019t. Typing this is calming, I don\u2019t know why I do so\u2026 why I keep trying to tackle what will inevitably lead to my demise. What is the point of keeping up this tiresome fight? \n\nMy mind fixates on self harm and suicide. There\u2019s no turning from it. I\u2019m trying so hard to type these thoughts out and ride the wave yet again, I\u2019ve done it countless times. It is getting harder and harder to do so again. \n\nThe suicide methods my head keeps going to aren\u2019t always the same. Sometimes I slash my wrists deep enough, sometimes I drink and overdose then go somewhere to drown.. I picture jumping off a bridge into traffic, or waiting for a train to hit me. Sometimes I see myself hanging myself with that noose I have made. I don\u2019t know why I am still here and I don\u2019t want to be. I wish I could have someone just hold me and tell me everything's going to be alright in the end\u2026 but I\u2019m alone, the only person I have for reassurance is myself and I just can\u2019t anymore. I feel so bad for my younger self, I wish my first attempt at 8 worked. I wish the attempts following worked. I just wish I wasn\u2019t here anymore. \n\nMy head is doing that thing where when I think about it too much my head gets so heavy and tired and I feel the deep need in my chest to die. It\u2019s hard to hold my head up, gunna lie back down see if I can sleep more. I hope I don\u2019t ever wake up even though I know that I will if I do get sleep.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/md7yms/i_typed_this_up_for_only_me_but_figured_may_as/", "title": "I typed this up for only me but figured may as well post it too", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "WPAttempts98", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616705086, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/md7yms/i_typed_this_up_for_only_me_but_figured_may_as/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428131.426949, "replies_charged": false}
