I\u2019m losing friends, I live at my parents house, I hate my job, my car is a pos, I have no future, etc. \n\nI put a plastic bag over my head tonight after researching ways to kms, but couldn\u2019t go through with it. \n\nI called the Suicide Prevention Hotline after sitting in their chat room for 20 minutes and someone answers and rapidly says \u201chello my name is ________, how may I help you?\u201d As if I was calling to order pizza. I just hung up. \n\nI don\u2019t know what else to do. I have nothing to look forward to. I was in this same position two years ago and decided against it again because I didn\u2019t want my dog to suffer, who only gets 10-15 years on this earth as it is, they shouldn\u2019t have to go through multiple owners or depression like humans. But at this point I really don\u2019t care about anything other than the mess(either physically or emotionally) it would leave my parents and loved ones with. \n\nTruly have no idea what to do.
