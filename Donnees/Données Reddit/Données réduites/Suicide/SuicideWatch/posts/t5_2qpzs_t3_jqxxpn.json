Yet, I want out of life. I find it  extremely painful & have a negative experience of consciousness. The  only time I'm happy is when eating or sleeping. In fact, I prefer sleep  to consciousness. I have been diagnosed with clinical depression &  no medication seems to be working. I have already tried so many.\n\nI  have a suicidal dream. To immigrate to America & shoot my head off.  Hanging has a much higher rate of failure. I don't know how so many ppl  can be optimistic when life is suffering. At least, that is what I have  mostly experienced. I don't see how my life can improve. In the past,  I've had depression with psychotic symptoms & I don't want to lose contact with reality again.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jqxxpn/severely_depressed/", "title": "Severely depressed", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "aargh1234567", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1604929875, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jqxxpn/severely_depressed/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428467.1086597, "replies_charged": false}
