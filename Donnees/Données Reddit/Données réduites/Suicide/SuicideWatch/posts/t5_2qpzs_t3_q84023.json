I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m a caregiver and my client is sleeping but I am reeling and anxious. I feel like I am buzzing and I just want to hurt myself. I took the day off yesterday because I\u2019ve been feeling burnt out and I was hoping today I would feel better. I don\u2019t. I was doing so well and I was functional for once and I am fucking it up. What do I do? All I want to do is go home. I don\u2019t feel safe. I just want to be normal. I don\u2019t want to be in pain anymore. Should I leave work? I am putting my job at risk but I\u2019m not a very good staff right now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q84023/at_work_and_feeling_suicidal/", "title": "At work and feeling suicidal.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "missghettokoalla", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 15, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634231102, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q84023/at_work_and_feeling_suicidal/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427917.1220021, "replies_charged": false}
