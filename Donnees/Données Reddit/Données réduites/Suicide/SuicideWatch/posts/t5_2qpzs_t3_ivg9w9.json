I don't want to be alive, I wish I had never existed, why the fuck would I want to celebrate being born? I haven't told anyone about my birthday, have wiped all mentions of it from all my social media, but some people remembered and have been wishing me a \"happy birthday!\" and it's so frustrating. I can't even be truthful to them either when they ask me what I'm doing today, I have to say \"I'm just chilling\" or something that has some positive spin. I can't say that I'm actually just mourning my existence today, and feel so sad and angry that I'm here in the first place.\n\nAt least I successfully warded off anyone getting me gifts.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ivg9w9/day_of_mourning/", "title": "Day of Mourning", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Donglesallthewaydown", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1600468671, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ivg9w9/day_of_mourning/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426729.6189694, "replies_charged": false}
