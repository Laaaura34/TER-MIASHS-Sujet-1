I tried to kill myself (which failed, I\u2019m dumb) because I couldn\u2019t handle the forcing (and me being depressed) anymore. And they know that, and they still do it, like what the actual fuck is wrong with them. I don\u2019t want to be alive when they force me, I try to die, and after they still do the same thing. And than they say I have to tell them when I get thoughts of hurting or killing myself, and that we can try and get rid of them, but when I literally try it nothing changes, so why would anything get better when I say it before doing it. What the fuck. I can\u2019t live like this, I\u2019m in pain, just leave me alone.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mgp89l/i_fucking_hate_my_parents/", "title": "I fucking hate my parents", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TrackConnect8709", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 20, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617136148, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mgp89l/i_fucking_hate_my_parents/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422270.3936095, "replies_charged": false}
