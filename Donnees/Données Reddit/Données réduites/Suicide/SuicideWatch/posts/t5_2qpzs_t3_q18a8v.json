I\u2019ve tried too many times to off myself to know I can\u2019t do it myself, I don\u2019t know why. So I\u2019ve been thinking, maybe there\u2019s so activity I could get into, or some job I could get, that would be dangerous and exciting enough to either A. give me something to really enjoy and scratch that adrenaline junkie itch I have or B. get me killed. \n\nI\u2019m trying to make this from being too bleak because obviously I\u2019m basically asking for a way to kill myself without actually taking my life myself, but I really do wonder if I just need something more exciting or fulfilling of my need for adrenaline-inducing fun. Maybe that would help me with my mental health issues.
