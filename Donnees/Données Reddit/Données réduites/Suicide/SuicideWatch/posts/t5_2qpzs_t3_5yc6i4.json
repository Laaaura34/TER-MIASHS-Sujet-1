It'll go from manic to depressed to stoic in under 6 months. Some periods of mania lasting weeks and some periods of depression lasting months. Stoicism is somewhat a poor choice of words. I guess a better word would be... apathetic. Through the mania and depression is a general blase despondency regarding my existence. It feels a bit like when I was a depressed teen. Perhaps over the years, it has simply grown with me and become a large part of who I am. \n\nIn either case, I've had a few attempts, which I'm not very proud of. My \"battle scars\" along my skin are rather childish and I wince with the reminder of these gauche activities I enacted so many years ago. Most of them serve as symbols of my weakness (or so that's how I portray it). But lately - somehow - I've grown even weaker. Despite feeling the waves of depression crash on me yet again, suicide isn't my directive. As it stands, I find myself wandering to drugs. Heroin, psilocybin, and MDMA all sound like miracle drugs. Heroin might give my mind a rest from the constant pitter-patter of suicidal thoughts. In some cases, MDMA and psilocybin have shown signs of healing mental illnesses. So, I've considered taking moderate dosages of those. \n\nBut along with using them as a means to fix myself or forestall the inevitable, I find it oddly enticing to picture the slow descent into madness and ultimately death if I were to find myself hooked on some other opiate. This where my idle minds drifts to whenever I'm feeling down: the graceful ignorant slip into insanity. And I imagine that, hopefully, the sense of dread I feel when I'm alone will fade with it.\n\nMy short drives between work and home have become my quotidian introversion, which ultimately lends its self into negative self-reflection. I start spiraling as soon as I'm alone. My mind starts thinking of pulling the wheel into oncoming traffic. I can't help but yearn for the quick and justified end. And so I find myself browsing Tor at night for all manner of drug. Whatever could ease the soul and reduce the will to survive. Weaken my impulse enough that perhaps - one day - that plunger is too eager and finds itself surfeit with toxins. And in such a moment I may incidentally incur too shallow of breath. Too shallow a heart beat. And the soporific medicine would allow me to arrest thought indefinitely.\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nBut I'm not entirely certain where this inhibition comes from. I don't know what presses me in this direction. I don't even know why I want to anymore. \n\nI will say this as a buttress to my depression: I can't handle being the lowest rung of every ladder. I've had just about every job, every opportunity, and every experience one typical young middle class man might expect. Surrounding me are so many brilliant, beautiful, and kind people. Yet I've always felt like a monster that feeds on their shadows. Everyone I meet is so important and meaningful. They lead rich lives and seem fulfilled. I feel unfulfilled and not worthy of the skin I'm wearing. Since I was a mere 10 years old, I had wished to trade places with the starving - so that they might have an opportunity to do something with my position. I'm always failing at each task. No one can possibly offer me a task *too* low. And I'm tired of failure. I'm also tired of struggling to survive. I must crawl my way through every battle. Every test I've taken, relationship I've had, and job I've had has been like clawing at water. I'm desperate to feel at home somewhere. I don't feel at home with other people. I feel uncomfortable and it wears on my psyche. I don't feel at home in my work - or the night classes I take to better myself. My relationships are always a fight. I have to fight to maintain the conscientiousness that I fear has withdrawn far too much to every recover. \n\nI struggle with what most people consider a simple task. I cannot fathom how I've lasted so long with this sluggish brain and this weak skin. I'm like a frail child - only I don't grow! I don't get better. I fall further into frailty, ignorance, stupidity. I feel as though someone picks away at my brain and my soul with each passing night. I just wish it was over so I didn't feel the shame I feel each day. \n\nFurthermore, I'm largely empty. I find tears rolling down my face randomly - I don't know where they come from. On the surface of my brain though, this great wall of stoicism forbids me from ever making a human connection\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nI anticipate that this post won't last long for being too verbose or perhaps a little too on the nose regarding methodology. But that's alright. I just wanted to say my piece.\n\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5yc6i4/im_beginning_to_see_a_somewhat_more_slow_means_to/", "title": "I'm beginning to see a somewhat more slow means to the end", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MurderedByStupidity", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1489023333, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5yc6i4/im_beginning_to_see_a_somewhat_more_slow_means_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426456.59117, "replies_charged": false}
