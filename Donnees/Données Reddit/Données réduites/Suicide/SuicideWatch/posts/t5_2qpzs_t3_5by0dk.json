I have been dealing with these intense feelings for the past 6 months, and intermittently for the past 3 years. I'll never be free from pain, I'll never be a well adjusted and happy person. I am collapsing. There is no point anymore. I am going to be like this until I am dead. If my father's life is any indicator, I will be broken forever. There's only one escape, and I'm not allowed to take it. I want out of this life. It feels like I've been asked to carry my own corpse. I'm dragging myself along, weighed down by the corpse and every other responsibility.
