I want to shut off my brain and just kill myself but knowing that it will negatively affect my loved ones makes me feel even more guilt. But I can't continue living in this world, I face far too much suffering to handle. Is it justifiable for me to make myself stop caring and just off myself? I really just want to escape this hell, and if I could I would take my loved ones with me so they don't have to suffer but that's obviously not an option.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qak6ku/guilt/", "title": "Guilt", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "zuhf_", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 17, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634554108, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qak6ku/guilt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426169.1877983, "replies_charged": false}
