I've reached my breaking point and to be honesty I don't really want to fix something that started out so fucked up in the first place. I'm alone, I'm sick, I have too much debt, and truth be told I'm exhausted. I can't remember the last time I smiled, I can't remember the last time I really felt anything other than numbing melancholy. I'm not trying to be dramatic, just honest. I don't really know why I'm posting on here, maybe it's because I don't have anyone else to leave a note for. No boyfriend, no family, certainly no friends, and it just seems odd to go out without at least leaving something, even if my reasoning is weak. I'm exhausted and all I want to do is sleep and not wake up.  \nSo that's exactly what I'm going to do. \nGoodnight", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1dykfn/peace_out/", "title": "Peace out.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "imexhausted33", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1368050200, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1dykfn/peace_out/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427586.3878827, "replies_charged": false}
