I don't have a set date, but everything is ready for when I inevitably have a bad day and go through with it. But I feel so oddly calm at the thought of dying, except for maybe just minor underlying constant anxiety (but that's moreso caused by other issues in my life). \n\nI don't think I actually want to die, but I've been so overwhelmed by a lot of crap happening in my life recently, and I've been constantly anxious and hurt by one thing after another in the past few years. I'm just tired, I feel useless, it's just like I'm numb now. \n\nI'm hesitating to call a hotline or go to a local hospital mainly because it feels like me dying isn't a big deal. As if the thought calms me so much I'm not even sure why I should prevent it. It doesn't feel that serious, but I can't tell if that's just me downplaying everything. I don't know, it just doesn't feel like it's a high priority case despite the fact that I'm just a ticking time bomb, waiting for the day I throw out any inhibitions and just do it. Is it even worth checking in if I don't have a solid date? Will anyone even take me seriously? Deep down, I have a nagging feeling that this is all  wrong and maybe I should tell someone, but I just can't bring myself to care as much anymore. Plus, it just feels like I shouldn't be wasting people's resources or time if I'm not going to kill myself right this moment. \n\nI guess I'm just slightly afraid of what I'd do, but I'm not even sure what my next steps should be.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mkvj30/should_i_bother_to_check_myself_into_a_hospital/", "title": "Should I bother to check myself into a hospital or call a hotline?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "low_mood_low_life", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617658480, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mkvj30/should_i_bother_to_check_myself_into_a_hospital/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426415.0820367, "replies_charged": false}
