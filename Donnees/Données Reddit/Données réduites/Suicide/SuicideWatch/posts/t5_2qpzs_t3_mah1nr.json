It took me way too long to reach this overwhelmingly obvious conclusion.\n\nI think the human heart needs to be filled with something in order to survive. Love is the best thing you can fill it with, but not everyone has that. I don\u2019t. Not after they all left me for dead.\n\nConversely, hate is the worst thing you can fill the heart with\u2014it really is a poison like no other. But what can you do when you\u2019re left with no other options? I don\u2019t want to hate everyone. It\u2019s tiring and obviously wrong. But how else can I survive? I don\u2019t want to die, either.\n\nI just want someone I can talk to without being told it\u2019s my fault. Someone who won\u2019t judge me and blame me for everything. Someone who\u2019s there because they care about me, not because they\u2019re looking for ways to inflate their ego! Is that so much to ask?!\n\nIf anyone I know is reading this, congratulations! You\u2019re happy, and I\u2019m not! You win! You\u2019re better than me! I hope that\u2019s enough for you. And don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll let everyone else know, too.
