This is my first ever reddit post and I'm sorry it's this\nI wake up with intense dread. I feel so tired n hopeless. Everyone around me is dating someone or talking to someone even the boy I like. The best part of my day is playing rdo or r6 with my friends. But I can deal with being jealous, that doesn't make me suicidal it's just salt in the wound\n\nIk Noone will care if I died. It'd make everyone's lives easier, my mom wouldn't have to yell at me. My step dad wouldn't have any one to abuse anymore and my friends would have less stress and more spare time.\n\nAnd I can't even vent here I can't put my thoughts into words I've been given such a shitty hand and I've dealt with sm hurt and shit people. I think I'm pathetic cuz I can't put my reason into words u\nIts just my head screaming I wanna die. I've tried and failed, I think I'm stupid for failing. I'm sorry reddit, sorry I can't put my thoughts into words.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pvlyai/im_suicidal_but_i_cant_put_my_thoughts_into_words/", "title": "I'm suicidal but I can't put my thoughts into words and it makes me think I'm lying", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "deeznuts150907", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 36, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632627105, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pvlyai/im_suicidal_but_i_cant_put_my_thoughts_into_words/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635428283.4868407, "replies_charged": false}
