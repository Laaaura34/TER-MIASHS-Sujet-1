At the current time of writing this I have been having a habit of buying stuff so I have something to look forward to in the week. I chose the longest shipping so maybe I can have something to wait for in a week. I feel crippling sadness every single day and watching and reading the news lately just makes it worse. I read the arguments online and realize all the hate that is directed at people like me. I used to be far left wing, attending rallies and protests. I then got hit with a false rape accusation(which I got let off of) and that slowly led me to full on white nationalism. At first it was fine, I guess, I was around a bunch of dudes that encouraged me to read and work out. They urged me to better myself and to find an aryan wife and have a bunch of kids and teach them western, European values, whatever the fuck that means. Never the less, I no longer felt immense hatred at myself, just at the people who I viewed have fucked everything up. I watched as white male suicide fucking sky rocketed over the last couple years with no signs of stopping, modern society pushing hypergamy and open relationships and even fucking pedophilia. I realized women will never love you like she would love her children or herself. I saw my religion get attacked, the colleges I go to preaching marxism(which I had grown to hate due to..previous experiences), my potential jobs becoming minefields. Of course, I was told to not worry about these groups, worry about all groups. I watched as white countries get flooded with people who have never and will never create anything of importance and then it gets praised. After a while I grew tired of caring about this. I realized I was just making the people around me cringe and laugh at what I was saying. I felt right but in the end I was more alone than ever. I eventually left the movement because I was sick of my blood pressure being high all the time and never improving anything in my own life. But I was still left empty and hopeless of the future.\n\nI bring this up because its a large part of why I am planning on dying. I have always wanted to be in a group, or a part of something bigger than myself. When I was far left, I got eaten, so when I went right I had something like that was close to belonging but even then, it was just permanent victim hood. I never hated any races or anyone for their skin color, I just didn't want to see my own and my own country's get wiped out and praised for it. But I digress from this topic, its a fools game in the end.\n\nI am incredibly lonely, I haven't even been touched in over four years, I barely go outside except for work and food. I work a low skill, low paying job with drug addicts and felons. I have no inhibition to get a better life style. I just know I am useless and should be working on my death as fast as possible. I will die a virgin, as expected, without knowing love or even basic affection. I spent way too much of my life playing video games and worrying about things that are inevitable anyway. I asked for the impossible and in the end I realized there is nothing to look forward to in the future, especially for me.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/92zvmd/there_is_no_world_for_me/", "title": "There is no world for me", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "OwnRoom", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1532914133, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/92zvmd/there_is_no_world_for_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426462.7388046, "replies_charged": false}
