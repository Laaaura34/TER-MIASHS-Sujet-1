Throughout most of it I was a fat, nearly friendless kid. Sure I was pretty smart, I coasted through school quite easily, as I guess most introverts seem to do. And yeah I always had at least a couple friends in real life. But it didn't stop me from spending all of my time on the computer, never going anywhere, never speaking to anyone I didn't have to, avoiding any confrontation at all costs throughout high school. As I entered college my weight was the highest its ever been, I was nearly 300 lbs at some point I'm sure of it, though my scale only goes up to 280, I failed a class my freshman year and got incredibly depressed, thought of suicide a hell of a lot, started abusing some Robotussin and things like that. Obviously I continued to be socially awkward and silent.\n\nI don't really know what happened but the summer after that I decided to change my health around, I basically dropped my shitty diet cold turkey and started running and hitting the gym, this change in my life I really can't explain, I would have never thought that in 100 years I would be motivated enough to become healthy, but somehow it happened, I guess my brain just thought I should do ONE positive thing in my awful life for once, as of today I'm 200lbs, went from size XXXL shirts to a M. I feel like if this had not happened I would not be here right now typing this. \n\nI'm about to graduate with a BS, but I still hate myself all the time. I can count the friends I made in college on two hands. Whenever I check Facebook it makes me incredibly depressed to see people I know (well, mostly high school \"friends\" who felt bad for me and added me back in the day) getting married, getting careers, having the time of their young lives. Meanwhile the only people I regularly talk to are my group of online gaming friends, or someone in my class who drops a pencil or wants to know what time it is. I'm so tired of my education, I feel like I've been in school for so long and have nearly nothing to show for it. I have no job lined up. Even when I have free time I just sit here and do almost nothing, even PC gaming and technology which I used to be so passionate about have become bland. I just work out, stare at my PC, go to class, and avoid social contact as much as possible. 90% of my private school are rich, beautiful, social people with whom I share nothing in common with.\n\nI'd like to be in a relationship but I have nothing to offer anyone. I'm actually not even that unattractive, and I'm fairly buff due to my weight loss regimen. My health is the single thing in my life I managed to stop fucking up at. But it doesn't matter when I still avoid confrontation and social situations. I have nothing in common with females I meet other than \"oh, you study X too?\". I feel like I'm being a burden on people when I talk to them. No I don't stutter or get super anxious, but it just feels like no one wants to talk  to me. And why would they, I have nothing interesting to say, no interesting life experiences, hobbies, jobs, people I know, places I've been to. Where would I even go with a girl that was actually interested in me? Hey let's go to the movies. Yeah fantastic. It's a real shame cause on the outside I look like any normal person, but on the inside I'm pretty destroyed. I'm just coasting on life and hoping it takes me somewhere but I know it won't. \n\nDon't really know why I even posted this here, I'm just a bitchy kid, too much of a pussy to even try suicide anyway.
