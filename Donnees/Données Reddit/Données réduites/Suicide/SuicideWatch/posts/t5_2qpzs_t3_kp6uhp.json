I am making this decision solely because I love you too much.  I adore you to such a degree that I cannot bear to exist knowing that, by living, I risk the possibility of hurting you. I love you so much that I am willing to perish for your happiness.\n\nI am sorry that I never became the woman you wanted me to be. I was doomed to fail from the start. I do not deserve the sacrifices you make for me. In order to take responsibility for me for the mistakes I know I am bound to repeat, I should no longer be allowed to exist as a blemish on the face of this earth.\n\nI am confident that you can find happiness once I am gone. I hope for this to be the last time I should ever cause you to bear yet another burden, and I apologize for the life I've lived as such an inconsiderate child.\n\nI hope that my death will be forgotten shortly after I am gone. I pray that my erasure from this planet will be as hideous and painful as possible to match my ugliness as a person and the pain I have continuously caused others.\n\nPlease don't attempt to dissuade me from doing this, I wish to waste away in my melancholy alone and spare you the heartache of raising me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kp6uhp/a_copy_of_my_suicide_note/", "title": "A copy of my suicide note", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Narrow_Awareness3055", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1609625073, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kp6uhp/a_copy_of_my_suicide_note/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427515.083781, "replies_charged": false}
