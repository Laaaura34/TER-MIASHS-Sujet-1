I'm losing interest in things I previously found fun in sooner than ever. My faith in those close to me is non-existent. I absolutely can't open up to anyone I know anymore - it'll just come back to haunt me later. I recently started drinking on the weekends (I semi-recently turned 21, never drank before because alcohol tastes awful), and that helped lower my inhibitions the first few times, but now I'm finding myself still unable to reach out to anyone even while drunk. Even if I try to maintain relationships, we always end up losing touch, no matter how hard I try. I've been told something along the lines of \"some friendships just don't last forever,\" but really, it seems none of them do. It makes it really hard to try and make new friends knowing that it won't last.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/60ch7y/it_doesnt_seem_like_i_have_any_other_choice/", "title": "It doesn't seem like I have any other choice", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "okwithdying", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1489958491, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/60ch7y/it_doesnt_seem_like_i_have_any_other_choice/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426445.2367425, "replies_charged": false}
