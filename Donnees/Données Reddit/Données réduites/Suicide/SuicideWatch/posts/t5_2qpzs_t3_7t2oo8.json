I was curious if someone(s) else had ever used that phrase in the way I was thinking of it at the time; that life has completely, utterly and irreversibly kicked the shit out of me; that I had no future, no hope left. I was kind of curious if anyone had used it as a suicide note.\n\nThat search led me to this sub. And the past few days I\u2019ve been thinking about posting, but I wasn\u2019t really sure what to write. I know I\u2019ve been having suicidal thoughts\u2026 both in the form of sudden, emotional urges that come and go; and in the form of what seem like very rational thoughts about what options I have, that end up at that same point.\n\nBut then also for a while now, I\u2019ve been wanting to share what I\u2019m going through. I don\u2019t have anyone I feel comfortable telling the full story to. The closest is a dear friend who I think could listen, understand, and give advice; but he also lost a sibling to suicide, so I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be impartial on all of it; nor would I want to make him afraid of losing someone else. So I\u2019d been thinking of doing something like an anonymous blog sharing what I\u2019m going through. But then I realized, maybe that\u2019s really what I should be posting here.\n\nEven just a year ago, if you asked me to describe the worst my life could possibly get, I never would have imagined it could get this bad. If you\u2019d told me, I wouldn\u2019t have believed you. The circumstances lining up so perfectly horribly is so incredibly unlikely. It\u2019d be like winning the lottery in reverse.\n\nThere\u2019s of course a good amount of backstory and detail, but I\u2019ll try to just hit the highlights (lowlights?). Because I\u2019m not comfortable sharing this fully with anyone who knows me, there may be some parts that are annoyingly vague. My apologies.\n\nI\u2019m in my late 30s. For most of the past 6 years, I\u2019d been in a job that I hated with every fiber of my being. In the first 18 months, it was clear it was destroying my mental, emotional and physical health. The kind of job where to even function, you\u2019d have to daily do 10+ things that messed with other peoples\u2019 lives and made you hate yourself. I\u2019d go through periods where I had panic attacks, emotional breakdowns; and at the same time, go through cycles of physical sickness. One time I had an awful stomach bug, immediately followed/overlapped by pinkeye, immediately followed by a throat infection, immediately followed by a vicious flu, immediately followed by another throat infection. It was obvious to me that the physical and mental stress were weakening my immune system. But it took me 5 years to get in a place where I could leave (mostly due to finances\u2014in part because the pay was so much better than I could have gotten doing anything else). It wasn\u2019t that horrific for all of the 5 years, but the whole time (after those first 18 or so months) I felt like I was holding my breath until I could finally walk away --even in the best of times.\n\nSimultaneously, my wife and I were trying to have a baby. For most of my life, I hadn\u2019t wanted kids. I love my parents, and I don\u2019t blame them for their mistakes\u2026 but they made some serious ones, and I didn\u2019t want to do the same to an innocent person. I also wasn\u2019t sure it was a good idea to bring someone into the world; I was mostly undecided on whether life was really a good thing. I\u2019d never found meaning or lasting happiness, and while I\u2019ve had some incredible moments and great joy\u2014it\u2019s all been fleeting. But in my early 30\u2019s I decided I did want a kid. I don\u2019t know if they were selfish reasons \u2013 I mean, what is a selfless reason to have a kid? But for me, I wanted to care about something beyond the span of my own life. I wanted to have someone I loved in a way unlike any I\u2019d felt before; and someone that would have a unique love for me. I wanted to \u201clevel up as a person\u201d, as someone had once described it to me. And my wife wanted a kid too, so we tried.\n\nIt took a long time \u2013 5 years of trying, for a variety of reasons\u2014but in late 2016, she got pregnant.\n\nAround the same time, things were starting to line up for me to leave my job. The pay had enabled us to pay off most of our debt, and even have a little bit of a savings. In early 2017, I finally quit. In large part, because I wanted to be in a job that wasn\u2019t killing me by the time I became a father.\n\nI had almost 4 months from the time I quit until the due date, and a little bit of savings as a cushion, so I had time to look. I committed myself to finding a better career. I explored several promising options. But none had panned out by the time my daughter was born in mid 2017. I was disheartened, and we were burning through our savings. But I still had hope I could find a career I didn\u2019t hate, and still support my family.\n\nAnd then came the day she was born; the day my world started falling apart.\n\nShe was born with a horrible recessive genetic disease. A disease pretty much no one should be born with these days, as it\u2019s easy to screen for. In our case, since we did IVF, it could even have been detected before embryo implantation. But it wasn\u2019t screened for then, for some reason, even though it\u2019s standard practice to offer that screening to parents. It was screened for later, but the doctor missed a key sign, and we (and the medical team) thought we were clear.\n\nOf course, we weren\u2019t. Our daughter was born in critical condition, due to complications of the disease, and spent most of the rest of 2017 in the intensive care unit. It was touch-and-go for weeks, and then uncertain future for months. I still wasn\u2019t working, and neither was my wife; we spent most of our days in the intensive care unit at her side; reading to her, talking with doctors. We were still burning through our savings, but things weren\u2019t dire yet, and we knew we had to be there for her. Any day things could turn the corner and she\u2019d be able to come home, so we couldn\u2019t just go back to our lives and leave her there. But it took months. Finally, after many surgeries and lots of drugs, she pulled through the worst initial dangers, and was released into our care. \n\nShe still had lots of problems, though. Round-the-clock hands-on care required, tons of medication, always connected to life-supporting medical equipment. We weren\u2019t equipped to deal with that at home. But we did our best. The first few weeks, it was just us\u2026 due to insurance snafus and bad legal advice, we didn\u2019t have home assistance for those first few weeks. We barely slept, stopped exercising, ate whatever we could find in a few seconds in the cupboard or just ordered pizza again. Constant scares and stresses as her health waxed and waned, as new symptoms appeared or existing ones worsened for a bit, as medications were adjusted. One professional we\u2019ve talked to since then is fairly certain my wife and I both developed PTSD from this period.\n\nEventually, insurance help (on-site care assistance, for part of the day, a few days a week) came in, and some relatives were able to get out to visit and help. And my daughter\u2019s health started to improve a little. Still round-the-clock care, life-supporting equipment, and medications; but not quite as demanding, and not as scary. This meant we could finally sleep, and even do a little bit of normal things like grocery shopping and paying bills. But we still had more to do each day then we had time to do, still didn\u2019t have much time for self-care. And we still weren\u2019t working yet. Savings were almost gone, and we were starting to rely on financial help from family members.\n\nBefore this had happened, I\u2019d actually at one point said my personal hell could be dealing with insurance companies all day. Some evil god must have been listening, because now I spent hours on the phone with insurance companies; awful, scammy medical supply companies; and insanely, frustratingly, inefficient government agencies --every single day.\n\nBefore any of this had happened, I\u2019d had some health problems. I\u2019ve had them most of my life, and they were the kind of thing that weren\u2019t life-threatening, but certainly could become problems longer term if not closely managed. And in the shorter term, tended to cause me a lot of discomfort and/or pain. GERD, plantar faciitis, digestive problems, environmental allergies, that kind of thing. And of course, with all this now going on, I couldn\u2019t spare time to do everything I needed to do health-wise. So problems (and discomfort and pain) started cropping up. And in the months following my daughter\u2019s birth, I was diagnosed with a couple new ones\u2026 nothing life-threatening, but just further decreasing quality of life. \n\nAlso in these months, one of my parents, after a terrible battle with a neurodegenerative disease, passed away. They\u2019d been unable to travel to the hospital, and my daughter had never been able to leave the hospital. So they never met, despite their lives overlapping by many months, and despite living only 30 minutes away from each other.\n\nThe disease my daughter has --besides causing the problems that almost ended her life as soon as she was born-- is usually the kind of thing that doesn\u2019t bother you at first. (She just happened to have rare major complications right at birth.) But it usually takes time, progressively getting worse over (usually, if you\u2019re lucky) 2-3 decades. And then when it gets bad enough, body systems start breaking down, and eventually stop functioning. Usually in a pretty awful way. In the meantime, in the decades before it gets fatal, it causes a lot of inconveniences and pain. In fact, it causes a lot of health problems very similar to the ones I\u2019d had my whole life, only much worse versions of them. This aspect of the disease was one of the hardest things for me to hear about. I thought about all the awful, painful experiences I\u2019d had \u2013the worst physical issues I\u2019d had to deal with in my life so far, as trivial as they seem now-- and imagined my daughter going through all of them, but many times worse. Hearing that, realizing that, was just so, so painful.\nAnd all of this, if she makes it through the initial health problems, is what she still has to face.\n\nSo another thing about this disease she has, is although it\u2019s progressive, the reason it often takes a few decades to kill you, is that it can be managed. An intense, difficult daily treatment regimen is required to keep it at bay for those 2-3 decades. But you\u2019ll still have scares along the way; you might catch a flu that triggers worse things because of this disease, for example, and you might spend a couple months in intensive care, before maybe pulling through again and returning to somewhat normal life for a while.\n\nMedical science on this disease is moving at an amazing pace, and there is a chance \u2013 a very small one\u2014that she\u2019ll be able to live a lot longer than people with this disease have in the past. Maybe even live until a cure. But that small chance seems like a foolish thing to hope for.\n\nProgressive, life-shortening, unpredictable, and with an intense daily treatment regimen. One of the worst combos for quality of life, for economic cost, and for impact on your loved ones.\n\nApparently, that particular combo of attributes is pretty much the most emotionally damaging setup possible for parents, too. You fight, and your child fights, every day, a losing battle. But you have to keep fighting, and keep seeing it win. Keep seeing your kid tortured, weakened over time, with no option but to keep trying to slow it down a little. \n\nI\u2019ve learned that if a child dies young, parents grieve; they usually divorce; and they continue to live their lives. It\u2019s awful, but they move on.\n\nIf a child has a progressive, life-shortening disease, that nothing can be done about, but it\u2019s predictable; that\u2019s awful too. But similarly, there is a grieving process, an acceptance process. \n\nBut if a child has a progressive, life-threatening disease that\u2019s unpredictable? The parents can never properly go through the stages of grief, never get the emotional room to properly process and accept the situation. They hover and shift back and forth between stages. This happens, for example, to parents with long-term critical preemies in the intensive care unit. It\u2019s damaging to them. But in that particular case--eventually, weeks or months, it\u2019s over, one way or the other, and they get to live the rest of their lives, despite whatever scars they picked up.\n\nNot so with this disease. Or at least, not for decades.\n\nApparently some parents of children with this disease are able to find solace in religion. I\u2019ve never believed in god. I kind of wish I did, to have someone to be angry at. Instead, I just despair at an impossibly bad roll of the cosmic dice.\n\nSo now here I am. Every day is a nightmare, on so many dimensions. Constant repetitive drudge work of machine maintenance and medication dosing, fighting a losing battle. Constant worry. Sleep deprivation. Nightmarish bureaucracy and infuriating bullshit runarounds from insurance and government programs that I have no choice but to deal with. Knowing that things might get better, for a bit \u2013but then they\u2019ll certainly get worse. Seeing my own health deteriorating. Watching our finances dwindle and circle the drain\u2026 and then seeing it start to drag my relatives\u2019 finances down the drain, too. Knowing that my daughter\u2019s short(-ish?) life will be filled with immense struggle, with incredible pain, and that I\u2019ll likely watch her die a horrible death. Knowing that if/when that happens, my wife and I will probably break apart as many parents in these situations do, as we\u2019ll each be an unbearably painful reminder to each other of our daughter.\n\nEarly in this saga, after my daughter\u2019s birth, I was so depressed that I had trouble functioning. And my family needed me to function. I had an annual checkup coming up, and as part of it my doctor gave me a quick mental health questionnaire. Unsurprisingly, it raised a few seriously red flags. She ended up prescribing me Wellbutrin\u2014which definitely helped a lot\u2014and urged me to see a therapist. I barely had time, but I did go. The therapist listened to about half my problems\u2026 not even the worst ones\u2026 and said she couldn\u2019t believe that could all happen to one person. That of course I was sad, and stressed, and I was doing all I could about it. That I should take better care of myself, and find someone to talk to (even if it was just her)\u2026 I didn\u2019t find the session helpful in the slightest. And I didn\u2019t have the time or money to go back and try again.\n\nAnother thing that is hopeless, to me, is the financial side. Pretty much the only way we are not going to lose our house, or bankrupt our extended family that's willing to help, is if I go back to that living hell of a job. The one that, when I finally walked out, I swore I\u2019d never put myself through again. If I do that\u2026I\u2019ll almost never see my family; my health will fall apart; the stress will be just as bad as before, but now I\u2019ll also have a never-ending crisis at home on top of that. I honestly don\u2019t even know how I\u2019d be able to do the job, be able to function. I barely could back when it was the only thing that sucked about my life. So now? Ha.\n\nI\u2019m continuing to take Wellbutrin\u2014what my doctor says is the maximum dose--and it\u2019s helping me function day-to-day. But I\u2019m filled with anger and revulsion and despair, constantly at a low roar in the background. Sometimes in the foreground. I have moments of uncontrollable rage, when it all hits me, and I have to go someplace private and punch walls. I have frequent moments of utter despair where it\u2019s all I can do to not swerve my car into oncoming traffic, or cut my arms open with a kitchen knife. I\u2019m quite certain if I\u2019d had a gun in the house, I\u2019d have used it on myself by now in one of these moments. I\u2019ve no hope that my life will ever get better, in fact I\u2019m quite certain it\u2019ll get worse and worse. That\u2019s part of what\u2019s so horrifying \u2013 I know however bad things have gotten, I could always see ways things can get worse. If things were the same as they are now, but I also had to watch my daughter coughing and struggling to breathe, for example. Or (as is currently a near-term possibility) she needs to get permanently hooked up to even more onerous medical equipment, with potentially awful side effects, that\u2019ll mean she\u2019ll almost never be able to leave the house.\n\nI don\u2019t really see a point in continuing to bear this torture. I know that choosing to leave will make things worse for my wife, and probably for my daughter. But I just can\u2019t bring myself to care about that enough to tip the scales; the other side is so weighed-down. \n\nTo be honest I don\u2019t know how my wife can possibly handle this either. We\u2019ve definitely commiserated a lot. But I don\u2019t dare share my full thoughts with her\u2026 I can\u2019t give her one more enormous thing to worry about.\n\nWhen I was younger, and I thought about the concept of suicide, I always thought people were crazy for doing it. If I ever felt my life wasn\u2019t worth living, I thought, I\u2019d at least go do something crazy and fun. Rob a bank or party in Rio before overdosing, that kind of thing. But I completely understand now, there are places you can find yourself where running away won\u2019t help; where guilt, regret and pain at what you left behind will follow you wherever you go on earth. I never would have imagined I could feel that. I guess that\u2019s what being a parent can do to you.\n\nI\u2019m hoping putting this into words will help me at least a little; either to feel better to have shared it, or to get some clarity on a path forward, or maybe even find some useful advice or perspective.
