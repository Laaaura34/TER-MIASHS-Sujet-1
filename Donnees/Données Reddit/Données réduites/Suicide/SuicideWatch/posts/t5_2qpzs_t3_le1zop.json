I\u2019m stuck at home for at least another month and I don\u2019t even have any cigarettes left to make me feel better. Online school is so draining and I just feel bored and hopeless on weekends. \n\nEven if lockdown was to disappear my life would still suck. I don\u2019t have any friends at school and we live in the middle of nowhere. Also I have autism and ocd, and I\u2019m trans, which sucks because dysphoria gets bad sometimes. I just feel so depressed and flat. Nothing really makes me happy anymore", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/le1zop/i_feel_so_empty/", "title": "I feel so empty", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "riejrjrjdjdjjddndjks", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612631873, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/le1zop/i_feel_so_empty/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427063.1381757, "replies_charged": false}
