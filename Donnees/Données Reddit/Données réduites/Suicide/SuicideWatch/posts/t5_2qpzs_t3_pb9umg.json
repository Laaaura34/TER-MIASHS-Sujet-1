I've got a job, I'm going to college, I have my best friends and my boyfriend that make me feel very happy and supported. Yet I'm still so done with it all. I keep thinking how life is unnecessary and futile. I don't care about how I could still be happy and things could get better; I already know and believe that. It's not like I'm a walking zombie, I still feel happiness and am able to get it. But. As I said, it's just not worth it to me. I could be laughing with my friends and still be thinking that being dead IS the better situation. Simply fading out of existence sounds way more appealing than living life because of happy times. It's just much easier and requires no bs. Unfortunately, actually doing it is. ofc. difficult.\n\nI feel like an asshole with this mindset. Coupled with my belief in the right to die, and it's making it that much more difficult for me to actually pull myself off of this suicidal bs in my mind. I keep thinking, why should I fight it and try to get better, when I don't care for it and I believe it's my right to die anyway?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pb9umg/i_dont_even_care_about_being_happy_the_boredom/", "title": "I don't even care about being happy.
