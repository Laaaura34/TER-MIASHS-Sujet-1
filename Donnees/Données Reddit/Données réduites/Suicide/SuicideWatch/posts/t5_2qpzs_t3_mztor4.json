I should be happy, I have a stressful but successful career, a family, I teach at a local prestigious university, and I managed to get out of a very emotionally abusive relationship last year. I'm in a great relationship now with an amazing person that I love.\n\nYet, all I think about from sunrise to sunset is killing myself - do I use a gun or hang myself? What about jumping in front of the train? When do I cross the 2 year exclusion period of my life insurance? So many things to work thru before I do this. I should be working and instead I'm just searching for ways to end this fucking non-stop suffering that is life. Camus was right that life is absurd and shitty but he was wrong about killing yourself. Every single person, company, student in my life would be better off without me. It's all nice of them to pretend otherwise, but lets be honest, I'm worthless and none of any of this matters anyway. \n\nI'm in therapy and on meds and I guess it's fine but maybe not working as well as it should?\n\nWhat do reddit?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mztor4/i_just_want_this_suffering_to_end_37m/", "title": "I just want this suffering to end 37/m", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "habanerosausage", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619544323, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mztor4/i_just_want_this_suffering_to_end_37m/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427107.3155332, "replies_charged": false}
