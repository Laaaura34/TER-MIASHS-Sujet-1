This horrible weight on my chest, most days feels like they're spent battling negative emotion, nothing more. It's all blending together into this nightmare indistinguishable from my life. Nothings wrong in my life, just the way I feel. I've been struggling for 5 years. I've tried to reach out to my Dad and tell him and explain to him in depth at least 4 or 5 times, he just gets weird and doesn't know how to approach it at all and then goes on a week later like I never mentioned it to him. I see a counselor, but it's really not been enough. I want to live, but I can't go on feeling this fucked up. My counselor is out of town, and I mentioned briefly to him I was feeling suicidal on our last appointment, but we wont be meeting again for upwards of two weeks. I tried to get in with a psychiatrist and I've tried 15 doctors or so. None accepting new patients, or United healthcare because it turned into a shitty insurance. I can't get institutionalized at the moment, but I'm running out of options. I don't know anyone I can reach out to and tell about this, I feel like it would only burden them and maybe for a few days things would change until it was all forgotten again I constantly feel this way, and then I act normal and try my best to hide how fucked up I always feel. I really need some advice on finding help without another stint in a psych ward , I just can't fucking cope. I feel like I need someone on my side to help me while I figure out how to get better, because in my own state it's difficult for me to stay on top of this alone. I have very few people I can reach out towards. When I mention it to my best friend his first comment is always 'down for a suicide pact, let me know when' and in truth he's probably 100% serious, so I try to veer away from conversation like that with him, beyond that no real people I can talk to. What can I do? More or less I need psychiatric medication. I have old prescriptions of prozac, and effexor. Also some seroquel and about 1.5mg of xanax floating around. I'm considering restarting prozac, but I'm scared, I'm already in a suicidal state and I'm not sure how I might react.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3ko0xq/no_support_network/", "title": "No support network", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "000100001000001", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1442068666, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3ko0xq/no_support_network/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427738.3853278, "replies_charged": false}
