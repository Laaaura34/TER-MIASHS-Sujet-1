I\u2019ve gone out more, picked up a new hobby, and even started cooking again. But I\u2019ve also had a few moments where I really had to stop myself from going into the kitchen to grab something sharp to just end my life. \n\nI talked to my therapist about this last week, and she seemed skeptical in a way that really bothered me. Almost like she thinks I\u2019m lying or exaggerating my feelings. She just seemed annoyed and suggested I go to inpatient. She said if I didn\u2019t, they\u2019d stop treating me as a way to \u201cpush me\u201d to go to inpatient. \n\nInpatient place called me to get an evaluation appointment setup. I declined, and they said they\u2019d have to tell my therapist. I expected a call from my therapist but never got one, an they\u2019re still sending me links for virtual group therapy.\n\nSo now I\u2019m avoiding inpatient, avoiding group therapy, and my urges are up and I haven\u2019t told anyone. Luckily, my family knows I\u2019m suicidal and are closely watching me. But fucking hell, this is all so frusturating. I know I should tell them but because my mood is better, they also think the urges are gone and I\u2019m scared to say anything.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/n0otqd/need_advice_mood_is_better_but_suicidal_urges_are/", "title": "[Need advice] Mood is better, but suicidal urges are worse.
