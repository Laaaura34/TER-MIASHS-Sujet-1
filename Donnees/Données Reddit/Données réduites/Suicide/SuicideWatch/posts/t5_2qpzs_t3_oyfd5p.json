I have a girlfriend who looks like a model but truly loves me and sacrifices herself for me. I have a best friend for 10+ years who I can talk to about everything. I have 10-20 other friends who I know also for a long time. With all that, I have parents who I think are best parents I can think of and I love the rest of may family too.\n\nWith all this, I kill myself in my mind every day hundreds of times. Why? I am unhappy in love. I think I missed out on the love of my life and I can\u2019t get over it. Everything I have doesn\u2019t matter anymore. I want to live and help others but the suicidal scenario is becoming more real every day. I want to kill myself with a gun so I don\u2019t think there will be a second chance. My psychotherapy doesn\u2019t work and now I\u2019m going onto a drugged therapy.\n\nI don\u2019t want to tell this to my friends and family because I don\u2019t want them to feel responsible in the case I end up killing myself so saying it here. In regards to my family and friends being hurt if I kill myself, I\u2019m thinking to leave them a video explaining how it was too hard for me to live anymore and that it was no ones fault than mine.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oyfd5p/i_am_successful_have_beautiful_girlfriend_many/", "title": "I am successful, have beautiful girlfriend, many friends and a great family but still dream of suicide every day", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "PracticalRaccoon3445", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628161988, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/oyfd5p/i_am_successful_have_beautiful_girlfriend_many/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428199.6172137, "replies_charged": false}
