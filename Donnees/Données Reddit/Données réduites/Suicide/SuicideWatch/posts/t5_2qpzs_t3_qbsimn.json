Then things began spiraling sorta. The mall, I humiliated myself. Then at therapy all I did was vent about suicide and being hopeless and my therapist just looks at me. She tells me \"well its your choice\" when I say I'm waiting to fucking be kicked out and die of starvation on the streets. I know where she was coming from, sure, but hearing those words just immediately brought me back to a place I didn't wanna remember. All the years that made me realize I've built my world on other's expectations and to just hear it was the cherry on top. I drive home bawling, just ecstatic. I wanted to turn around and spend my last 40 dollars on ANYTHING to kill me. Unfortunately I realized how painful attempting suicide so I decided to go to work. \n\nFuck me", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbsimn/today_was_just_awful_i_seriously_contemplated/", "title": "Today was just awful, I seriously contemplated suicide", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Difficult-Can-1812", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634702691, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/qbsimn/today_was_just_awful_i_seriously_contemplated/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426211.2594368, "replies_charged": false}
