It\u2019s like everyone either thinks I\u2019m an attention seeker or kidding. Even my psychiatrist just looks at me blankly, raises my medication dosage and says \u201ctry not to do anything until next week\u201d every single session. The only reason I\u2019m not dead yet is because I can\u2019t find a reliable and minimally painful method.\n\nI\u2019ve been waiting for the right time and the right method but honestly I don\u2019t even fucking care anymore. Next time I get the chance, I\u2019m gone.\n\nEDIT: \nFirst of all, thank you to everyone giving me support and awards! It genuinely means so much. You\u2019re all such wonderful souls and I\u2019m sending you all the love you need to get through whatever it is you\u2019re going through :) <3\n\nSecondly, I feel like this post is getting misconstrued a bit so I want to clear some things up. I totally get that I wasn\u2019t very articulate - It was just sort of an angry vent and I didn\u2019t imagine it would get so much attention. Anyway, My point in the original post is NOT that people aren\u2019t allowed cope with humour - I even cope with humour myself sometimes. My point is that it\u2019s frustrating that wanting to die has become the punchline to half of the jokes on the internet, so even when you\u2019re trying to talk about being suicidal in a serious manner, people treat you as if you\u2019re kidding. \n\nI also understand that absolutely no one\u2019s obligated to listen to me. I always make sure that my friends are okay with me venting to them before I say anything even remotely emotional. If they\u2019re not, I totally understand and they have every right to ignore me or tell me that they don\u2019t feel comfortable with that. But responding to my \u201cI\u2019m struggling really bad right now\u201d with a laugh and a joke is hurtful and unnecessary.\n\nI also know that people might joke but actually be serious and coping through humour, but there\u2019s just no need to turn what could be a meaningful conversation into a joke. If I come to someone about something and they respond with \u201cI feel that way too, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d that\u2019s absolutely valid. I have no issue at all with that. Just please don\u2019t laugh at me. \n\nAnyways, hope you all have a great day.
