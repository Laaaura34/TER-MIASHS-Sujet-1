My mother is elderly (shes technically my grandmother, im adopted) and I will be dropping out to work full-time minimum wage to support her. \n\nI feel like my life has been rigged from the start: my biological mother abandoned me after trying to murder me as a newborn, i was sexually assaulted during my childhood, and my father (not biological father) has been completely emotionally absent my entire life. I moved across the country during the pandemic, and I have fallen behind in education and will be held back. I\u2019d stay in school if this wasn\u2019t the case, but I know I\u2019ll likely never be a 4.0 student ever again. Especially considering I\u2019ll have to support my mother financially once we kick out my father.\n\nThis has been very tough on me. I genuinely feel like I have no future now. I\u2019ve already dealt with constant depression and anxiety since I was 8, and an eating disorder since 13. I also have chronic fatigue issues from dealing with anorexia for such a long time. I have no clue what I will do anymore. I don\u2019t have any support group other than the friends i have online. I know that killing myself will ease the expenses my mother has to pay, and Im sure her social security will be enough to pay for her life alone. Tonight I will hopefully end my life, and end the pain that I\u2019ve endured for almost a decade.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mkw5aj/im_only_16_and_i_have_nothing_left/", "title": "Im only 16 and I have nothing left", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "emsthrowaway64", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617660206, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mkw5aj/im_only_16_and_i_have_nothing_left/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422276.039376, "replies_charged": false}
