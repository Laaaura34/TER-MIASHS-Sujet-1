Really dunno what my husband was thinking buying a handgun to keep in a house with a bipolar person, but here we are! A new, easy, statistically effective way to just call the whole thing off. Good timing, too, since I just learned about catalytic converters (damn accidental deaths ruining it for the rest of us) and don't have easy access to benzos and opioids.\n\nHave a therapy appointment this afternoon. Not gonna tell her; not trying to get 72-houred (or more). I'd rather be dead than a whole lot of other things, but I'd **super** rather be dead than hospitalized. More fake it 'til I make it.\n\nSo, yeah, just gotta pick a date. Indecision will only keep me alive until I have more pain than indecision, so, I'll see.
