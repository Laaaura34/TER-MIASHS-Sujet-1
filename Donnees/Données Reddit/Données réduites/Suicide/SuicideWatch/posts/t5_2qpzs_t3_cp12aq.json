I failed my second year miserably due to my declining mental health. In total I didn't show up to 5 exams and so I have to redo my second year. I went into my 3rd suicidal crisis during the last exam period in june. Currently I am hospitalised in a psychiatric ward, about 2 months now. My self worth has become so interconnected with my studies that even the thought of failing makes feel depressed or on some occasions empty.\n\nI was trying to better myself by reading books about mindfulness and meditating and obviously by seeing a psychiatrist, but at this point I just want to give up because it all seems just so futile. I still feel anxiety while studying and still can't grasp basic concepts nor memorise my courses. I just feel so useless and hopeless at this point that my suicidal thought are returning. I don't even feel like bettering myself anymore, I just want to bury my emotions, give up on everything and live like a hermit in pursuit of my studies or off myself if I fail.\n\nI wish someone could point out my flaws and tell me how to fix them instead of grinding my time away by trying to figure it out myself. I really could use some advice on how I should live my life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cp12aq/i_really_could_use_some_life_advice_right_now/", "title": "I really could use some life advice right now", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Throwaway_0699300", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1565551405, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cp12aq/i_really_could_use_some_life_advice_right_now/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426138.159078, "replies_charged": false}
