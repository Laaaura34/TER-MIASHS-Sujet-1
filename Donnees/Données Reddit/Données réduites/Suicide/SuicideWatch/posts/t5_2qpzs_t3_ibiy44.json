I'm 22 years and still have lots to live but I don't want to. I feel like I'm empty from inside. I have nothing to do in this world. Who am I benefitting? Who am I making his/her life better? I don't have any of these answers. I have lots of friends.. But I guess I just zoned out from them. I cut them off, even though they still talk to me but I try to finish the convo fast..\n\nI'm 22.. And already thinking of suicide. My society (Arabs) consider mental health a \"taboo\" subject and they'll answer by \"go pray, allah will heal you\"...?\n\nLike do I matter to anyone at this point cuz I think no one is gonna care if another person dies. It's nature. I just can't speak/talk/chat with anyone or even talk to a stranger like I'm so fed up.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ibiy44/i_think_of_suicide_a_lot_and_im_not_sure_about/", "title": "I think of suicide a lot..
