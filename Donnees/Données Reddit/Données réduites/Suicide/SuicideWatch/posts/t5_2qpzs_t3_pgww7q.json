I\u2019m going to kill myself. I can\u2019t handle this anxiety, I\u2019m so scared nuclear war will happen I don\u2019t go outside anymore, I don\u2019t go do fun things in the city, I don\u2019t hang out with my friend, I just sit at home and drown in my anxiety. It doesn\u2019t help I have bipolar too. \nI don\u2019t want too die from this, I love my mom and my dad and my boyfriend and cat so fucking much, I can\u2019t lose them. Not to this. I just wanna live a normal life but this is ruining my chance at life. That\u2019s why I\u2019m killing myself, I just can\u2019t keep going.
