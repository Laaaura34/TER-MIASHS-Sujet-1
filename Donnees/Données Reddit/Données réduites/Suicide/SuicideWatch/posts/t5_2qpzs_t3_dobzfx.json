It's all a fucking joke. I went to bed last night whispering the words \"please just let me die\" to myself over and over again. I just want somebody to shoot me. I'm begging, at this point. I deserve it. Actually, I deserve a lot worse. I deserve to continue on in this stupid, lonely, miserable existence for eternity. I don't deserve to be relieved of my pain. I deserve fucking nothing. I deserve to be forgotten and left to suffer. My open-mindedness and willingness to improve used to be my only hope in life. And now I've lost that. I've completely closed my brain off. I feel like I already committed suicide when I gave up on myself a few weeks ago. My mind has just been this soulless clump of meat ever since. Now, all that's left to do is get rid of my body. I don't think I'll do it, though. I'm too indecisive and cowardly. But, if somebody was holding a gun to my head right now, I would beg them to shoot me. I don't even want to die. I just want so desperately to not live anymore, and dying just so happens to be the only other option.  Anyway, I don't know how to end this, so, I hope you're happy.
