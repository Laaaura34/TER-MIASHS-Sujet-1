I don't even like hanging out with my friends anymore. Hell, I don't even think I like my friends anymore. I'm just bored 24/7. Alcohol helps a little bit, but not much.\n\nAnd then there's politics, social issues, race relations and things like that. A few years ago I got interested in politics. I thought I had found my niche, but it's just been a downward spiral from there. I once considered myself to be a pretty competent moderate, not leaning too far to one side or the other. But now I've basically just turned into a paranoid conspiracy theorist who thinks everyone's out to get me. I argue online, I lose a lot of those arguments.\n\nI just don't even know what to think anymore. I'm just confused, I don't know what the right answer is. I don't know what to think and I don't know what I believe in anymore. Combine all of this with the fact that I'm a 30 Year Old Virgin. \n\nNow you look me dead in the eye and you tell me I don't have a reason to end it", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lodf7a/boredom_and_confusion/", "title": "Boredom and confusion", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Just_Sum_Dude91", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613846051, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lodf7a/boredom_and_confusion/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635427013.239858, "replies_charged": false}
