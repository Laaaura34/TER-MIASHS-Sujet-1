It\u2019s exhausting. I drown myself in escapism movies/tv/games because I can\u2019t stand reality anymore. Don\u2019t really have much family anymore because they were either abusive or harmfully ignorant. The ones I have left are younger adults that don\u2019t deserve having all this pushed on them. I don\u2019t have any friends that I can really depend on any more because they are either busy, moved away, or are starting families and I\u2019m left alone not really knowing who to turn to. Therapy has been somewhat helpful like learning to set healthy boundaries but doesn\u2019t really solve the problem of people only assigning worth to you based on what you can do to benefit them. I\u2019m tired of being the one that pretty much initiates all communication with friends and family unless they want something from me or need a shoulder to cry on. I don\u2019t mind helping others through difficult times but a) I deserve to be part or the good times in their life as well and b) I should be able to receive the same compassion and effort when I need a shoulder. Boundaries have helped with my sense of worth but not really about how people treat me as it just seems like a revolving door. People drop off I make new friends but the same thing happens and I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t really want to die but I\u2019m really tired of life being so awful and lonely and feeling like people don\u2019t even want to try to understand me or what I\u2019m going through. I just wish my life wasn\u2019t something I wanted to escape from \ud83d\ude14", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pkltje/just_tired/", "title": "Just Tired", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Vyndria2", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631143788, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pkltje/just_tired/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635423004.5192184, "replies_charged": false}
