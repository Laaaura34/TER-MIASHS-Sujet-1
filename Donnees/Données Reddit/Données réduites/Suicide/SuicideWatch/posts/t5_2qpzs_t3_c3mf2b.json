Any experience feels like a waste of time and effort spent. I just keep giving (time and effort) to life like everyone else, only, what life gives back isn't worth it to me. Of course I don't enjoy negative experiences and living through pain, but I don't want to be happy, or even fulfilled either. I just don't care. How am I expected to choose life? I don't understand. Staying in the middle, never completely giving up but never completely giving myself to life, is so painful. Part of me, a very small part wants to explore meaning and live. The part of me that wants to die is the part that I most identify with. Both parts of me (death and life) want to do what I'm morally allowed to do. Also, I swear I dont have Dissociative Identity Disdorder (multiple personality disorder). I cant figure out if I have the right to die or not. Both parts of me, the part that wants to die and the part that wants  to live, are in so much pain. I just want someone to clarify this issue so I can't stop being indecisive and just choose and option. Eventually, if I don't find an answer I know I will give up and choose death.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/c3mf2b/i_hate_life_the_good_the_bad_all_of_it/", "title": "I Hate Life.
