I am a useless drug addict and it's a miracle I have a job still. I am ridiculed at work. My girlfriend annoys the hell out of me and it's not even her fault. I just want to die. I'm so tired of being so tired of being so tired. Life is just anger, violence, suffering, and lies we tell ourselves. I wish I had the courage to slice open my throat right here and now. Free myself from all these useless stupid things. Free myself from my failure\n\nI can't even cook. She won't cook. No one will cook. I hate being alive. I hate people. I hate God and food and air and drugs and everything in existence.
