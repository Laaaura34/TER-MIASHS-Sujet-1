We were very close, and it has been unbearably hard on me, my family, and countless friends.  I wanted to come here and tell my side of the story.  And tell the brutal truth, not just the emotions felt.  I want those who feel alone or loved to know what it is like for us who are left behind, not as a way of laying on guilt or belittling your feelings, but so you know what life is like after you are gone.  I will give a small backstory of His life as a jumping off point, but mainly I am focusing on my story.  \n\nHe was 32.  He had Bipolar Disorder, which didn't fully manifest until his last 3-4 years of life. He did try twice before to kill himself.  The first we didn't know about, and he was thankful to be \"saved\" by a stranger.  The second was serious, but he came to in the middle of it and realized it wasn't what he wanted.  He crawled to a phone and called 911 himself.  He was a grown adult, he lived 4 hours away from the family, and he did not want us treating him like a baby.  Standing over his shoulder and jumping at every inconsistency in his life not only felt wrong (though unavoidable), but I know it only made him feel worse and fed his depression.  So I tried to back off and give him some room to make mistakes like a normal person......  \n\nI noticed his lack of presence about 3 days before his birthday.  No one else had mentioned it, so I tried to remain calm (it had happened before, and he had been ok).  He had been struggling very hard with money, and I thought maybe he had shut his internet service off.  I decided to wait to call.  I figured if I hadn't heard concerns from anyone else, I would wait until his birthday, because I had planned on calling him then anyway.  So his birthday rolls around, and when I try to call he didn't answer.  I knew this would happen, and the feeling of dread rose worse in my stomach.  Then his \"girlfriend\" sent me a message, asking if I had heard from him.  She hadn't since nearly a week before.  I knew then what I knew 3 days earlier, but I tried to keep up hope.  I started contacting people I knew who lived around him, asking anyone if they had seen/spoken to him or if they could go check on him.  No one could till the next morning.  At 7:45am, I received a phone call that I never, ever wanted.  A neighbor went over and found him.  I still don't know exactly what happened, because according to our mutual friend, the neighbor and his SO have not been the same since.  They stopped talking to anyone familiar with Him.  The man even ignored my mother when she tried to introduce herself and apologize for what he had gone through.  My mutual friend was given the horrible weight of having to call and tell me.  I can't imagine how difficult that must have been.  Being 4 hours away from each other, all he could say was \"I'm so sorry\" over and over.  I cried harder than I have ever cried in my life.  I then had to call my other brother and let him know.  Then me, my husband and 4 yr old, my \nbrother and his wife, and my mom's SO had the displeasure of going to Mom's home and letting her know.  She was completely unaware that He had been \"missing\" for nearly a week.  We woke her from her sleep, and I watched as her surprise of seeing me grew to uncomfortable worry as each new person came into the house.  The horror in her body language as she slowly realized what was going on was heartbreaking.  We never even had to say anything.  Parents should never have to bury their children.  They especially shouldn't have to know that their beloved child had been so lost and miserable that they felt the need to end their own suffering.  What an utterly helpless feeling.  I watched a good person be reduced to nothing, full with the feelings of failure.  \n\nSkip past the full day of crying and the haze of disbelief  as we made endless calls to hospitals, police stations, morgues, funeral homes, etc.  Skip past being told that the body had been there for an undetermined amount of time and had started decomposing.  Skip past being told that the body was unidentifiable and the forensic investigator was waiting for dental records to make a positive ID.  Skip past being told that, \"There isn't anything left that you could identify.  And even if there were, I would never let you.  You don't need to see this.\"  Skip past knowing that there was no chance to ever see him again, even just to hold his hand and say goodbye.  \n\nThe next day we made the 4 hour trip to his house.  I rode with a bottle of Pepto in my hand and a never-ending feeling of complete nausea in my stomach.  I had the tiniest bit of hope because no one had yet mentioned the thing I feared.  I figured it would have come up in all the talks.  We were the last to get there, and once out of the car, Mom asked me, \"Are you ready?\"  I truthfully answered, \"No.\"  Then she said it.  What I was more worried about than finding anything.  She said, \"Now, they said it smells pretty bad in there.\"  OH. GOD.  I had held it together as well as possible during the ride, but that..... I didn't want that.  I broke down instantly.  I ran to my mom's arms and sobbed uncontrollably.  Your sense of smell is the strongest in being tied to memories, and I didn't want to have to experience walking into my brother's house and smelling his dead, rotting body.  No.  But too late, there was nothing to do about it.  The smell was everywhere.  The entire house was filled with the aroma of death.  It wasn't quite what I thought it would be.  It was like a mouse that has died somewhere in the corner of your house, but not quite.  It was both better and worse than I was expecting.  Better because it wasn't as pungant and sickly as I thought it would be, but worse because of the uniqueness of it.  I never got to see the spot where he died.  Not fully.  Mom and my brother walked back ahead of us as I slowly meandered the house, remembering him.  Seeing his house untouched made it seem like he wasn't really gone, just out.  In the room, Mom was just staring as people tried to get her out, and my husband shielded me from going in.  He told me that I didn't want to see it and didn't need to.  I wanted to, but it's probably better that I didn't I guess.  \n\nFast forward to the next day.  We came back with supplies in hand, and this time armed with menthol rub for our noses.  I don't have to mention the regular milling around, not knowing where to start on cleaning up and looking at all the things that reminded us of Him.  But on this day, I experienced the most surreal moment of my life.  By the time my husband and I got there, my mom and her SO were in the process of cutting out the carpet where he had lay.  I only saw the underside of it.  But even at that, I saw the large circle of blood that had soaked through.  Apparently there were maggots covering the top.  Everything had seaped through the carpet and padding and onto the concrete below.  They took the carpet outside to air out and to help with removing the smell.  Then my mom got a bucket and sponge to scrub the floor.  I told her she didn't need to do it, to let me clean up.  But she wouldn't let me.  So I sat on his bed and watched.  Looking down at my mom, on her hands and knees scrubbing up the blood of my dead brother, I felt removed from the situation.  In all honesty, it felt like watching a crime drama on TV.  It was the sort of thing I had seen on TV and in movies many times before, but it wasn't what happens in real life.  People don't experience that in real life, so it couldn't be real.  At one point, she said to me, \"I think I know why I am ok with doing this.\"  After I asked her why, she replied, \"He was my baby.  When he was little I cleaned his diapers.  I took care of him and cleaned up after him if he got sick and threw up.  This is just one more thing I am cleaning up.  He was sick, and I am helping him by cleaning up the mess.\"  It was heartwrenching, both grotesquely melancholy and beautifully rational.  (As a side note, there are companies that specifically do this sort of work.  Everyone failed to tell us this, and we didn't find out until after we were done.)  \n\nBut here is what I really want people to know.  After we found out and settled some, I made an announcement about it on-line.  I was blown away by the response that followed.  Countless people, probably 100 or more in just a day or two, poured in with messages and comments.  Some were your run-of-the-mill sympathy.  A sort of, \"Oh hey, I knew that guy in school.  He was pretty cool.  That's sad.\"  But some, most actually, were truly devestated.  So many people wrote to Him or me, pouring their hearts out.  SO MANY PEOPLE LOVED HIM.  He had no idea the affect his death would have on others.  Friends and family, some who I knew, some who I didn't, completely heartbroken over finding out.  A number of people wrote to tell me how He had been the person who got them through their own tough times.  He had saved so many of his friends and had offered an ear or a voice to them.  I don't think he ever knew how much people cared about him.  People from all aspects and ages of his life.  He thought he was alone, and nothing could have been further from the truth.  I have never in my life seen such a reaction to someone's death.  It's been a year now, and his acct is still active with thoughts of love and remorse.  Not a week goes by that someone hasn't written to him, just to say they are thinking of him or how there is still a light missing from their lives.  So many messages of people saying, \"I wish I would have returned your call,\"  or \"I wish I had known how to help you better.\"  He had so many people to turn to for help, had he just tried.  \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/khqx0/in_honor_of_my_brother_he_committed_suicide_a/", "title": "In honor of my brother.
