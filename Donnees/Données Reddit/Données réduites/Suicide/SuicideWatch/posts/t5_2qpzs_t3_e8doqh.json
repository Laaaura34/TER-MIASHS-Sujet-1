I know what chrmicals and materials I need in order to use gas. \n\nI've picked out the parking garage that's close enough, AND high enough. \n\nI havent got any rope, but I do have a hose that's sturdy and I think would hold my weight. \n\nUnfortunately I don't have my stock of pills anymore...they failed the one time I tried anyway. Failed miserably. \n\nOf all my plans tho, I wish I just had a gun...it seems like the quickest, most sure fire way to get the job done. But I always wonder if I could actually pull the trigger given the chance. \n\nI want to die...but I also understand that my suicidal tendencies come more from me wanting to escape my situation. But there is no escape. There is no better alternative. \n\nBut I'm still here, for some reason. Too chickenshit to jump and probably too dumb to mix the right amount of chemicals. Probably too fat for the hose/noose too. And guns, even if the us, are kind of hard to come by for me. \n\nSo here I am...planning yet again.
