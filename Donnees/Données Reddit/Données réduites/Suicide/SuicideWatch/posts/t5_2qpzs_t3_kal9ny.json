I hope others who suffered the same mental illnesses I have can learn from my mistakes.\n\nMy severe mental health problems have haunted me for almost my entire life, and I've failed to self-reflect on how much they destroyed everything in my life until it was too late. I know a lot of people suffer from social anxiety disorder and clinical depression like I do, and I'm glad mental health is finally a mainstream topic especially during this pandemic.\n\nBasically, I'm a fairly typical Millennial in the sense I feel like I was born either too late or too early. I feel like if I was a Boomer, I would have had a better economy and job market, and if I was a Zoomer I would have never had any illusions to how tough the economy would be and important social issues like seeking help for mental health problems would not be taboo like it was when I was growing up.\n\nMy social anxiety probably started in the third grade when I was sent to what I realized much later was a far right Evangelical Christian school that even many other Evangelicals find controversial. I don't mean to offend any religious people, but these days some of the extremist things I was taught by them like sexual promiscuity, homosexuality, or abortion are why 9/11 happened are considered heretical by most other churches these days. I spent 6 years at this school and a big part of the developmental years learning about fundamentalist Christian ideas and very old-fashioned ideas like abstaining from sex until marriage. A side note is that one of the guest speakers who spoke at our school, Joshua Harris, wrote a book called \"I Kissed Dating Goodbye\" where he basically talked about how every time you go on a date or kiss someone who ultimately won't be your soulmate, you are giving up a piece of soul of yourself to them that you won't be able to give to your future spouse. It was something really crazy like that. I recently found out that in the last couple of years, he has recanted his statements and personally apologized to many people who told him his advice severely hurt their personal lives and emotional well-being because they ended up putting off dating until their late 20s believing that God would miraculously help them meet their soulmate and now they're in their early 30s like me and still single. Last year, the author even divorced his wife over religious disagreements and announced he's no longer a Christian.\n\nBut perhaps it's just an excuse and many people have indoctrinations they overcome, but my whole experience at that school was extremely toxic in so many ways. I never made any close friends there and faced some bullying and racist name calling because I happen to be Asian-American. My parents are immigrants from a very different culture with different circumstances, and they didn't seem to care or understand when I asked them what I could do about the bullying and the fact I couldn't make friends.\n\nEven though I didn't like the school, I was still indoctrinated because my parents to still day are still rapture ready Evangelicals and forced to go to an equally extremist church with them every week. I admit I found comfort in the idea of an afterlife and a chance to see loved ones again, as all 4 of my grandparents passed away when I was young. It wasn't until I was old enough to think with reason and stopped being in anything supernatural that I had a depressing realization that most of my childhood was wasted being indoctrinated by vindictive bigots and that I will never see my grandparents ever again nor have anything to look forward to in the next life. Looking back on my life now, I feel like I have a lot of moments of existential dread in my youth that I do as an adult. I felt the same feelings of depressing realization that many millennials face when they graduate from college and fight themselves working one dead end job after another and the chances of ever getting their dream job or at least a job with upward mobility decrease each day. I guess what I'm saying is I repeatedly made the mistake of thinking life wouldn't be as difficult or harrowing as it really is both when I stopped believing in a higher power as a teenager and when I realized I would never really have a career as an adult. Delusional optimism was my coping mechanism I suppose.\n\nI finally convinced my parents to let me attend a public high school, and people were nicer there. I made more friends and even had good friendships with a few girls that seemed to know I was romantically interested in them but it was always platonic because I never had the courage to ask any girls out because I believed I would get rejected and it would make the friendship awkward. I had my first bout of severe clinical depression when I was 16 because I had realized the girl I had a huge crush was far more popular than me and I didn't have a chance with her. By 17, I was full on suicidal because my circle of friends started avoiding me because people were spreading rumors about me being \"retarded\" because I was socially awkward. It all seems petty now, but I was self-harming and crying every night. I thought about committing suicide for at least a week, but I guess I wasn't completely hopeless enough to do it. My social life never improved the rest of high school.\n\nAfter I finished high school, I ended up going to a community college for a couple of years before taking distance learning classes for a year to finish a degree in IT. I stayed with my parents the whole time because we barely had enough to cover tuition and I never got to live on my own in a college dorm. I was bitter toward my parents about that because they had been spending tuition all those years to send me to an indoctrination school I hated but barely helped me with my college fund.\n\nAfter that I tried to find a decent IT job, but it was already a very competitive market with a shrinking number of available jobs at the time due to the financial crisis of 2008, and I ended up jobless after 5 interviews. After a year of job searching, I finally decided to take a job at a call center and finally moved out. The pay was enough to get by, but it was a very stressful job for someone like me with social anxiety, so I quit after a month. I then got a job as a computer lab assistant at a community college, but the department got downsized, and I was laid off. I was out of work over a year and desperate so I took jobs as an overnight stocker and a few jobs in warehouses I deeply regret because I've had chronic back pain ever since. I was working a few minimum wage retail jobs before the pandemic started and was laid off and haven't even bothered to look for work since.\n\nLooking back, I've gone through a decade of odd jobs without making a single meaningful business connection just like I went through elementary school to college without making a single close friend that I'm still in touch with. I more or less had the same career trajectory of a lot of other Millennials have, but when I see people I went to school with with families of their own now, it hurts me on a profound level.\n\nInitially, I enjoyed the lockdown, I thought spending a year as a total recluse would be like a vacation to me. I spent all my days and weeks off from work by myself anyway. But a few months into it when the meager stimulus money ran out and what little savings I had was dwindling, I realized that my job prospects above minimum wage are zero and that my health had fallen off a cliff when after foolishly binge drinking for a month to numb the chronic pain in my back I ended up making it worse and now I have neuropathic nerve damage that's not going away even months after sobriety and I'll never be able to afford health care to heal myself.\n\nI've been suicidal but never in a somber accepting way where I'm mature enough to admit my mistakes and accept my fate. I was hysterical and overemotional about petty things when I was suicidal back in high school. But it seems that deep-seated feeling of dread that took hold of me back then never seemed to go away. The only coping mechanisms I had was self-harm as a teenager and alcohol as an adult. I just never learned to stop being self-destructive.\n\nBut I'm suicidal now for much more rational and contemplative reasons than the petty emotional ones I was back then. If I had learned back in high school what heartbreak failing to reach out to people and never forming a meaningful relationship would bring, perhaps my social life and work life wouldn't have ended up this way.\n\nI only realize know I never prioritized self-care and self-improvement. I was always worried about what other people thought of me and fruitlessly trying to change myself to fit their expectations. I know most younger people today aren't delusionally naive about how difficult life can be for introverts and people with mental health conditions, and how we are often drawn to self-destructive ways to cope with problems that could have been prevented with a little more initiative and courage. I also realize now the people around me saw the self-loathing and low self-esteem and immediately lost any respect or interest in me. Confidence and positivity is what makes a people's person. \n\nI'm a 31 year old guy with no friends, no relationship experience, and no real people skills. I'm still a virgin and never even kissed a girl. If I die like this, I must take that secret to my grave. I can never ever tell anyone that in real life because I know it's incredibly pathetic and I will be laughed at and humiliated. It's a cruel irony I will likely involuntarily spend my final days as a recluse because despite having a college degree, I'm broke with both serious mental and physical health problems, and on the verge of homelessness. I don't how much longer I have, but the crippling pain physically, mentally, and emotionally is overwhelming more and more every day.\n\nI wrote down a bucket list of things I want to do before I die. It's basic stuff but still impossible for someone like me. I want to go on just one real date with a woman but there's no way any woman would date a broke unemployable loser with serious health problems and I still haven't learned how to hold a conversation. I want to share a beautiful memory with my parents because I don't have any good memories of them but I'm not even on speaking terms with them now and our views on everything couldn't be more different. I want to take a trip to another country but I have no money to do that plus pandemic flight restrictions.\n\nI just wish I hadn't wasted my entire life on doing things I hate just because I felt like I had to. If I had questioned authority a bit more and been more rebellious, would my life have been different? I think being too by the book is the biggest regret in my life.\n\nSo I guess it's over for me, and I'll never get to do any of the things I dreamed of doing. I made the mistake of putting off the most important things in life when my job situation got better when it was clear it wasn't going to. So I guess my final suggestion may seem obvious but it's always worth reexamining your priorities. Don't worry about the small stuff because you'll end up losing all the big stuff. Thank you so much if you read the whole thing. I just hope you all can something out of the hard lessons I've learned in life.\n\ntldr: My social anxiety disorder prevented me from ever making any significant human relationships. Now that I am unemployed with nothing on my resume but dead end jobs with failing health and about to evicted within a few months, I have no one to help me, and this is the end result of a lifetime of not dealing with my mental health issues properly.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kal9ny/i_never_understood_how_important_human/", "title": "I never understood how important human connections are to succeeding in this world until it was too late and now my life is over", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ihopemystorycanhelp", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1607625973, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kal9ny/i_never_understood_how_important_human/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635428465.4591217, "replies_charged": false}
