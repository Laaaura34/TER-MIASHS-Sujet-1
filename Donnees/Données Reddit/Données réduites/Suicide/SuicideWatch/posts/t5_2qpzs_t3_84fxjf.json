I have borderline personality disorder and recurrent depressive disorder. \n\nI have never been able to hold down a job, or make any friends, because as a teen I would lose my job or my friends as a result of my mental health- it was out of my control.\n\nBut now, as a 30 year old, the problem is me. I can\u2019t get a job, because I am so anxious about losing it before I\u2019ve even started, that it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy... I become avoidant, more depressed, then get fired as I\u2019m not reliable... all self sabotage according to my mental health team.\n\nThe same goes for friends. As an adult, I have isolated myself from all social situations. I perfected being invisible in secondary school, as I was horrifically bullied. Now I don\u2019t even give people a chance, I know they\u2019ll eventually let me down, hurt me or abandon me, so what\u2019s the point? I also don\u2019t know who I am, and hate myself so much; my appearance, my failures, my whole life, in fact. I don\u2019t understand why anyone else would like me or want to waste their time with me, when I can\u2019t even stand me.\n\nI\u2019ve wanted to die every day since I was 13. That\u2019s 17 years of pain, suffering and hatred of myself. I\u2019ve tried to commit suicide so many times that I\u2019ve lost count. Each attempt has strengthened the idea that I\u2019m a complete and utter failure, I can\u2019t even kill myself right.\n\nI guess the point of this rambling is that I don\u2019t know what else to try. My mental health team have said the only person who can break this negative cycle is me- but I don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m so tired of trying, and failing, over and over again. It\u2019s exhausting. \n\nI don\u2019t get enjoyment out of anything anymore- all my hobbies are boring, life is boring. I have zero motivation to do anything, along with no energy. There is no point to life. I\u2019m probably never going to be able to work again, so I can\u2019t contribute to my family financially, and I know I am a constant financial and emotional drain on them. I\u2019m sick of trying new things, only to get bored and give up within a week or two.\n\nIt feels like someone has stuck my give up switch permanently on... I have given up, but I\u2019m stuck in this place with no way out, because I can\u2019t even commit suicide successfully. If anyone has any suggestions, I\u2019d love to hear them. (apart from God, because I used to believe in God, but if he seriously loved us he wouldn\u2019t let this screwed up world operate; where law-abiding, working class citizens have to constantly struggle, whilst the rich and powerful can do whatever they want with no consequence, and the other end get everything handed to them by the government. God rant over.)\n\nSorry for the long rambly post, hopefully someone understands what I\u2019m saying!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/84fxjf/stuck_in_a_never_ending_self_destructive_cycle/", "title": "Stuck in a never ending self destructive cycle", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "taddi87", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1521053785, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/84fxjf/stuck_in_a_never_ending_self_destructive_cycle/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422558.5327466, "replies_charged": false}
