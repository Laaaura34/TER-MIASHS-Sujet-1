I feel like Covid has really taken a toll on my mental health. I have been starving, purging, smoking cigarettes, and vaping excessively to try and shorten my lifespan. I feel bad because my mom is concerned with the restricting and purging, but it has almost become an addiction. I have really bad harm OCD, BPD, and an eating disorder. I've also been struggling with disassociation and depersonalization. The eating disorder is so complex because it manifests as a mixture of Anorexia and Bulimia. I feel like a failure and I've attempted suicide 5 times. I keep thinking about attempting again but I'm too afraid of hurting my family, possibly being involuntarily committed if I fail, and being taken away from my family, friends, and loved ones. I feel so stuck and trapped. I keep fearing that I am a bad person but I am so genuine and compassionate. This is my OCD. I have never acted on any thoughts to hurt others, its just a fear that leads me to be suicidal. I am in therapy via Google meet and I am taking my medications as prescribed. I'm trying to use my DBT skills but I feel like they are not working. If anyone could please just respond to this I am begging for some ounce of hope. I know I'm not going to be completely fixed and perfect I just need something to pull me out of this darkness.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gi2ct6/crying_out_for_help_trigger_warning/", "title": "Crying Out for Help (Trigger Warning)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Kindsoul10", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1589251076, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gi2ct6/crying_out_for_help_trigger_warning/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635422949.621858, "replies_charged": false}
