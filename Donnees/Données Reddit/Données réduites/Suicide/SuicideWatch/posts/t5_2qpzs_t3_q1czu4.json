I\u2019ve done years of therapy, training, and hard work to overcome it. It\u2019s controlled (usually), but still \u2018there,\u2019 and it\u2019s a constant struggle to keep it hidden and appear \u201cnormal.\u201d \n\nMy disability is mostly invisible. I don\u2019t \u201clook disabled.\u201d I can put on the neurotypical act, and fool people into thinking I\u2019m \u201cnormal\u201d\u2014for short periods of time. Then something will overwhelm me, and I\u2019ll completely shut down. This has cost me jobs, friendships, and even a place to live. Just everyday life on my own is exhausting, and I\u2019ve reached a stage of burnout where I\u2019m always tired and just can\u2019t manage.\n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do. It doesn\u2019t look like more improvement can happen, and even if I could I can\u2019t afford the thousands of dollars it would cost to get back into therapy.\n\nI\u2019m tired of living with this condition, tired of being a burden to others, and death seems like the only way out. I\u2019m not planning to kill myself but the thought keeps crossing my mind. \n\nI just want to able to live a normal life and stop being a burden to myself and others.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q1czu4/struggling_with_a_permanent_disability_and_tired/", "title": "Struggling with a (permanent) disability and tired of living like this", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "adventuwe", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "subreddit_path": "r/SuicideWatch/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633375776, "permalink": "/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q1czu4/struggling_with_a_permanent_disability_and_tired/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635426285.439846, "replies_charged": false}
