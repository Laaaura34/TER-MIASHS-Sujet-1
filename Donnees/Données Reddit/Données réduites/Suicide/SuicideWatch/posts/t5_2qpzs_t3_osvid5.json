I'm always angry, I grew up living with an abusive father and right now, things are constantly worst. I told my family that I am not feeling okay / has thoughts of wanting to die a year ago  and didn't get any support. I'm still a student so I have no money on my own to seek professional help. Still locked up in the house due to pandemic + bad government in my country. Everyday is hell. My anger sometimes is poured to my pets. I hurt them and I think soon enough I will hurt people or maybe kill them. So yeah, instead of doing another bad action which harms my pets or do something extreme that other people may be included, I will just kill me. I want to be at peace already", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/osvid5/i_am_potentially_dangerous_i_think_someday_ill/", "title": "I am potentially dangerous.
