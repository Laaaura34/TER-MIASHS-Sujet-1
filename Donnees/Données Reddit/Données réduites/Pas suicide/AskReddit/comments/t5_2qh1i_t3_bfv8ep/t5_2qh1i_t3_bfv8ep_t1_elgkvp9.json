I took a shit-ton of sleeping pills and most of a bottle of rum.  My then-boyfriend took me to the hospital.  I'm not sure what happened there or what procedures were used on me.  I did wake up with nurses forcing me to drink charcoal to get the rest of it out of me.    \n\n\nThough I have been tempted since, I realize it would be too awful a thing to do to my family.  Now I am a parent, and even though the temptation can still be strong - overwhelming sometimes - I realize how badly I would ruin my children were I to attempt suicide again.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/bfv8ep/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_is_your_story/elgkvp9/"}
