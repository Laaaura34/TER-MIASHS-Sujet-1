I'd seen loads of doctors, had MRIs and CAT scans, the works. Doctors usually just assumed I was drug seeking since they couldn't see anything wrong with me. Every day was miserable so I decided to go out easy and take a bunch of vicodin.\n\nI just ended up passing out and puking all over myself. I woke up the next day feeling like shit and decided to try some non traditional pain management stuff. I figured if it didnt work that killing myself was always on the table.\n\nCryotherapy + shrooms ended up fixing me.
