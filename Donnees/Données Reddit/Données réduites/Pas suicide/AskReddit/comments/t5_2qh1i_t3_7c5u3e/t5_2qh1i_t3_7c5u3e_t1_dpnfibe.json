I've tried cutting my wrists and I've tried OD-ing (Vicodin + antihistamines + alcohol + all my prescription meds.) Cutting, I bled a whole fucking lot, even spurting blood, but only passed out. On my drug cocktail, same thing, passed out but came to.\n\nBoth times I felt like absolute hell afterwards. But both times I was taken straight to an ER, and then the psych ward for about two weeks. There was never an instantaneous feeling of being glad to be alive, more like regret that I hadn't finished the job that only eventually faded with time. Took some time to get back to normal again, plus a lot of therapy, especially in the beginning.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/7c5u3e/serioussuicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_happened/dpnfibe/"}
