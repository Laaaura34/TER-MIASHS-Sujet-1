I have bipolar type 2 disorder and started to experience minor auditory and visual hallucinations and that kind of put me over the edge. One night I took a bunch of pills and slit my wrists. Immediately after I realized what I took probably wasn't going to kill me, just destroy my liver, so I called 911. I was admitted to the medical hospital for 3 days and then the psychiatric hospital after that. Upon admission my plan was to go with the flow and tell them what they wanted to here until they would release me and then I'd go home and find a better way to kill myself. During the few days that I was in the psych hospital my aunt and I talked about a lot of things and I decided I wanted to live. I am living a much happier and much more productive life now.
