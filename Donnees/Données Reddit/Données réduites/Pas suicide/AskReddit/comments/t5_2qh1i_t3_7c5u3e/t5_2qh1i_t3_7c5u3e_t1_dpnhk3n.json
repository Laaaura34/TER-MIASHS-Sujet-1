I was so ashamed and hated myself but was too chicken to cut more than superficially so I took all of the ibuprofen in the bathroom. I didn't bother to count, just kept swallowing more until two or three bottles were gone. I have no idea how I escaped serious consequences but all I remember is being very tired and going to bed.\n\nAfterwards, not much changed. I continued to cut for another year or so. Moving away helped me recover some but I can't say I'm *totally* cured of my self-hatred. I have too much responsibility to die now.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/7c5u3e/serioussuicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_happened/dpnhk3n/"}
