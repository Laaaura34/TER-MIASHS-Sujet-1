She was three years older so she killed herself at 15/16. I was very low functioning for a year and had many attempts until one really just pushed me over. I tried to hang myself but I felt a force try to calm me down as if it was the Universe or God or whoever. I sat back down and I cried so hard that night. My teachers brought me into the hospital to get treated as my parents are traditional and kept me from receiving the help I needed.\n\nI still felt depressed a few years after that and suffered on and off anxiety and eating disorders at different levels. It really affected me because I lost grades, friends, myself. I stayed isolated and obsessed with anime and spirituality afterwards until a 2-3 years ago where I started to reach out again to others and here I am, high functioning with trusted friends, boyfriend and my family is extremely loving and providing now. I still suffer from my mental illness but I've learnt a lot of coping methods over these years.\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/7c5u3e/serioussuicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_happened/dpnh6y7/"}
