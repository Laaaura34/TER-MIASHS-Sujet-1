I know this is a meme, but it was literally the thought of that my mom and the rest of my family and my freinds would be sad. I felt like I needed to live so I could take care of them and help them through there lives. A lot of the people I'm closest too has a lot of troubles themselves and they didn't need my death on top of that.\n\nI don't really know why exactly, but after a while it just started feeling better, maybe I got a better mindset or the meds worked, but I started feeling like I had a reason to keep living. I found a girlfriend who I truly love, I do a sport that makes me happy and I'm studying for a work where I think o can truly make change and help people.
