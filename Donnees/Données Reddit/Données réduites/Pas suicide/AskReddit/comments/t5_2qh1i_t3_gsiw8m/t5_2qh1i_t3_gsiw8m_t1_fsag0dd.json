(added, my aunt had committed suicide in 2012, and my father and her were super close and my dad was scarred from the incident, so i\u2019ve always had this burning passion to kill myself in spite of my abusive father, i fucking hated him. i know he would go off the rails if i passed, and i wanted him to crumble.)\n\ni had just pierced both sides of my nostrils from anger, and i felt fucking crazy and alone in my\nown mind, and it was fucking horrible, i hated everyone and wanted to just disappear, i wanted to see my mom and that wouldn\u2019t happen.\n\nlater comes along, i\u2019m still going fucking crazy, as well, i\u2019m on prozac 50 mg and some anti anxiety medicine, high dosage, i took probably over 20 of my anti depressants, 25 anxiety pills, and a whole bottle of the small yellow heart shaped aspirins. i accepted i was gonna be dead. a while passes, and i\u2019m in the shower, trying to clean up before my last hours of life and enjoy the hot and warmth on my skin. my stomach starts to churn, and some of my organs started to hurt, so i knew it was almost time. eventually, i would get out of the shower, and i collapsed, and by some stroke of luck, i threw up all of the pills, it was fucking disgusting, neon yellow mush that was the most bitter thing i have ever tasted. and i survived, but my kidneys were fucked for a couple weeks after and my pee was dark dark brown almost.\n\ni managed to wake up without letting anyone in the house know what had happened, but my dad and step mom figured it out later on, after i realized i hadn\u2019t died and everything was real, i was fucking freaking out, i thought i would be dead and my worries would\u2019ve been no more and i would be at peace, but i am very thankful i didn\u2019t OD, i\u2019m very happy with life right now, and i\u2019m glad that my stroke of luck or my body did what it had to do, \n\ni\u2019m crying right now and panicking i don\u2019t know, but i just wanted to share my story, and i hope someone reads it, i don\u2019t have a message, besides that you are loved.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/gsiw8m/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/fsag0dd/"}
