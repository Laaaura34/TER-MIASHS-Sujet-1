I even hesitated to put it, but I\u2019ve also seen people grieve over others that had committed suicide, and I always thought it would be nice to know if the person who died had known about the impact. \n\nFor example, I worked at Walgreens and another cashier was very shaken one day cause she found out that one of her regulars committed suicide. She found out cause the family had pictures printed of him at our Walgreens and the family told her that they committed suicide. Again she was very shaken up but she shared a lot of stories of the times the guy came into the store. So it\u2019s not that you should feel guilty for others feelings. But just know that people will miss you, think of you, and share your stories, even if it is smaller interactions. \n\nSo it\u2019s both from the side of attempting suicide, and seeing others react to the death of people they knew.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/m62l31/suicide_attempt_survivors_of_reddit_what_message/gr3lcvy/"}
