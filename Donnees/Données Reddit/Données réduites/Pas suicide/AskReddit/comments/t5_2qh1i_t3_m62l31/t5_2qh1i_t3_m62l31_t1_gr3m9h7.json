Imagine you\u2019re in a room being tortured and there\u2019s people passing the window looking in. They\u2019re able to interact with you and you impact each other, but when they walk away you\u2019re still in that room being tortured. That\u2019s what it feels like, you\u2019re living in anguish while tourists stop by. Maybe I resent the statements more because of how I was being spoken to and how they had asked me to live for them and their sake as though they had no regard for how I would have to live through every second they were or were not there.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/m62l31/suicide_attempt_survivors_of_reddit_what_message/gr3m9h7/"}
