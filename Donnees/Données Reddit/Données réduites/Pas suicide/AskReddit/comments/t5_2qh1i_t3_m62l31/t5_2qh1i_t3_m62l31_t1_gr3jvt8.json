Your death will devastate people (this is not a guilt trip), even if you\u2019re just a \u201cregular\u201d at a store, if the cashiers find out you died, they WILL think of you. So don\u2019t think no one will care, a lot of people will.\n\nAlso, if you have scars from depression, don\u2019t view them as something gross or disgusting. Look at them and think \u201cI\u2019ve done well for not doing it again\u201d, even if it\u2019s just a few days later. View them as a positive, like rehab chips, not like a negative. No matter how many days, months, or years go by, it is always amazing how strong you are for not relapsing.\n\nPills can be amazingly helpful. If you feel like life is beating you down harder than before, then seek medical help. If you realize it\u2019s a lot harder to get things done than they were before, just talk to a doctor and get Meds. Medications sometimes are trial and error, but they are worth it.\n\nAnd lastly, you are not alone. You are never alone. I know a lot of these things seem easier said than done, but you have done an amazing job and you\u2019re doing your best. Celebrate the small victories, and just remember you\u2019re never alone.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/m62l31/suicide_attempt_survivors_of_reddit_what_message/gr3jvt8/"}
