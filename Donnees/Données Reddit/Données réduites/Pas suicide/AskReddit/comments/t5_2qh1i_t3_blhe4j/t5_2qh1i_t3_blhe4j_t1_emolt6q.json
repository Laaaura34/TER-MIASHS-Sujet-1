If your father had been unsuccessful, he might have been able to overcome these feelings too longer term. I'm really sorry about what happened to you and I think you should talk to someone about how you feel because that doesn't sound nice to be retaining so much anger. I don't know if you've experienced mental illness yourself but it's beyond an individual's control at times, although I appreciate we don't know/understand your father's specific circumstances.
