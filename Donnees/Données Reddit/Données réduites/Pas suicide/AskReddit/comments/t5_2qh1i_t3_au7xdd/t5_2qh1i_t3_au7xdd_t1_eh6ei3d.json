Life gradually improved and I do I didn\u2019t feel the need kill myself.\n.\nThe second time wasn\u2019t due to depression,I just thought I was going to die a lot worse death. I was hunting and it was getting dark and I have night blindness. I started out of the stand I was in when one of the steps broke and I took a hard fall. Landed on an Oak root and hurt worse than I ever had. That\u2019s when I considered it, I live in bear, coyote , and wild boar country. I normally don\u2019t really have to worry about any of them though, the bears are docile, coyotes avoid anything larger than them, and boars aren\u2019t very smart, but any of them could have gotten me that day.\n\nI don\u2019t know why but I decided to crawl, and crawled home where I was able to stand. I spent a few days in bed and then went to a doctor. Permanent nerve damage and my nerve was so inflamed it was pinching my spine. They put me on a mild painkillers and steroids to get it to heal as much as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as actually what has changed since the first time \n\nI finished high school, started college for my dream job, found out I\u2019m medically DQ\u2019ed in state from doing it. lot of time and money wasted there. Tried to find something else I wanted to do, finally did but my family has actively tried to stop me every step of the way and sabotaged me from trying.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the second time I\u2019m still working on that dream job, trying my hardest to get in shape for it. That set me back and will probably stop me from achieving it. Made a few great friends in that time. Don\u2019t hurt as much anymore.
