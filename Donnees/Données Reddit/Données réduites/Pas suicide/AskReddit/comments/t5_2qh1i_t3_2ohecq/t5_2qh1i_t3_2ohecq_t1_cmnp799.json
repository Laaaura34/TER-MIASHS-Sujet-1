When I was much younger I tried to commit suicide a few times. Two attempts were half hearted,  but the one that got me the closest to the other side I remember being overwhelmed with living in general. I was so young and already had so many bad things happen to me, I didn't feel like life could possibly get any more bearable or that I could be any more invisible. I didn't think of my family or friends, I had already disconnected myself from them. I started taking any and all pills I could find in the house. I cut my wrists and prayed that if there was a god he would show me mercy and let me fade out and never let me wake up again. I cried because I finally wanted to stop all of the hurting inside me that just seemed relentless. \n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2ohecq/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_the_last/cmnp799/"}
