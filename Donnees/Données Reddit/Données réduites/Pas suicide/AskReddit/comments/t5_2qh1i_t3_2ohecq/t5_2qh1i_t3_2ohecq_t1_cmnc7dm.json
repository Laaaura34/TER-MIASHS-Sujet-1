Don't forget how far some people will go for attention. The most common obvious location was the wrist.\n\nOn the otherhand two people who I was close to confided in me that they cut themselves, I never knew and neither did anyone else. They did it to try to help themselves and clearly needed help. They cut themselves on the upper thigh, where no one ever found out. The two people I talked to about it said they just felt nothing and they did it to feel something, \"sometimes pain is better then nothing at all\" ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2ohecq/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_the_last/cmnc7dm/"}
