I started drinking lots of alcohol at 3 in the morning with the aim of gaining the courage to go through with it and to increase the likelihood of my mirtazapine/valium overdose being lethal. My plan was to pass out on my back and choke on my chuck. The mirt is so heavily sedating I didn't even get to the valium.
