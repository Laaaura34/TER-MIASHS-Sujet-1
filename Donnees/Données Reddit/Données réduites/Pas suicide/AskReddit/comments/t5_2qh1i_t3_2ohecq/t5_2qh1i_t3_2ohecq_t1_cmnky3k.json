It is December and snowing it, I'm freezing my ass off, angry and frustrated. The restaurant is supposed to open at 11, it goes by, 11, 11:15, 11:30, and it's still no open, that's when I got really angry.\n\n4) Because no food and didn't eat breakfast I had low blood sugar\n\n5) Already have depression and anxiety issues\n\nI don't know why or how I didn't kill myself on that day. I just started walking down these train tracks thinking how blissful it would be if one of them would just hit me. The last things I thought was probably, \"Let's get this over with\" as grim as it sounds. Eventually I got off the tracks after I started thinking about my girlfriend and my family and how they would react. I went home and told my mom exactly how I felt and for the first time in forever, I balled my eyes out crying telling her the story. \n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2ohecq/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_the_last/cmnky3k/"}
