When i ingested a lot of paracetamol and whatever there s in blood pressure lowering medicine, it caused my blood pressure to drop to 60/40. A blood clot was formed in my leg which wouldn't dissolve with Heparin. It cut off the circulation of blood in my body. The blood clot would only be removed if they amputated my leg. I'm now enrolled in an engineering college. I'm struggling here academically, but it is better than what i hoped for.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2ohecq/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_the_last/cn79jdh/"}
