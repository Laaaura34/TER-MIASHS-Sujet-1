I love her more than the world itself.\n\n My thoughts as I ziplocked my hands with a bag duct taped around my head was how this would affect my sister knowing she was young and loved me too. \n\nI thought to myself: *She doesn't deserve to suffer because of me. I will suffer for her.* \n\nLuckily I was able to break free from one of the ziplocks and checked myself into a psyche ward.\n\n- Never really thought of this much till now. Should I tell her this? I want to tell her now but it's been 4 years.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2ohecq/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_the_last/cmnn0dl/"}
