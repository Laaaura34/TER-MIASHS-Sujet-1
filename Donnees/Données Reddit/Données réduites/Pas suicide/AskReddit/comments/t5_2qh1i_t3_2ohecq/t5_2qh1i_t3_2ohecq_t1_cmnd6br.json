Anxiety was killing me and i never did anything right. I have that type of OCD where if something isnt perfect I panic and do nothing. After i felt the knife hit the skin i gave up and tried to clean the mess up. Nothing vital thankfully and i just played it off as my cat clawing me bad. I've gotten better since then.
