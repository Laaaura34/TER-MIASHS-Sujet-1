It goes something like, \"I instantly realized that everything in my life that I\u2019d thought was unfixable was totally fixable\u2014except for having just jumped.\"\n\nWhen I attempted in October of 2012, I had just been arrested for drinking again and I was certain that I no longer had a future in anything I wanted to do. I don't remember any specific thought going through my head, I just know that I felt that the pressures of life and of my expectations for myself were to heavy to deal with.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2ohecq/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_the_last/cmnkwsj/"}
