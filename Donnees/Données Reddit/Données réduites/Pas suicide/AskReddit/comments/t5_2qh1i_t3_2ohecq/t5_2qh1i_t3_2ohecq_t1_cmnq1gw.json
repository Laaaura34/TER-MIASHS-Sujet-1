I still swim, wear short shorts and let boyfriends see it. I just say i used to cut and leave it at that - people dont really need to know much more than that. I've come to love my scars. I would transcribe poems and words pretty deep into my leg, it's nice seeing those words all mixed together and reflecting on how they got me through. I also now have a scarification swallow on the same thigh, it was quite a release from that part of my life to have that done.
