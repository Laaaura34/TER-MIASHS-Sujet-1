I know it's a hollow and empty thing to say, kind of like suggesting you play the lottery because you \"might\" win. The difference between that and life is that in life you have a lot of choice in HOW you play. You know when you get bored in a video game and just start fucking around with stuff to see what happens? Same deal. Try stuff. Stuff you never would have done before. Maybe even dangerous stuff? (Just try not to hurt anyone else fer fucksake). Soon you begin to realize despair only survives when circumstances remain stagnant. Despair sets in when life becomes a grind. But when you are teetering on the edge of a cliff and your next breath is a 50/50, despair nopes out. Survival wins.\n\nThat was a long winded way of saying, never say never until you're actually on your deathbed.
