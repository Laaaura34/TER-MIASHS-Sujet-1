I'm not special in that way, but thanks!\n\nMy wife is now a preschool teacher, and I'm an artist and privately teach art to children.  I've always wanted to be one, so that's so exciting to write.  I've volunteered with youth in crisis organizations and spoke out about child abuse a lot.  Sometimes I am a guest speaker at my local junior college about relationships, and surviving abuse every now and then.\n\nMy sister/kiddo is undeclared right now, but she's getting her required classes out of the way.  I honestly see her going into humanitarian work.  The kid has passion.\n\nI've always put a huge emphasis on helping your community without asking for things in return (we are nonreligious).  Right now she volunteers at a pitbull rescue society.  I'm so proud of her.  She's had a few issues, but I'm unbelievably proud.  She's smart.  She's tough.  She's kind.  I haven't kept this story from her, but I've also never told her either.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2ohecq/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_the_last/cmno4q2/"}
