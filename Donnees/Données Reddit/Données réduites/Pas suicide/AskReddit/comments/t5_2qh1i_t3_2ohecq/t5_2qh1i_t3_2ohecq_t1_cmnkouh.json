We were all jumping off the top of the boat (about 20 feet.). The HK bay has quite a few jellyfish, some of which are actually pretty dangerous.\n\nSo anyway, fast forward to me jumping off for the third time or so (I'm afraid of heights, so some of my friends had already jumped of like 20 times already).\n\nJust a few minutes ago, we had noticed a jellyfish near our boat, so we switched to the other side. Anyway, as I'm hitting the water I kinda gasp and inhale some water\n\nAt that moment I have a panic attack, which causes my throat to sort of tense up and close.\n\nI thought I swallowed a jellyfish and was feeling the effects of the poison in my throat.\n\nAfter about 10 seconds of \"Shit I'm gonna die\", I suddenly had a moment of clarity where I just though \"this is a panic attack\".\n\nMy throat immediately opened up and all was fine.\n\nPanic attacks *fuckin* suck man.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2ohecq/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_the_last/cmnkouh/"}
