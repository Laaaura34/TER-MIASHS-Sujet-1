But it lead to me being depressed, leaving all my friends and my current girlfriend out of nowhere. \n\nI had taken 52-100mg Trazadone, which is a very strong sleeping medication, as well as 15-15mg Melatonin pills, and taped a garbage bag over my head right as I was dozing off, then I put a ziptie around my wrists behind my back.\n\nI was laying down on the futon in my basement, listening to the song \"Orion\" by Metallica as I started drifting off, and my mind went completely blank, I closed my eyes, and everything seemed so distant and I was finally calm for the first time in almost a month.
