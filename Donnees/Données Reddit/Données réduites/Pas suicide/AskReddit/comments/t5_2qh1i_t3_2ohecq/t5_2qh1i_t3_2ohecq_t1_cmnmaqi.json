Before I slid my head through the noose I was thinking about anyone in my life, people that would miss me, people that I wish I had known and all the opportunities I had never taken, it was emotional, I didn't want to but it felt like the only way out, my true final thought was:\n\n\"This is it.\"\n\nChair hit the floor hard enough that my mom came in, for no real reason, just wanted to check on me.
