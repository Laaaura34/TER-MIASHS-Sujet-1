But I've seen my best friend funerals. And... yeah there were people loving him, people grieving his loss and.. You would be miss, you would leave a hole in their heart. Even if you don't imagine it now.\n\nEnough with the negative.. \n\nLife can and will get better.. sometimes it takes time and a lot of effort that you don't have the energy for at the moment. But you will find the motivation one day, it might be a special person, an activity, anything.. that will change your world.\n\nGet a psychotherapist if you can afford it, meds can also help a lot at least with sleep. In my experience, sleep is actually one of the most critical thing. I've been out of depression for 3 years now. But if I duck my sleep schedule I can feel some thoughts coming back (actually almost fuck myself up again at some point).\n\n\nThere is nothing I can really do for you except telling you that.. You are strong enough, you are loved (and if you can't think of who loves you..  well there's always the random stranger typing this!), you can do it. And I'm very proud of you for still trying your best to live !\n\nFeel free to let out some vent here or in my DMs I'll read you asap \u2764", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/eb9hc3/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_how_did_you/fb3illh/"}
