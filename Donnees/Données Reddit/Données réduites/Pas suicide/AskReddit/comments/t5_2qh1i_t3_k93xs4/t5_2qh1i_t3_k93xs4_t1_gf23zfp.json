Shit comes in waves and after your hormones even out and the teen angst fades away life is much easier to face daily.\n\nMy depressive episodes I tackle with a tip my former shrink gave me. Take any task you have to do and break it down into the simplest form possible. You need to go to the bank? Well, you've gotta get out of bed. Well, you need to get uncovered, so do that. Next you've gotta move your legs and set your feet on the floor, so do that. Done? Good fucking job. Now you gotta stand up, go slow if you need to, you've got all the time in the world. Now that you're standing, take a step forward, now another one. You're halfway to the bathroom, keep going. Take a piss, brush your teeth. Make time to reward yourself for the stupid, piddly shit. No one else is gonna do it, and you've got the serotonin motherfucker, USE IT!!", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/k93xs4/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_did_life_get_any/gf23zfp/"}
