I would say I eventually figured I\u2019m gonna die at some point anyway, I may as well try to make the most out of what I have here now.

I dunno if that sounds silly, but I guess I had a perspective shift and realized how much damage it would cause to people who care about me, I didn\u2019t want to cause that much hassle so I started looking for little reasons to live, small reasons to be thankful helped me a lot.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/k93xs4/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_did_life_get_any/gf1uy35/"}
