One night after a hard day at school and a drunken parent lecturing me I grabbed a knife and well... I sliced my wrist and tendons. I was found by said parent a couple minutes later. I am rushed to the ER and I am sent to a mental facility for a week. After that it all goes back to normal besides the pills and the therapy.
