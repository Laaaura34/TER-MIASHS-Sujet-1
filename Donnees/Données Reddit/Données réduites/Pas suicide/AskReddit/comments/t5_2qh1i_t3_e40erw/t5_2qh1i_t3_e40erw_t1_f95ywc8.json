This pain you feel, this disconnect, this feeling of futility; you aren't the only one who feels it. \n\nMaybe you've been hurt more than others, maybe you've been treated worse more than others; but that means you're stronger than most because you're still here.\n\nThe fact that you're still here, can inspire those going through their own hell. Your pain can create something beautiful for others, and can help them from experiencing the same things. \n\nThe tiniest action you make can greatly influence others. Simply holding open a door for someone can completely change their day. Some tiny thing you do 2 years from now, might save someones life; and if you weren't as strong as we both know you are, you might not be here to do it.\n\nYou are worth it. \n\nYou matter.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/e40erw/dear_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_would_you/f95ywc8/"}
