So one night I grabbed a Kitchen knife and slit my throat, but the cut was shallow and was not fatal enough to off myself, Neighbors saw what I did called 911 and EMT found me pale in a pool of blood half-dead. After a few months of recovery and graduating. I started college, moved out of my parents home, got a paid internship, surfing again and started talking to a therapist.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2dpvdz/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_are_your/cjrxlvx/"}
