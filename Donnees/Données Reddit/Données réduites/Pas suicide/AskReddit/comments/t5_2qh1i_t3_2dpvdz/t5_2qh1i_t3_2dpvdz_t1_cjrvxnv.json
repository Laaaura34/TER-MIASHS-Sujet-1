Lots of booze, lots of pills, and completely unresponsive when I found her. Weird situation as I was on meds that made me sleep through anything and always locked my bedroom. Woke up to dog licking me, still not sure how he got in there. Stumbled in, found her, eyes were... blank. Ambulance arrives quickly. I take my car and follow, all the neighbors staring at the single mom being drug out of the house on a stretcher with her only son just dumbstruck... I'd never felt that they'd looked at us that way before or since, but that's what I felt that day.\n\nAt the hospital doctors say she's just drunk and I should've let her sleep it off (before tox screen), family says I'm just 18 but that she was just drunk and I was being silly... then comes tox screen. She wakes up, hates me, but she's alive so don't care. Family never apologizes but they're cunts so don't care. Paramedics pull me to the side later in the day to see how she is while they're making another delivery. Come to find out, she flat lined on the way there. They didn't think she would make it, but she had.\n\nBy the end of that hospital visit I was making her medical decisions at 18, getting her into a treatment program and dealing with her hating me for probably a month.\n\nNow she's a better mom (and grandma) than ever before because after a while she realized the true value of everything she'd tried to throw away, everything she would've missed, and how exceptionally lucky she was to get another chance.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2dpvdz/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_are_your/cjrvxnv/"}
