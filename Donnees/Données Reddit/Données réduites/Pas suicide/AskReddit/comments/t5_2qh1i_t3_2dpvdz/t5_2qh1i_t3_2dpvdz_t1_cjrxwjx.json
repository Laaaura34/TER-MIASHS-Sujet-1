I called a suicide hotline, talked for about twenty minutes, and thought I was going to be okay. An hour later, I took a necktie into the bathroom, put it around my neck, and tied it to the frame of my shower. I lowered my weight, passed out, and the tie broke. I woke up on the floor of the shower and thought, \"Oh, shit, that almost worked.\"\n\nI thought (realistically) about how my family and friends would have responded to my death. I decided I'd never try again, no matter how dark the future looks.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2dpvdz/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_are_your/cjrxwjx/"}
