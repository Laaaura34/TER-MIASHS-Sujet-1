I became chronically ill 5 years ago and I feel like I\u2019ve been grieving the loss of what I thought would be. I\u2019m trying so hard to come to terms with it, so that I can remain here for my children. I don\u2019t think you were selfish\u2026 just heartbroken and lost. Like I feel now. We are mothers, but first and foremost we are human beings. We will make mistakes, it\u2019s human nature. To take those mistakes and grow and keep trying Is what we all hope for, and you\u2019ve achieved it. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re still here\ud83e\udd7a", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/pi3u0i/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_is_your_story/hc8hy1p/"}
