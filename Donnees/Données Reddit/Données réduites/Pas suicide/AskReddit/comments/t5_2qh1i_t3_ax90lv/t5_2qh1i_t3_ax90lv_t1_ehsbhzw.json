At the point I thought the only person who cared for me had just left me and I was dead inside. I called the 4 people who I knew I would miss the most. When I made my attempt and I was met with voice mails from them, I told them good bye before ending the messages. (From here is based purely off what I was told) Although they didn't answer one tried to call back while he was on the road. He drove to my place, got inside and found my body just hanging there. He moved me to his car and took me to the hospital. When I came to in the morning, after hearing the events, what saved me was seeing the smiles I brought to my friends and family, (despite being the target of all the jokes) and literally the physical exertion my friend put himself through to get me to the hospital.\n\nTl:dr friend drove me to the hospital before it was too late.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/ax90lv/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_saved_you/ehsbhzw/"}
