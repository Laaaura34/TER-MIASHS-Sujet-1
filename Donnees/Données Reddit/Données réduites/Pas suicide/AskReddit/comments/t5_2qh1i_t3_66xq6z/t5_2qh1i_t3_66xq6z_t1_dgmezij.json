I found myself identifying with Hannah and I am double her age. And I am determined to live as happily as I can. The moments where she was insulted, ridiculed, or dealt with negativity - I could taste her disappointment and heartbreak. It was too real for me. \n\nThere's a part in the show where she says \"you'll look for signs, and it'll be nothing\" that really hit home for me. I think sometimes seemingly small things add up and you're incapable of seeing or expecting a better outcome. In my case I was just tired. I still am, I just don't think about how tired and hopeless I feel. I didn't want to watch the show but I did anyway, I was scoffing at it. I thought it would be a Hollywood version. I don't know I just didn't realize how much I would be affected by it. I really really really had a deep appreciation for Clay, Alex, and even Zach at the end. \n\nI am doing well, but I have moments every day that I can put on a tape but I don't think anyone would want to be a champion for me like Clay was.
