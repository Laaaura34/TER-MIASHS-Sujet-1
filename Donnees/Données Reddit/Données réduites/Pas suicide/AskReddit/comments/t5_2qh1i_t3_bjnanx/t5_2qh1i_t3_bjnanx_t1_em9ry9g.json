I didn't think much about my attempt as the time because my mom was screaming for me to get up and get ready. Nobody in my family has any idea I had done this. I did realize, however, that I do want to live, even though life right now is hard. I want to live, so that I can see and live with the love of my life once I am out of school.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/bjnanx/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_did_you_think/em9ry9g/"}
