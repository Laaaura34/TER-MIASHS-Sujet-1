That is partly why I was suicidal. I didn\u2019t go through with it for two main reasons:\n\n- Fear. If I somehow messed up, I\u2019d end up living in a worse position than I was already in \n\n- My family. Although I\u2019m not particularly close with my family, I\u2019ve seen first hand what suicide can do to the people left behind. I wouldn\u2019t want to put my loved ones through that. \n\nMore recently I see the value my life has. Now I have a daughter, so I have to keep going for her. I might not be the best Dad, but I\u2019m the only one She has got. I *will not* let her down.\n\nIf you are at absolute rock bottom and there is nothing left for you...the only way is up. Things will improve, it\u2019s a slow and sometimes painful process, but things get better. Suicide doesnt stop the pain, it passes it on to someone else.  I still have relapses sometimes, but I\u2019ve got the things to keep me grounded and force myself to keep going.
