Though I submit job applications like it's a part time job, I still can't find a job that offers health insurance. My state doesn't allow single adults with no children access to low income based aid so I went off my medication. Off my meds, I find myself overspending because it's hard to justify not doing something that will give me a few hours worth of not-sadness. \n\nI have a few new people I hang out with, but my best friend moved half an hour away recently and I suspect I'll never see her again. My new friends mostly just get high and drink their asses off and it's free so I don't see a reason not to join them. I fell in love again but every time I think about it, I get flashbacks from my failed engagement and want to hurl.\n\nI'm worse at my job now. \n\n I asked God for a sign not to try again and I won a big prize in a work raffle the next day, so I just keep praying He'll choose to gift me someone else's fatal accident. It keeps not happening and I don't get why. My parents keep making small comments about the girl who failed to kill herself and got the face transplant, as if my attempts failed because I fucked it up. They failed because of flukes. I technically should have died at least twice by now.\n\nMy life isn't much worse, but it certainly isn't better. I don't regret my attempts. I'm not happy to be alive. I'm still 99% sure every single person I know would be better off without me and have facts to back it up. It's been 8 months since my last attempt.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/9dmfco/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_how_is_your/e5n0fsw/"}
