But I got help, I filtered out my life of toxic people and situations, and started taking care of myself. If I succeeded I would\u2019ve never gotten here. I didn\u2019t even think I could get to a point in my life where I\u2019m happy, overcoming obstacles.  It was a miracle. I would\u2019ve never met my best friend, and other amazing friends if I succeeded. My piece of advice would be, that once you hit rock bottom, there is no place to go but up, think of the good things that could happen in the future, and take things one day at a time. I was there once, and I know it\u2019s hard, but it will get better. I tried harming myself and ended up hurting my liver temporarily, and it\u2019s just now getting better, years later.
