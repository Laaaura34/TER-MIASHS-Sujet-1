I spent years telling myself to wait for it to get better. \n\nEventually, I got tired of waiting, was convinced it wouldn't get better and tried ODing on pills and booze.  It's been a bit over a decade since I tried to end it and my life now is pretty much bliss. Sure I have a bunch of debt and some extra lbs., but I'm happy. Every day, I'm happy. When a cloud starts coming, I'm better equipped to deal with it and recognize the signs and step out of myself enough to see that I'm depressed and it will pass. \n\nI used to have weeks where I would wake up in the morning and simply wish I hadn't and now I am so thankful for every extra day I get. I don't have advice on how to get through it, because well, I didn't intend to. Just keep holding on.
