When I look back on the way things were, I can confidently say I do not feel anywhere near what I felt like back then. When things were at their lowest, I'd just lay in bed the entire day and cry. I didn't know why I was sad but I was and I didn't want to be here anymore. I just wanted to not feel the way I was feeling. \n\nThe difference now is that I honestly don't feel like I've found the drive or want to keep going. Like, there's nothing that fuels my passion for life. But I also don't feel sad either. I guess it's more or less just a psychological numbness. Good stuff doesn't make me happy, or at least it doesn't last long, and sad stuff just doesn't even phase me anymore. Nothing comes close to intensity of emotion I was feeling when I was depressed. \n\nI know that's not too clear of a response. It's not really all that clear up in my head either.
