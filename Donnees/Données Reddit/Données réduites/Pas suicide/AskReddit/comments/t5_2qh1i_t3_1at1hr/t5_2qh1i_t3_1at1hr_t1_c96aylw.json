I am still struggling to find resolution with my uncle's decision, which I know will never fully come to me. I recently found out he tried committing suicide when he was much younger and they attribute his OCD/anxiety/ depression (which I also recently found out about) to PTSD of an event that happened in his childhood. (Again, I just found out about this, but my uncle told my mom about a week before he took his life that he was molested by another boy that lived on their street when he was a child.) Logically, these are classic events and symptoms that lead to suicide, but knowing my dear uncle in such a warm, caring light my whole life, then seeing that light immediately disappear and morph into an ugly grey, it's heart-wrenching. So much that I've known my whole life has been ripped away from me in a split second. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/1at1hr/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_went_through/c96aylw/"}
