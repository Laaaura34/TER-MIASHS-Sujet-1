The cop wouldn't give me my purse (there was nothing of value or danger in it) but he did put my huge, recently filled bottle of antidepressants on the stretcher at the hospital with me (I was handcuffed to a gurney).  I asked a passing nurse for water and proceeded to take a couple hundred pills.\n\nClearly, I was not thinking.  Drinking was due to severe depression (which made it much worse) and a career crash-and-burn, plus I'm just an out-and-out alcoholic.\n\nOnce I sobered up and got help, I never attempted anything like that again, knowing the pain it would cause my family.  But in that moment of intense pain, I couldn't care about anyone else.\n\nThe person who kills himself/herself is generally in so much pain he/she can't see daylight.  Anything that would have worked has failed, and death seems to be the only antidote to pain.\n\nThis is why depression kills at least 30,000 people a year, more than AIDS and homicide combined.
