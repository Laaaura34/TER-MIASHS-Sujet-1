I haven't moved on and I'm not coping well. Every time I try to heal, I have to take several steps backwards after dealing with certain people who prefer to use me as their punching bag and pretend they are the only victim. The irony is my husband hated these people and now I see why. I'm not angry at my husband. I know he was in a lot of pain and I couldn't force him to get help he didn't want. It also isn't my first time being a survivor both for my own attempt and completion from other people. At this point I'm seriously considering just ending it all. I'm not interested in a future without my husband anyway.\n\nMy psychiatrist did say some things that might helpful to you, #1 being that it's not your fault despite having guilt. He also told me that even if got help but didn't believe it would work, the help then becomes useless. I couldn't force him or change that outcome. Logical appeals reach me better than emotional ones so he cited some studies for me (and I should note that this doctor does counseling on the side but is highly active in research and R&D for pharmaceuticals; i.e. this person knows their shit): There is a genetic basis for the predisposition to suicide. It has to do with the genetic coding for serotonin receptors (of which there are multiple versions) and 95% of suicide victims in this study have the same type of receptor. You can't always fight genetics.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/641zxk/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_or_is_your/dfzniaf/"}
