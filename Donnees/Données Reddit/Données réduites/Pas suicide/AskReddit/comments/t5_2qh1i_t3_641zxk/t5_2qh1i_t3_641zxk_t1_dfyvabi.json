I guess that's why I made multiple attempts. Sometimes I tried just to \"feel\" alive. But more often than not it drove me further away from myself. I always thought \"I have a switch, and only I can hit it. If everything hits the fan - I can make the pain stop\". That screwed with my head for many years following. I still think about death often, but I'm not suicidal anymore. My life was terrible for a long time, but college (and very good friends) saved me from the brink and made me see the positives and power that comes with living.\n\nI'd say the one thing that really drove me out of the darkness was color. That's probably why I love the show Adventure Time so much; it has such a diverse and strong color palette. I thought, \"if I die, I wont see color anymore\" and that was a major turning point for me.\n\nYou grieve the life you could have lost, and then you just start living the life you always wished you had.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/641zxk/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_or_is_your/dfyvabi/"}
