You don't feel like doing anything, if feels *wrong* to laugh even if something is funny, you get in a big rut because this person you knew is now just gone.  They say time heals all wounds and it does, but those no \"right amount\" of healing time.  Some of my friends we're better after about 2 weeks, I took much longer to grieve.  It's okay to feel sad and it's okay to cry.  Actually only 6 days until the 4 year anniversary of one friend's death.
