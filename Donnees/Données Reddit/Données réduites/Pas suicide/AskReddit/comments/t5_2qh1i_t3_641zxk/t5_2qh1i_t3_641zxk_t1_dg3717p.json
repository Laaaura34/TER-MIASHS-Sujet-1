The thing is, you will feel like this for a while. I wanted to throw up every time another guy even looked me in the eyes for too long. I did a lot of reading on death/suicide when my boyfriend passed away because I thought it would make me feel better to get any kind of insight on why it happen and it actually did help in a way. I could barely get out of bed  for what felt like forever but try to go outside even if it's just for a little walk! \n\nJust remember that you're allowed to feel this way for however long you need to. If some days you feel happy and forget about it even for a slight second, let yourself have that. If some days you handle it worse than others just know **tomorrow is a new day**. It's crazy to think about because it is still very fresh but feelings aren't permanent. If you give your grieving a chance you will be able to get over the hard part and learn how to cope. I think about him always but I am in a new loving relationship now and it feels so freeing. It doesn't mean I love him any less because of that. \n\nJust take it 24 hours by 24 hours.
