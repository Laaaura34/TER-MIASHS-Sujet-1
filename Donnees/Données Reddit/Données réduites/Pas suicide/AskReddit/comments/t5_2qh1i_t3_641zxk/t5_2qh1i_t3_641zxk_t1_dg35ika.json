He says I've been handling situation in the best way I could so far - i don\"t know what he means by that cause yeah, i'm not crying like crazy in front of other people anymore, but I still feel like shit, i still want to gag at a thought of another guy casually touching me, i still redearch things on death and suicide, I still sob and don't want to live occasionally. He knows about it. I take only 1 pill from timw to time when I'm going to sleep, but otherwise clean of any meds. \n\nI'm lonely, work from home, don\"t have any classes left to attend at the uni and have just one friend who also happened to be my fiance's best friend. He lives on the other side of the country (Switzerland - so we can occasionally see e.o.), but messaging helps. \n\nI'm really greatful I could read your story, subparsandwich. I know I'm not alone in this very cruel world, and maybe one day I will be able to feel a bit of love from another person and be loved again.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/641zxk/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_or_is_your/dg35ika/"}
