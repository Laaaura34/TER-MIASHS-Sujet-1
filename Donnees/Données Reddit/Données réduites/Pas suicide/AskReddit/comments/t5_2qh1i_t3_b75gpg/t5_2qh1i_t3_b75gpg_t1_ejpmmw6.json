I was convinced that nothing would ever change. I had even convinced other people that my life may never get better and that it should be my choice whether or not I wait around to see.\n\nIt's a long story, but things did improve. I'm nowhere near where I want to be, but I met an amazing friend who has really helped me find myself. It required a lot of work on my end too. It CAN get better if you want it to. Sometimes you just need a hand to hold along the way. Don't be afraid to reach out to someone. \n\nAs I often do, I will leave you the option to PM me if you ever need/want to talk. No one should have to feel that way so I will try to help whenever I can, if someone wants to reach out.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/b75gpg/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/ejpmmw6/"}
