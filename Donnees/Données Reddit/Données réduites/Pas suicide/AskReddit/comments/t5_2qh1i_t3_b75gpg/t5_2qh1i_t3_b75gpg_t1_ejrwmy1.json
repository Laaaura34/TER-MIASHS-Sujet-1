After I was able to catch my breath for a few seconds, I was mad at the officers for bringing him in. They would not have found me with out him. Honestly, looking back, I know he was doing his job and I hope he got a lot of praise for doing what he was asked. \nThey later told me that if I had started panicking, he may have bitten me. \n\nI am doing a fair bit better these days, so thank you very much. I truly appreciate your kind words.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/b75gpg/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/ejrwmy1/"}
