Im so sorry you carry pain. I want you to know that you're honestly not alone. I'm not saying that for b.s. or to try and fix you [and me] but.. some people carry a lot of fucking pain. A lot. You're not alone on that struggle.\n\nI'm also not gonna say that b.s. about 'someone has it worse' because .. my problems may also seem small to someone but it destorys me from inside out. No one knows how you felt, what you went through, the variables, your own life expierence. I won't judge. You're loved dear, and I'll be glad to share our pain together on a stranger basis.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/b75gpg/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/ejr8yxl/"}
