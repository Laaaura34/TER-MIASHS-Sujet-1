I couldn\u2019t move my arms (turns out they were tied down to the bed), I couldn\u2019t speak or breathe on my own (intubated).\n\n\n\u201cOh shit I really did it.\u201d\n\nThen, \n\n\u201cOh FUCK. I didn\u2019t do it right.\u201d\n\n\nThen I heard my mom\u2019s voice calling out for the nurses, \u201cSHE\u2019S AWAKE, SHE\u2019S UP, SOMEONE COME HELP PLEASE!\u201d  And then she walks into my line of sight. I thought she was going to lose it on me, but instead she was totally calm and soothing, telling me I was ok and that everything was going to be alright.  \n\nI couldn\u2019t tell her how sorry I was, but I know she could read it on my face. I immediately started crying, my eyes were apologizing, and she just kept telling me it was okay. \n\nIt turns out I\u2019d been on life support and in a coma for 2 days following my admission to the ER (which I don\u2019t remember, but from reading the official report in my records from the hospital, shit was wild).\n\nI felt so awful not just because of what I put her and so many other people through; but also because I was even more upset about still being alive. That went on for over a year- the wanting to be dead part. But eventually I came to terms with still being here. \n\nI still have bad days. Healing is not linear. But I\u2019m doing better now than I thought was even possible back then. \n\nIt\u2019ll be 2 years in late July. \n\nThings really do get better.
