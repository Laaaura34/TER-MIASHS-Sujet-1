Scariest shit I\u2019ve experienced in my life. \n\nI woke up in the hospital 11 days later, my skull had fractured, combined with the lack of oxygen in my system had sent me into a coma. When I woke up I couldn\u2019t remember anything from a few weeks before it happened except I could remember everything from when I first kicked the chair up to the point the fan was rushing toward my head. When I woke up I remember feeling really worried that my family would find out that I had tried to take my life because I didn\u2019t want to hurt them, which made me realise that the pain may end for me but not for them if I had actually succeeded. \n\nWith copious amounts of therapy and memory recollection training I managed to remember the time I had lost and I\u2019m now happy again, after years of being depressed. That experience really made me realise that life isn\u2019t about having a purpose or ascending to heaven, it\u2019s about enjoying the time you have here and that there really isn\u2019t any point to your life if you were sad the entire time. The only way to make your life meaningful is to make a good impression on as many people as possible", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/b75gpg/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/ejpx17o/"}
