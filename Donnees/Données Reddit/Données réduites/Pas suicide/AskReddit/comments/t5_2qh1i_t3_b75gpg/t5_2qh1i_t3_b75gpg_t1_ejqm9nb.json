I hear you.  It sounds so trite to try to tell someone going through something like that that it is all chemical but truly thats what I have to tell myself.  I have to remember that my brain isn\u2019t getting the serotonin and sometimes i\u2019m like \u201coh shit, thats right\u201d.  I also have this thing I do now where I try to wait 30 minutes before I act on most impulses (i.e. reaching out to friends for drugs, meeting up with my Ex, etc) as I\u2019ve found that I can be super impulsive at times.  This shit takes a ton of self control.  Aside from that I have to do my hobby, force myself to walk the neighborhood, and reach out to old friends to talk about the good times.  This all sounds cliche but it really helps.  At my worst I pick the one person I care about the most in my mind and I imagine her/him finding me. I pick the one person that I wanted to find me (in high school it was my bully) and I imagine them laughing and saying how glad they are it happened instead of being emotionally affected and changing which was a huge drive for me through those stages.  The biggest thing for me was addressing my past with my therapist and opening up doors for my growth. I did a cycle of SSRI\u2019s for a few months to get me through my divorce also.  My Psych took me off eventually.  Also I quit weed a few months back and its helped level me out tremendously.
