I'm 13 and only weighed 85 pounds at the time, I was certain it would be enough to kill me. Took all the pills and went to bed hoping I wouldn't wake up but I did. When I woke up I couldn't think, but I just laid there for a while until I realized I had to puke. I couldn't stop puking and I couldn't eat anything I just sat by the toilet. No one even noticed. I had a visit with my dad that day so I went to visit him and I just went and laid down and cried. Around 30 minutes later my dad came to check on me but he heard me crying, he asked me what was wrong and I told him I needed to go to the hospital. I couldn't stop puking and my stomach hurt so bad, my stomach had never hurt that bad. He asked me why and I told him he started to cry and he gave me a hug. He told me to drink lots of water and left the room. We never talked about it again, I never got any help I just had to get over it. But here I am with the same thoughts just another plan.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/b75gpg/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/emebwur/"}
