She may have done it had my sister not told the counselors at her school. After her parents stopped her, they started inviting more and more friends over, and that helped her recover. That girl always says she was happy she told her friends that she was going to do it, because otherwise they may not have been able to stop her.\n\nThe lesson: Talk to close friends if you don't want to talk to your family about it. They will find a way to help you, even if you don't want it. Also, spending time with people who value you is always a good way to get out of your depression.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/bcrxa7/serious_suicide_attempt_survivors_of_reddit_what/eksyg4d/"}
