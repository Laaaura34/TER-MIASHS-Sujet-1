Now I cry remembering my attempt. Suicide is murder. It can't be justified as okay because you did it to yourself. If I had succeeded at 17, I would have been murdering all the future iterations of me. I would've killed myself at 18, 20, 25. I think suicide would be less prevalent if we had to stare down our future selves as teachers, parents, activists, and still go through with the decision to end life for not just your current self but the person you could've become.\n\nI know that in a low state, I can become convinced that I was never good and will always be better off dead. What keeps me here is the thought of \"what will happen to (insert loved one, real or imaginary).\"", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/bcrxa7/serious_suicide_attempt_survivors_of_reddit_what/ekszja7/"}
