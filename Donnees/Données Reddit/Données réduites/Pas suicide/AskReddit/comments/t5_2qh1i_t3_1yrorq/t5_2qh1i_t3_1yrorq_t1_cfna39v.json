I didn't have many thoughts going through my head - I was just glad I had made my decision and thankful it would be over soon. As nasty as it may seem, a small part of me hoped everyone who had hurt me felt some sort of pain at my passing, but I also didn't really care that much. I just wanted to go to sleep and never wake up.\n\nThe second time I didn't think about anything because the medication I overdosed on caused me to hallucinate almost instantly. My heart rate to slowed to a dangerously low level, caused me to pass in and out of consciousness, and stopped me from being able to move, so I was too preoccupied with that to remember that I was trying to kill myself. When I woke up the next morning I cried a lot and was generally upset that I hadn't succeeded, despite taking what should have been a lethal dose.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/1yrorq/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_were_your/cfna39v/"}
