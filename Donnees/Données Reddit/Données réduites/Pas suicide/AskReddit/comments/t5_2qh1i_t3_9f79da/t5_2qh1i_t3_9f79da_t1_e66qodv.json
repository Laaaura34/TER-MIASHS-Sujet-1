Not big things (that doesn\u2019t work for me) but little things like \u201cwell I can\u2019t do it today, I\u2019ve nearly finished my to-do list for the week\u201d. If it\u2019s hugely intense then I go for sensation-based strategies, like cold sparkling water to drink, putting my face in a sink of cold water. It can be exhausting but I\u2019m here.\nI also do a lot of therapy which helps (though it\u2019s bloody hard).\nI think the worst thing, weirdly, is that due to the nature of my attempt I have damaged the arteries in my neck and now get pulsatile tinnitus.\nIt is seriously annoying! It\u2019s not constant, but it is so loud and distracting when it does happen.\nThe risk of making it worse is enough to deter me from trying again.\nOne of the most positive things is that I\u2019ve become really involved with the consumer/lived experience movement and advocacy.\nI have found this so rewarding and may not have if I hadn\u2019t attempted. I don\u2019t love that I tried, but I am so so glad I survived.\nI don\u2019t know if/when I\u2019ll stop feeling suicidal, but I\u2019m still here, I\u2019m finding joy where I can, and doing things I can be proud of.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/9f79da/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_how_are_you/e66qodv/"}
