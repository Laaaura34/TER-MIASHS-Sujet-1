But hey, I'll answer anyway.\n\nSo basically, I was at my lowest point in a long time and pushed everyone away, so I was dwelling on my problems with no-one to vent to. It all added up. I was so lonely, in so much pain, and I felt so hopeless, that there's no way it's ever going to get better. I'd spent the past god knows how long hoping I just hurry up and die in my sleep so the pain and misery will go away. I couldn't stand the thought of living decades of this meaningless life that might as well be spent with me in a coma, because I literally do nothing with my life. Had a bit of a breakdown and a panic attack, during which I usually get pretty...crazy, I guess. And decided to do something about it.\n\nAfterwards, I just felt confused. I'd been asleep for a long time, I didn't know how long I'd been asleep for, what time it was, I didn't even remember what I'd done. I was just very dizzy and confused. Then I remembered and I freaked out, wondering if I'm going to die. I was terrified, I didn't want to die, I'm scared of dying. I just don't want to live. But I didn't want to admit what I'd done, and I didn't feel particularly bad, just tired and dizzy. I realised what I did was stupid, and to never do it again. Life still sucks and I still wish I'd hurry up and die, but for various reasons, I'm not going to get to that point again.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2znizy/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_could_you/cpkkda6/"}
