After so many years of dealing with it alone, she couldn't take it any longer. I was only five when my dad told me what had happened, but I remember it clear as day. I wish she would have told someone, anyone. My grandfather, my dad or my aunts. (The only reason we know about the depression, is because of her suicide note) She didn't do anything to reach out for help and I really wish she would've. The fact that she didn't even reach out to anyone tears me apart. It would\u2019ve been something else if she had gotten some help, but still committed suicide. Because then I would have known she at least tried.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/g2eev6/survivors_or_suicide_loss_of_reddit_what_could/fnkzdkp/"}
