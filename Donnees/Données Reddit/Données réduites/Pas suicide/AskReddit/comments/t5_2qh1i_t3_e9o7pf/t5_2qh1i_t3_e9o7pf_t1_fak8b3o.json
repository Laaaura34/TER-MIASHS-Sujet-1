I have poor mental health, and there have been a lot of shitty situations that affected my life (read: abusive relationship, homeless alcoholic/addict dad/ mental health issues, actual health issues/ being cheated on/sexual assault etc etc) I tried to commit suicide when I was 15. I\u2019m 24 now so it seems like a life time ago. Perhaps ironically, the one moment that made me decide I would never take my own life was so when my best friend actually committed suicide. I felt the effects of that, and saw the effects on her family and friends, and I vowed I would never do that, it\u2019s not to say that I\u2019m not still sad, or don\u2019t still have suicidal thoughts, but I won\u2019t go through with it. I\u2019m now in undergrad getting good grades, working full time, have an amazing boyfriend and  have a pretty bright future ahead (I hope). Things do get better, and sometimes they get bad again, but they always get better.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/e9o7pf/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_whats_your/fak8b3o/"}
