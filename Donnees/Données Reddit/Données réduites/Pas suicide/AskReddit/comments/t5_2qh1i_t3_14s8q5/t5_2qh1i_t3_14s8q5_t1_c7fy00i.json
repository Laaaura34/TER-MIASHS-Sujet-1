At the time it really seemed like he had failed at life and that there was no way that things would ever be okay for him. After being hospitalized for a couple of weeks he began taking anti-anxiety and anti-depression meds and seeing a therapist once a week. Although he had lived on his own for a while, he stayed with him mom for about a year and she gave him a lot of space, because she realized that maybe her previous methods of parenting hadn't really been the best approach. She's a sweet woman, but a bit of an idealist and tries to deny that anything bad exists and believed (before this incident) that it was inappropriate to talk about problems you're having. The one thing he wishes someone had told him was that it is not only okay but actually really important to talk to someone about how you're feeling. And when things seem really dark, you probably need help from outside yourself to get back into the light.\n\n\nWe met about a year after his crash, as he calls it, and got together last year. He is doing great now and I am extremely happy that he's alive.\n\n\nI don't know if you're asking for yourself or out of curiosity, but I hope this helps.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/14s8q5/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_whats_one_thing_you/c7fy00i/"}
