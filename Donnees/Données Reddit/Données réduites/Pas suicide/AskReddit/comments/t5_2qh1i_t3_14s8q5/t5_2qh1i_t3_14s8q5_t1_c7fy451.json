Seeing other kids my age with much more severe problems then I did made me realise that this wasn't me. I didn't act like myself and I knew I could be better then that. I took my statement as a challenge to better myself not as a tool to make myself feel bad for others o make myself feel good.\n\n\nI am proud to say that I faked being \"normal\" so I could get out that place. I didn't belong and I knew it, that person that consumed me for so long and made my life a mess was ment to be there and that wants me, I'm better then this. It's been 5 years and I still hate myself but the difference is I know who I am and I still have a desire to better myself. \n\n\nTake the statement however you want but remember inside of you there is a Beter person, you just have to prove to yourself that you are worthy of that person. And believe me everyone is worthy of something Beter.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/14s8q5/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_whats_one_thing_you/c7fy451/"}
