We went out just for one day alongside his girlfriend. The rest of the days I was with said girlfriend of his, going out, talking and having fun in general.\nWhen I was back home I wasn\u2019t the same person anymore. \nIt\u2019s almost a year now, and with the help of my therapist I\u2019m free from suicidal thoughts, paranoia, self harm, mood swings and apathy \n\nMy personal advice is to do very small steps, (or to stay for a wee bit with someone you deeply care) remember that your brain is lying to you, all those negative thoughts are just thoughts, nothing more. \nIt also helps saying to yourself \u201cI\u2019m having the thought of\u201d when paranoia or anything bad you think kicks in.\nLive the present, this bad boy works, just focus on your breathing this will help ya to stop thinking. \nI\u2019ll be honest it won\u2019t be easy but trust me... it gets better and you deserve it", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/lcw446/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_made_you/gm2hh3a/"}
