Dying is actually pretty fucking scary. \n\n2. I would have torn my family to shreds. They had no idea how much I was truly suffering. They had no idea how to handle it properly (and sometimes they still don\u2019t but it\u2019s better).

He saved my life. He was the only one who broke me down that night and got me to admit what I did. I feel like I broke him too and I feel so guilty about it. But it somehow made us closer as well. I know he\u2019ll see this so I\u2019ll just say thank you Ryan. I love you.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/n5sf7e/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_if_anything_what_did/gx3g3q7/"}
