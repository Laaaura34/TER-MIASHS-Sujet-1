In a pragmatic way we reject this notion with the belief that care and patience can make something last forever, but it can't. We struggle and struggle and worry and doubt, and at the end we've suffered more from sustaining it than we found joy in it.\n\nCounterintuitivlely, the best way we can respect and love is to *let go* a little bit with the acceptance that it will eventually end; in that way, the care and appreciation flow naturally from the happiness of impermanence. It doesn't mean that you throw the glass around or otherwise neglect it; it means you treasure and value it because it will eventually break, not because you're trying to impossibly prevent the inevitable.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yh4o8/"}
