Some would say just reaching out and rubbing someone's back just to make them exhale, smile, relax their shoulders, and release a little stress just made you significant. Some would say If you aren't at the level of Alexander the Great and Conquered the known world by age 28 then you are insignificant. Where is the minimum \"significance line\" for you?
