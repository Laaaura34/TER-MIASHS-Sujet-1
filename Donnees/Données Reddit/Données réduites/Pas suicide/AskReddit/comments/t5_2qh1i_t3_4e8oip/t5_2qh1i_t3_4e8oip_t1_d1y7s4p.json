I'd always chickened out last minuite every other time. So this time I did something I couldn't back out of. I mixed some pills with a bottle of alcohol, all stolen from around the house. I knew my parents would be back late and I was home alone. I told the one person who I hoped still cared about me goodbye, then I lay down.\n\nMy dad came home from work early. I hadn't passed out, I was groggy and sluring my speech and he kept asking me what I'd done. I think I had acess to something sharp too and he was scared I would hurt myself further but somehow I don't exactly remember he got me to the hospital and I spent all night throwing up and blacking out and in the morning I was still there.\n\nAnd I thought, I would have died if it weren't for my dad. The person I told didn't do anything to try to stop me. I thought I needed to sort out my priorities and to see who actually did care and cut out those who didn't.\n\nI never tried again. Mainly because I didn't want to mess it up, I was told that what I had taken would be more likely to seriously innure me and give me a life long disability than outright kill me. I don't know if that's true but it svared me far more than death ever could. I spent a long time depressed and suicidal but eventually I got better.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7s4p/"}
