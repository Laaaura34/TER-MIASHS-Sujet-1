After that it was a whirlwind of ER and IVs and vomiting and psych ward. I got of there thinking I will do anything not to go through all of that again. \n\nFour years later, I'm back in college and aiming to finish well this time, have an adorable dog who's the bedrock of my emotional stability, and am in a supportive and healthy relationship with my SO who I had a massive crush on for years and who saw me at my worst those years ago and still wants me (and is wonderfully validating of the progress I've made). So for all those who replied to this thread who're still struggling to deal with suicidal ideation and depression and any of that, from someone who's been through all that shit, all the doctors and hospitals, it eventually does start to get better. Slowly, painfully, but it does. Please hang in there, seek help, and keep fighting. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7x3n/"}
