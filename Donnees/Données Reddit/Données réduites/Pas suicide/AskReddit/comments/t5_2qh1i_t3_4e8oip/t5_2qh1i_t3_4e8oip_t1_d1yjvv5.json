I've taken her in 3 times in the past few months for attempts. Even with me sitting right there, they won't let her have curtains/doors shut, she can't wear anything but a hospital gown, and they assign her a babysitter that sits a few feet away that keeps eyes on her at all times.\n\nAnd I'm not being a smarty pants, they call them babysitters.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yjvv5/"}
