He's suicidal too, so we kinda keep each other alive. We did make a suicide pact a while ago... You guys are really my best resource. Even people who I don't know are willing to take the time to acknowledge me, AND offer compassion to someone they'll never meet! It's wonderful. I feel like once I'm reached out to in that way, you are no longer strangers. We have a small stake in each other's lives, and even as complete strangers I owe it to you to try. We're really not alone. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yjduk/"}
