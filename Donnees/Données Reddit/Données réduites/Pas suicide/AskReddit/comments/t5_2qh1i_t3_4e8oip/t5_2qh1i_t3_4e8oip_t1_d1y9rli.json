I researched so much on the internet and compiled a seemingly perfect way to guarantee death. I mixed awful amounts of morphine, diclazepam and alcohol in an attempt to kill myself via respiratory failure but it wasn't enough.\n\nI even found myself the perfect spot to pass away, in a small secluded field inside the bushes where I hoped no one would find me. The most painful part of the ordeal was going back home, knowing you failed to even end your own life and face the ones you love, unaware that they very nearly lost me.\n\nYou really have to experience the dread you feel after a failed attempt to truly understand it, not that I would wish that upon anyone.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9rli/"}
