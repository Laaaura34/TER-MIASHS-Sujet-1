The first thing i remember after asking my mum to leave was sitting on my bed with an empty sleepingpill container. I have no recollection of conciously deciding to take all those pills, but i remember lying down, feeling a little drowsy and then rushing into the bathroom to try and make myself throw up when the realisation fully hit me. \n\nMy mum took me to the doctors immeditately  (i dont have a gag reflex so i couldnt make myself throw up) and they said the dose i took wasnt lethal, that id just be sleeping for a long time.\nWhich i did. \n\nThe stupid thing is that i tried to kill myself multiple times, but the only time i almost succeeded was the time i didnt even conciously really want to.\n\n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8dd3/"}
