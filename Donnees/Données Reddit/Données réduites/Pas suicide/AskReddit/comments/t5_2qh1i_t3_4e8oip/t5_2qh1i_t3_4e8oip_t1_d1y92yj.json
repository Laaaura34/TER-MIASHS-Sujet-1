I had taken a mix of pills trying to kill myself but I guess dosage wasn't enough for more than just making me pass out (I'm fat I guess it saved me) I still think back about it and honestly I'm glad it didn't work. After that I remember being sick, whether it was mental or physical from the pills I'm not sure. Never went to the hospital or told my parents.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y92yj/"}
