Tried cutting my wrist. Even numbed it up with lidocaine which I stole from the hospital I worked. Cutting it up to about the radial artery when I saw my cat lapping the blood of the floor which kinda snapped me back to reality. Didn't stich it up, it healed ok. Nobody suspects this of me so if anybody would ever comment on my faint scar I'll say something along the lines of a drunk night and a glass sliding door. \nI actually like the scar because it reminds me that I'm so much better even when I have a bad day.
