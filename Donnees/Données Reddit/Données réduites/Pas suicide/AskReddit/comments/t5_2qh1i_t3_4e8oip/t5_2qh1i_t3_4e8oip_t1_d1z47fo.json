My parents had gone through an horrendous divorce, I was dating someone terrible for me, I was failing school, and had this crippling depression since I was nine. I had been addicted to prescription drugs for a while and I guess I either didn't take enough or my tolerance was too high. I just slept and threw up a lot. Then when I sort of came to, I was still heavy under the effects of the pills and sort of attacked my mother (not my proudest moment). She grabbed my arm and I clawed her trying to get away from her. Ick.\n\n\nWhen I fully regained lucidity, I just cried a lot. I hated myself for it not working, but I also hated everything about who I was. I remember feeling like a disappointment to myself and how utterly defeated I felt when I realized I had to still be me.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1z47fo/"}
