Because of my 6ft tall height and the bar being too low, I had to lean really hard to get myself to choke. after about 30 seconds, I said to myself \" What the fuck am I doing? This is taking awfully a long time\".  I still struggle on a daily basic to try not to kill myself, I hate being alone because then it will entails suicidal thoughts. When I am with loving, caring people, I don't think about suicde at all. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ygwyg/"}
