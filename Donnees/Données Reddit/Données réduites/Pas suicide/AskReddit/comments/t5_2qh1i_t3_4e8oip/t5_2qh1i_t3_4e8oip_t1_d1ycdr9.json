Immediately I ran to the bathroom because my body decided it's time to get these pills out of you. After about 30 minutes of throwing up I thought there's still a chance I can die and that I wanted to see my ex (I was a freshman in high school young and blinded by \"love\"). I went to see her no one around me still not knowing what I did. I told them it was just something I ate or whatever. Thinking I can hold in the vomiting to say my last good bye to her, I end up throwing up all over her driveway. From there it was to the hospital. \n\n\nI always planned on killing myself during or before high school ever since 6th grade. So when the day came I was full of adrenaline I couldn't even say I was relieved to escape the depression. The whole experience just felt like all my thoughts were in a blender.
