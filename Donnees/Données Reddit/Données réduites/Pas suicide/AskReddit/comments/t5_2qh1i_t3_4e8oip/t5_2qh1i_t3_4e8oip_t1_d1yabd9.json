But it's harrowing when you suddenly find  yourself breathing when you shouldn't be, when you discover yourself on the floor with a snapped rope. I'd tried multiple times and each time after I asked myself why did I want to do it. Why did I want to disappear.\nI'm glad I had her, if I didn't I probably wouldn't be here anymore, because thosee thoughts don't go easily.\nEven these days I find myself occasionally, when times get really hard and I end up feeling alone, wishing that I'd managed it. Even thinking how to do it fast and easy. \n\nBut it's not worth it anymore. Despite the dark sides you gotta look to the happy sides, to the people who care, even when they don't seem to, or when they're angry with you, or when they ignore you.\nBecause as much as you want to disappear to make sure they are happy, because you feel you drag them down, in the end you hurt them more when you go.\n\nThank you \"M.G\" for teaching me that.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yabd9/"}
