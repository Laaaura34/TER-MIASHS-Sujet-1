Since that day my life has become a truly wonderful one with great friends a wonderful job and a wonderful home with many more good things still to come. I'm very blessed to have a second chance at life and I do what I can to not squander it. Fellow survivors I believe there's a reason we made it through. Find that reason and live and to those going through the thick of it I promise life gets better than you can possibly imagine.
