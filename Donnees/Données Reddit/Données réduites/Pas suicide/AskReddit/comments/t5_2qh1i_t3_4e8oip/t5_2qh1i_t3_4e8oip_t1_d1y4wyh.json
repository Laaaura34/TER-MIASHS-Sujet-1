I strongly identify both with your hesitancy to write and with your experience of not changing your mind about it at the time. That's a very hard thing and one that needs to be heard and read and felt.\n\nI am very glad that you are happy to be alive. There are many beautiful things in the world - many of them useless - and no small number of them suicidal. I know some who succeeded and they are still beautiful to me. The memory of art lost to a blaze.\n\nI hope you keep doing good - in all senses of the word.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y4wyh/"}
