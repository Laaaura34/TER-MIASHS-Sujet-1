I do not do these things.\"\n\nThe morning after a party where I took a bottle of whiskey,  wearing only indoor clothes,  ventured around and drank,  sobbing about a woman I loved but who never loved me back. Ended up sleeping in snow for an hour and half, was later found by classmates at the party who brought me back inside,  put me down at sauna room with blankets and pillows. I am quite grateful to those lads. I never have mentioned anyone why I went out like that,  but I just wished to freeze to death. All they know is that I just got real drunk and went out for a cigarette,  fell and was too wasted to make it back.
