All I can tell you is that being there for someone can mean more than you'll ever know. Just a text or a phone call to let them know you're thinking of them can make the world of difference. I had a couple of friends who texted me every single day with something like a stupid pun, or a picture of a cute animal, or even just \"hope you're ok today\". It meant so much to me that I was never really able to express to them at the time. I don't know how they knew to do that because sometimes I didn't even reply for days, but they kept it up and were so patient with me. I've since told them what it meant to me but I don't know if they'll ever really know. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo all I can say is be there for them. Let them know you're there if they want to talk about things, and that you won't judge them or think any less of them for it. But also let them know you're a solid friend, and you're there for them in general. That you enjoy their company. One friend of mine actually wrote me a letter once. He didn't write about my depression, but he just said how happy he was that we're friends, and to thank me for being a good friend. I don't know, it was just a really nice thing to do. I hope your friend is getting some professional help as well, because it really is a life saver. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: I also just wanted to add that you should take care of yourself too. Don't put too much responsibility on yourself. Let yourself rest from it, and be kind to yourself. \n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yes5p/"}
