I hung myself. But the rope broke after I'd passed out. I came-to on the floor. I sat up and felt something wet on the back of my scalp. It was blood. I'd hit my head on the corner of a dresser. There was a nice pool of blood forming. I freaked out and called 911 because I'd split my scalp open. Here I was, ready to die, and now I was scared that I was going to bleed to death. I will say, there was a young male medic that was with the group that showed up. He walked into the room and came back out white as a sheet. He didn't like seeing the broken rope hanging from the beam. It really freaked him out. So I made up my mind to never attempt suicide. If a complete stranger reacted like that, I could only imagine how the person would feel who found me. I just couldn't do that to anyone ever again. As for the split scalp, I received   fourteen stitches. Serves me right. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y86y2/"}
