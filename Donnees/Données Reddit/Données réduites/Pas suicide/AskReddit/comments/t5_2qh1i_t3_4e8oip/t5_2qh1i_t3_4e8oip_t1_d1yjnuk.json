I'm a recovering drug addict and when I overdosed, I had an EMT in the ambulance basically berate me for being an addict and making stupid decisions that led to me being clinically dead for several minutes. He made me feel worse than I already felt. Addicts already feel so much shame and stigma and this is why many are afraid to get help or reach out to anyone.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yjnuk/"}
