Waking up again 8 hours after taking over a hundred pills was like that big sigh when you realise no, your phone's fine; your pet looks at you; the email went to your colleague. I don't know what happened between falling asleep and waking up; I don't even know how I woke up and called an ambulance, as by rights I should have been dead; but the feeling was a total rush of \n'Someone up there likes me. Open your eyes, keep breathing, and don't ever fuck up like that again'.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6oyt/"}
