I know that other people will be affected by my suicide, namely my brother, unfortunately that's not enough. I can't live another 35-45 years just to spare him that pain. Plus, given his experiences I know that he'll understand. \n\nI've distanced myself from friends over the years so when it comes to it, it will be sad but not devastating for them. \n\nEither way, so long as I'm alive I'll try other things but barring a miracle I think it's reasonable to expect to continue feeling like this.
