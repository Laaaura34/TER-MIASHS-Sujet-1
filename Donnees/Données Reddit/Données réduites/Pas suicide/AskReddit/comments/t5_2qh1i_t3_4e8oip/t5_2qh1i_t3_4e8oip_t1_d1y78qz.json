Like the idea that a condescending comment from a strangers with a pithy message will potentially fix you just rubs me the wrong way.  \n\nAnyway, having been in a similar position to you, finding a truly foolproof way to kill yourself without harming, traumatizing, or seriously inconveniencing someone else is exceptionally difficult and expensive. Living sucks, but by the time you manage to put together plans to die in a non-horrible way, there's a good chance that you'll be feeling *just* better enough that you'll wait another day. And then another.
