People with depression often see life only in their small immediate surrounding. When you look what causes your depression (lack of friends/success , break ups),  it isn't so hard to actually fight it. With billions of people living in the world of which the vast majority doesn't even know you, it really doesn't matter what happens in your direct environment. Your life is so small and unimportant and the world with all its possibilities so big. Killing yourself over a lack of social contacts is so petty. Life's not shit , your current situation is. You can change your life simply by moving away and discovering other parts of the world.  Nothing is really as important as you think it is.
