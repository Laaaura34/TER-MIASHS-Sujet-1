I'm sure you've learned between then and now, but for any passers-by: If normal life brought you to the point of suicide, normal life needs to change. A lot. A changed life can be embarrassing and painful, but it also comes with good things- 'normal' life would've ended right there and never have another good thing ever. No more bacon. No sex.
