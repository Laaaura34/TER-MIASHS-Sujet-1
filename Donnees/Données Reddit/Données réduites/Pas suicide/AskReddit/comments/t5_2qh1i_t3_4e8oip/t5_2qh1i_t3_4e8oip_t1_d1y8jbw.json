The gun just refused to go off, both with freshly reloaded rounds, and factory loads. I got pissed off and chucked the shotgun under my bed and took a nap. Went to the range later on with my dad, and didn't miss a single shot with the same rounds that refused to kill me. That was the last honest attempt I made, about 7 years ago. I've had the thought about once a month, and came really damn close about two years ago, but I learned from my dad growing up that all a man has is his word, and I gave my word to too many people to try again. So I just sit here and suffer while people try to cheer me up or ask what's going on. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8jbw/"}
