It hurt so much, especially when you're conscious throughout the first few minutes. The only saving grace was that I fainted halfway through and didn't know what happened afterwards. Apparently, the rope snapped right after I lost consciousness and, well, let me live. The worst was that I was only starting high school. I had so much to live for, but I chose to throw it away so carelessly. I won't go into details about my other attempts, but this one was definitely the worst.
