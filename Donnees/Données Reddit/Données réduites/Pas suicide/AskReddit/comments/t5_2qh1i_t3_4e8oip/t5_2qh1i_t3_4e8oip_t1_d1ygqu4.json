Drank something around 3/4. Got hit by a taxi in the passenger side of the car, driving on the wrong side of the street. Lost the car, but luckily didn\u2019t get hurt at all.\nAfter that I feel so much better and feel like life has its worth. Never thought about doing anything like that ever since.\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ygqu4/"}
