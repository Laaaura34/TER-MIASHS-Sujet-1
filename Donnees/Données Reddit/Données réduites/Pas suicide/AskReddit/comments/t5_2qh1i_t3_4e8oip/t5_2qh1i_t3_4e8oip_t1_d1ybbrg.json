When I came to I tried to pull the cannula out. My mother had to convince me it was a bad idea as she had gone into recovery to be there when I came to. It took a few minutes for me to be lucid enough for this to be understood.  \n  \nTo this day the feeling of a cannula in my arm is the thing I hate most about hospital. The fact I felt and looked like I went three rounds with Mike Tyson didn't phase me. It was that fucking thing in my arm that I disliked the most.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ybbrg/"}
