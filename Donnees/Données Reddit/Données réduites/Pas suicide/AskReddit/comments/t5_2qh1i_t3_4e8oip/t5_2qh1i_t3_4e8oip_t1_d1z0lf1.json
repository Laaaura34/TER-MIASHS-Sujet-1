It is just how human works, your parents likely struggled to understand your pain, and to them, it feels like their failure never knowing how to pull you out of the shadows. I think they are hurting, too,  and they express that through showing disapprovals, in the hopes that by disapproving, it can get you to walk out of the darkness you are in.\n\nThey are not showing the disapproval with an intension discourage you, and are doing it only because they want to love you,  but they don't understand how. \n\nI think if you were to tell them that the disapproval hurts,  but you understand they are trying to love you, it would probably change things and brighten it up.  Parents are sometimes kids too, they just needed to know that their love is getting through to you, and you love them too.\n\nKeep working at it,  keep your spirits up. Life is tough on you,  but know that you are loved. It is not going to be easy,  but you will find a way out of this maze. Job hunting is a job in itself, and it takes much energy. Stay strong,  like you have been. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1z0lf1/"}
