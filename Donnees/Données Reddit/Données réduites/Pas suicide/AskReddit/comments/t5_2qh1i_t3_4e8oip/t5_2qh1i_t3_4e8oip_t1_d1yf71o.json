I know it's a shitty way to do it but for an alcoholic it seemed fitting. I woke up in my suit on the couch the next day still drunk at 5pm feeling like shit and confused. I realized I was alive and that it was a terrible idea. I checked my phone and say that lots of friends were both concerned and giving me shit for getting that drunk. So i had people that cared about me. I went back to bed and slept till the next day and finally had the worst hangover of my life two days later. I have never been that low again.
