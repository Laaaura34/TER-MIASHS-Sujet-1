I attempted suicide multiple times yet I'm still alive. Apparently I really suck at it.\n\n\"Goddammit. What the fuck?\" Was my response when the rope I was using to hang myself broke. It was disappointing to say the least.\n\n\"Holy shit, I'm alive. This sucks,\" followed by, \"Cops will be here soon and they're going to make me explain things.\" I decided to end my life while driving, which I enjoy very much when I'm not trying to commit suicide. Drank copious amounts of alcohol and took a handful of pills to prepare myself for it. I picked a wooded area with a large drop from the road so there would be plenty of things to run into. At this point I unbuckled my seatbelt, got my speed up to around 60 and jerked the wheel. I wake up in the rear cargo area of my small SUV, covered in water, glass, and superficial cuts and bruises. Being arrested later really rubbed salt in the wound.\n\n\"Why am I covered in blood, urine and vomit? Oh yeah...\" My final attempt was on October 4, 2015. I decided to give myself a fatal dose of IV Heroin but it didn't give me the results I desired.\n\nThings have gotten significantly better since my last attempt and I would not consider myself suicidal anymore. That was also the last time I used opiates so life is good and getting better at the moment.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y5jy9/"}
