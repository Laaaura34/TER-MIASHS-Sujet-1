Several years later I attempted again, I vividly remember how scary those last moments of consciousness where and thinking about how I should have said goodbye and that I'd never see my loved ones again. After I woke up, two days later in ICU, I was scared because I didn't know where I was, but then I was thankful to have a chance to see my family again.\n\nI swore after that hospital stay, and the hefty bill that came along with it, I wouldn't attempt again. It's been 5 years since then. I would be lying if I said I haven't thought about suicide again. But I always remind myself of those moments before I blacked out, also I think of my brother who found me (we've never talked about it because I'm ashamed and I know it deeply hurt him). I've also started getting involved in the community working with survivors and people affected by suicide. All of these reasons keep me from attempting again. There isn't a cure and the feelings never fully go away, but you can find things worth living for.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y3j7z/"}
