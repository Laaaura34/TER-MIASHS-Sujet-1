I use to go and it was once every two weeks. My therapist let me run the session as far as what I wanted to talk about and it's the BEST thing EVER. She never discredited me, but did help me talk my way through everything from childhood issues to why someone pissed me off at work. Every session was productive and constructive even if we just chatted about unimportant things. She was so good at validating my feelings while helping me think in different directions. It really improved my mental maturity. \n\nAlso, let her know that you do love her. Never let her doubt that-even if you leave. \n\nIf you choose to leave, your daughter should get seen by a therapist to help her cope and to deal with anything negative you or your wife could accidentally say about the other. (It happens. We are all human.) It will help your daughter understand a lot better than if you or your wife tried to explain because emotions will be high.
