She was my everything and my life would've ended with hers. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 confided in me that he tried (unsuccessfully) to shoot himself as a teenager. Without him in this world, I have no idea if I would ever have found love. \n\nWhether you realize it yet or not, someone out there is looking for you, exactly YOU. You fill someone's void, you are someone else's rescue. I have 2 people in my life that hold my heart in their hands and if they go, I go. \n\nSuicide doesn't let you escape your problems, it shoves them onto your loved ones. Don't do that to the people that love and don't abandon the people that will need you in the future. You are more important than you realize.
