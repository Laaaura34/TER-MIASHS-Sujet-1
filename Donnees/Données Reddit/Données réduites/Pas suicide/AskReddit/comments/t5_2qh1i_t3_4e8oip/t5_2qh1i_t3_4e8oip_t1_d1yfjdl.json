I was tired of being thrown around between family members, spending my days skipping school to find ways to care for my siblings, since my mother worked full time and my father was out of the house 13 hours of the day, and when he was home he was strung out high or drunk and abusive in every way.\n\n\nMy grandma ended up making my father take me to the ER, which he tried to avoid doing. I walked in, stood next to the bed, and apparently fainted(this was after I had already spent hours on a couch at home in and out of consciousness.\n\nMy first conscious thought was waking up on the hospital bed with my father laying beside me groping me. I screamed st him to get off, and thus was my first conscious thought after realizing I was still alive", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yfjdl/"}
