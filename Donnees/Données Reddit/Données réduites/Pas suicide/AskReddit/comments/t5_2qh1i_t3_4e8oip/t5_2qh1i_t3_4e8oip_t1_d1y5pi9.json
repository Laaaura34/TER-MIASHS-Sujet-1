I kicked the chair out from under me and in that moment of extreme pain, I couldn't go through with it. Not because I was thinking about it but because it hurt so much that it was just a natural reaction to stop. I braced myself on the walls of the stairwell and un-roped myself, knowing I couldn't go through with the pain again but not really thinking any words to myself at that point like if I were talking to myself, just thinking those very basic thoughts. I think my first real higher-level thoughts were of needing to just get out of that place.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y5pi9/"}
