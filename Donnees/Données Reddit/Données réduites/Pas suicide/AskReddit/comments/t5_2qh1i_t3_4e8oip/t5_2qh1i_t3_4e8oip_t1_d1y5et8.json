The knot I tied managed to loosen itself enough so that I woke up again after two minutes (I passed out in < 5 seconds). I woke up gasping for air and panic in my chest. Had no clue where I was for a few moments. After realizing I failed, I didn't really think much about it. I just double knotted the constrictor knot and tried again. I failed again and same reaction waking up. Then I figured I needed a rougher rope that had more friction, so I stopped for the night and went to sleep. Figured I had to get ready for school tomorrow. Still have those rope burn scars on my neck, but I'm feeling better after being sent to a psych ward.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y5et8/"}
