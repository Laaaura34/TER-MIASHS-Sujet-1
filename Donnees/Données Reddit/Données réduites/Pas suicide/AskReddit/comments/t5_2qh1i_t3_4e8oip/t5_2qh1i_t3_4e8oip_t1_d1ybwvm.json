It was the type of belt with the two metal \"D\" shapes at the end that you loop through and pull tight.   I had placed it around my neck and pulled as tight as I could.  I started feeling like my face was turning to stone (it's the best way I can describe the sensation).  \n\nThe next thing I know I hear my stepmother calling me from the top of the stairs. My room was in the basement, so my parents would just open the door and yell down when dinner was ready.  I was completely embarrassed.  I now had a huge mark around my neck.  The belt must have loosened just enough for me to regain blood flow and start breathing again.  I threw on a turtleneck and went upstairs.  Never to speak of it again.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ybwvm/"}
