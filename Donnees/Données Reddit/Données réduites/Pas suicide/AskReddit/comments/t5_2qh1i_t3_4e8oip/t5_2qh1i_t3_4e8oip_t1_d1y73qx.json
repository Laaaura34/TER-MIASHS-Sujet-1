No such luck. I don't have a cellphone with service so I could only call 911. After I called I realized I'd need a story and so I told the cop my tire blew out (which it had, after impact) and he seemed to believe me fine. Didn't even ask if I'd been drinking or anything (which I hadn't been).\n\nThis was a about a month ago, give or take a few days, and it was the easily the lowest point in my life mentally. I've been recovering really well. My car wasn't actually totaled, it just needed a good few parts and a couple tires and it was right as rain. \n\nI think I needed to get that low before I could really start recovering. I don't know. It's always darkest before the dawn, they say. \n\nIt's strange how this isn't even close to being the worst part of my life and yet it's been so impossible shaking the misery. Mental illness has been so fucked up and I'm so glad I seem to be getting past it.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y73qx/"}
