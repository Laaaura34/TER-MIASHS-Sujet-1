It wasn't my college of choice and I had only applied there at the behest of my guidance counselor.\n    \nTurns out I would get a full scholarship and proceed to REALLY make a mockery of the school I attended. Long story short, I felt myself starting to slip into dour moods which did not fit my personality and sought counseling from the school who proceeded to never get back in touch with me. In hindsight the program was really mismanaged.    \n    \nANYWAY. After not receiving any attention, help, out-reach, etc, I decided that my life really just wasn't worth continuing. \"Clearly, no one must care if I stay or go, so I might as well go.\"    \n    \nOr so I thought.\n    \nI tried to hang myself from a closet clothing bar with a belt tied into a tight loop. I hung long enough to lose consciousness, but the bar must have snapped because the next thing I remember I had fallen out of the closet and my clothing was literally everywhere.\n    \nNo one called me or came to check on the sound.\n    \nMy immediate thought was, \"Fuck this. I will make the world care about me.\"    \n    \nHaven't tried since.\n    \nFunny thing about the \"No one cares if I stay or go...\" argument: if you might as well go, then you might as well stay by the same premise.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yi08t/"}
