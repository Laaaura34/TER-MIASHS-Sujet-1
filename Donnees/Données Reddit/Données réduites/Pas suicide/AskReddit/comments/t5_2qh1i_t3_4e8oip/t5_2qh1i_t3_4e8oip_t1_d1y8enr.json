I had been taking a higher than recommended dose of Tylenol to weaken my kidneys for a few weeks prior to that, but one day everything got too much and I just took a handful of pills and slowly started to lose consciousness thinking everything was finally over. I'm a bigger guy, so I guess I didn't take enough because I woke up I don't know how much longer later and I recognized it didn't work, then when I tried to get up, I couldn't move my legs... I tried to massage them to get blood flowing but I was sitting for about an hour without even feeling them. I had to text me roommate, who was also my best friend since grade school, that I needed his help. I didn't tell him what happened, but he wanted me to go to the on-campus health center. I told him I was fine, and he still half-carried me there.  \n  \nEnded up going to therapy a few weeks later. It helped. He still doesn't know what I tried to do.  \n  \nThrowaway for obvious reasons. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8enr/"}
