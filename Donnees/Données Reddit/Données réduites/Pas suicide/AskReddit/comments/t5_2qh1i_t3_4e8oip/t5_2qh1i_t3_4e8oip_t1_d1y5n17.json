It started when I was 10 years old..I began to get extremely happy like anything in the world made me happy, I smiled non-stop and it lasted that was til I was about 22 I don't know what changed what happened can't explain it but one night I woke up after a blissful 12 years and every single moment of every single day I wish I was dead. I have attempted 10+ times and three of them have been \"miracles\". I survived a hanging. I survived a 122 foot fall from the 13th story of a hotel and I survived shooting up 10 50 unit syringes of air. I dont know how I am alive and why I can't just die. I am so sad.
