I'd been raped by a man. I couldn't get my head right. I overdosed on everything I could find and went to bed to die. My next memory is laying in bed on the hospital ward with my dad next to the bed. He looked at me and asked: \"this wasn't because of me was it?\"\n\nI'll never forget the guilt I felt in that moment. He'd been sat there all night scared shitless that his son might die and - wrongly - that he might somehow be the cause of it. He's not what you'd call an emotional man; he's gruff, pragmatic, conservative. Seeing the tears in his eyes and hearing his voice crack... it will stay with me.\n\n20 more years later, that guilt is what stops going through with it now. I stand at the platform edge waiting for the tube train to roll in, or walking over Waterloo bridge on my way home, and I wish I had it in me to jump. I even went to Canada to try, hoping that the distance would somehow ameliorate the memory. But I feel such guilt ... for my family and friends... who, despite whatever note I might leave, would be caused immense grief.\n\nDon't do it kids. If you feel like you can't go on, talk to someone.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9jqw/"}
