Took quite alot i was through three packets one panado one nurofen and one antidepressants (zoloft). In my dazed motion i accidently sent a snap chat to a friend saying goodbye. I had driven down to the beach and hidden my car little did i know i left my.phone tracker on. Ah the joys of hospital trips amd your stomach being pumped.\n\nI can now say getting out of the toxic relationship being with my new partner and expecting twins  has made me the happiest I've  been in nearly six years.\n\nSurviving a suicide attempt has left me . somewhat scarred  but it opened up my family to my pain and they really realized how broken i was.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yeiww/"}
