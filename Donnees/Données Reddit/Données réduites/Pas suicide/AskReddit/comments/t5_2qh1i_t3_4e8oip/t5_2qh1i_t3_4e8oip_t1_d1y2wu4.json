So much confusion. I woke up behind a maglock door handcuffed to a bed. That's all that was in the room. Me and the bed. I started crying, asking for help. A male nurse came in and was very annoyed and kind of rude to me.\n\n I found out later, I had drank half a bottle of vodka and taken a bunch of painkillers and sleeping pills. I somehow managed to get myself on a city bus, and get off at the stop at the hospital. \n\nApparently I stormed into the ER and collapsed. Woke up, tried to fight the nurse, police came in, cuffed me, they gave me a sedative and 15 hours later I woke up.  \n\nI don't know if that counts. I defiantly tried to kill myself. I should have probably died. But I didn't. And the first thing I thought was, \"fuck. My liver hurts.\" \n\nTL;DR: Fucking destroyed my liver with painkillers, sleeping pills and a bunch of vodka. Woke up in the mental ward. Thought to myself \"fuck, my liver hurts.\" ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y2wu4/"}
