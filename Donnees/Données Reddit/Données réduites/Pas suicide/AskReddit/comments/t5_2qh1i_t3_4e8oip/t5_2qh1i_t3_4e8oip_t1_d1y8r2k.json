Basically when you *think* you're about to give up and you've given it your best shot, you've still got 60% in the tank, for times like this.\n\nWhich is incredible really. I'm the same reason 125lb mothers lift a tonne of car off their trapped child or whatever - adrenaline is one  hell of a drug.
