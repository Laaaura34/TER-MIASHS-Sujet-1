I looked over to my younger brother on the next bed and i broke down silently in bed. I dont recall how i really felt. I just cried and got out to shower and attended school. This had happened several times.\n\nMy mother passed away 13 years ago and my dad and stepmother divorced after five years of marriage. My dad was not the father figure he was supposed to be; abandoning us to ourselves in the house whilst he had to deal with his own issues. I created a strong bond with my younger brother and thinking back, i am glad i hadnt \"tried harder\". Ive been off meds for over four years now and my brother has been doing good in school and is now in the rugby team. I wouldnt deny that what i did was selfish. But what i would like to point out is suicide always seems to be the easist way out. As much as your friends or society tells us that suicide is never the solution, when youre in a dark place and youre suffocating,  tearing up the wound wide open big enough to numb it seems to be the only option. My heart goes out to suicide victims and survivors. There is no way to tell if it is the right or wrong thing to do.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yga0s/"}
