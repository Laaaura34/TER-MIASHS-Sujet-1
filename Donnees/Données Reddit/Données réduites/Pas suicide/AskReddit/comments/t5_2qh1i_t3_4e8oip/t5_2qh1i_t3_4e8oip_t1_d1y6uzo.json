When she has tried to kill herself in the recent past, has she been sent to the hospital? Has she had any referrals to a therapist? Your girlfriend may want to give her mom the number of a suicide hotline, and see if she can get her mom to agree (in writing even) to call when she's feeling like she wants to die. Even better would be to get the mom to call a therapist if she doesn't have one already. Also may be smart to talk about removing any means of hurting or killing herself from the house - as in, talk with her about what plans she might have had, and try to come to a mutual agreement to get any of the things she would use out of the house where she wouldn't be able to use them.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6uzo/"}
