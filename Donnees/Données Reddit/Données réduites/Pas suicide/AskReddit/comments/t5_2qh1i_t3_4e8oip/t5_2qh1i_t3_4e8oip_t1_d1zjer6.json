Like seeing spiders everywhere, having full conversations with people who aren't there, repeating the same action 100s of times because you keep forgetting what your doing, etc. Almost every single one says the same thing too \"I would NOT recommend it!\"    \n\nIf you haven't, read up on erowid.com of some of the stories, there's some real crazy ones. That one, and also the other deleriant drugs like Datura or dramamine. Real scary, not a good idea to ever take them, but they sure are fun as hell to read about though!", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1zjer6/"}
