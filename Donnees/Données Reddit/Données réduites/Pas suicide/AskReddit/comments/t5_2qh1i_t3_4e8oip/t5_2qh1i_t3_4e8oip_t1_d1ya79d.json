I can tell you that you're not alone, that I'm afraid when I have children that I won't be able to be a good father to them because of my depression, and I can tell you that your children are worth staying in this world for. But what I really want to address is this:\n\n> I can't handle this anymore.\n\nYou can. It feels like you can't, I know, I've been there, but I know you can because tomorrow you're calling your doctor. That's you fighting depression. That's you saying that you don't accept it, that you want to be better and you know you want to beat it. It may feel like a small step, but remember that every step you take is a victory. Fighting is winning and you have something worth fighting for. So whenever you catch yourself saying you can't handle it any more remember what you've done and think about what you're going to do and think about why you're going to do it and remember that you *can* handle it. I believe in you. You're stronger than you think you are.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ya79d/"}
