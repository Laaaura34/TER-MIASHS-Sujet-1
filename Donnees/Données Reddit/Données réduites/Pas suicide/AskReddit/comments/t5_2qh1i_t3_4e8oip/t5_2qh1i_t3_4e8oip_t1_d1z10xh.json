I won't make light of it, I know what it is like. And although I was 14 many years ago, I do remember what it was like.\n\nI would like you to try to understand that this won't last forever, this is temporary, and kids are dicks. Most of them will grow out of it. You will mature and grow up and realize they are just doing it out of their own insecurity and selfishness. And if you choose to, you can make changes to your physical self. It might make you feel better, I know I feel better about myself when I look better. But how you look doesn't define your value. You still have worth, no matter what you look like, or what music you like or what other people say about you. Look for and find that part of yourself. Love yourself, because you are lovable. Find help and talk to someone. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1z10xh/"}
