That sounds familiar. The hard thing is that a lot of times there is nothing anyone could've told me to make me realize I needed to work on my depression alone. Nothing. \n\nI will say though, no matter what my family SAID to help worked.... but the fact that whey were just THERE was life changing. I have an incredibly supportive family and while it was a tough time, they had nothing but unconditional love for me. When the bf and I broke up, I maybe didn't realize it at the time, but it turns out my family was my ultimate rock, not whoever my significant other at the time was (not to downplay his support). And while I was a little shit about the breakup, acting like and thinking it was the end of my world, little did I know the reason I did make it through everything was my mom and dad and sisters were there listening and holding me when I was crying and dealing with the PTSD (source of depressions for me) and all without asking for thanks. \n\nI guess all I'm saying is let him know no matter what happens (with the girlfriend or otherwise), that you'll be there for him. And maybe reach out to her too, let her know she can talk to you when she's struggling as well.
