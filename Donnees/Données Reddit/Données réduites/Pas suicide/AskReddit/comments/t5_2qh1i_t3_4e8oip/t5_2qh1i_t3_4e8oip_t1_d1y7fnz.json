It was when I woke up in the hospital after getting my stomach pumped, I decided downing as much sleep aid as humanly possible and washing it down with whiskey at the age of 15. I woke up to my father asleep in the chair next to my hospital bed. I just started sobbing when I saw how much he'd been worrying, and how both he and my mother thought it was their fault. It was after that I decided to start taking my life seriously, not just for me, but the people around me too. \n\nApparently they found me in the bathroom, In a pool of my own piss, vomit, and shit. Took weeks to Scrub it all out of my hair. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7fnz/"}
