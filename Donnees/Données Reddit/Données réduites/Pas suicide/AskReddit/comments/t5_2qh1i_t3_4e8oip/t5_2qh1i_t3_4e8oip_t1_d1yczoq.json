The other alternative I can see for things getting better is moving out at 18 (Have to stay in education until then) and just restarting my entire life again, cutting off my dysfunctional family (bar my brother and sister), putting the stuff that happened growing up behind me and just getting a place and shitty job and working up from there. The problem is I'm not sure I can go another 365 days + of this. \n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yczoq/"}
