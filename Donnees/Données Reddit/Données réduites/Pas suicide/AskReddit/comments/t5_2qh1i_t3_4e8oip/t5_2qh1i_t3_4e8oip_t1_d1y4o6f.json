It does mean a lot to see it. That said -- honest question. What do you mean by feeling that you had something inherently wrong with you? I feel the same way a lot of the time, and, even fighting the depression like hell and pushing back and trying to make things better, life seems to continue to shit on me in new and creative ways. I don't know if there's a mindset change that I could implement that would fix it. If you don't mind sharing, can you go deeper into how you felt at that time and what was making you feel that way?
