We had all kinds of issues with people confusing our phone number.  Like we were an 800 number, but if you called the same number with a local Pittsburgh area code, you got the help center for a hospital, and if you swapped a few digits you got the help desk for AT&T.\n\nOne time I got a call from a guy who thought he was calling a suicide hotline.  I had no clue what to do.  I talked to him for a bit, telling him I wanted to help him, but I'm clueless about people.  If he were a software problem I could help.  Meanwhile I looked up the number he needed to call online.  I gave it to him and told him there were experts there who could help him, please please please call them.  I asked him to promise me, and he did, but who knows if he did or not.  \n\nIt's been 20 years, but I still think about him and hope he's OK.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yp7de/"}
