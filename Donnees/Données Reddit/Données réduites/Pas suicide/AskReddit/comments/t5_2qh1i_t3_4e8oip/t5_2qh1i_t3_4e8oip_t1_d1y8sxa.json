I don't really know.  All I see right now is the start of a process.  It's rarely just a mood disorder influencing me towards such thoughts.  There's stresses in life that sometimes get too unbearable.  There's also some pretty bad life conditions I ended up being in, conditions that would take serious work to get out of (of course, these add to the stresses).  And then there are others that I can't recall or put into words right now.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8sxa/"}
