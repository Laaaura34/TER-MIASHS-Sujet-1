I convinced my parents it was better for me to stay at home. \nI woke up the next morning sober and felt numb. I didn't really know what happened other than fragments that started coming back to me. I didn't really know what to do. I ended up sexting someone I had been talking to. Until the full gravity of what had happened hit me. (it's because of things like that that made me realise I had been using sex as an escape mechanism from dealing with any of my problems). \nI still think about that night a lot. I haven't felt properly suicidal or as bad since then.  \n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ysb8y/"}
