I had failed out of university, my gf at the time had cheated on me, I had destroyed my relationship with my family, abused alcohol and drugs to get away from my issues and surrounded myself with fake friends. \n\nMy advice to anyone who is dealing with depression and feel like they may be at the end of the line....**it will get better.** \n\nFind a productive hobby to fill the void. Surround yourself with good people that you can talk to about these issues. Avoid drinking and other substances. \n\nKeep the mind clear and focus on making yourself better in every aspect. \n\nMy life has done a complete turnaround since and that will forever be the lowest point in my life. No failure, set back, or personal loss will ever make me feel worse than I did in that particular moment in my life.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y66g0/"}
