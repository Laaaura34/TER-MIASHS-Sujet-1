Just not quite tying the noose right.  The ability to undo the knot otherwise would be damn near impossible. Aside from going hulk mode with the most epic one armed pull up of all time, which it sounds like is exactly what happened for you. Incredible. People astound me at times with the reality of what we're really capable of accomplishing. \n\nGood on you man. So glad you made it through that and moved on with life. Never forget you have a purpose here. Much love. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1zj3tu/"}
