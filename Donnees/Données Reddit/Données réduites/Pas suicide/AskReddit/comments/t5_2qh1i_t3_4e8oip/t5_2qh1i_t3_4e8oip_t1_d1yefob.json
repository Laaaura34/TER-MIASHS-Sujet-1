Dad found me, force-fed me ipecac, and apparently he, his girlfriend, and his girlfriend's daughter took turns holding me as I just vomited all of creation all over a tarp they laid out in the living room. I wasn't conscious for any of that.\n\nI remember when I woke up, I was ravenous. I wanted nothing more than just goldfish and Pepsi, and kinda locked myself in a room to play Half-Life 2 for an hour or two. I just needed some sort of stability or normalcy \u2014 I wasn't sure how to process the fact that I was still around.\n\nAnd then I went outside. Mind you, I had fully and entirely committed that I would not see stars again. I wouldn't see green, or feel humid Florida air, or hear the breeze lazily whooshing through pine trees. I went outside, and it was like seeing color for the first time all over again. I just cried. I didn't know why I was still around, and a large part of me was resentful that I had been saved.\n\nBut part of me was also just overwhelmed with the unending crystalline beauty of everything around me. And I mean EVERYthing: the humming of tires as traffic dinked about nearby was tied to bee-buzzings and a memory of a cello section from an orchestra rehearsal. Everything became lightly synesthetic, and I sat in the grass with a mix of happiness and dismay, just...drinking it in without judgment or decisions. Just feeling it all.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yefob/"}
