I had the worst panic attack of my life. I spent the next 3 days at home, i refused to go to the hospital, laying in bed and being almost unable to move. I took the bottle of trazodone the night before and tried to throw it up after but it was severe enough that i should have gone to the hospital. I didnt so much want to die as i just wanted to escape my feelings. Bipolar disorder sucks.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7qx1/"}
