I don't know how to word it, exactly. I don't know if you'd call me a survivor, as I basically sucked at trying to die, for all my efforts. My Mom also cared more about her sex life, her friends, and her pot than whether or not I was trying to take myself out so even when I should have been hospitalized, I never was. \n\nI did get feint from blood loss a few times and once of my overdose attempts knocked me out for a few hours the way Nyquil might, but that was it. \n\nHonestly, I'd say every time, even the stupid shit I did recently when I lapsed after *eleven years without an attempt* (sigh), it was always a variation on \"What the fuck was I thinking? I should have done (*insert whatever here*), instead.\" \"I'm so godamn stupid.\" \"I am so godamned worthless, I can't even die right.\" \n\nI wish I could say it was something profound and life changing like \"Oh thank God,\" or \"I got a second chance,\" or something like that, but the reality is that it's not that simple for most of us. Most of us either have a mental illness, severe trauma, or grew up in a shitty environment, or a combination of all of those (*waves* Hi, hello, right here). And it takes a lot more than managing to survive to help most of us crawl out from under that shit.\n\nThere's so much I could say on this topic in terms of my mental health and state and how so many of us struggle for most of our lives, but those are answers to questions that weren't asked.
