I had knocked back a few shots of gin, taken almost two dozen vicodin, and then chugged another pint of straight gin. Judging from the state I woke up in, I rejected the gin and barfed everything back up before passing out on my floor. There was no joy at being alive, no gratitude that I didn't drown in vomit, no excitement at a second chance; I woke up face down in a pool of puke with one of the worst hangovers of my life and the knowledge that not only did I feel like a total failure at life, I was enough of one that I I couldn't even opt out. I never got the stain completely out of the carpet and I never told a soul for about ten years. I wish I could say that things have gotten better and I now have a multitude of reasons why life is beautiful and I'm glad to still be here, but despite meds and therapy I still wish pretty regularly that I'd succeeded. Sometimes I wonder if maybe I actually did, and that a lifetime of depression and hiding behind a mask of humor and optimism is the purgatory I've been sentenced to for taking my own life.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ynu61/"}
