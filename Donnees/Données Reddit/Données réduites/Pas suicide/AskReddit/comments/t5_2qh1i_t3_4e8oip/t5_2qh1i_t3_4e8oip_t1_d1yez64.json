I was just angry and tired and didn't want to go on. It all happened in a row, first I took some pills, woke up groggy and 'drunk', tried to get myself into a car accident, and got the police called over, then i jumped off a roof to try to seal the deal, that didn't work either. I ended up with a fractured spine and still really wanted to just die. Afterwards I felt really shitty that even after everything, I couldn't even kill myself -- was I so big of a loser that I can't make this one thing right after decades of contemplating it? The one thing good that came out of this is that my parents became more understanding of my condition and I cut out some toxic people in my life (I still debate if that was a good thing). Now I'm living with a disability and still contemplating jumping off the roof again. I just don't want to live life.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yez64/"}
