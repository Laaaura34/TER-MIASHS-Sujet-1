Am I alive? Shit. How long have I been out? I didn't die. Damn. Here comes the psych ward.\"\n\nI overdosed on prescription pills. I woke up 2-3 days later in a hospital bed on suicide watch. I was hooked up to several machines. My heart and lungs/breathing were being monitored. Also had an IV. There was always a hospital staff member in the room at all times. I remember kissing my children good bye (they were 2 & 3 years old at the time) and taking a bottle of sedatives. My husband at the time called 911. I remember laying down to sleep in my bed and wanting to never wake up. They were not sure of the pill count at the time or of how many I ingested. I was lucky to be alive. This was 10 years ago. I was diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder and PTSD in 2005. Still have suicide thoughts time to time, and the incident I mentioned was the only one I lost consciousness. \n\nI've been hospitalized at least 15 the since 2005, and have had several attempts that have failed.
