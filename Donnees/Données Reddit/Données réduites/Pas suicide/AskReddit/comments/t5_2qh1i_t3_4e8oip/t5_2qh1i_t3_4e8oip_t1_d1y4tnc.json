In fact, I'm going to copy and paste some excerpts from my suicide note (I'm not currently suicidal, it's more of a \"suicidal ideation\" letter that I wrote to relieve my brain). I think it hits on all of these points very well and they're my words from about a year ago and I still feel the same:\n\n\n* Negativity is the norm, and positivity is disconcerting because it is foreign, and fleeting. Positivity used to be labeled \u201chope\u201d but hope is dead. Positivity is now a sick tease and stupid fucking naive child\u2019s fairytale.\n* Even when I have moments, fleeting, where I don\u2019t hate myself, the sludge is still there. And it drags me right back down.\n* Remember, I am aware of hope, happiness, excitement, goals, motivation, new starts. I am aware of what a huge difference 20 years can make, 10 years, hell, 2 years. I know that in six months this could lift. I could be \u201chappy\u201d. The scariest conclusion I have come to is that the emotions and \u201chigh points\u201d are not worth the lows of the low points. Black and white make grey. Grey is tainted. I am tainted, ruined. I think my brain chemicals are fucked. I don\u2019t care if I\u2019ll be happy again. \u201cRide the wave.\u201d The crash of the wave is more intense than the thrill of the catch. **Happiness is stressful because I wait for it to slip away, leaving me with darkness.**\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y4tnc/"}
