Over the years my emotions towards my mother have undergone something of a shift. I still keep some contact with her, although now it is completely on my terms.\n\nWhat I've come to realize is that she can't stand to acknowledge a lot of things, not just regarding her relationship with me, but in confronting the damage she has wrought on her own life. She simply lacks some critical capacity for self reflection and reconciliation. That's what I mean by broken.\n\nI used to hate her so for the way that she treated me, her only child. For the hours and days full of neglect, for the physical and mental abuse at the hands of a woman who presented herself to the world as a champion of ending such things. Now, however I largely pity her. For her shallowness, for her hypocrisy, for all of it.\n\nI suppose I choose some measure of forgiveness because it's a burden to hate. I'm not doing it for her, but for myself.\n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8htb/"}
