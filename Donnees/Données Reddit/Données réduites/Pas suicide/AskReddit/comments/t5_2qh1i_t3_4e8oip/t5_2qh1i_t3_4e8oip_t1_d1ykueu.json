I had a similar situation, my mom's mom, he boyfriend raped me for years and when I finally gained the courage to tell someone, nothing came of it. I told her and she said she always had suspicions. Then made me go with her to buy him valentine's day gifts. I've since stopped talking to the majority of my family because they blame me. I've considered killing myself multiple times, but my kids need me and I refuse to let them have that satisfaction that what they did affected me. I hope you're better now", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ykueu/"}
