Dunno where you live but in the UK it's easy to email/facebook artists, you can find someone who is perhaps a specialist with coverups and scarring who may be able to advise and consult you on what will work with whatever scars you have left. You won't have to disclose what sort of scars (although no doubt they will know, there's a lot of self harmers in all stages of recovery out there) but you can guage how experienced they are dealing with it, getting good results etc. \n\nOnly thing I'll say is going over scars is more painful - I haven't got any from self harming, but have got lots of tats on my wrists that went over small scars (accident prone child with no fear) and you can feel it more. But, if the scars bring you mental pain then the short physical pain to transform them into something deeply personal to you that won't bring unwanted questions will be worth it :)", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9jk4/"}
