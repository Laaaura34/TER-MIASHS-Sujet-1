Each time, the panic and pain took over and caused me to loosen the noose or take the bag over my head. \n\nI would always wonder why I backed out, why I couldn't wait until I fell unconscious. Then it would all have been over. I felt like a complete fuck up. I wasn't strong enough to continue living, and I wasn't strong enough to commit to dying. I still regret being too weak to go though with it. But now I've accepted that I won't really ever have the determination to go through with it.\n\nSorry for the poorly written rambling, I just kinda wanted to get it off my chest.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y60wd/"}
