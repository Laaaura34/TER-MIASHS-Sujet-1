And my brother, I felt really guilty about that part. My bro and I are super close, and having to look everyone in the face after all the shit I put them through because of the shit I did thanks to depression. For anybody wondering, I had depression which led to insomnia, and all the shrinks and psychiatrists just gave me one pill after another, for sleep and depression, and that ended in me abusing them pretty hard, and mixing them with alcohol. It turned into an almost daily thing. OD'd pretty hard on that stuff. In the past though, just some scars and memories left to remember that stuff. \n\nIt really does get better, as clich\u00e9 as that sounds.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8ew1/"}
