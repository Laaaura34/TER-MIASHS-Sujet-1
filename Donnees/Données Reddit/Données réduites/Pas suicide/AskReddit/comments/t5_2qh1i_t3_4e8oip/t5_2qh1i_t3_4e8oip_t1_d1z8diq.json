But eventually my memory of the feeling went away, like all feelings. Dissociation is hell, u can barley feel but when u feel , u forgot how it feels in some seconds. Its like sensory Alzheimers. No offense \n\nI suffered from chronic  depersonalization and chronic HPPD. And I have a really bad form of hppd as well. So I was always thinking about commiting suicide. But despite this all I can't resist my curious feeling of the future . but I am the type of suicider that put we in a situation where it can happen, and if it happens , too bad.\n\nLast thing I remember was that I took 4mg xanax, 9 h later I wake up in my mind because of a call, it was the police. Someone had called because I was cutting my arms, and drinking alcohol after eating the whole 30mg bag of xanax.\n\nThe sad thing is that is likely I won't get older than 30 because of my destructive behavior. And no one will ever understand the situation I'm in, and it feela so lonley. Every one dies eventually with there memories so it really doesn't matter when someone chooses to go", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1z8diq/"}
