I literally tried to commit suicide just this weekend. Used an electrical cord and tied it to the door handle - I was afraid the closet beam would break. \n\nI remember thinking, \"Wow this is really effective, this is really painful, this is really scary.\" Then my boyfriend came in and caught me, though I thought he was going to be gone for a while. \n\nMy first thought was, \"I'm going to catch hell. Things will be even worse now. I fucked up big time. I hate myself more than ever.\" My boyfriend told me what a selfish asshole I was being and to grow up. So much shame and guilt and I can't even quantify it. \n\nThe next day he was angry because I wasn't properly \"over it.\" Though I'm still not sure what that means - I guess because I'm still depressed?", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ygwom/"}
