I woke up once in the er 48hrs later on a respirator, hospital put me back under. woke up the following day with no respirator. \"how the fuck was that not enough\" (this statement initiated baker act) was my realization. From taking the pills to hospital, i have no recollection of that time period. spent 10 days in civilian er, spent another 22days in va inpatient psychiatric care.\n\nsince my attempt with that amount of medication, i have developed gastroenterology issues. Dropped 120lbs within 90 days of attempt, symptoms of food poisoning/diarrhea(12-18/day) upon digesting any liquid or food that produces waste. digesting any type of food hurts, and have significantly reduced calorie absorption. Going on year 4 in july. Its now becoming normal to throw up undigested meals 8 to 12 hrs after consumption every 3 to 5 weeks. \n\nIm waiting for appointments and to see blood in the contents of my stomach or black stool, digesting blood. currently working with 3 gastroenterology facilities to determine problem. they also think i picked something up in iraq...2008. I now take way more rx pills just to keep food down and in me for longer then 30minutes. im slowly wasting away in a constant state of pain. i regret that my attempt was not lethal.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1z6fya/"}
