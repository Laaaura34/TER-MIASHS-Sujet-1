Well, maybe a few times a year. But not nearly as often as I did back then. Most days I still wish I would have succeeded, however. I'm not really in a much better place mentally but I have mostly gotten my life on track enough to be a normal member of the rat race.\n\nI don't see much good in the world and that makes it really difficult to change my mindset. My girlfriend is positive Patricia about life and it's very very hard for me most of the time to accept that. My cat is my best friend and the thing I look forward to the most everyday.\n\nI'd like to think that most people are able to turn their lives around and work towards finding happiness. Gf and I have argued many times over this topic. She thinks suicide is selfish, but it is far more selfish (imo) to want somebody you care about to be alive and live miserably everyday just because you don't want to deal with them being gone.
