To see a comment like this along with all the other positive comments helped and I reminded myself that I was not ready to read these type of stories.\r\r To everyone in this thread, stay strong, together we can overcome our difficulties, life might never be perfect but it can be freaking good at times, no matter what we have or are going through, be it in our minds or our environment.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1z506u/"}
