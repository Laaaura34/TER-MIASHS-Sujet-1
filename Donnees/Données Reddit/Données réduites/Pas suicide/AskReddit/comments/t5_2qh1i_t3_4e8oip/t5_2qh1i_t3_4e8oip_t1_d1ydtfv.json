It wasn't because I realized I had lived though the night, but because I wasn't throwing up anymore (in retrospect I don't think I did actually throw up, but for some reason I remembered doing it at the time), my stomach wasn't churning as bad, and my room wasn't a mess. For some reason that relieved me too. I was afraid of making someone clean up after me. For the rest of the week though, mundane activities left me out of breath for long enough to retch, and I still retch to this day any time Im winded. I also feel sick when I can smell strong odors from cleaning supplies. \n\nDuring the week, my roommate kept telling me to see my therapist and go to the hospital. When I finally got out of the hospital, my friend got me fish and told me he was counting on me to take care of them and they were a hassle, but it really kept my head clear a lot of the times, and I never wanted to kill myself and leave them behind.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ydtfv/"}
