I think you make an excellent point, its not a bad thing to point out, its not something we should try to excuse. We should of course feel sympathy for others and acknowledge someone's loss, these things cannot be lessened for suicides, nor should there be shame involved in this either.\n\nI guess to clear up what I mean a bit better is not so much the word selfish, its a strong word, people do certainly feel strongly against its use in this case as it suggests that its all completely wrong and discounts the suffering.\n\nNot at all, I really should make it clear that I would not wish to discount any of this, the word is only used in this case to show that its an act that has a *huge* weight to it, and a great cost.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1zevd9/"}
