I had intentions of going through with it this time so I put a  pillow case over my head so my family wouldn't see my face. It was hard to breathe already and I when I dropped I could've sworn I was fading away but all I can remember is laying face down on my bed crying and wondering what the fuck just happened. I felt so weak physically,. I have no idea where I could've gotten the strength to prop myself up. Ever since then I've felt a bit better and am pretty over the suicidal tendencies. Most days. I wonder if failed asphyxiation can fuck you up.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9qx6/"}
