Hanged myself in the closet. My cat must have walked into the closet and I accidentally stepped on him.  The noise he made snapped me back to after blacking out.  My first immediate thought was \"What is happening?\"  Things felt warm and confusing and I couldn't breathe. I frantically tried to loosen the rope and my first formed thought was \"Holy fuck, what did I just almost do?\" Then I started crying hysterically, called my mom (I was 27 at the time). I never felt more alive those weeks after that .  Depression is an uphill battle even with tons of professional help. Cat saved my life.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yduqr/"}
