I hated myself for not being able to just do it and get it over with. Instead i got into as many drugs as a child could with no money, which is a surprising amount. I was with my SO at the time and did a few too many and overdosed, so instead of a high to make me senseless i tripped so bad i though that i died. Seconds felt like an eternity and everything that my senses perceived would repeat hundreds of times until they picked up something else to torture me with. After i came out of the experience, the SO was holding me and crying. She told me that i was flipping between shallow rapid breaths to not breathing. I was like that for almost an hour. After i threw up a few times, i laid dow and cried until my eyes were dry. After that day, i had PTSD? (Would have the same feeling) I hated every day after and sometimes felt like i did die on that day. Thankfully for me it moved me away from the terrible people that i used to call my friends and kept me away from drugs. I am better now, but still have anxiety when i feel get Deja Vu. \nSorry for the bad format, on mobile.
