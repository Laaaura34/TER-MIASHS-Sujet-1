Multiple attempts on my own life, I can't even count the number of times I've sat with a razor to my wrist or my neck in a noose. I'm not even sure if the numbering of these is even close, but these are the big significant attempts that pop to mind. I've tried hanging myself, overdosing, alcohol poisoning, falling from some height, stepping into traffic.... I'm not very successful at dying. \n\nFirst attempt: \"I can't do anything right.\"\n\n2nd: \"Its going to be hard to pretend everything is OK once everyone hears about this.\"\n\n3rd: \"HAHAHAHAH fuck the world fuck this fuck that and fuck you too\" followed by the 4th attempt that weekend. \n\n4th: \"Just pretend everything is OK, or they will never let you out of here.\"\n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7xg8/"}
