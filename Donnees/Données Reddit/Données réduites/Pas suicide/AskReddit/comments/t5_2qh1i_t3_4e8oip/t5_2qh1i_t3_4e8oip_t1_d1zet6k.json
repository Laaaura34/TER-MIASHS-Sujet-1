Decided i was gonna check myself out before someone else did, thank god the branch I tied my rope to snapped.  Took all my willpower to decide the weird pride I felt living in a fucked up neighboorhood was just not right.  I moved to different cities in the same state and somehow always managed to meet the local dealers. I moved halfway across the country, and after a couple years of reflection and sobriety started working on changing myself.  I still  have a shadow hanging over me and I think Ill carry it to my grave cause I dont really see me forgetting where I grew up and the feelings that it stirs up.  Even after 11 years of moving out of my old  neighborhood I haven't been able to shake off old habits(not talking of drugs, althogh I still get cravings after 7 years sober).  Anyways I started this post to wish you continued success with your life, and sort of rambled on. Wish you luck, man", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1zet6k/"}
