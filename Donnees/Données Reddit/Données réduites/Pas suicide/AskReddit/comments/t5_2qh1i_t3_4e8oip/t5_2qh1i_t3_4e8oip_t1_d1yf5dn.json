The second one was a primer that didn't go off on a live round, which would be fucking insane.\n\nEdit- after reading looks like what also could have happened was a live round was in the chamber and he racked it using the slide release with an empty tube which would just get rid of the round in the chamber.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yf5dn/"}
