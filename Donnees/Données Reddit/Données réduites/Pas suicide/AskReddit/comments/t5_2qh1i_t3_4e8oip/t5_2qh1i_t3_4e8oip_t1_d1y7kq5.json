I pulled trigger and the gun jammed. I actually felt like more of a failure at that point, when I noticed a picture of me and my ex gf's son at my desk. I realized I made that kids life different over the past three years and he changed me for the better. Then decided it wasn't worth it. Never told anyone this story, but glad to post here and get it off my chest.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7kq5/"}
