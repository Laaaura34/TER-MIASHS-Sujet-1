After getting bullied and my dad leaving, I felt terrible. I felt useless and thought(somewhat still think) all of those insults they used to say about me were true. \n\nI felt worthless and tried to OD.\nI took one pill after another but slowly enough. When I reached the \"dangerous\" level I just broke out.\nI'm someone that doesn't cry anymore, since all of this shit happened to me, 6 years ago, I'm totally unable to cry. My therapists never accepted the fight I might be depressed until recently. All that time I felt like I was just a terrible mistake, and, since you hear about depressed people breaking down, and my therapist not telling me anything; I felt like I was just faking it all and I wasn't even sure of all my feelings.\n\nSo I broke down, sobbing one or two tears, the best I could do. I was, and still am, too scared of finishing it off. I was,what, a few pills away from it but I just couldn't.\n\nI don't know if its really \"surviving suicide\" but I felt a need to share it here. What I said happened 3 times in the past years but I never managed to go further.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7lyv/"}
