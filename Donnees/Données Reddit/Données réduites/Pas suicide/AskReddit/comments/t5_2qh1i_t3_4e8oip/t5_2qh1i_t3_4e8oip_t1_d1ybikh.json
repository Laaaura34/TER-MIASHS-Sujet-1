The doctor monitoring my vitals told me that once every five years, someone my age will manage to succeed, and it is one of the worst ways he has ever seen someone die. The parvolex antidote they give you to combat the paracetamol made me vomit over twenty times in the space of four hours, it felt like my insides were crushing themselves together and my throat was filled with the chalky taste of the pills. I was crying in the hospital bed and regretting my decision and begging that the pain would go away.\n\nI understand what you went through - I'm still in that dark chasm too, but things will get better. They have to get better. Once you hit rock bottom things only have to improve. Just please, don't overdose on pain killers again. It does not matter how many other humans there are in this world, you only have one life to live out, find someone you can love and make history for yourself. There are a million stars in the night sky but they all shine brightly despite being surrounded by a million others. You will get through this. I believe in you.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ybikh/"}
