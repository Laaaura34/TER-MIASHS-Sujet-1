Though I think it's important to remember that there is bias in what we are hearing. There will be those who didn't succeed who immediately attempted suicide again who obviously can't tell the story of the gap between attempts here. What's more worrying is there might be those who have the horrible realisation they want to live, when it's too late. \n\nI'm so glad everyone of you who posted here, are still here.
