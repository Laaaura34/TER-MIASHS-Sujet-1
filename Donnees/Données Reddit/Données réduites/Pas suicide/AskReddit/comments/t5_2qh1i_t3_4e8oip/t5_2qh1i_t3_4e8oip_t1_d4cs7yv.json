I am guessing whereever I stabbed didn't cause enough damage to actually kill me or make me faint from blood loss and just die from lack of blood. When I realized I wasn't going to die soon from this I tried to move the knife around more to cause more damage, but the pain was too much for me to bear. I kept crying and shouting \"I can't even do this right\". Eventually one of the neighbors heard my shouting and complained to the apartment  staff. They found me in my bathroom covered in blood still shouting the same thing over and over and called an ambulance. When I finally was able to put some rational thought to it, I cried and was unable to process things really. I thought myself to be the failure who couldn't even leave this world correctly. It has been 2 years since then. Honestly some days are still pretty bad and other are good. The future is world completely unknown and I am just hoping that the good days will start to outweigh the bad ones.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d4cs7yv/"}
