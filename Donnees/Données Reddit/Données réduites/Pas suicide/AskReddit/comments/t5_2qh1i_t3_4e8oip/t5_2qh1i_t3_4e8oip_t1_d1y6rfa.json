Just the way the noose came untied from the beam... it doesn't make since to me sometimes.

Noticing weird patterns in things and strange coincidences... I still live life like it was real though, but I always have this lingering thought of what if. \n\nThis is why I have come to live by the quote \"I think, therefore I am\" \nI think I am alive, so I am... alive i guess.... idk its strange that this has stuck with me.
