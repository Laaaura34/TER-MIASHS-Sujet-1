Has anyone ever checked your thyroid?\" I am so grateful to her! That one little organ causes me so much trouble and the meds for it are mind blowing - 100 micrograms of hormone - an insignificant amount - and I feel human!\n\nI am not surprised that for some a symptom may be depression - it's kind of an ass of an organ.
