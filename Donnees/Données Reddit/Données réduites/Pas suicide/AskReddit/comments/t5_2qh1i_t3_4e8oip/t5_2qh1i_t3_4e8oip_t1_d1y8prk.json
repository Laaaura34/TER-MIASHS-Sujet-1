At the last minute of my consciousness I pictured my father hearing that I was dead and was immediately filled with regret and guilt. I called my best friend who couldn't be bothered to drive 5 minutes to come help me get to the hospital. My ex-girlfriend (was his present girlfriend) rushed to my house and dragged me into her car and sped off to the hospital. I kept trying to fight the feeling of shutting down but I couldn't resist it and lost consciousness before we reached the hospital. I woke up naked and freezing hearing my \"best friend\" and a few other friends asking to see me. They brought me in a blanket. The first words out of my \"Best friends\" moulth was him asking me to apologize to my ex-girlfriend (she was outside crying because she thought it was her fault I attempted to kill myself) it was in that moment that I realized I was alive. I knew I was alive once I realized how fucked up everything still was. I nearly died and was being asked to apologize to someone... I started crying and laughing. I'm still recovering. This happened 6 months ago... I apologize for the formatting.\n\nTLDR: Woke up in hospital to friend asking me to say sorry for committing suicide(I died for about 2 minutes), I immediately started sobbing and laughing uncontrollably.
