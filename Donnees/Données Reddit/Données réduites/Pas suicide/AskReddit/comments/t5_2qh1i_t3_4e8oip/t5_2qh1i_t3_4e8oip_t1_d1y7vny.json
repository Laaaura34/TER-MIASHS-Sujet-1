I hear the rythmic beeping of the machine and it interrupts my ponding. Oh shit, I realize that this isn't my soul floating around in space, I'm actually here.\n\nSo I wake up. \"Fuck. Now I have to do this all over again.\"\n\nI've been to a hospital before and knew I would have to be processed all over again. Waking up was never the problem. Life hasn't been the same since before the attempt, though. It's very different, more flat.\n\nEdit: reading these people's posts and comments, my heart goes out to you all. I might have ad an experience but everyone is unique. I hope you all are okay.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7vny/"}
