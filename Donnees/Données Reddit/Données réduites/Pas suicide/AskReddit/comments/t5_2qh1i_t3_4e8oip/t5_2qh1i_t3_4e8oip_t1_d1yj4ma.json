But to say the glass is already broken is pretentious, its not, you could just say I LOVE THIS GLASS why come out with some crap about it already being broken it's not broken, one day maybe it will be - so say \"i'm enjoying this glass one day it might break but its not broken now so I'm enjoying it\".
