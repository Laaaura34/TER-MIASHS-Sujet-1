I hope the OP sees, and takes the advice to heart. I recently got inked for the first time, and though not intentional, it ended up on the arm I chopped up with a box cutter. The scars always bothered me, and only reminded me of a very low time in my life. The ink I got was during better times, and now anytime I look at it, I don't even see the scars.\n\nFair warning: once you get a tattoo, it's very hard not to think about when you're getting the next one.
