We are built to adapt, we are built to change and get better.  If anyone gets to the stage that they consider suicide, obviously it's tough, but (clich\u00e9 warning) it's a long term solution to a short term problem.\n\n Everyone should also know that no matter what there are people who think they matter, some who loves them. \n\nDepression, particularly at the advanced stage that brings on suicidal thoughts destroys everything inside us, takes our self esteem and makes us think we are worthless and no-one loves us. This is not, nor will it ever be true. People will support you, people will have your back and at the end of the day,no matter what, help is always just a text, call, message or pm away. \n\nAll the love to my brothers and sisters going through tough times right now. There is a light at the end of the tunnel just hold your strength and hold onto yourself. It will get better! \n\nSo much love for everyone out there!", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d20euft/"}
