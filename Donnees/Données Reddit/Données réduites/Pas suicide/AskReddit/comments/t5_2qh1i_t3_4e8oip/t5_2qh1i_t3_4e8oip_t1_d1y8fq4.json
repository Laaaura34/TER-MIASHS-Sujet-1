I didn't feel connected to anyone, I had no one I felt I could talk to, no one that'd understand, always kept on the outside.\n\nBut one day it just clicked for me that it'd be the most selfish thing I could do. That if I did commit suicide then I'd be putting the people I care about and the people that cared about me (whether I knew they did or not) through the same thing or so much worse, and I just couldn't do that.\n\nAnd I may not be happy all the time now by any means, but even when things suck the most, I just think, \"These people here still need me. My friends, my family, even someone I haven't met yet. Me just being here gives me the chance to help whoever I can that might be going through something like this.\"", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8fq4/"}
