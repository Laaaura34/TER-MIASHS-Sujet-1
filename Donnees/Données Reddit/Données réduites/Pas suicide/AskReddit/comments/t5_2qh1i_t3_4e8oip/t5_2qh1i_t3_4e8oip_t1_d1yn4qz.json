It's more informative and written with education and the intent of informing. \n\nI'm sorry if my words made it come off as that type. I picked it because I like reading/hearing about interesting cases in psychology and sociology. I was incredibly surprised at how it impacted me and how much I did learn as I expected just a book of stories and not nearly as much education. \n\nI fully understand and respect your hesitance towards self-help books. They can easily be a dime a dozen and should be taken with a grain of salt. A popular saying in another subreddit I frequent is YMMV or Your Mileage May Vary. \nWhat is good for one person is not always good for another nor will it always be as effective/ineffective. \n\n:) ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yn4qz/"}
