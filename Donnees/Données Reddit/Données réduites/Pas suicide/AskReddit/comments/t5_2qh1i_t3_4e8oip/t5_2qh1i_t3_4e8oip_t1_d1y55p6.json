I never consciously tried to overdose but if I just so happened to and died from it well that would have just been alright. Shit everytime I stuck that needle in my arm I was playing Russian roulette. Like I said I didn't have a death wish but I used to be super depressed and didn't feel I had much to live for. Once I saw the light and knew there was much more to live for I moved on. Now I can deal with daily life and most emotions I face. Basic thing is to know you can't get through anything like this alone. Help is always there don't be afraid to ask. I was for 4 years and I could have very well died. Now I have almost a year clean and life is okay. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y55p6/"}
