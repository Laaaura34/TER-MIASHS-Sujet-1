I love weed but at that state I almost decline just so I could go home and put my plan into action. Instead, I went to my coworkers, we blazed, he helped to try to find me an apartment (I was just kicked out of where I was living at the time, on top of a host of other things ogoin on in my life and how I was looking at myself) and we had some laughs and it helped me re-focus. I went into my car and threw the razor out.\n\nThat, and making sure to finally see a therapist, literally saved my life. When you have a plan and are letting that side of you win the battle, go see help immediately. It is not worth it, and no person that asks for help is \"weak\" or \"wrong.\"\n\nSuper cheesy, but you owe it to all of us to stay here. And without the sour we could never appreciate the sweet.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yqbny/"}
