I can't one-up your situation, but I've been more negative than usual lately. Even though there was truth in your comment, I didn't want to hear it because it challenged me, and I didn't want to feel worse.\n\nLeaving a shitty comment didn't make me feel positive and I'm sorry I left it. I have no ill will toward you. I wouldn't wish job loss on any stranger, and I genuinely hope you figure something out.\n\nEdit: don't let random Internet jerks be the metric of your worth.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yzv1l/"}
