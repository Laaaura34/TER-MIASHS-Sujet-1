It all started when they caught her dad cheating. In all the fighting mess he said he never really loved her and was just waiting for the kids to grow up. I believe this, based on how depressed he always seemed. But on to the part where I need advice. Her mom has tried to commit suicide twice in the past couple weeks, is a complete mess emotionally, and is crazy depressed. My gf has tries to help but just gets frustrated because her mom won't listen to any advice or do anything to better herself, in fact she is actively making her life harder by not going to work and not paying bills. My question is what do you say or do to help someone who has completely given up? It's like the only thing on her mind is how she can get away with killing herself.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6d4d/"}
