I took a mix of psychiatric medication as I had not long been discharged from the psych ward and every other tablet I could find in the girlfriends house. This included prescription strength painkillers, asprin and many more. I think in total the police counted 400+ tablets had been opened from previously closed boxes.\n\nI don't remember even getting to the hospital, or even the emergency services being called but I was in intensive care for 7 days and i had to be resuscitated twice. Eventually when I came too, apparently I said to the doctors, why did you not let me go peacefully. \n\nNevertheless, I was filled with guilt as my parents come in to see me, tubes everywhere machines bleeping, heart monitor all over the place. \n\nSeveral hours later I was taken to a ward for a week long review. Kidneys and liver were heavily hit during the OD but thanks to doctors I guess I'm OK now. No permanent damage, except for some flashbacks. \n\nPart of me wishes I was still successful and I don't regret what I did but I'm now moving on in life with a lot of mental health support. \n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y99cn/"}
