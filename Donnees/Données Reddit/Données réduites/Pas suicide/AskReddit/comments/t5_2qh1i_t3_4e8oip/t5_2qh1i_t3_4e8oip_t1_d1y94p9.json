A boy brought a gun to school and held a class hostage until two other students tackled him and disarmed him.\nWe got to see lots of different rumors fly around afterwards. The two boys were thought of as heroes in the town and another teacher bought them the fanciest class rings of there choice. When it started an assistant slipped out of the class became ambiguous whether she did it to abandon the kids to the shooter or to alert the police. Everyone had their own story of what they were doing at the time. My favorite was my friend's Archery teacher, realizing they couldn't hide in an open field during the lockdown, sent them with there bows and arrows to hide in the hills and bushes.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y94p9/"}
