I went to a public phone ( they had them still) Went to the phone book, pulled the first suicide hotline number- it rang and rang, no answer. I kept calling because I was offended I mean, there should be peopleon the other side right? Turns out, it the number was right, and USED to be the hotline but was currently assigned to some poor immigrant fellow with broken English but enough to understand why I was calling. I began to, and then could not stop laughing for the longest time, and here I am earnestly trying to seek advise/help. I still laugh to this day. I feel really sorry for the guy on the other side can you imagine- oh the torment on Holidays!", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ycphx/"}
