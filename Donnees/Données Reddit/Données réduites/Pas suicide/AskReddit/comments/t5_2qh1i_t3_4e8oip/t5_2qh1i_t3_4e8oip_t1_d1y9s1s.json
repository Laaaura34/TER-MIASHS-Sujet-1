I can't read any more comments but I'm glad that all of you have survived. I suffer from depression and have my entire adult life. I am 62. I have lost almost all of my family members to death and other reasons and I have no friends but that's *my* fault. I live alone with my dog and sometimes life gets lonely. Luckily my doctor put me on an anti-depressant and I feel much better. I hope all of you that haven't reached out for help will do so before it's too late. You are stronger than you think you are and yes, life is fucking hard and it gets to be too much sometimes but when it does you have to reach down deep inside and find a reason to keep hanging on. Once you're dead there is no coming back. Hugs to all of you.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9s1s/"}
