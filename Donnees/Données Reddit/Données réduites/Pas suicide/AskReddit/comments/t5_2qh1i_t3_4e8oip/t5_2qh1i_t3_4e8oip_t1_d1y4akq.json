The round squibbed, meaning it misfired and the round was stuck in the barrel. He assumed because he saw a bit of smoke and heard a quiet pop, that he was dying and was euphoric since he didn't feel anything. Nope, round failed to do anything. He realized what happened and instead of being angry, was relieved and decided he wanted to live rather than his mom come home and find his body in a pool of blood. He cleared the squibbed round, cleaned the gun and called a doctor. \n\nI never told him, but I shoot guns and have since I was a young kid and I have seen or shot hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition and it wasn't until this past August that I saw a round squib. At the point he told me of the attempt, I had yet to see it happen.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y4akq/"}
