Turns out the pole was designed to give when hit, so my car just flipped and spun and landed upright 100 yards or so from the interstate. I was then confronted with loads of Good Samaritans who wanted to help, among them a nurse who knew what she was doing. At first I wouldn't get out, but when she explained that she was going to wait until I did and that the car might explode, I couldn't help but relent. Apart from the self-inflicted ones, I was completely uninjured. This was seven years ago. I've been searching spiritually ever since. This is the most succinctly I've ever managed to tell this story. Gotta get back to work. Also, fuck a throwaway. I did what I did and it's now part of who I am.
