I was so upset that i was told no, by the college i so desperately put everything into (it was a state school, not even a reach or anything) that i thought dying was my only option. (This wasn't a spur of the moment kind of thing, but like a \"last straw\" kind of thing)\nAfter the bleach swished in my mouth for about 10 seconds, i threw up all over my bathroom floor and went downstairs and had dinner with my family. Silent. I guess seeing my little brothers stuffing their face with chicken or whatever was enough to make me thankful that i suck at killing myself.
