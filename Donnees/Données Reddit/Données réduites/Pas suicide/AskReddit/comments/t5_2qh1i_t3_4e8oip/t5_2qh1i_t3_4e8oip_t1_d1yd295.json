At the time I didn't see a point in life and I was just a teenager going through tough times (break-up and depression overall), so I decided why not end it all.\n\n\nIn the end I came up with overdosing because I felt that it would hit me without knowing it. I ended up taking two full bottles of Tylenol PM extra strength expecting to die from liver failure. It was a funny feeling at first, as soon as I took the first bottle I had already begun to regret, and after the second, I was absolutely devastated, like \"what the hell did I just do?!\" As I went to sleep expecting to die, I began to involuntary cry and I absolutely knew I was going to the other side. \n\n\nFortunately enough, I was awoken in the middle of the night with terrible pains, and I hurriedly rushed to the toilet and proceeded to vomit tons and tons of what seemed like reddish solids, and oh boy it hurt like hell. I was hovering over the toilet for almost a good hour, hell I'm beginning to remember the feeling typing this out. I couldn't drink or eat anything without the feeling of vommitting for almost four weeks. \n\n\nAfter all was said and done though, I was glad to be alive and vowed myself to never do anything that stupid again.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yd295/"}
