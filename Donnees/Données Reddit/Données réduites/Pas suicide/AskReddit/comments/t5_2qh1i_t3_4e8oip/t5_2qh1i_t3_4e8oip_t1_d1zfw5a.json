I hope maybe there will be something within this time that gives you reason to stay. And while I don't condone what you are thinking about doing, it is ultimately your decision. When the time comes, I beg you to please take just a little more time to try and come up with a reason to stay around. No life is worthless and no life is meaningless. I don't know you at all and I feel like I know you better than most of my friends. The struggle you have gone through has changed you and you will never be who you were before. I understand your reasoning and I understand where you are coming from. I hope that in these months you will find it in yourself to stick around and see where things go. I'm sure you are tired of waiting but maybe waiting around for a bit longer is an option you could consider. From person to person, I love you. I would take a bullet for you. Thank you for sharing your experience and know that your experiences may just help someone else get over the next hurdle.  You never know who might need someone else's story to get them through the next day. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1zfw5a/"}
