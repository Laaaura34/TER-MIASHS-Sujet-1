I still get anxiety because I haven't done this well for this long, well, ever. Every day is a new step. I was so comfortable in depression that I saw not only no hope for the future, but no hope for the present as well. People like routines and patterns. Unfortunately, with mental illness, it's easy to get into the wrong patterns. For me it was crippling depression and suicidal thoughts mixed with substance abuse. I thought I'd never finish up my undergrad degree, I'd never have a career or family, and I got so comfortable and used to the routine that I almost enjoyed pushing my friends and family away (and I'm still paying for that one).\n\n\nMy best advice would be not to isolate yourself - if you have the opportunity just to be around people, you can be distracted. Even at my worst I could every so often bear to be with friends and family, even for a couple hours every few days. If you can keep up that pattern, you can work it into your routine. Like I've said before, I don't know what it was that clicked in my mind, but in hindsight I realize that this is what helped me, even just a little bit. Hope this helps!
