Suicide attempts of all kinds by the elderly are wildly underreported and underestimated but the insulin route appears to be much more common in that age group. I've seen many situations where an elderly person tries to pass off taking more than their prescribed dose of medications as a memory lapse when they have no history of dementia. They're often too proud to admit it right away that they were trying to end it because of pain and suffering and lack of family and friends who went before them but many times simply talking to them and asking about their lives will lead to them opening up. I'm bothered by the overall state of mental healthcare but it is nearly nonexistent in the elderly. Diabetes is a difficult disease to cope with for everyone regardless of age especially the meticulous care necessary to manage insulin dependent diabetes for many. Add other illnesses both physical and/or mental on top of it and it's not hard to imagine this happening.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yc7f0/"}
