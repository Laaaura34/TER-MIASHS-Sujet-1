He posts all this #gunfail stuff.  Pisses me off.  He's not some guy on the internet, he is a person I *know*.  \n\nOne day I called him out on it.  Asked if he'd make fun of me if I accidentally shot myself or something.  He replied with some bullshit about \"oh, I'm just for gun safety and I am sick of seeing children getting killed.\"  I just let it go for the sake of the friendship, but I really wanted to challenge that.\n\nHe is not for \"gun safety\".  I've never heard him once talk about safe firearm handling or storage.  He wants guns banned/confiscated.  \"Gun safety\" is just a euphemism.\n\nHe is very pro-internet freedom.  The \"won't somebody think of the children\" argument is used all the time to erode internet freedoms.  And there he is, using it to try and erode my 2nd amendment freedoms.\n\nThis guy is an otherwise intelligent fellow.  To someone else, he may just be another \"shithead\" on the internet.  But to me, he's a nice guy.  He simply lacks perspective and education on a certain topic.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yj8ep/"}
