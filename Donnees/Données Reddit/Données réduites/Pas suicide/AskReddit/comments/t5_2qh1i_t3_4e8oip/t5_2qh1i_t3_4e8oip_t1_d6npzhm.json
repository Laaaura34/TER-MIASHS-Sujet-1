I have held it to my head a few times just to see if I could picture myself pulling the trigger. I'm not proud to admit that.  I have been having extreme anxiety for the past six months because my partner of three and a half years left me, and I have been dealing with health issues. Because of the line of work I'm in, I have to be careful of showing any mental health problems. The person whose position I filled actually took their own life several years ago. \n\nI feel myself slipping away, at first it was slow, and now it has amped up. I barely sleep and my thoughts race a lot of the time. For awhile I was on Xanax, but that stuff is addicting and I made myself stop taking it.\n\nI'm having trouble coping with the loss of my relationship, and the loss of my sanity. My body can't take any more stress, as it only makes my health issues worse.\n\nThe gun is under my pillow. I have it loaded with two hollow point bullets. I don't know where I'd actually do it, because I wouldn't want to around my dog and cats. \n\nI've had to make myself almost blank out lately, because if I look at my mom, who is my best friend, it makes this so much harder.\n\nI'm ready to go. I'm tired. I know a lot of people will probably be hurt, but I don't have the energy to live for other people anymore.\nI can't believe I'm typing this, and that this is my story.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d6npzhm/"}
