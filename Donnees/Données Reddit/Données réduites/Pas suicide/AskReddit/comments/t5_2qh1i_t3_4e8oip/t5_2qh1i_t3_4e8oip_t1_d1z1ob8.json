I descended into an existential/nihilistic state in my final year of university. I'd look at everything, the photons emanating from the streetlamp glowing through the leaves on the trees whilst walking home from work, the structures and symbols pasted onto the signage by human hands, the barking dog next door, and feel like everything was completely pointless. Everything will end. This litter and soot ridden rock covered in moss that is tumbling through the void, a great cosmic accident, has no point whatsoever. No meaning. A flash in the pan, a moth on the light bulb.\n\nOne day it hit me. That's the fucking point. It's not about the \"point\" of everything or the meaning, there is no meaning in reality as it's all pure chaos, it is only the journey that matters. Those leaves only existed there and then soon to wither and be lost forever, the sound of the barking dog wont be heard anywhere else in the entire universe, who knows what sounds were made by countless species that romed this rock, now long extinct. Those signs and buildings are as rare as the wings on a butterfly, ideas of man meticulously manipulated and constructed by the hands of man. How amazing, and temporary, and precious all of reality is. There was once nothing at all. Absolutely shite all. Nothing but nothing itself. Then everything blossomed. Like every idea that comes to being inside my mind, it's all magic - something coming from nothing. Like pulling a rabbit out of a hat.
