After spending so much time in and out of psych wards trying to end my life I realized I had things left to do on this planet so Id better figure out how to make my life bearable because it wasn't my time yet. I made a plan to actually leave my abusive situation and poured my energy into that instead. I wasn't meant to die so Id better figure out how to live and make it kickass. I took suicide off the table. That wasn't an option anymore. I haven't looked back since. Life has been shitty and really difficult but im a survivor in every sense of the word. I know whatever life throws at me I'll be okay. People have tried to destroy me, I have tried to destroy me and life has done its damn best but it ain't happening. Im a resilient motherfucker.
