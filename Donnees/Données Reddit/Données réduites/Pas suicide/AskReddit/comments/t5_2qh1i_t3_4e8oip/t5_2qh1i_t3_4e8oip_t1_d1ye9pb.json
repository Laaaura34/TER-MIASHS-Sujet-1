Not because they have an obligation to appear like they care....they truly care. And they care because you are a worthwhile person. Just by sharing your story you've touched a lot a people. Total strangers care about you, not because they have to, but because they can see you're a worthwhile person. A good person. A person just like us who is struggling a bit harder. \n\nI've never attempted suicide. I thought about it a lot during my younger years. I made a few plans, but never acted. Deep down I still knew I wanted to live, that people still cared about me, that things would get better. They did get better. It took a decade to get to where I wanted to be in life, but I got here. You will, too, so don't stop fighting. We all want to see you succeed because we know that you deserve it. :) ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ye9pb/"}
