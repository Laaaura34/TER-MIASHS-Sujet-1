For me I had start looking outside of cities and people. I needed nature to see the beauty in the world, and I still need to look at the stars every now and then to remind myself that I'm dust, standing on bigger dust, in a sea of dust. My problems don't really matter in the grand scheme, so just get one with it.\n\nThe other thing for me was letting go of the idea of happiness. I needed to stop wanting it. Get comfortable being content with what's there and happiness will follow.\n\nAwesome quote from Kalil Gibran\n\n>Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding. \nEven as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain. \n\n>And could you keep your heart in wonder at the daily miracles of your life, your pain would not seem less wondrous than your joy; \nAnd you would accept the seasons of your heart, even as you have always accepted the seasons that pass over your fields. \n\n>And you would watch with serenity through the winters of your grief. \nMuch of your pain is self-chosen. \nIt is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self. \n\n>Therefore trust the physician, and drink his remedy in silence and tranquillity: \nFor his hand, though heavy and hard, is guided by the tender hand of the Unseen, \nAnd the cup he brings, though it burn your lips, has been fashioned of the clay which the \nPotter has moistened with His own sacred tears.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y5axq/"}
