Sometimes just breathing and being alive is enough.. Even if it means you're just holding on in suffering because you don't want to break your grandparents' hearts. You will find you're way.. Some day. You're just too young yet. Once you find you're way you'll be thankful you just held on. You're struggles will make you stronger and you'll be able to truly appreciate what it means to survive when you're on your own. I don't know if depression or wanting to die ever stops but you will find you're meaning.. You just have to go through hell first.
