[MAPS](http://www.maps.org/research) is working with the FDA doing clinical trials with various psychedelics, including MDMA, LSD, Ibogaine, and Ayahuasca, for use with psychotherapy in order to treat a variety of psychological and emotional problems including PTSD, trauma, anxiety, depression, and addiction. These trails have been working extremely well with success rates higher than that of traditional treatments. They plan on legalizing MDMA for prescribed use by 2021 and I would expect the legalization of the others to follow not long after. I recommend taking a look at their site where they have promising research on these substances, as well as others.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y5nvw/"}
