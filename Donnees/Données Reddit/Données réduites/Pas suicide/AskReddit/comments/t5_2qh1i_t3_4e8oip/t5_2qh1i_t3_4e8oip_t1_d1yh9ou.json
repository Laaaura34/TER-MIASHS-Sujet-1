Since I listen to a lot of metal music, and I listen to quite a lot of Mozart and Beethoven. At the age of 12, I was being bullied for my height and weight. It carrie on until I decided to hang myself when my mother caught me getting ready for my death.\n\nAnother time was when I was 14, and I had been beaten up and rejected by a lot of people, even some friends, I tried it in school, and I had to go to a psychologist.\n\nAnd a few months ago, August I remember. I tried suicide again. This time I decided \"I am going to drink bleach and try that.\" I never did it, but I tried cutting one of my ears off then killing myself, by self inflicted knife wound. \n\nBut it never worked. To be honest, I feel as though I am no one. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yh9ou/"}
