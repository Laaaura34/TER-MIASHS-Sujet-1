The police were there, and I was scared that this was now going to become a huge thing and I wouldn't be able to \"finish the job,\" if you will. They took me to the hospital, and I was completely helpless. I couldn't leave. Everything in me just wanted to be done and here I kept having to take tests and talk to person after person, and it was completely up to these nameless people when I would be allowed to walk out of there. I was dead set on saying and doing whatever I had to in order to be discharged and pick a better vehicle to come to completion. \n\nTurns out there's a reason for keeping people against their will.
