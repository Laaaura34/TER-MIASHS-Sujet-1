I did eventually tell my mother. I'm sure she's told my father, but he's never mentioned it to me. I started getting help after that and I'm lucky to say that was my only attempt. I'm sure you've heard it all before by now, but seriously consider your options as far as getting help. It's done a lot of good for me. I'm sorry for your three attempts and I genuinely hope things look up for you if they haven't already, because although you might feel otherwise you don't need a fourth.
