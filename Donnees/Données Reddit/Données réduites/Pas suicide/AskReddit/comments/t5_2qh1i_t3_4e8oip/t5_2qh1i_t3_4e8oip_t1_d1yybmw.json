But those of us who have not made that decision have a psychological block to it, and the amount of people who will go along to get along far outstrips the number of us who must seek honesty and truth.\n\nAnd unfortunately the amount of people who were not raised in a peaceful, respectful, negotiating way far outnumbers the ones who were.\n\nI think the mistake you make is assuming most others had good parents. They were probably abusive in their own ways.\n\nHere's how I replied to a similar comment:\n\n >I understand that, and unfortunately I would chalk that up to the vast majority of parents not raising their children in a healthy, respectful, peaceful, negotiating way.\n\n>For most people the bond between parent and child is an inviolable one, enforced in subtle coercive ways, even though there is also love and tenderness.\n\n>81 percent of Americans believe it is acceptable to hit their children to discipline them. Let that sink in. We got some problems to sort out with parenting. If that were a husband's hitting wives statistic, you understand that our attitudes toward marriage might be tinged with a little Stockholm syndrome.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yybmw/"}
