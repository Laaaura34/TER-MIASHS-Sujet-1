It's never easy, but you're moving forward and I'm proud of you for that!\n\nI'm doing better too. I've been talking to my family about my problems. I also finally got around to seeing a doctor, so I'll be finding out what's wrong with me physically. I feel like I'm actually getting somewhere.\n\nI also got a sewing machine and will be bumped down to part time at work. I know that sounds backwards, but I'm excited to have more time to myself and figure out what I really want to do with my life while still being able to pay rent.\n\nI've been wanting to spend more time talking with people online. I like helping people and making them happy, or at least entertaining people. So I'll try to grow my YouTube channel as well. I'm also talking so someone about making a website similar to Compassion Pit where people can go to talk about their problems anonymously, or listen and give advice.\n\nWe'll see where the following weeks take me. I'm kinda putting a few eggs into all the baskets I've been wanting to for a while. I'm pretty happy for the change, and hope to one day be able to do one thing exclusively besides working at the office.\n\nFeel free to message me anytime you want. Whether you're feeling good or bad, I'll be here to listen.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d2bxcdi/"}
