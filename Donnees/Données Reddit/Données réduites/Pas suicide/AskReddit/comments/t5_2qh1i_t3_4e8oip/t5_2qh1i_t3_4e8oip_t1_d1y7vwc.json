I sat up in bed and fell back immediately and dozed off. Rinse and repeat two more times every couple hours. Once I sobered up I told my mom I didn't feel safe by myself and she took me to a hospital, where I stayed for almost two weeks. My mind is sometimes a crazy irrational place and I'm so glad I got help. Don't take a sane mind for granted or think it's somehow reflective of someone's character, as I can speak from personal experience and tell you it is not.
