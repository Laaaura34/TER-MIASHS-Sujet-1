I told the doctors the entire story, but with the insistence of my family, two versions of the clinical abstract was made: one with no mention of suicide.\n\nI ended up being in the hospital for a month.  The doctors tried to stem the infection, and mostly succeeded.  The dead tissue build-up had to be removed though, and I had to be operated upon.  I lost the use of an arm and a leg for around half a year while the wounds healed.  But all in all, one year later, it seemed as if it never happened--except for the scars.  It was all swept under the rug.  Bad decision in hindsight, as it could have prompted everyone to investigate the mental health issues in the background.\n\nOver the decade following that incident, I slowly realized what was happening, and just a few years ago started doing something about it.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8n7x/"}
