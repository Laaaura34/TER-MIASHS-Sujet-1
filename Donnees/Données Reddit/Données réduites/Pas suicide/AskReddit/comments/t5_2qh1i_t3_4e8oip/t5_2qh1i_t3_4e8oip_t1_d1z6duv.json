You're a wonderful person and just realizing your \"insignificance\" (I don't agree with that term considering you are here for a reason and no I am not religious) in this world shows that you are a good person. You are not entitled nor self-centered. This is becoming a very dark world, but only the selfless keep it filled with light. I hope you find your reason to remain here. You are a good person and you deserve to see life in a positive way. Breathe in. Breathe out. You may feel insignificant, but you may not have even realized when you completely changed someone's day for the better. And that alone, makes your life worth living. You are an amazing person. We're fighting our demons together. Take care my dear friend. <3", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1z6duv/"}
