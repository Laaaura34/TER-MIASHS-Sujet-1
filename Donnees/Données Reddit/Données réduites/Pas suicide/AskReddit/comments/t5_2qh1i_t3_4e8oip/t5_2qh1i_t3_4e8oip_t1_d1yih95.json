Good to get it off my chest.\n\nI tried to hang myself in 8th grade. I was bullied a lot in middle school, couldn't trust my friends, picked on by teachers and students alike. At home my parents were always on my case about very small things, but that stacked with the school shit took its toll. One night after a particularly bad day, I decided to end it. Nothing could be worse than the life I was living. \n\nI took a wire coat hanger and twisted it around my neck, twisted it around a clothing bar in my closet, and dropped my legs out. Immediately I was overwhelmed with fear and regret, and thought about my family, my brothers, everyone who I cared about. I felt selfish and stupid and scared, but my legs stopped working and I couldn't stand up. Slowly my vision started to fade, and I thought I was about to die.\n\nI woke up afterwards on the ground, because the hanger had snapped at some point. As soon as I realized I was alive, I just started bawling. I was so happy that I had failed, so happy that I hadn't died. I just laid there on the ground for a long time, so happy that I was alive.\n\nSo, to answer your question, my first thought was one of relief.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yih95/"}
