It helps with anger outbursts, and I haven't punched a wall in a long time, but I have the overwhelming urge to just quit my stable 9-5 and move to California or something.\n\nI'm at work now, just occupying my mind with that, but part of my mind is always taken up by the depression. Then, no matter how hard I try, I always make mistakes. Of course that makes me feel worse about myself. Not thinking about that now though. I kinda cut up the back of my hand (shallow) with a razor last night. Part of me wants someone to notice. But even if they did, I'm gonna say I got on cat's bad side.\n\nI appreciate the response either way. Reddit is the best support group for me lately, besides my brother. Suicidal thoughts and depression definitely run in my family. Maybe it's time to find a more competent doctor and change up the chemicals. I hate needing pills just to feel normal. I've been smoking a lot lately. That helps for now. Luckily I work in a small office that doesn't test. But I've been losing myself. They were things I'd been wanting to do, but they're slipping away. I don't really care to do anything.\n\nCrap. I should probably get back to work.
