I was in high school and going through what I did not even know at the time was severe depression. I still deal with the crushing emptiness and loneliness that comes and goes, and thoughts of suicide, but life has chugged on and I have learned good ways to get through it through time and wisdom.\n\nI did not feel the pain of the impact, just the percussive 'whack' of hitting rocks like a bag of cement. Landing on my leg took most of the impact and I broke my pelvis in several places, but incredibly did not receive worse injury. I only felt the pain after I had been unconscious for some time, during which I think I may have had a near death experience or something like that. A bright light set in blackness shone on my face and hit my eyes with a warm fluorescence while I think I wondered if I were dead and if this was the afterlife. I don't remember much more.\n\nAfter the fact the worst thing was less the pain of my injuries, but the dramatic comedown from the feelings of euphoria and joy and pain and love and heartbreak that was whirling like a tornado in my mind during the final moments before I leapt, and had increased to a fever pitch as I did so. It was the worst emptiness, sorrow, and hopelessness I have ever experienced, eclipsing even what I gone through that made me want to jump in the first place.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yb7kv/"}
