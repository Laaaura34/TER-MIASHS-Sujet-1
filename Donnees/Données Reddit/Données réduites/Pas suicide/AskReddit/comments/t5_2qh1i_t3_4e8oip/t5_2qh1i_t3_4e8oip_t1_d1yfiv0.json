I was incredibly upset by the fact that it didn't work. After overdosing on a little over a gram of ametriptyline, I was out for 20 hours in the hospital. I woke up and my mom was there asking what I did. I realized that there was no chance of me having another attempt while in my parents and doctors' care. \n\nIt's 3 years later now and a day doesn't go by where I don't want to die. I just can't do it though when my family needs me so much. It's a very hard lifestyle for someone to live only for other people.
