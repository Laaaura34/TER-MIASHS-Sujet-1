I call my cloud Ted.\n\nNow, Ted won't ever go away. He is a part of your life for good now. He adores you to the point where you feel smothered and unable to breathe. He takes away your last bit of energy to feed himself. He leaves you empty and hungry for anything which will fill you up. \nMen, booze, food and sleep just past time but right after he is there ready to pounce.\n\nYou need to feed your soul, find joy. \n\nHe is self centred and takes up all of the conversation going on inside your mind. He is passive aggressive and loves to attack when you are the most happiest. He will get back at you when you ignore him and enjoy life.\n\nHis jealously hounds at you and catches you at anytime day or night. Now, although he is cruel and mean, a part of him is intensely beautiful.\n\nHe will teach you to be empathic and kind. His ability to pay attention to detail will help you to be gentle and careful around your loved ones. \n\nPlease get to know Ted and what triggers him. Please, teach yourself how to co-exist with Ted. Learn to appreciate his beauty. Slow down your life and your thoughts. Accept Ted for who he is in your life. He is a dark cloud with only a bit of power.\n\nYou can take his power away by understanding the root of his anger. Talk to Ted. Acknowledge his presence but do not give him anymore weight. Acknowledge his cloud can not follow you everywhere, it cannot consume all your joy.\n\nDance in the rain. \n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9kj2/"}
