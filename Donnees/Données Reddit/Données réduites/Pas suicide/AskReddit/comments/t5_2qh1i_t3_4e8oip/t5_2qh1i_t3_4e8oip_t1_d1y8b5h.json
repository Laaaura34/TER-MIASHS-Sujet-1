That all the pain and shit I've felt and thought about would be gone. The memories of my parents fighting and me hiding, the times I was bullied, the times I just felt terrible about myself. I thought they'd all be gone. Then when I tried to do it it's weird I just couldn't bring myself to do it, and thinking back on it 8 years later, I really can't come up with a reason why. \n\nI don't remember my first conscious thought.\n\nI sorta blacked the memory out, but a feeling is still there. The feeling that I don't want any other person to feel that way about themselves. That life is that hopeless. So, while it was a battle and still is a battle this very day, I focused my life on a career of entertainment, specifically comedy, because I want to tell stories that make people laugh and also understand mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. I guess what drove me not to do it ultimately is the idea that if I can make people laugh and smile for one moment it's worth going through all shitty parts of my life.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8b5h/"}
