I had just gotten to school after my dad drove me because I missed the bus again. My dad had been pressuring me about getting more college applications in, because he really wanted me to go to a good school. I was sure that I was just going to disappoint him when I wasn't able to get more applications in and didn't get into a good school. I went to the bathroom and locked a stall, sat on the floor and injected about 25 units of regular. I was drawing out another full syringe when my dad sent me a text asking if I was okay. I teared up and realized it wasn't something I could do, even if I really wanted to, and squirted the second syringe's insulin back in the vial. I went to the vending machines and got a couple of sodas and sugary snacks, dragged myself to class and ate my lunch early. The rest of the day was a jittery haze but I made it okay. \n\nIt took another 4 years and a lot more hating myself, but I finally got on the right sort of medication and therapy for ADHD and I'm doing a lot better now.
