I got it into my head that overdosing on levothyroxine was viable, so I took all of the levothyroxine in my apartment (it was something like 10-20 mg). A few hours later, I called poison control, realized I needed to get help, and called 911 from a bus stop.\n\nI probably realized I hadn't succeeded at the hospital, though my memories from that particular moment are somewhat vague (it was 3 or 4 in the morning at this point). I probably thought something along the lines of \"wow, I probably made my life a lot more difficult without actually risking my life very much.\" I may have been wrong there--though I stayed off of Levothyroxine for a while, I had to take a beta blocker for several weeks to deal with the side effects of the levothyroxine overdose. Beta blockers are the worst. \n\nIn retrospect, I can't help thinking that I probably made my thyroid cancer worse with that overdose (I've had 2 surgeries since then). That's probably the thought that sticks with me most about the ordeal, besides feeling harassed by my roommate at the psychiatric ward and the intense feeling of boredom while I was there.
