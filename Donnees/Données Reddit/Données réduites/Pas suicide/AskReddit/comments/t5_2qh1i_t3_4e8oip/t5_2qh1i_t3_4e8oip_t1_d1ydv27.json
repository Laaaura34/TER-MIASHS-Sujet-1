I remembered when me and my ex-girlfriend broke up I was devastated, and I literally cried everyday for three months. But working through it allowed me to learn how to love better, it made me stronger because I know I can bear a lot of sorrow, and it made me appreciate the people around me a lot more.\n\nNot sure if anyone will read this amongst the now 400+ comments, but things will get better...and after that things might get worse again, BUT! after that things will get better. And each time you'll learn new things and see the world more beautiful than before, or you become stronger than before.\n\nSo hang in there.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ydv27/"}
