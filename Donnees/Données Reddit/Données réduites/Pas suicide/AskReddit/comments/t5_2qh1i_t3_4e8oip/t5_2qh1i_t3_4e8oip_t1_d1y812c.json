The few people in my life that I thought may care I was gone were now angry with me and distant.  No one wanted to associate or talk with me.  I was now in physical pain, not just the emotional pain I had been in, and wanted some positive attention but all I received was anger.  I was in the hospital, and even the doctors were upset.  \n\nI hadn't expected that.  I thought I'd either succeed, or at least if I failed receive an outpouring of grief and understanding of the real struggles I faced.  It turned out so completely different than I imagined.  In the end, I hurt the only people who I cared about, and pushed them out of my life.  That was several decades ago, and I've only reconciled with my mother -- I was never able to repair the relationships with anyone else.  \n\nMy second thoughts were how to move forward.  When you plan suicide, you don't spend much if any time thinking about the aftermath if you fail.  Lying in a hospital bed you spend a LOT of time thinking about what comes next.  It took a lot of therapy and life changes to move forward. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y812c/"}
