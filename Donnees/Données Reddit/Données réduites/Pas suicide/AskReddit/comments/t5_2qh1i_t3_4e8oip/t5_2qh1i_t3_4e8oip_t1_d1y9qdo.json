My plan was to hang myself in my uni accommodation using a belt .I set it up and was stood on a chair ready to kick it out from underneath but I didn't . I stood there with this belt tight around my neck as memories flooded my mind , I was stood there for nearly half hour just thinking completely ignoring the belt around my neck , I realised it wasn't what I wanted and I could fix it . As I was undoing the belt I slipped and the chair nearly went over but I somehow managed to get the belt loose enough for me to get my head and collapsed on to the chair safe. I left uni after that , never told my friends or family because they didn't need to know . ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9qdo/"}
