I mean I felt really bad but I had a good laugh at the thought of you giving a 1,000 yard stare at the corner store, going into full sprint and frantically eating metric assloads of junk food a la Crank. Then the encounter with the delivery guy who must have seen a clammy man tossing through the bags and smashing the chow mein with no hesitation.\n\nAgain, I'm glad you're here, but this is definitely one of the more out-there and dare I say humorous ones.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yql0r/"}
