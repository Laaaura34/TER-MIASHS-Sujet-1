I would list things I would miss if I were to kill myself. Like the next Elder Scrolls game, the inevitable remake of the Harry Potter series, the laugh of my unborn child, the taste of buttered Cuban bread, the way my husband makes me feel, even the next meme to come out of imgur. As silly as it sounds, listing things gave me serious FOMO and continually made me feel like things would eventually get better and I'd soon remember those moments as the darkest time in my life. Reducing it to a singular dark blip in an otherwise bright life. Anywho, thank you for your wonderful post arcadebee. Though I am no longer depressed or suicidal, you helped me.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ydei1/"}
