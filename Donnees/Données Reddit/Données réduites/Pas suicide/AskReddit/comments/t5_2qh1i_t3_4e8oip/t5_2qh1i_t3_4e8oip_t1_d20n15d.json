Too bad I was a dumb angsty teenager that couldn't really spell out what was wrong. I feel like it would've saved me a little grief but at this point I am happier with where I am.\n\nIt is very comforting to know people are there for me when I have depressive episodes but there's still a lot of fighting I have to do with myself to open up about it. And forreal, there are a lot of people struggling like we are. My sister has BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) so we often lean on each other when we need it.\n\nAs for people who exacerbate it and make it worse -- like I've noticed a lot of people have less than great parents who have driven them to the same thoughts that I had -- I really wish there was something to make older generations to see that it's a big problem. It feels like a lot of trouble is due to a miscommunication between parent to child in many cases and it blows.
