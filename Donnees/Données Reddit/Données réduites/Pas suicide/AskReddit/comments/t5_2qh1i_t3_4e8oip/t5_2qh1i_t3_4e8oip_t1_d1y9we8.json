Through all my shit, through all my pain and hatred of myself. All my anger at the world, and myself for taking out my anger on those I love the most. Through everything, as much as I want to be dead, as far away from who I am and what I am and my life, is just as much as I want to live. I want to be here for my kids and have them love me like I never loved my mother, and I want to raise beautiful children who love each other and can't live without each other and make people's lives better just for being there. I hate so much who I am because I'm not that mother that I have always aspired to be, who I started out to be before the darkness consumed me. So many times I want to be set free and I look at my scars wanting to reopen them and then my daughters name written just above them catches me and locks me to this existence. Thank God for them, my beautiful children, who deserve better than me. \n\nI'll be calling my dr tomorrow for a new antidepressant scrip. I can't handle this anymore.
