She was a toxic person who did *not* have my best interests at heart.  That was all fine and good, but when she started pulling her shit in regards to my (then) year-old daughter, that was it.  No fucking way was she going to taint this little person I tried so hard to conceive and bring into the world (infertility, then premature birth). I called her on her shit, and she was unable or unwilling to change.  Many in her large family view me as a pariah, but fuck them. Even on her death bed she was a vile hateful person.  My daughter(s) will never know her brand of hatred from a family member at least.   ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yorm2/"}
