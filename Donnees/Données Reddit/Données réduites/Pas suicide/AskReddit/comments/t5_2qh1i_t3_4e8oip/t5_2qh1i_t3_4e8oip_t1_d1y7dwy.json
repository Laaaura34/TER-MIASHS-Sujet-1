Mostly I had to make up a story to explain what happened to the fire fighters, police and emts. After that I was in  shock for a while and I guess my first aware thought about everything was how bad I screwed myself by failing and how badly I wished I hadn't. \n\nGoing through that has left me with permanent pain which I almost killed myself with alcohol because of. \n\nBut going through such a rough time, being rescued by complete strangers and friends alike has made me so appreciative and understanding of myself. I hate that I went through it, I hate that I still slip and struggle, but I am who I am today because of the shit I went through and I truely like who I am today. \n\nIf you feel down, depressed or just sad please talk to someone, anyone, I'm here you can talk to me, there is the crisis help text line and so many resources. You Are Not Alone. It will get better and we are here to help you. \n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7dwy/"}
