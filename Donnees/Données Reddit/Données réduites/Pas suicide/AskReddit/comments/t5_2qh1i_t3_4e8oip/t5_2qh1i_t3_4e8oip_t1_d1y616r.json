Thank you. I am shocked that someone out there is even talking to me. My body hurts. I have taken a serious toll on myself over the last few years...it's hard to eat some days or even have enough energy to shower much...I feel disgusting...I used to love myself so much...A lot of people still love me and I don't know why.    \n\nI have gone to rehab for the drugs and mental diagnosis. Two longer stays and a handful of week or two stays. I am thinking of going to jail (intentionally violating my probation by skipping an appointment or two so that the weight of that responsibility and others is lifted while I get 3 hot meals and a bed and CANT go anywhere so therefore I dont feel like I'm doing nothing.)  I should see a therapist. I really should. I dont have a car or phone or license anymore no job no money no place to live except the few girls that find me insatiable somehow but dont know how badly I hurt inside and the friend here and there who lets me couch surf when I need some alone time.  I am so desperate for something to happen different I will try anything at this point.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y616r/"}
