I remembered (some of) how hard the paramedics had fought to keep me alive. Even my dad was nice to me for the first time ever.\n\nIt made me realize there is a system of people out there to help you out of that situation. \n\nAlso Britbong and bloody grateful to be. I'd probably be dead now without the NHS.\n\n\n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yavzv/"}
