My weight broke through it while I was slipping out of consciousness and sliced my neck up pretty badly. I felt regret immediately when I came to because one I had failed, and two my parents were in shambles about it. That was 3 years ago and I'm still in that mental state, it hasn't gotten any better. Part of which is because I've beaten cancer once, I had a small cancerous tumor in my leg, but I currently have a non-cancerous brain tumor that causes some crazy headaches. There's a lot more to my life story that brought me down this path, I'm hoping university will help me and that my tumor would just not be there anymore.
