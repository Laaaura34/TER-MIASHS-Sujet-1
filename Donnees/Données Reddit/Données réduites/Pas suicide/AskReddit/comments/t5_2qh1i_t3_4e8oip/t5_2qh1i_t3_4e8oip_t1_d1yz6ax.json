That, for whatever reason I thought my life was so shitty that I needed to kill myself over, was in middle school. I'm graduating high school in May and I've already started my freshman year of college. It honestly does get better.\n\nI can't say I'm happy every day that I'm alive. I still struggle with suicidal thoughts from time to time. I'm mentally ill so I guess that's just in the programming. But I can honestly say that life is worth living. You'll experience things, meet people, have a whole life you never imagined for yourself. It'll suck some days. I'm going over the worst break up of my life right now, so it sucks a lot. But you and I both have to keep breathing. I promise it'll get better. The Earth will never throw more at you than you can handle.
