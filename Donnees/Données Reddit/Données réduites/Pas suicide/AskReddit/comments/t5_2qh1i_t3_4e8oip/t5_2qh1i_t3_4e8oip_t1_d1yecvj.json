I just want you to know that there are people out there who care. You've definitely seen and done things in your service that have affected you, and there are a lot of other veterans who have as well. You matter to us, and I hope you can get to a place where you no longer say \"Today I am not doing the best but I want to live\", but instead say \"I'm doing well, and loving life\". Thank you for your service. If you need help, don't be afraid to ask.\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yecvj/"}
