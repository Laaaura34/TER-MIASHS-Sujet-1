I stumbled out of my room to the toilet and hurled all of the pills that I had taken a few hours earlier. My vision was so blurry and I was so bent out of shape, it's a wonder I could move at all, much less down the hall to the bathroom. I felt a hell of a lot better after puking, so I crawled back to my room and passed out. \n\nThe next thing I knew, I could hear that god-damned mockingbird who lived in the tree outside my window. Daylight was shining through the French blinds onto my face as I lay in bed. I had an insane migraine headache and my ears were ringing like I had been to the most epic metal concert of my life. I remember feeling so defeated, like the clich\u00e9 guy who fucks up anything and everything, even his own suicide. At the same time, I felt a bit glad about my lack of success, so I got up and attempted to carry on with my life like normal. Surprise, though, I ended up spending the next week and a half hallucinating, hearing voices, and talking to people in my kitchen who weren't even there. I even thought there was some kind of rodent living inside my couch. I could see him and feel him running around underneath the leather, when in fact, there was absolutely nothing there. The after-effect of the overdose was really fucking weird and creepy. Never tried suicide again after that.
