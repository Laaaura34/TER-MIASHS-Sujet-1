Because his life would have been so much better had this monstrosity in the shape of a female daughter by a woman who turned out to be a whore never entered it. \n\nBut actually, there weren't many thoughts, I was delirious. After the vomiting and the blood, it was all just...so placid. I saw the blood but the instinct of \"this is very wrong\" wouldn't kick in. I was just watching the crimson spirals wondering what my esophagus must look like and that it's odd that my vision is blurring. Ever the perfectionist, plagued with an eating disorder, I always had that panic that I would lose control and fail - and suddenly, that person wasn't strong enough to torture me. I was a child again. It felt like a gentle electric hum was surrounding my hearing, I drifted off into a faraway memory I never thought was there, to where I was a kiddy and safe and sound and loved, no rape, no starving, no failures...and I stayed there. \nThen I jerked myself back, I have no idea how. I know that one moment I was safe and \"not there\" so to speak with that gentle hum that felt like a caress on the mind, the other the world was suddenly real, chaotic, raw. Primal instincts set in, like \"pain pain scared scared not safe get help cold so cold sick smells bad throat aches taste copper\" and then...just so much regret. Just constantly repeating \"I'm sorry, daddy, I'm so sorry.\" ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y76un/"}
