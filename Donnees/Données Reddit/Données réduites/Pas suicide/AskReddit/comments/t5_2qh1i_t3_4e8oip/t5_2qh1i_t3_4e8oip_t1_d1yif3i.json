No matter the good intentions and care of those who want to save. Ppl shouldn't fault themselves for not being able to help them. Moreover, a help program for suicidal ppl should excist so it can allow to the 99% of \"save-able\" ppl (and who think to be unsave-able) to be saved, and the \"unsave-able\" ppl to die piece-fully in a controlled environment.\n\n(Hope not to offend too much ppl. with this)\n(Ppl. thinking to be in this category should not be self-diagnosing however, don't underestimate how strong pills can affect your brain)", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yif3i/"}
