I did so by breaking off a six year relationship I thought would last my whole life, changing majors to study what I enjoy, not what will \"get me a job,\" spending my life's savings to buy a 350z and dump my shitty dying Altima, doing away with religion in my life and completely shedding my skin until I came to a year later and found myself a semester away from graduating and already starting to find work and success in my field (which is film, and I'm working on several films right now including a feature I'm directing), a new love who makes me happier I've never been, I've good a job to hold me over until I can hopefully complete an internship at Turner Broadcasting and look into career options, I have two dogs (was never a dog person) who are literally my chilldren, I have no money but I budget carefully so I can stay on top of my bills, and I suddenly remembered I used to be depressed and couldn't believe I ever was. It was like I became so immersed in my new life that my past was behind me and I no longer thought about the pain. It's a distant memory now. Life's good.
