My parents were pretty good. I always knew my mom loved me and that my dad would fight his way through a mob to save my ass.\n\nWhen my wife cut off ties with her mom I still couldn't understand how she justified it. Logically it made sense but I struggled to accept it.\n\nNow a few years later, I'm still holding back on making suggestions that they try again. Even though they did try again previously and her mom let her down repeatedly, some part of me can't accept what I know is the right course of action.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ylzkr/"}
