A few months later I spiralled back down into depression and things just didn't get better. but I feel like \"It will get better if you can realize that you absolutely have the power to make things better.\" would be a better tattoo because it's more realistic. Things just don't get better on their own. I have a lot of shit in my life right now but I don't have the power in myself to make things better even though I could. It's the main reason I refuse to take anti-depressants, because I know they wouldn't make things better in my life, possibly they would remove my negative bias towards everything but they wouldn't make the shit magically disappear.
