If you lie and say everyone can recover, and especially that \"drugs help\" everyone, you are going to end up making lots of people believe that saying anyone at all can ever recover is a lie, too", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ye1oc/"}
