Sometimes I wonder if he purposely room enough to make himself sick so that he'd get attention , or if he truly wanted to die.  Both seemed plausible. \n\nI think he thought it would force me to come back, but all it did was strengthen my resolve. I am especially thankful that our closest friends saw through his \"attempt \" as a way to manipulate all of us, it really helped me get back on my feet.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ynh1q/"}
