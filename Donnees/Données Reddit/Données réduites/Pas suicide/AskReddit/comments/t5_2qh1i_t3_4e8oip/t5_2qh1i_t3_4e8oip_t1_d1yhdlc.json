In this case it is the IV needle. If you haven't tried it, it takes quite an effort to blow a significant amount of air through a needle.\n\nOn top of that, before you get the air into your veins, you also have to push the fluid that is already in the tube through the needle, which is even harder. Air flows freely, liquid not so much. I'd guess the effort to blow liquid through a needle is 10x more than with air alone.\n\nBut wait, there's more! Your blood pressure works against the flow of liquid into your veins. So while you're pushing the liquid/air in your heart is trying to push blood out through the same needle. Since you made a hole in the tube, the gravity forcing the IV liquid down the tube is no longer helping you.\n\nFrom your post is seems that you are better now. That makes me happy.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yhdlc/"}
