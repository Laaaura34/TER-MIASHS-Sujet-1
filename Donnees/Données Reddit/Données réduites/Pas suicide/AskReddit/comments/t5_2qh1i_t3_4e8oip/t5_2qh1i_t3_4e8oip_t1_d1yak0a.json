I lost everything. I intentionally crashed my car hoping it would kill me. It didn't as any \"normal\" thinking person would have known. My life has been fucking tough. I dream about her nightly. It's not a heartbroken thing. I have learned that life has to continue. But until this day I still believe that 2016 will be the last year I spend alive. I just want something to click so I can change my mind.. Too many 72 hours. Too many feelings. Not to mention the emptiness from losing the love of my life and my lovely little dog. \n\nLife is hard. I'm still trying. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yak0a/"}
