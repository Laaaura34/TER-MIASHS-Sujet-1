Neither of my parents came to see me because my mom had made me live with my grandparents a state over. Basically it felt like no one cared and I went on to swallow pills again a year after.

I'm doing much better now. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6xnw/"}
