I appear to be no more worse for wear. \n\nBut to this day (18 months) I still regret not dying. I've accepted this is who I am and I'm not ashamed of it. Had it for almost 25 years.\n\nI liken life to a party: you go, have a good time with a few bad moments, and at the end you are glad you went. Or, like me, you have a bad time with a few good moments and yet you know you would still rather not have gone. I'm never going to enjoy the party. Let me take my life safely and give my organs to those still enjoying the party.\n\nI like hearing when others have found their good times but for those out there that aren't - you don't have to pretend you are enjoying to the party, just be honest you are there because your parents said so and you are just waiting to tap out.\n\nI hate hearing that I'm wrong about this thought. I'm not.  Some of us can get every dream and goal we wanted yet still not want to be alive. We can do our best to participate and yet we still would rather not be here.
