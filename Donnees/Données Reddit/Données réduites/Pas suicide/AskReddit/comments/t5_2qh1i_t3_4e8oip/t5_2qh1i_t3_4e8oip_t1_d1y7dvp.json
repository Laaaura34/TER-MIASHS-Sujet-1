I'm in a much better spot, with a loving fianc\u00e9e, decent job while going to med school for my dream career. Life couldn't be better.\r\rHaving said that, quite a few years back I cut my throat. I woke up in the hospital with crying parents, wishing I wasn't there. I was in pain, angry I was still alive, and now having to deal with my parents. What's worse was the therapy that followed in the next few weeks. It didn't do a damned thing.\r\rHowever, much later there was a little moment of clarity. Nothing I was actually angry at, or upset about, was permanent. I could literally just leave, or change. And I did. It was hard, having to cut people out of my life. Some I considered friends, and some were family. But it was worth it. I changed my look, I changed as much as I possibly could. A year later I met the woman I'm soon to marry, and im glad I failed.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7dvp/"}
