Tied a cord into a noose, put it over a door and closed it, i hade a pair of wireless headphones on repeating a certain song. I put a chair next to the door with the back faced away from the door. I kind of crouched down on the chair enough for the cord to cut blood flow to my head.\n\nSuddenly the sound faded out into silence, i had passed out. Just as it faded out it began returning, a sharp pain began pulsating from the hip on my left sided, it took a while for me to realise i was lying on the floor, the room was pitch black, i got up and checked a digital clock i had in my room, some 20 minutes has passed since i had checked it just before passing out. Im guesssing that most of those 20 min was spent passed out on the floor. Looking at the cord and door i could see that it most likely had been damaged from the friction caused between cord and edge of the door when my body went into spasms. I was fucked up, kind of highish for quite a while after the incident and mostly confused. In this state i managed to break contact with a person affecting me in a very negative way though.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yn6cz/"}
