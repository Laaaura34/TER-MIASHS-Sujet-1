I'm sure there are some people who don't think of others before they take their lives. But lots of people who are put in a place they want to take themselves out of, permanently, feel either that they are a negative influence on the people that love them, or that nobody wants them there at all. I definitely felt that even though my family, especially my mother, would be devastated by my passing, in the long run their lives would be infinitely easier and of a better quality if I wasn't there taking food off their table and bringing negativity into their lives. It's not just for you, it's for the people around you as well. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8uc4/"}
