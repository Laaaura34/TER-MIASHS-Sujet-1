I've overdosed at least 5 times on heroin, most of them was when I was in my suicidal phase because of how the drugs ruined my life. One time I was saved by a police officer and the rest I was on my own, woke up and puked, head spinning, brain hurt so bad. \n\nMy friend that was with me one of the times said dude you were completely blue, I didn't know what to do and panicked. Well thank god I woke up jackass. I usually shot up with people incase something like this does happen. If you are using heroin, and don't want to stop, at least do it with someone else in case you fall out. Your parents do not need to see you dead in your bedroom gargling on vomit at 3 am.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yd1mw/"}
