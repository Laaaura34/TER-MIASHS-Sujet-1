You want to get help/do the hard work required, and she hasn't taken the high road. You have far more potential due to your willingness to work for it, and I'm really glad the gym and hypnotherapy have helped. I personally saw a couple of psychologists before I found the one I go see now, I saw it as interviewing them for a job and if we didn't click I'd try someone else.\n\nAlso have you considered medication, even temporarily? It's something that when used properly can be a powerful tool for achieving balance and getting past survival mode. I personally take meds so I'm kinda biased but if you've never taken them, they might be worth looking into and if you do take them, you might want to look into a medication switch/dosage switch.\n\nI hope I'm not being to forward or intrusive as that is not my intent. I just want you to know that there can be better days for you ahead and as long as you never stop trying to beat this thing. As long as you fight, no matter how hard it is, there is still that kernel of your true self deep inside that can't be touched or tainted by all of the other stuff. That determination to keep trying even when you feel so shitkicked that you just want to give up is what shows your strength and courage and that is your true self. Don't let anyone, including your own brain, tell you otherwise.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ze5aq/"}
