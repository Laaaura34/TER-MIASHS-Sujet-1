I remember thinking of her and telling myself i have to wake up and stop the bleeding somehow... the place i was at was on a trail behind a park, i started to drag myself towards the park with blood gushing down my arm i don't know how but i manged to tie a tall grass around my upper bicep to slow the bleeding, drank a lot of water at the fountain and washed the blood from my arms so i can make it home without anyone knowing what was going on.\n I never went to the hospital, parents never found out,  they asked about my cut though about a month after on a day when i wore a tank top and that's the first thing they noticed. i still have a scar, i cut myself on my bicep right where the vein is, that no one knows how it got there, except for you guys first time telling anyone about this. Whenever i am in my dark place i try to think of the reason why i stopped myself that day.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ygg2d/"}
