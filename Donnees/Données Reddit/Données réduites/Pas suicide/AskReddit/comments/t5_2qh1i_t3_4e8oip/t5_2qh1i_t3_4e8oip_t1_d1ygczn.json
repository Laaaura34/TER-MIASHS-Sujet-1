I sat on my bed while listening to my parents call me for dinner and waited to die. Absolutely nothing happened after 20 minutes.  I got up and walked to the dining room wondering why I wasn't dead.  I told my therapist later on and he said that Prozac is too safe to overdose on.  I'm so happy I'm alive because I love my life and my family", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ygczn/"}
