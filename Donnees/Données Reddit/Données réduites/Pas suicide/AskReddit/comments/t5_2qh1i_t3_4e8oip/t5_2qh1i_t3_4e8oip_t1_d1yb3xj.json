My marriage had fallen apart and I was also dealing with PTSD from my military service. After passing out here it felt like I was falling and flying at the same time. I woke up in what looked like a demented circus filled with skulls and all kinds of creepy workers. A man in a top hat walked up behind me and facepalmed. \"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING HERE?!\" He shouted at me. Before I could explain he cussed me out. \"Stop trying to get here! It isn't time yet you dumb fuck. You still got a quite a bit to learn. Now go back AND STOP DOING ATUPID SHIT!\" then he slapped me. You know that feeling you get when you get back home from a long trip? That is how I felt waking up at 943 in the morning the next day. I was alone but I knew it wasn't my time. Ever since then no more attempts. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yb3xj/"}
