My therapist said I disassociated. When I realised what was happening, I was sitting on the floor of my room with empty prescription packets infront of me. I tried to pick myself off the floor but couldn't. I had to scream for my parents - I didn't want to die. Yes, I was depressed, yes I thought about it a lot - but I didn't want this. \n\nBut while I regretted it then, I don't regret it now. That moment was my wake up call. I broke up with my abusive ex, hired a personal trainer and got a job. Life is good now. I'm happy again. \n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yb75y/"}
