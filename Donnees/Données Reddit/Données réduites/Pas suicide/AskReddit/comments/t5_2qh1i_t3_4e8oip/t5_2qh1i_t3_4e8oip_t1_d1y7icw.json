My girlfriend and I that have been dating for 4 years, got into a big fight last year. She started giving me less and less respect and more and more attitude until I flipped. I told her that she was treating me like shit and told her that we were done. \n\nYup, Facebook status to single (sounds cheesy but that's how news is official these days). A few days later I get a call from her.  I was going to block her number permanently but for whatever reason I answered. She was in the hospital from attempting suicide with sleeping pils, pain pills, alchol, anything from her family's medicine cabinet. She wanted me to come see her. \n\nI never planned on seeing her again but my hearts true feelings came out and I got to her as soon as I could. I stayed with her the whole time and never left her side. Move forward about a few months and we are back together and everything is good. \n\nShe talks about why she tried to commit suicide. She said I was the most secure and stable thing in her life and without me she didn't want to be here (alive) anymore. I find a letter in the mail from her doctor saying that she has a miscarriage due to the suicide attempt. \n\nTo this day I have the date written on a picture of her in my wallet. The date is written small across my GF stomach. I look at it and just think where my life would be right now with a wife and kids.\n\nI plan on marrying her and to have a child together. I dream of the day I finally get to meet our baby. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7icw/"}
