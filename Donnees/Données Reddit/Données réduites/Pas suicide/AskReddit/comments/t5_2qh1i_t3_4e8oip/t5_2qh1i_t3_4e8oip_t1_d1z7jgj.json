I wasn't aware they could perform MRIs whilst a person was hooked up to an IV, but I guess it makes sense. I'm also curious if they were performing the MRI after your OD? \n\nWhen my dad woke up from emergency surgery and was taken off of life support, he ripped out his PICC line twice...which is essentially an IV going into your heart. I believe it was a combination of the disorientation from being in a medically induced coma and coming out of it, having no clue what was really going on, being in a massive amount of pain, plus the disorientation that comes naturally from waking up from anesthesia, especially being under for a prolonged amount of time.\n\n He did it once or twice more at home (he has a permanent port now in his arm for his daily IVs). Sounds so incredibly painful and uncomfortable to me, from what I've heard from both of your experiences.I hope that you are feeling better now \u263a\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1z7jgj/"}
