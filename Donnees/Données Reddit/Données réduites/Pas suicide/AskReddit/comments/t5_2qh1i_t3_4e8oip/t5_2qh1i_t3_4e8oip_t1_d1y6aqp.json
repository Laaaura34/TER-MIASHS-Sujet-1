I think my first thought (after \"owwwww\") was \"How am I going to explain this hole in the ceiling to my mother?\"\n\nSecond time, it was \"Crap, how am I going to explain these slashes on my wrists to my mother.\"\n\nThird time, it was \"Fuck, I hope these slashes on my wrists heal before I have any job interviews. I don't have any long sleeved shirts that fit me.\"\n\nFourth time, I was in the Navy and ate 4000 mg of dextromethorphan powder with a pocket knife on hand to cut myself if that didn't work.  Never got a chance to use it as I got so messed up from the dextromethorphan that apparently I spent two days in the hospital constantly trying to strip off all my clothes in front of everyone.  After I came to, it was like \"Shit, I'm in the hospital... This is boring.  When can I go home?\"\n\nFifth time, it was \"Crap, my commanding officer saw the slashes on my wrists; I hope I don't get kicked out of the Navy.\"  Note: I got kicked out of the Navy.\n\nSixth time, after consuming all the Nytol, Unisom, and alcohol I had in the house, it was \"Dammit, I woke up.\"\n\nIn other news, I think I might be a Highlander.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6aqp/"}
