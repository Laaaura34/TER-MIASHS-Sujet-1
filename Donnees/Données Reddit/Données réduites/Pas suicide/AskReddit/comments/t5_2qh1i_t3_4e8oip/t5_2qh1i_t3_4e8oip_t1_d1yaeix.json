Anyway, I just want to say that significance is by definition relative, so if you feel insignificant in the \"grand scheme of things\" its probably because you are looking for significance in the wrong places. No one person is significant when compared to the whole of humanity, but really the whole of humanity is not significant when compared to a single person. The scales don't match up, and any comparison you try make would be a false one. Your significance is really about how you relate to yourself and the immediate world around you. While your life may sometimes seem insignificant to the whole world, try to remember that it holds literally all of the significance of *your* world, and a large bit of significance in the lives around you.\n\nI hope this makes some sense for you. I'm sure there is more I could say on the subject, so feel free to talk to me if there is something unclear or you just have something to say.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yaeix/"}
