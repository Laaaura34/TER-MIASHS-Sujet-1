Grateful to be awake from self imposed oblivion. I was still intoxicated when I woke up in the ER, I wanted to leave and go outside but they wouldn't let me. I was drunk and bleeding heavily. The police came to settle things, drew their guns on me and ordered me around. A nurse came to me and touched me, asked me what was wrong and I just broke down. Her warm and caring physical contact felt amazing after waking up to that calamity. I was cuffed and 51/50'd. Woke up 3 days later and took the bus 30 miles home. Went to work the next day to beg for my job back. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y73n2/"}
