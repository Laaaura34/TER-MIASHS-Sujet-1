I got into super bad longboard accidents, got hit by a car, got physically harmed in some way, but the next thought was always *I can do better*. \n\nFor some reason I never think about killing myself any more - it's always about getting myself killed. \n\nA year ago? I thought about killing myself all the time. Daily, multiple times. I had several plans for how I'd do it, but I was too scared of pain to go through. \n\nI don't know why I'm different now - I've never seen a therapist or gotten pills, I guess it's just like the end is in sight.
