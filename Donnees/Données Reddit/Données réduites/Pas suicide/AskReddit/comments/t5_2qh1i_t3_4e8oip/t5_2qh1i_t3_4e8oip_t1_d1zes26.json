Did research on doing the exit bag method. But lately it has been a challenge to not just go for it and take my entire bottle of Xerelto (blood thinner). I also thought about jumping out in front of a car or cutting myself because I know my blood is so thin I'd easily bleed out. Or if I wanted to make it look natural I could just start throwing out my daily blood thinner suddenly and let a blood clot do it. I got a DVT in my right calf about a year ago and it broke loose and lodged in my lungs. The doctor in the ICU told me \"the only time we see pulmonary embolism this bad is in an autopsy.\" I remember being like...fuck, it should've taken me.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1zes26/"}
