I have a friend that has acted similarly to you in that she has always been concerned about me and checks on me a lot.  Thanks for making me realize how much my friends care and how hard it can be in them.  Lately I've been having trouble and my meds don't seem to be helping as much anymore, so you just convinced me to set up a new appointment to discuss this with my doctor.
