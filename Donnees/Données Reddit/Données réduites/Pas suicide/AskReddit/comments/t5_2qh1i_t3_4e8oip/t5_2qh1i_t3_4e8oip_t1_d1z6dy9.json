I blacked out. I'm not sure for how long. My brother somehow heard what I was doing. He was on the second floor and I was literally hanging in the basement. I didn't really have a first conscious thought until my brother cut me down and hugged me.  I felt an overwhelming sense of shock and relief when the cable was cut. I remember being horrified from being so close to death. My memory about it is hazy. But I remember screaming for air when I was freed, and the scared, urgent look on my brother's face. I still have mixed feelings about him saving me.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1z6dy9/"}
