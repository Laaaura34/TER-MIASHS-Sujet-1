Though for what it's worth-- I'd advise you to work within the networks that already exist before you make a new one. Plenty of places like /r/offmychest and suicidewatch feature people pouring their hearts out and very few replies. The very nature of those places draws people who want help moreso than those who can give it. They can be a great resource if you're looking to help folks. :)", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d2c27hh/"}
