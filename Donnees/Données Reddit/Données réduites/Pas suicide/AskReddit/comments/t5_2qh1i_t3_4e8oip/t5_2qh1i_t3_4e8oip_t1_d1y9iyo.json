I don't know what really happened. I swear I saw an angel floating in front of me, and that's why the gun misfired. My first conscious thought was I needed help.\n\nThe chaos of war while I was in Iraq, the ungodly vivid memories of the smell of rot and the way the skin of the water logged bodies slopped off in my hand while I was deployed to New Orleans for Katrina; and every life threatening mission I was on was going to kill me if I didn't get help. \n\nIf you are facing the temptation of suicide I beg you to reach out to someone. If you are a veteran there are amazing resources for you. There is:\nhttps://www.veteranscrisisline.net/ or 18002738255 then press 1\nHttp://www.woundedwarriorproject.org or Call the Resource Center at 888.WWP.ALUM (997.2586)\n\nAlso I help veterans around me with claims and letters to congressional leaders to get claims moving. Whatever I can do to help don't hesitate to message me. Over 22 veterans a day are lost to suicide. Don't be one of them. I got your six. \n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9iyo/"}
