It wasn't my wife but a long term girlfriend.  I laugh about it now but you're comment reminds me how bad it hurt.  For at least two years, not a day went by that I didn't wish I was back with her and I knew that she probably didn't think about me, at all.  Years later and a clearer vision, I know that it would have been hell for us to be together.  I wasn't a good boyfriend and she wasn't a good girlfriend.  Neither of us would have been able to put the past behind us.  The only thing that helped was to get a new girlfriend.  It's funny because even after 2 years, I felt guilty loving another woman.  Nothing I, or anyone, can say will help you get past what you're feeling.  I wanted to jump off a building but 20 years later I have a pretty good life and I get sad thinking how close I was to that.  I like to feel that I add to this world.  I have a good job, pay taxes, and donate time and money to charities.  My wife has had bouts of depression and she keeps a saying she got from a fortune cookie taped to her phone she claims helps her.  \"It can't rain forever.\"  The fact that you care enough to post mean you want to feel better.  I hope you make the decisions that help you do that.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yebc0/"}
