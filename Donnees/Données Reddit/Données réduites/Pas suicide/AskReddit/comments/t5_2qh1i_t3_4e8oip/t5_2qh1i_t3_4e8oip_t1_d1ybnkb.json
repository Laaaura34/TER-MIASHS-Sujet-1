My best friend and I were victims of physical, emotional and verbal bullying and it ended up with both of us self harming and I took about 15 Panadol pills (the only medicine we had left from all the times I faked sick to avoid school). It didn't do much except knock me out  (my first thought after I woke up was 'why am I still here') and leave me dizzy for the next 48 hours. My self harm continued and I tried drowning myself multiple times after because I didn't want to do the pills again and I didn't have a convenient place to hang myself or jump off of. I'm 16 now and I'm 6 months clean after I realised how useless self harm is, and also as someone who is into Marilyn Manson and avenged sevenfold and stuff like that I got called Emo a lot and people would mimick cutting and stuff and it motivated me to stop. \n\nI'm still suicidal and I still hate who I am but no one knows.
