She stayed in a rehab center for like 5 days but I think that made it worse. They had no 1 on 1 with her, it was just group meetings. The rest of the time she was lock in a small room with nothing to do. I want to grab her and just say \"fucking stop. We all have problems we have to face\" but I know that won't help. I've dealt with suicidal friends before and I successfully helped them but this is over my head. I've never seen someone who is so intent on dieing that even though of hurting your kids won't stop them.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8xz2/"}
