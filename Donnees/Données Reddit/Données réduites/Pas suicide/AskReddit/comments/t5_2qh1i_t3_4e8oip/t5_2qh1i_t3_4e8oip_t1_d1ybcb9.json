It really only takes one fleeting moment of weakness and you're right back in it. My girlfriend relapsed last year. We got her into rehab in November. A week after she got home she was dead from an overdose. So if you do decide to use (and I'm not going to judge you if you do, sometimes it seems preferable to living sober and we've all done it.. I lost count of my relapses a long time ago) please make sure you're safe about it. Your tolerance will be low and you never know how strong the bags are. If you live somewhere that you can get narcan then do it and keep it with you, in your car or bag or whatever, not even necessarily for yourself but because you never know when you'll be in a position to save someone's life. Good luck. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ybcb9/"}
