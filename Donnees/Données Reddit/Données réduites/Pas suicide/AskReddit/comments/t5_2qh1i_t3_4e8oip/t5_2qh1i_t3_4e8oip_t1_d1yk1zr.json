I have been shirking my hobbies to fall asleep to 'Off The Air' on YouTube when I get home from work every day. I spent a good portion of this weekend playing video games, which has always helped me. But it's still just an escape. My favorite aunt and cousin came back from across the country and went to Busch Gardens yesterday. I didn't go. I just didn't want to. I'm trying not to regret it, then my cousin just texted me saying she finally ride the roller coasters for the first time. I've been trying to get her to ride them for so many years. I missed it. Because I wanted to pay my video games and be alone.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yk1zr/"}
