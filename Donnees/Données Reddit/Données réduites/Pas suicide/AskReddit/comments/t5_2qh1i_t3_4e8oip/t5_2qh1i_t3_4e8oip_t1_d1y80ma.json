I grabbed all the pills I could find and downed them. It got really hazing and I just remember passing out in my bed. Next thing I know my little sister was trying to FaceTime me cause no one could get ahold of me. I took her call and just lied to her saying I wasn't feeling well and had just been sleeping.  She just said  \"Brother I love you\" before we hung up. \nI never felt like more crap because I realized at that moment I would have left my baby sister with no answers and only questions as to why I would do that. I felt ashamed because I know how much she loves me and it would have been a dick move to do that to her. \nI still \"pray\" that I may just go quietly into the night and that way at least a natural death wouldn't have any guilt associated with it. I love my family but my little sister and I are close and just knowing I would hurt her just tears me up inside. \nI still have horrible thoughts and just try to push through them but sometimes it just becomes so taxing that I wish I wouldn't wake up.
