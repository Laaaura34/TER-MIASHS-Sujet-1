Almost died, I was actually pretty close. At one point before I blacked out, the nurses were trying to force me to drink liquid charcoal to absorb the pills I took, because some of them shut down my gag reflex. Not sure if my stomach was pumped. Never asked.\n\nI woke up feeling aimless and hopeless. I had no idea what direction to go in after that. I had to stay in an in-patient mental health unit for a couple of weeks. I was borderline catatonic. I didn't really eat, sleep, move, talk. Everything just felt fucking pointless. I was sad that my one (supposedly) guarenteed out had failed. I didn't know how to pick up the pieces of my life that I had fucked up, and I  was terrified of facing the people I hurt emotionally. I remember my parents were really pissed off at first. They lectured me, but then they softened up and realized the level of desperation I felt. I was around 15, if I remember correctly. That was one of my five hospital visits that resulted in admission to the unit.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1z2nuc/"}
