It's part of volunteering, and it's something people make peace with during their time there - which isn't to say we don't care what happens, or that there aren't people we sometimes wonder about long after the conversation is over, but everyone understands that it's your decision to make and that ultimately we're not responsible for whatever you choose to do. Personally I always told myself that fewer people actually go through with trying to kill themselves than tell us they're thinking about it, and only a fairly small percentage of those that do try are successful, so the person is probably ok. Or, you know, alive. Don't think I ever asked anyone else while I was there but they probably have similar thoughts.\n\nIf you're still thinking about it then you could always send a short note to say thanks - even if you're not sure branch you spoke with, it's seen as the organisation as a whole that helped you rather than the specific person who took your call, so it'll still be appreciated. Of course no-one does it for the thanks, but it is quite tough work sometimes and it means a lot to know that it's really mattered to someone.\n\nAnd you never know, they might even have checked the local news and found out no-one jumped off the bridge that day. People do that too sometimes :)", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yez9e/"}
