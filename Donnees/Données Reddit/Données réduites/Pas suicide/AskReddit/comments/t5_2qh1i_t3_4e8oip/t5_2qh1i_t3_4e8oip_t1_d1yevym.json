That's his opinion and no matter how much you cuss and swear, he's entitled to it. He definitely didn't have your special self in mind when he made that comment.  \nWe've all got problems, it sounds like you haven't had the easiest run, but look what you just did in your comment. You devalued my experience saying fuck me, and that I have no right to comment. I never condescended to you, just said plainly that you were being rude and unfair to the guy based off your own experience.  \n  \nThere hasn't been a day in my life I haven't taken medication, been in pain, and some days it seems like I think about killing myself every day too in some way.  \nSo kindly get the fuck off your high horse, and try and have a little consideration that YOU AREN'T THE ONLY ONE.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yevym/"}
