It just passes it on to someone else.\" \nthis is so very, very true.\n\nMy uncle killed himself when I was 5. My grandparents, I am told, who were once jolly outgoing people became the grandparents I knew - alcoholics, workaholics, and my grandfather had a temper. (That being said, they were loving and amazing and badass). My mother shortly after was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder.\n\nMy grandmother passed away February 2015. Six months later, in June 2015, my mother committed suicide. \n\nI cannot imagine what my grandmother and grandfather (as parents) and mom (as a sister) faced, having to deal with my uncle's death. But, now my brother and I are left to deal with the pain that keeps getting passed on and on and on . . .
