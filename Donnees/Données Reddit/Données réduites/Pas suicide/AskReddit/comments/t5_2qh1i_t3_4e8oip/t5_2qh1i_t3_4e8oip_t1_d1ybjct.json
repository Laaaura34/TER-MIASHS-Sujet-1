Things may look bleak and like you have no control, but fixing things is frequently a lot easier than we sometimes imagine. I'm assuming you're young, so you have literally decades to make your life whatever you want of it.\n\nAt 16 I stayed in bed for a year, too depressed to even leave the house or go to school and just wanted to end it. I felt no control. By 18, I was happy, living on my own and life was a lot brighter.\n\nThere's a lot more of life you can see, and I wouldn't judge your experience based on only what your 17 year old self has experienced. It really can get better. Even if shit is fucked right now.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ybjct/"}
