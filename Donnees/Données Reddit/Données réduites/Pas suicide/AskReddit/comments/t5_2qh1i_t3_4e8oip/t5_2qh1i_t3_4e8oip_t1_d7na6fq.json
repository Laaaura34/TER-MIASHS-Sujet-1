I'm someone who is really intrigued by the human mind, and while I've never had to battle like many have with depression, I've always searched out to learn more about it, for that reason.  I like to believe that I am a compassionate soul (I am :).....so when I read a story like yours, I try to put myself there, and somehow feel what you feel.  \n\nYou've touched many people with your story, from many walks of life.  And in a GOOD way.  Take solace from that, let it warm your heart.\n\nMy best to you, dear.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d7na6fq/"}
