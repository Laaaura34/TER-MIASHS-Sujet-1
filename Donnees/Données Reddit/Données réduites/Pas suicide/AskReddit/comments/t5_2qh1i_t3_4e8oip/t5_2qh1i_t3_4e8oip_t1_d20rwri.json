I wasn't thinking or feeling too much at all.  I had a long bit of paracord from something, so I made a simple hitch(or whatever the fuck it's called, tightens when you pull on it), and put it around my neck.   I tied one end against my doorknob, and tried to relax against it.  I got to the point of feeling kinda faint, but that is all it ever was.  I gave up after a while, put the cord away, and went to put a cold rag on my eyes to keep it from looking like I had been crying.\n\nI'm much better know.  I've recently started seeing a counselor at school, though I haven't told her any of this.  I've thought of killing myself for years, and I've hurt myself for a while longer.  I've overcome these with the help of a dear friend of mine, and I really don't think I'd be here today if not for him.  It means a lot to me that he cares about me at all.\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d20rwri/"}
