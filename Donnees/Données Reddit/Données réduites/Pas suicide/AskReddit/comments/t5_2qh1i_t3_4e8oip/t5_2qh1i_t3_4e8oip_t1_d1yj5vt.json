It was all going to finally be over (severe emotional abuse and manipulation as well as being the scapegoat of the family) I made sure there was a round in the chamber and then pulled back the hammer and....I stopped.. I didn't want to stop, I wanted to end my life. But I did stop and now I'm here still. I still deal with depression and I still want to kill myself but I just keep going.. I play three instruments (drums,guitar and piano. All self taught) and I give piano lessons. Some days are harder than others but I guess my will to live beats a bullet to the head.\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yj5vt/"}
