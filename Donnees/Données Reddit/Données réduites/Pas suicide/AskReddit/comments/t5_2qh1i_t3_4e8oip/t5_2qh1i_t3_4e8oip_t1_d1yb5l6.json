I'd think they were so mature, that they thought different to me, that they were 'adult' in the head.\n\nI've since discovered that's a lie. Ya know how you go out and 'pretend' to adult? That's pretty much what we're all doing. I'm 30. I've spoken in depth to of every age bracket, everyone is the same.\n\nMy grandfather says that's shitty thing about getting old (he's 86), he still thinks the same and has the same mind as he did back at 16. So he's just a young mind, trapped in an old body.\n\nSo don't worry about 'feeling' grown up, you never will. I hope you never do! I just signed up for a 30 year mortgage and I'm talking to a girl about kids.\n\nMeanwhile, I just watched videos of trains (because I've loved them since I was a toddler), I'm about to play xbox, I just made like..lol..the lamest meal in the world hahaha. I still laugh at stupidly stupid shit. Because I am totally still my same young self..from really..I'd say..like...since I was aware? I feel no different?\" So maybe like...10 years old? It's still the same manager in charge of this body, he's just literally experienced more now. So with that having been through stuff, he references that before making a decision.\n\nin my head:\n\"We should buy that expensive car!\"\n\"Dude, we did that when we were 18 and we were super poor after\"\n\"ok, we wont buy that expensive car\"\n\nwhat other people say:\n\"You're so responsible with your money\"\n\"Thanks\"\n\nLol. I might go wank to porn now, then maybe do some coloring in.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yb5l6/"}
