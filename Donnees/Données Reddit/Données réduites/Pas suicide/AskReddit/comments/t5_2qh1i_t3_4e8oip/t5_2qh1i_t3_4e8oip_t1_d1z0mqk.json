You have to take a look at the different settings though, i am a paramedic and she is a nurse. If a nurse gives you an IV it's normally in a relaxed and safe environment... if a paramedic gives you an IV shit is mostly on fire though. I've got patients from car crashes and heart attacks... stuff like this, i really can't take the time to explain something like this to a  patient who iss having a heart attack cause I am absolutely occupied with asking them the necessary question, putting the IV in, making an EKG and stuff like this.\n\nIf i have time to explain this correctly i am more than willing to do it, sometimes it just isn't possible. I hope you get where i am coming from.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1z0mqk/"}
