My first suicide attempt was in 5th grade. The last one was 7 or so years ago when I took a handful of antidepressants trying to OD. I've since met my wife, had children, and found reasons for living far beyond any misery that I felt, whether it was real or imagined. My advise to those suffering is to understand people in your life care about you and you need to find what makes you happy and stick with it.
