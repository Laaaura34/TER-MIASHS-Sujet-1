I'm an overweight woman and have been trying my entire life to lose weight to stop the bullying and beatings at school. Now in my adult life, I do cardio, tai-chi, and run at least a mile a day. No change. Have had this routine for the past seven months. ONE pound lost. Yes this is true and yes I see doctors about this.\n   \nDuring child hood, once I learned that it's totally okay for me to be bullied, I figured it's totally fine for me to be on the bullies' side. What's the harm? Just following the majority, like we are taught to do. \n\nStarted attempting suicide when I was nine, around one of the many times my father was raping me, and sorta tried now and again ever since. Only things that made me stop were when my PTSD triggered flashbacks happened and I froze up.\n\nMy last attempt was April 2nd, 2016. I failed. Again. \n\nMy thought was: \"If there's a god... why doesn't he let me out of here?\"", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ygb3v/"}
