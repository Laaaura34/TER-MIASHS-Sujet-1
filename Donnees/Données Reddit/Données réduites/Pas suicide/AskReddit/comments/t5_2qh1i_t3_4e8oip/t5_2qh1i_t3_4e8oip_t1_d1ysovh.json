After a while, I realised that what I had tried wasn't going to work and I didn't have the energy left to do something that would work. So I called the ambulance. I think that I first thought something like \"Oh man, that happened. I guess I gotta figure out where to go from here\". I wasn't grateful that I didn't die, but I also accepted and was ok that I would continue to live.\n\nThat was almost 4 years ago, I've been sober since then, and my life has been super awesome and beautiful. I'm grateful I didn't die, and for people struggling, my message to you is this:\n\nWhatever is happening, there is a way to turn it around. You may feel like shit now, but can create a beautiful life and give something precious back to the world if you try hard enough.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ysovh/"}
