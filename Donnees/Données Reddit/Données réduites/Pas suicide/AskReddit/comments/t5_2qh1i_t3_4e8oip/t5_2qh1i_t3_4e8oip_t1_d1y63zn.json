Not to put down people who do have scars though, its likely tougher to live with than I've put into words, so I don't mean to be insensitive here.\n\nAdditionally the whole 'scars are beautiful' idea is horrendous, there's no beauty in hurting oneself, thats as ugly as things get and should not be glorified, marketed, trending etc.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y63zn/"}
