I've only gone 4 months without a dog in my adulthood and I was very ill during that time. With my last dog I was sure I would do it when she was gone. But I got a puppy a while later and here I still am. \n\nAnd she self trained herself to assist me physically (I'm disabled) and through various mental issues too - PTSD, anxiety, panic disorder etc. She's the best thing that has ever happened in my life. She's the only person in the world who knows how depressed I really am and the only person in the world who is able to get me through it. She brings me out of blackouts, warns me of low blood pressure, helps me up when I fall, gets me through panic attacks... all things she taught herself. She's the most incredible being I have ever known. \n\nThat line of yours I quoted though. Spent a while crying all over my dog when I read that. It's been my only reason for holding on for a long, long time. And now? Life is finally getting better. And I have only my dogs and myself to thank for that. I'm finally happy sometimes. More and more often. And it's good. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d23u4sz/"}
