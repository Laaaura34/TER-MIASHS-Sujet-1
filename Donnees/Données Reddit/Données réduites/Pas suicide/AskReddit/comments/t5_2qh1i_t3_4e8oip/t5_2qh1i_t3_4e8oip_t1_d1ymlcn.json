It helped a bit, but still wasn't a fan of it. It prevented me from attempting suicide, only because I became too lazy to do it. Was still depressed, and now had no energy due to the medicine and I wanted to sleep all the time. But it also helped with anxiety.\n\nThen I took bupropion with it. It gave me energy, but a bit of anxiety too. But the Zoloft helped with that part. But since I was taking both of them at the same time, I got pretty bad insomnia. I would feel tired, but I just could not fall asleep.\n\nI eventually just went off both of them, and have been feeling a lot better.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ymlcn/"}
