I've tried and failed. Recently saw a postsecret that said, \"Suicide doesn't end the pain. It just passes it on to someone else.\" \n\nAll I could think of were my parents. I love them more and more every day. As strange as it may sound, I also thought about my dog shortly after, before even thinking of my brothers or anyone else. Knowing that she wouldn't understand why I never came home again makes me cry just thinking about it. Unconditional love is a hell of a thing. I still have my moments where the thought crosses my mind, but things have gotten more or less better and I'm happy that I'm here.\n\nThanks for sharing your story. I'm glad we've made it.\n\nEdit: oh my goodness, thank you kind redditor for my very first gold!\n\nThis is the first comment I've ever made that's gotten more than a few upvotes. I'm both humbled by and deeply thankful for this surreal kind of solidarity.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y89do/"}
