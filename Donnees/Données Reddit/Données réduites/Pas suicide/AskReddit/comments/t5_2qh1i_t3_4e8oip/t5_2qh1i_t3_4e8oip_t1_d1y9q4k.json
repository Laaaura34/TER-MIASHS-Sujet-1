I don't really remember what was going through my head because I was around the age of 12 at the time.\n\nSecond attempt I think I was 17 and I tried to od on my antidepressants (Lexapro) .  I didn't know at the time they wouldn't kill me. After my parents found me sickly and took me to get my stomach pumped, I really wished It would have worked.  But then I had to see all these people sad.  And to see my best friend cry because of my actions has helped keep me afloat.\n\nIve kind of been stuck between those two feelings for the past 5 or so years.  Sometimes wish I would have succeeded, yet I don't want to make the people close to me sad. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9q4k/"}
