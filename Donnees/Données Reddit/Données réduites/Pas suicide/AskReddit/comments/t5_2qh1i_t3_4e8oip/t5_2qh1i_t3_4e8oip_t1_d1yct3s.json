The plan was to wrap myself in one layer and then wrap a second one within it, in a shower, in the dark. Just remove a sensation at a time, let the shower keep the bag temperature comfortable, as I run out of air. Ultimately I didn't do it and checked myself into a facility. I felt so weak. It was an incredibly dumb way to do it with plenty of points of failure. It was melodramatic.\n\nI still feel like I failed, even with all the progress I made in life. All the cliches and pills thrown my way never changed that. \n\nAnd the facility was terrible. They basically isolate you from the real world with nothing to do. There's no stimulation at all. The intake nurse is a fucking bouncer, and the only reading material these fuckers had was a bible. Hardly a comforting scenario. I felt even more trapped.
