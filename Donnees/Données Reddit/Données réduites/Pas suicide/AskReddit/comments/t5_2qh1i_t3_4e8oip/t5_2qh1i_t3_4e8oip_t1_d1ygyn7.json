That's how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day.\"\n\nThis was the spring of 2012, I had broken up with my girlfriend and few weeks earlier, my grades were slipping, I was living with two other people who I didn't relate with, and I just felt alone.\n\nI had been out to the bars, and even being around so many people, I felt even more lonely.  As I pulled my car into the garage, I closed the garage door without turning the car off.  I just sat there with the car running.  My first thought was, we'll I'm here, and if I do nothing then it will all be over.  Then it set in what I was actually doing.\n\nAnd I laughed, I laughed harder than I had in months, I realized how stupid and foolish I was being.  How weak and stupid I was.  I  laughed and cursed at myself for doing the one thing I told myself was unforgivable.  At that point 4 of my friends had killed themselves, and I would never do it to my friends and family.\n\nI shut my car off, went inside and went to bed.  The next day, I moved out of the apartment, I applied and was accepted to study abroad, and even though it took some time, I'm graduating this spring and moving forward to my life.\n\nGoing back to my the quote, I had two paths before me, I had my one bad day, and instead of giving into the insanity, I came out just a bit more sane.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ygyn7/"}
