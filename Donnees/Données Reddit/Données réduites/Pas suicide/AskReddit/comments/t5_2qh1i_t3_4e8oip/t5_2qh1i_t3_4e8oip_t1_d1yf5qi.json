NHS isn't just an infinite pool of healthcare for everyone. Every amount that gets spent on someone is an amount that that could be being spent on someone else. Sometimes you have to draw the line.\n\nAlso, you are missing the main point. It is impossible to know when the patient is fully cured. If they say \"I'm fine now. Totally want to live.\" Then is that the point you will let them go? Fine. But as pointed out in the story above, precisely that was done, and the patient still tried to commit suicide.\n\nAnd if I happened to be American, what exactly is your point? I know they don't get the luxury that we do of having healthcare, so unfortunately they do have to make the decision when to pull the plug. It doesn't make them heartless if they literally can not afford the treatment.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yf5qi/"}
