I still regularly have thoughts of wishing I could just give up, but it doesn't take over anymore. My partner and my family and the things I do in my life now (found a few creative outlets) make me happy enough to be able to ignore it. \n\nI always think of it being similar to an addict who's gone through AA. They'll consider themselves to always be \"an addict\", even if they've haven't had a drink in 40 years. I feel similarly about depression. It's always somewhere in there but with growth you can find enough happiness to not let it take over you anymore. And at least with age it's easier to get out of it when I slip. \n\nHope you're doing well, too.
