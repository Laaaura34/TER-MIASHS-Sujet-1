The first time I tried to commit suicide I was 14,and was found in a park. My first thought / feeling...  Embarrassed. Which quickly turned to anger, and sadness, as the nurse told me my family was notified but refused to come see me because I was just looking for attention. I had failed tests, failed relationships, but nothing felt as crushing as knowing you failed at dying. I live in a small town, so I also knew everyone else would know. And somehow it made me feel like the biggest piece of shit. I would describe it as crushing, overwhelming pressure. \n\nMy second time I was 17, I had drank a ton of booze, and then proceeded to swallow every pill, medication I could find in the bathroom. My neighbour found me on the floor as my parents and brother were away in Germany. When coherent enough to understand what was going on I sort of felt like, this is the second time, maybe I'm not supposed to die. Because people keep intervening. So I asked the nurse if I could stay for a bit, get myself some help. Still felt embarrassed, still felt like a bag of shit. \n\nI'm 27, actually tomorrow's my birthday, so 28. No more attempts, but definitely a lot of suicidal ideation. I have good days and bad days. But I got tired of letting depression run my life, and the guilt, anger and embarrassment I still carry with me everyday of having two failed suicides... Or as I like to call it now, successful living. As well as every person I grew up with, went to school with, entire family. Everyone knows. Some deal with it better than others.
