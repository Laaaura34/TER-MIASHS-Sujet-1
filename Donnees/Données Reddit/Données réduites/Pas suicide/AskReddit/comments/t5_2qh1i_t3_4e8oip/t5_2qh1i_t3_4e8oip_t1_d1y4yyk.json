I felt for a long time like I couldn't allow myself to leave because of what it would do to the people around me, but that just made me feel worse. I didn't exactly want to go, though, and finally I began to think consciously about my depressed and suicidal thoughts as I would about anybody who would be so mean to me as to say those kinds of things. Eventually, I realized that there wasn't any part of me that wanted to leave; I was just having a hard time telling the difference between my voice and the other, cruel voice because they were both in my head. I can't say exactly what it was, but letting myself start asking my thoughts, in essence, \"Why are you saying such mean things? That really hurts my feelings,\" started a habit of, well, thinking of myself as a person just enough that I did finally open up and ask for that first bit of help. Once I started getting it, it got easier and easier, and I wanted more and more to be healthy and happy.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y4yyk/"}
