Okay? This will be our secret. Because take it from me, a scar does not form on the dying. A scar means, I survived.\"\n\nI have friends who have self-harmed and still have scars. I don't see them as something they should be ashamed of at all. I see them as a sign of strength that they have dealt with things I can't understand, and they are still here.
