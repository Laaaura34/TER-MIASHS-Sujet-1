My mom had taken me because a friend contacted her who saw a status message i put up on yahoo messenger. I hadn't slept in 48 hours and was really out of it so no clue what I put up. The hospital check in didn't know what was going on so I was just sitting in waiting room waiting my turn till my mom apparently came in and told them what happened. I was immediately rushed to the back where they pumped my stomach.  Later I was told I was 7 times over a lethal limit and they didn't know how I was still conscious let alone walking around. Also yes got handcuffed and had wear handcuffs when was moved to a different facility by some kind of police related people for recovery/safety watch.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9t47/"}
