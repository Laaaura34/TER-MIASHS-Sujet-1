Being devoid of negative thoughts doesn't mean you're happy now, you just silenced a part of yourself. \n\nFor some people that's enough to grab the reins and name some serous leeway into fixing their problems. I personally felt no real emotions toward things while on my medications; my response to everything good or bad was \"ok\", and every day seemed to last an eternity without the company of \"myself\" in my head. \n\nI eventually made the decision to stop wasting money and time on a problem which has no real cure. Almost three years of switching around medications just to finally accept that you are a slave to your own life. You can't put the book down no matter how much you hate it, can't change the channel. Gotta just hope it ends soon. \n\nIn the meantime sleep has been my solution to suicide. The hours pass by so much easier when you aren't conscious.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6qyd/"}
