You often hear the stories, like you said, of people relieved that they failed. People who stepped off the bridge, and just as they start falling realize it was a mistake. I appreciate this point of view. \n\nA question though. Why did you choose the method that you did for the attempt? I apologize if this seems forward but mental health is a study that interests me. I work as a deputy sheriff and encounter many people with different ranges of depression and anxiety. \n\nUnfortunately, my fianc\u00e9 just lost her brother to suicide and he was paranoid schizophrenic.  \n\nIt's good to hear that you have found a way to see beauty in life. I didn't see if you mentioned medication but if you are doing without it even more kudos to you. It isn't easy to over power your own psyche with positive thoughts in the moment.
