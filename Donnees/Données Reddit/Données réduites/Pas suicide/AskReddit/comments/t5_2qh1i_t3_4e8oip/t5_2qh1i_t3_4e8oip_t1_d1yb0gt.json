I followed her to that school in hopes she'd finally come to her senses and be with me. We got really serious. To the point we started  imagining our wedding. Things fell apart and it was just sleepless night after night. She took interest in the other guy and one night we were all kinds drinking, they went upstairs and she implied she was going up to bang him just to piss me off. I just felt heartbroken. Everything I have up. I had no future, I failed college, lost my childhood home, insane debt, no job. I looked at the smirnoff ice and decided to chug as many as I could so I wouldn't wake up. It was strange I didn't view it as suicide. I was young and stupid and obviously didn't know anything about Smirnoff since I only works up with a bad headache and heartache. Anytime now I find someone have difficult times I show them the rocky Balboa speech when he's talking to his son about life.
