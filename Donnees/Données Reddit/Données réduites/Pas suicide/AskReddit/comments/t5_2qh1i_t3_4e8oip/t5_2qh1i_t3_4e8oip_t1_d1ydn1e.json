I had spent the better part of 4 years having a parental figure tell me that I was worthless and that I would never amount to anything. Of course, when you first hear it, you immediately dismiss it; after awhile, however, you start to believe it. It was a weight that I couldn't shake.\n\nI started cutting not to kill myself, but rather to dull the mental/emotional pain I was going through. I had thought about suicide, but I was determined that if I was going that route that I would just drink a cup of bleach and be done with life.\n\nThe saddest part was that when my dad found out, he proceeded to yell at me. That was when I knew that I needed to change my life.\n\nFast forward these 7-8 years. Things haven't been easy, but I am managing my life. I have at least proven that I am not worthless, and have found things in life to help keep me on the healing track. I have a wife of 5 years and a 2 year old son, been to 2 different therapists, and am taking an anti-depressant, but I am surviving one day at a time.\n\n**EDIT: Actually added my thought to the story.**", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ydn1e/"}
