It was 6PM when I woke up, just in time for my Mom to tell me I need to prep because it's a Sunday and we had to go to church. I was confused when I woke up and just nodded, but once it all sank in, I started cursing the world because, *it didn't fucking work*. I checked my phone to find confused messages from my best friend aka one of the people I said good bye to. She called repeatedly but I didn't answer. All I can think about at Church was how stupid what I did was and how I'm a failure-- I can't even kill myself properly. Oh and, the awkwardness of hiding all the letters I scattered at home and taking myself to the hospital the next day.   \nIt was a weird, unforgettable experience, to say the least.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8w6l/"}
