Basically, \"Well, alright then.\" I had taken the whole bottle of my medication and laid in bed with my heart racing until I passed out. Woke up feeling like shit, but still alive. It wasn't an eye opening moment for me at the time, but I just kind of accepted that I guess I was supposed to keep going.\n  When I had the feelings again a couple years later, I decided to call a hotline with hopes that I could be talked out of it. It was a weird feeling to want to die and want to be talked out of wanting to die at the same time. Anyway, they talked me into calling the police on myself, who then took me to a psychiatric hospital for a 72 hour watch. While I was there, I met with a doctor who said I had been misdiagnosed my whole life and he put me on medication that actually worked for the first time.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y5zc9/"}
