That's not it. \nIt's not that my life is so terrible now, It's not great, but its not something I couldnt turn around. \nIt's not that I cant go on living through the years of physical and sexual abuse. I can, I've made it over that hump.\n It's not that I cant stand the sight of myself or cant find the motivation to improve myself. Im not fat or ugly, I am losing weight but its not even that necessary. \n\nI don't know what it is. I just know I don't want to keep living. I know that I want to die everyday, and the only thing that keeps me living is guilt. Guilt from knowing if I did it I would hurt people who love me, be a financial and emotional burden. I know I would feel guilty because I could have a good life if I so choose. I know that there is no reason for me to die and I feel so guilty for wanting it so bad it hurts.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1zasnk/"}
