I had slit my left arm with a razor blade in my bathroom, and when the skin actually broke I was just shocked. \n\nI'm not sure if it was because I didn't actually expect myself to go through with it or not, but as soon as I did I just froze. I stopped crying and just kind of stared at my arm for a while. \n\nI finally realized the cut wasn't going to kill me, but I did know I would need medical attention. I told my stepdad and he was great about it and drove me to the hospital. He later told me I kept saying \"Please don't hate me, I'm sorry\" and he just kept telling me it was okay. \n\nI'm fine now. I'm in a great place in my life and I don't have these thoughts anymore. I have a scar up my left arm, and I'm still too embarrassed to tell people the truth about it. Other than that, I'm so so incredibly happy that my attempt didn't work, and I hope this comment shows someone that things do get better.
