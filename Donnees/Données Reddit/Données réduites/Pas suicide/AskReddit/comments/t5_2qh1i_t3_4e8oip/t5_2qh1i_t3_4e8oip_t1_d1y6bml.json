This hit me hard. I don't know who you are or what your life is like but I can guarantee, even if it doesn't feel like it will happen, it will get better. I know I probably won't help you at all but the fact that random strangers on the internet are wishing you luck and trying to help you must mean something. Go out meet someone new or get a dog like everyone else said. People do care for you, even if you don't think they do, I'm sure if you were gone people would be sad, people would care.
