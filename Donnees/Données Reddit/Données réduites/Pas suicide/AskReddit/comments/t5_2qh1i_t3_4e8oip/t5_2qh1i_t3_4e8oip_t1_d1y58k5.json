My plan was to move to a different town and get whatever job I could where I could get some cheap-ass apartment and send everything else back to my family. Then, when it had been long enough that they didn't really care about me anymore, I'd kill myself. I should mention that, at the time, I had a husband and a 2-year-old--and was 6 months pregnant. I was carrying a baby inside me that I believed should never learn to love me because that's how much I hated myself. Fortunately, my husband, providence, and my ever-shrinking sense of self-preservation prevailed, and I finally allowed myself to ask for help. But it's the kind of thing you just have to take on faith: it's not being unaware of how much it'll hurt other people. Often, it's being all too aware and feeling that you're a terrible curse that you desperately have to save the world from, particularly your loved ones.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y58k5/"}
