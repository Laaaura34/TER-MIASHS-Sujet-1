There is no chance of escape or rescue. There is however a window in the room. You have a choice. You can be burned alive or you can jump out of the window. For those that commit suicide jumping out of the window is still scary but the thought of being burned alive is much scarier. Especially since you can already feel the heat and are being smothered by the smoke.\n\nLet me flip the question around a little bit. Do you think it's wrong that we kill pets that are obviously suffering? If someone kills themselves are they really the ones that are selfish for hurting the ones that love them, or are the ones that love them selfish because they would rather that individual endure endless suffering instead of ending their existence? \n\nThose are some pretty complex questions and every case has a lot of nuance. In general though someone who commits suicide doesn't usually view themselves as selfish. Either they view themselves as a burden to those around them, or their suffering is so great that all the love in the world isn't enough to keep the flames at bay.  The thing about depression and other mental illnesses is that even with proper treatment they don't necessarily  go away. They just become manageable, hopefully.
