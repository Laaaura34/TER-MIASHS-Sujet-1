I was bullied severely for the way I looked and was raised and I tried to hang myself but the rope broke. So that just confirmed I was a fat cow who's hair was like a horse and all the other mean shit people said about me. Much like the top post right now, it wasn't like something clicked right after that that made me feel better. After my dad died my freshman year of high school and the news spread, people stopped bullying me and just ignored me instead. And after lashing out for awhile I got over it, identified that my depression was environmental and got the fuck out of state as soon as I graduated high school.
