Woke up on the ground after apparently locking my room. I could feel how dry my eyes were from the crying. \n\nI checked myself in the mirror and my only reaction was \"please, just tell me it's over\" and then I burst out in barely dry heaving tears. \n\nAs soon as that was done I went back to my room and double checked. Yep, two bottles of cheap whiskey, no puke, all the meds taken, what had gone wrong?! \n\nCharge up my phone, see that it's been a whole day and a half of me being passed out, my housemates (busy with studies so not in the house) asking whether I want to join them for a pint. \n\nDefinite no and up to this day I have yet to mention this all new low I reached to anybody. It was despicable. Driven by hatred, scorn, alcoholism, egoism and all the vile things that a human at the bare age of 20 can acquire. \n\nAnd then it hit me, with an extremely slow delay, \"Fuck this, if everything can fuck me over viciously in completely undeserved ways, I can do better on its own terms by proving to be the victor.\" \n\nAnd that is exactly what I strive for nowadays, proving that there's a point to it. Even though I still despise every second of my life, I found meaning in seeing my close friends smile, having deep and meaningful conversations, struggling to become better not for me, but for the people who care about me, because that's what happiness proved to be for me in the end.
