But I'm still gonna type it cause it's 1 a.m. and I can't sleep well I've tried to kill myself about 4 Times, first time was in high school I took a razor blade to my neck , luckily a nearby student saw it and told an officer (I was outside behind the school) at the emergency room the doctor on call told me if I went just went a little deeper I could've hit a artery and I would've died . After I was stitched up and question by the hospital psychologist I was admitted to the mental care wing of the hospital  . After a week I left and for some reason I never really thought of it I never realized how big of a deal it was I guess I still  don't. I didn't really think it was  crazy or an insane thing to do it, to me it was the same As spilling milk it was something people shouldn't cry over, I didn't think \" boy I'm glad I didn't die \" I just didn't care . The next couple of times I just kinda shrug my shoulders and thought \"oops that's my bad, that's my blunder\". I don't know what that says about me but suicide was never an unspeakable or unforgivable act it just is ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y57jh/"}
