If he wanted to, he would've by now. He has access to a gun collection that would make a museum jealous. He could've taken all of his medication, *then* drank. He could've floated face down in Lake Michigan. The fact he hasn't, and told you about his intention, is a cry for help.\"\n\nHe's in the hospital and getting better.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ybwgw/"}
