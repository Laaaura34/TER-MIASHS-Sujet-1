It was the middle of the day and I was severely drunk but when I realize I'd failed I was so mad at myself for not being able to follow through, I was just screaming in rage and telling the cops to go fuck themselves.\n\nWhile they had me in restraints on a bed waiting for me to sober up (my blood was drawn and tested at .40 BAC) the anger turned into shame and overwhelming sadness and I just bawled like a baby in this dark room with a nurse looking in periodically.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9h2p/"}
