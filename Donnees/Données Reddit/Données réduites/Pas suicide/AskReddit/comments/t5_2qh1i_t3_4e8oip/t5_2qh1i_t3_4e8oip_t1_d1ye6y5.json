This touched me because it reminded me of the difference a person like that can make in your life.\nMy wife used to be like that, but she gave up because I didn't have the strength to help myself. It was too draining for her.\nI miss that person every day and am confused by who she is now. I realise now she never really  understood. \n\nThe kids and I have so many adventures together on the weekends. It's so tiring though. I miss having a complete family so much.\n\nIt's been a year and a half since she told me she didn't love me anymore. I still wish I wasnt here and feel trapped. I know I can't leave because it would make people sad and my kids wouldn't have a dad.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ye6y5/"}
