I just inform you that, yes, you are being selfish for wanting someone to be in constant mental pain so you can continue feeling good.\n\n\n>There are ways to battle whatever is making you unhappy. You don't just give up. You \"Continue\"\n\nThat's not for you to say. There are people who are incurable. This entire statement just reeks of ignorance. There often isn't just a thing that makes you unhappy. The thing that is making these people 'unhappy' is themselves, it's inside of them and it's with them always.\n\nIt's not giving up to commit suicide, it's just ending a painful struggle. If someone has bone cancer eating at them and having them in pain constantly, would you say the same? 'Don't give up, you might be cured one day.' Fuck that. Someone is in control of their own life. If the pain if too much for someone to handle they should be able to end it without people dishonoring their memory by making them out to be cowards.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ycoou/"}
