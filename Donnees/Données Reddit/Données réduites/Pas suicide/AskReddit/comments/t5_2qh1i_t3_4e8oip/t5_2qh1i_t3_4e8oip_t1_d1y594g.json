Im not saying I'm right or that anyone else has to think this way, but maybe the depressed state isn't the default state. Maybe happiness or a good middle is. Maybe, just maybe these default states of depression aren't really your default and you are just going through a rough patch.   I say this because I love people very much and have seen a lot for my age. I hate hearing people talk about how life is terrible and that everything sucks. Because it doesn't always suck. Always look for the silver lining. It may not always be there but 90% of the time there will be one and that silver lining, no matter how small it is can make all the difference. \n\nThat phone you accidentally just broke? Maybe this is a good chance to get off your technology and talk to people and make new friends. \n\nThat money you accidentally dropped? Maybe it will make someone else's day\n\nThat balloon you accidentally let go of? Maybe it for some reason gives someone hope.\n\nMy point is, if you look hard enough, you can almost always find something good in something bad. I understand what's going on. I get what its like. But you are never alone and there is always a way out whether its doing nothing and waiting or being proactive and working your way out.
