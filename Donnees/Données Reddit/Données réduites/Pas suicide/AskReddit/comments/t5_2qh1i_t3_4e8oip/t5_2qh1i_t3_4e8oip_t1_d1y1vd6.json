My second though was, I'm kinda glad I'm not dead. \n\nBefore anyone can ask, I cut my wrists. Deep enough to need stitches that I didn't get, but not deep enough to die apparently. That was eight years ago. I'm so thankful I didn't succeed. I'm grateful for my life now. I have an amazing fiance, a beautiful God daughter, and a fantastic best friend. \nAll I can say is, if you're feeling like suicide is your only option, it's not. Seek help and support. Life sucks, but it does get better. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y1vd6/"}
