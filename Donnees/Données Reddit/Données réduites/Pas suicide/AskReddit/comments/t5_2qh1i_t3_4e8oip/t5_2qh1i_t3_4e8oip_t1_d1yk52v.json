Its tough, and I have lived with the thoughts my whole life. But since that day I have never tried again. There was a point where I was constantly planning on how to end things and things never seemed to line up.\n\nAs of this point yea, Ive accepted that I have to live and that is what I am going to do. How? I have not a clue. I'm at the point where I am saying fuck it I'm going for my dream now and gonna make something of myself. I AM BETTER THAN THIS. World didn't want me gone, well I am gonna do something for the world instead.\n\n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yk52v/"}
