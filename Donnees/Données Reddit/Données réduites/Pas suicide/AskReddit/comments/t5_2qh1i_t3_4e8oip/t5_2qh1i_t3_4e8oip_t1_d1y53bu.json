I don't have to say anything. \n\nI was about 12-13 and was bullied heavily where I went to school. Went through puberty before everyone else, was tall and fat, had an abusive childhood and was ultimately robbed of happiness. One night I tied my belt around my neck and looped it to the support beam in the basement. \n\nThe belt snapped, I fell to the ground and gasped for air. I felt like everyone was right, I am fat. I didn't want to go upstairs to my abusive family either. I wanted to be hanging from the belt where I could've been happier. \n\nFast forward, I used the depression at fuel to change my life and do a 180. Sometimes I go back down a dark path, but I can usually redirect it elsewhere. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y53bu/"}
