But [this](https://medium.com/@PurpleBooth/tuesday-night-wednesday-morning-6727c2c9981d#.1kelmkh2g) happened last week.\n\nBasically I was going to jump off a bridge but the Samaritans talked me into not doing it from a payphone, half way through I ran out of money, but they gave me the free to call from payphones number like a second before the money ran out and I talked to a second person. I had already been at A&E that night and escaped, and all I could think about was if the person who I talked to first knew that it had turned out okay and they had saved my life or if they were worried about me and it was stressing them out.\n\nI guess I'm not really a survivor because they talked me down before I actually did it.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8wlu/"}
