I didn't work out so 6 weeks later I OD'd on medications and spent a couple days in ICU. When I came out, my family didn't deal well with me and sent me back into a mental institution.  I felt guilty after I had done it.  Not because I didn't succeed but because of the pain I caused my little brother and the guilt he felt from not being able to \"save me\" himself.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yprpz/"}
