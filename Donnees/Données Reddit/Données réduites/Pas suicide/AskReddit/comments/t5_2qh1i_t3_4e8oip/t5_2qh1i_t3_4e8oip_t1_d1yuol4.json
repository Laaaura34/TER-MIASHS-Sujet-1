The first time, I instantly regretted it, feeling guilty about being so selfish about everything, and reached out to my friends, who got me the help I needed to survive it. \n\nThe second attempt was more serious. I went to sleep after taking an overdose that by rights should have killed me, expecting never to wake up. Didn't tell anyone I'd done it, just did it and went to bed. The next morning I woke up, completely unable to process how the hell it had happened. Just pure confusion. \n\nThe third (and as of now final) attempt didn't really get too far. I was on my way to the place where I was going to do it, when the police picked me up. First thought: \"Shit, they're going to section me, aren't they?\". Yep, they did. Off to the hospital I went. Definitely the lowest points I've ever been, and not something I ever wish to repeat. It's been 5 years since my last attempt, and I'm doing better mentally than I have in a long time.
