I have a nerve disease. It's also called the suicide disease because, well, it sucks. Cancer would be better because at least I would have a chance to have a cure, remission, or die and be done. The first time I took a whole bottle of my sleeping pills. I woke up the next day, albeit really late in the day. I thought, I guess I'm not supposed to die yet and thanked God I was alive and did my best for the next few years. Several years down the road I went to a park/forest during the day, I knew hardly anyone would be around, in left two forms of I.D. in my car and one in my pocket and sat down in seclusion with my 9mm in my mouth, against my temple etc. I just didn't or couldn't pull the trigger. A decade later and I'm married and have a daughter. So I'd never do it now, but there are days I'm glad I keep my guns at my uncle's. I'm religious, so my first conscious thoughts were that God wasn't ready for me on the other side yet. I still had chances of happiness on this earth .
