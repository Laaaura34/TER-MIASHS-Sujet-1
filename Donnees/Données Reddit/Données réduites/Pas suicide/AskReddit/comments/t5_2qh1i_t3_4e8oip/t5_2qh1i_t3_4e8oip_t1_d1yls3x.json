But everything you say is okay. You ultimately need to take care of yourself. It's not like you just didn't care what happened to her and got annoyed and dropped her. She was breaking and it was breaking you too. And what good are two broken people? You may love her but you can't be of help when you're living a stressed and worried life. \n\nMy attempt was the worst part. I took the pills and crawled back in bed with him. I had woken up from another PTSD flashback dream, after a string of them happening maybe 30-40 nights in a row, and all I wanted was to sleep forever and never have that dream again, and go to sleep in the comfort of his arms. I don't blame him for not wanting to go through that again. I always tear up and my stomach goes in knots thinking about that moment. \n\nI'm sure I gave him all kinds of issues and for that I'm very regretful. I loved him and my depressed brain didn't realize how much I was hurting someone I love. All I was aching for was his arms and to feel better. What is going on inside her ex's head isn't something she can help but it doesn't mean it needs to break down more people. I hope you eventually feel better and take care of yourself.
