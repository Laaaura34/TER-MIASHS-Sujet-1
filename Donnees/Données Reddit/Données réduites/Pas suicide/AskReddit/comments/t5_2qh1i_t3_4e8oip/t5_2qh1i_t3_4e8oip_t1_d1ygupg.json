The first time I don't even know if I was intending to die...I just knew I didn't want to wake up, if that makes sense. I was just so so tired, endlessly tired, so I swallowed a bottle of pills to finally get some peace and quiet. My first thought upon waking up was \"Damn, I want to go back to sleep\", followed by \"Shit, let me hide this.\"\n\nI am miles away from the person I was then, thank god. I am generally pretty happy and have lead an exciting life so far (I'm only 21), but still I  acknowledge I will have to continue to fight off depression and anxiety the rest of my life. If I don't think positively or just use 'mindfulness', I can easily see my thoughts start to dip. And you know what, fighting a naturally negative mind is exhausting sometimes. Today it sure is, I feel pretty lonely today, but writing about this helps me acknowledge why I feel the way I do I guess.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ygupg/"}
