I know it's about as far from a verifiable phenomena as can be but those thoughts fuck with me sometime..  Like the time a buddy and I were almost killed by a snowplow on an icy road..  For the life of me I don't remember how I got the car in reverse,  managed to find a grip on the road and get out of harms way in a matter of seconds..  I'm sure the actual cause was adrenaline getting me through faster than a brain can process and not my conscious experience jumping to an alternate time line but those thoughts still nag at me from time to time.  \n\nAnyway sorry for rambling,  this got way way off topic.
