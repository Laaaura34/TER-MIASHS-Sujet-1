Nobody else has any say over your life except you. Obviously I'm just a stranger on the internet and I'm just explaining from my own limited experiences, but likely you aren't actually keeping yourself from suicide just because of your family and friends. Your will to survive and perservere likely just manifests itself as love for your family and friends. You desperately want to hang on and it's this love and care that you use as a way to trick yourself into hanging on a little while longer.\n\nThat is a good thing. Just take it a day at a time. Every day you don't kill yourself is a success. Really, eventually there is going to be a day where things aren't as bad.\n\n\n>anti-depressants haven't been helping\n\nHow long have you been on them?
