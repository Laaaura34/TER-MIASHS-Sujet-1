One of my sisters confronted my parents for sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of my dad. He denied, mom backed him up. Sister flipped out, grabbed a knife, ran out of the house, and went for her wrists.\n\nMy brother-in-law, my brother, and I were the only ones to visit her in the hospital. None of the rest of our sisters or our parents visited her. This, despite the family line that \"she was mentally ill, and had a psychotic break.\" So she's mentally ill, but you won't visit her? More like she brought up something you don't want to deal with, so you're angry with her. I still struggle with anger about that whole multi-year drama.
