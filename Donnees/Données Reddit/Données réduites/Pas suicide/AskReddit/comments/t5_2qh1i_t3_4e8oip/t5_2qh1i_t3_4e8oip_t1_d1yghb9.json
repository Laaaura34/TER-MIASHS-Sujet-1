My family life was in shambles, my boyfriend (who, looking back on it, was a pretty toxic person) had gone missing, and I was being bullied at school. I remember that while the pills were beginning to take effect, my mother and brother were fighting over a school project of his and I  remember thinking \"Can't I die in peace?\" before blacking out. When I woke up the next morning, my first thought was \"God dammnit, I can't even kill myself properly!\" My failure had only served to make me more suicidal and I tried two more times before my mother realized how depressed I was and that me being suicidal would be great leverage over my father, so she got me help. 3 years later and I'm not really suicidal anymore thanks to medicine, some things my therapist said (but not many), my friends, and various support groups for dealing with my family. The thoughts still bug me sometimes, but that's just part of my life. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yghb9/"}
