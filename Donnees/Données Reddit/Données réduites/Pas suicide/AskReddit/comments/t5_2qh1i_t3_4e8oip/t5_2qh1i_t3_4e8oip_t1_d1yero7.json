There's not many psychedelics that would land you in the hospital at a normal ketamine dose. We'll call it 75mg lines (assuming it's not medical grade, if so then 50mg), which really isn't that much for any other drug.\n\nMethoxetamine has potential to cause psychosis at that dose, but I've never experienced it personally and I've taken very large doses of methoxetamine. If it were 2C-B, 4-HO-MiPT, or any other tryptamine/phenethylamine (excluding the DOx and other blotter drugs) then it would just be one hell of a trip with possible psychosis.\n\nReally, I just want to know what caused a hospital visit like that. The drug nerd in me is crying out.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yero7/"}
