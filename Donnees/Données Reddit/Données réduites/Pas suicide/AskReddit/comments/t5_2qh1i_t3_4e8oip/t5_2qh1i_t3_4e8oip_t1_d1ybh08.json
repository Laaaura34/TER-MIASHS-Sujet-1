This is such a huge part of depression that I'm not sure even a lot of doctors know or understand. I remember being there, and even in the midst of my worst bouts, I remember how comforting the sadness was. It's like a blanket. It consumes your thoughts and becomes your everything. And it's your secret. Once I finally sought help (after about 10 years and one very scary, awakening attempt) not only did I remember the feeling, but I missed it. I longed for the cover. But once I pulled out, I realized what I'd been missing and who I really was. But I'm not going to lie, it's been 7 years and on occasion, when things are bad, I long for that comfort.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ybh08/"}
