It was almost 5 am and I thought \"shit, now I have to be up in 2 hours for school.\" Got two hours of sleep, woke up, then put on autopilot for school. It was surreal, really. Walking around, seeing people and teachers with all the same sort of interactions I'd come to expect, and thinking that I shouldn't even be there. \"How am I still here?\" \"Do they even have any idea?\" Of course, no one did, I just seemed like a bit of a robot to some of the casual acquaintances I had in classes at the time.\n\nAt least that's how it was for me.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6an1/"}
