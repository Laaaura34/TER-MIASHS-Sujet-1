All they know is that parents love their children. They can't imagine a different perspective. If you doubt me, go talk to some cops. Most will have a story or be able to point you to someone who has a story about a child being given back to abusive parents. Child protective services primary goal is actually the reunification of families not protection of children. People can't seem to imagine a world were it could be better for the kid to not be with biological family. Other CPS services might be different from my state's, but from the stories and news articles I've seen I don't think so.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ygjku/"}
