And if they don't want to be a burden, they may never ask. Which prompts me to offer perhaps again and again, to show them that I care, and I mean it, and they are not putting me out.\n\nYour feelings are valid, and I am not trying to tell you who in your life cares or doesn't care because I have no way of knowing, but perhaps it will help you to think that maybe some of those people who seemed like they were doing it for show were perhaps doing it for another, kinder reason.\n\nAnd I will remember what you said next time I am trying to be there for someone in my life. Because my way of responding is certainly not the best way either. :\\", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yd7n6/"}
