I downed a handful and chased them with as much liquor as I could a few years ago. It was half suicide attempt, half a deep desire to be fucked up. Ambien has hallucinogenic effects for me and was the only drug I had on hand that had positive effects anymore (weed had stopped being positive, which was a sad sad realization).
