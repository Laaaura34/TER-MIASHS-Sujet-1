Within hours of the attempt, before she was even declared brain dead, everyone in town knew and was already posting \"RIP\" statuses on Facebook. Her death was devastating for me, and I had hoped that she would pull through, but it got to the point that even I eventually thought it would be better for her - could you imagine waking up to a world who had accepted your death? To people talking about \"a good person throwing away their life\" when you were unsuccessful?\n\nI like to think that had she survived it would have been that \"thank god\" moment that so many other people described. But I'm convinced that even if it had been, the towns reaction would have quickly turned the thought back to disappointment.
