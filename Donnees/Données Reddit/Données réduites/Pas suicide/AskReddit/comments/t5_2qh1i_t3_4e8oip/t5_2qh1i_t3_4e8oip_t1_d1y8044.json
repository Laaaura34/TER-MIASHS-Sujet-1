I was still fucked up feeling.\n\nI decided to tell my mom what happened, rather than try to make it through school. I knew I would likely have an emergency meeting with my therapist. I didn't expect to be sent to a hospital. Had to be there by 10pm (it was 3 hours away, and they were nice enough to allow me to pack and prepare, and let my parents drive me).\n\n\"Fuck. Fuck. Fuck,\" was a frequent thought that whole day. My parents took their time driving me. We stopped for fast food for lunch. We stopped at random scenic areas. They took me to dinner at a decent chain restaurant. I know that they were just trying to have more time with me. But, \"Fuck. Fuck. Fuck,\" stayed in my mind.\n\nI'm so glad that I survived.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8044/"}
