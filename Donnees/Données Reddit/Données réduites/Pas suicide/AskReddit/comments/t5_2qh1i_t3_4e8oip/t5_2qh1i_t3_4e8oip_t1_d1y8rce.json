I'm still here?\"\n\nSecond attempt was more or less the same. Just really strong self hate at the fact i failed twice at committing suicide. \n\nI've since found help but the thoughts are always there. I struggle to find work and still live with my father at 23 so that's probably the main source of self contempt. I help whenever I can but the stress is really taking its toll on my dad.\n\nMany a night I've entertained the idea of packing my bags and l leaving. I have nowhere else to go but if I'm not a burden on my dad then at least I'll be somewhat comforted. \n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8rce/"}
