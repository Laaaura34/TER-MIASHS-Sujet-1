We get people everyday who are suicidal. Case by case basis where I work on restraints. Basically if they are absolutly out of control and could hurt them selfs or others we are required by law to restrain you. I can ~~always~~ typically tell between the ones who are just ass holes who are trying to be pricks or just refuse to cooperate with staff (typically homeless people or people drunk/on recreational drugs and the people who are actually struggling and it fucking sucks to force someone to do something they don't want to do at their low point when they already feel like everything is already out of their control. I have had bad thoughts through out the years so on some level I feel their pain. I have been doing this job for 5 years and the whole time and even through EMT school I got my self through tough situations by telling myself that I would want some one like me taking care of my loved one.
