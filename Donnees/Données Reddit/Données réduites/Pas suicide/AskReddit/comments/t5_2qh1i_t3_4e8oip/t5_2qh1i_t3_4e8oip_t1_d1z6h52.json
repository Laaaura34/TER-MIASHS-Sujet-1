I'm gay and when I confided in my teachers, they told me my parents would never accept me (so not true). \n\nI was also sent to conversion counselling behind their back. I felt so bad for just being me. So I took 30 sleeping pills the first week of year 12. My parents found me. They took me to hospital.
