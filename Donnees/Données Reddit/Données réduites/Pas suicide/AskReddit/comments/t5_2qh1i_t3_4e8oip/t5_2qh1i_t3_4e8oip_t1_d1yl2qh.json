That is one of the best bits of advice I have ever taken when it comes to dealing with difficult people. \nAlso, don't expect answers right away. Discuss and give her time. That whole 'don't go to bed angry' thing is stupid. When my fella and I have disagreements we each present our side and our ideas/solutions. We listen and we allot time to think between trying to resolve the issues. We will talk about other things and go about our day. This has helped a LOT because we have time to fully think about what the other said and everything about it. We have time to try and understand each other.
