Self inflicted paranoia and lack of larger perspective can really distort things. \n\nA common complaint among those of us who have struggled with suicide is the feeling of being \"trapped.\" When the people in your family and social circle seem to have turned against you, it feels as if the whole world is collapsing. It's also a trick that your mind plays on itself to automatically assume the blame lies with you. \"All these people can't stand me, that must be a reflection of how shitty I am.\"\n\nThe interesting thing is that if you survive the collapse of your whole world, you may start to realize that there exists outside of it a much larger place inhabited by people who have no opinion of you yet. When you're suicidal you have no grasp of this. All you see is that ring of people you've surrounded yourself with that aren't really working out for you right now, perhaps because of their own failings, or you see the \"uncaring\" masses of people you don't know and can't bond with as some kind of personal reflection about your own worth. It's not that. They just don't know how awesome you are yet, maybe because you haven't figured that out yourself. \n\n\n \n\n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9b99/"}
