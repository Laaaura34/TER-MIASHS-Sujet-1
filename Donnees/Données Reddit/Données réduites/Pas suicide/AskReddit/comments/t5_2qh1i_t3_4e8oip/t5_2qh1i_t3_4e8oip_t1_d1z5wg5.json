But your comment has literally brought me to bawling. Your father's words hit me so hard. I can't imagine what my father or mother would have thought if I had fully committed. I'm so happy you're still with us. Thank you for sharing your story. It's definitely going to be something that comes to my mind when my thoughts grow dark. Thank you.
