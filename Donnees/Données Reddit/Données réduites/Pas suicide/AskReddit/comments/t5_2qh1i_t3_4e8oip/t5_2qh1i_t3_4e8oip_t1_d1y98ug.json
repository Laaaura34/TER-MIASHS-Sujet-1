I yelled this aloud.\n\n\"Jesus fucking christ are you FUCKING KIDDING ME?\"\n\nWas mad more than anything. Still alive. Not the outcome I wanted. That day I didn't have anything better to do so I just went to the gym. Then I went the next day. And the day after that, and I just didn't stop. Now I'm in peak physical condition and I'm better than I've ever been at MMA.\n\nI guess the moral of the story is you have to make change happen. Your life won't just magically get better. The \"it gets better\" thing is bullshit. It won't get better if you sit around doing nothing. Make it better and live happier because of it.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y98ug/"}
