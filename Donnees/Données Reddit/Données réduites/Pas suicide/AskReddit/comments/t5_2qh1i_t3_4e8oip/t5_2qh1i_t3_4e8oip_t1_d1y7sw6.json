I have 11 unsuccessful suicide attempts already from hanging myself to drinking acid. There is only one attempt that I walked away from that really left me with something to think about after I woke up. I ended up waking up in a hospital bed full of machines and I wasn't strapped down. I had drank a full months supply of my epilepsy medication.  When I woke up I remembered a few things while I was out. The feeling of being completely helpless unable to move, talk or breath. I woke up and my first thought was fuck another failed attempt. I had doctors surrounding my bed all excited I survived but I just wanted to die", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7sw6/"}
