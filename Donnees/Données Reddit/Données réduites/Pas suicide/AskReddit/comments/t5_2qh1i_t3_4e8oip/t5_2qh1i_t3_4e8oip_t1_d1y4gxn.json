If you well and truly, absolutely must die.....then do it through life itself. Run away. You have crippling debt, cant make ends meat, have an abusive spouse, are depressed, etc. Leave it all behind. Gran your jacket, some cash, whatever food you might be able to hold onto and just walk out the door. Jump on the back of a freight train or something and just go around. Find where you can be happy or make yourself so busy surviving actual fight-or-flight threats that you dont have time to be bothered by whatever ailed you. What do you really have to lose with this? Anything you might stand to lose, you were already throwing away with death. So change the equation. Experience the world, as many things as you can at any level you can. Who knows? You might find somewhere or something that just makes it all right. Worst case? You die in the attempt...but if that was the plan at the start then is it really something to hold you back?\n\nGood luck with whatever you choose.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y4gxn/"}
