Her father had recently passed and she had tried to kill herself in the shower, I Found her in the tub and her mother and I took her to the hospital. While she was there the pressure from feeling like I was a failure for not being able to alleviate her pain, being in a new state with no family or friends to support me, as well as all the stress from hiding the fact that I'm bisexual from everyone I Know for most of my life hit a boiling point and I cut my arms pretty bad.
