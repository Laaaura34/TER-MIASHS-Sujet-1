I was all ready to go, I even in a total nerd moment looped this: https://youtu.be/hKIZCmlDrWk?t=6 in the background.\n\nAll that happened was I vomited it all right back up, I assume I also \"Napoleoned\" went into school the next day as if normal.\n\nI had several more \"attempts\", most they were self harming through cuts - I still have the scars.\n\nAround 18 things got much better, and now at 32 I still occasionally have those thoughts. There was abuse in one form or another in childhood and mentally I've never really accepted the fact that I \"deserve\" a good life. It's part of a self destruction bent I have, which at the moment has taken it's form in painkiller addiction. I also have an auto-immune disease, so on really bad days that helps drag me down further.\n\nSadly these things you sometimes never get over. Occasionally I will think that my wife would be far better off with the mortgage paid off and nice pot of \u00a3100,000 from my death in service benefit. I haven't actively tried since I was a teenager, and I seem to be fairly bullet proof with the painkillers. Long ago I should encountered renal damage, but nope. They are fine. Due to my illness I have full bloods every 6 weeks and always normal.\n\nFrankly I'm glad I live in the UK.
