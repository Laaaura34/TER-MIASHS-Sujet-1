Slept for about 18 hours straight. Felt super sick in my stomach. First thought was \"Damn, I failed again...\" Then I went downstairs to get a \"Morning sleepyhead\" from my parents. It killed me but my mask stayed up.\n\nThey would find out about my severe depression and hospitalize me before my next attempt. Have been in therapy for the past 4 years. Currently have a music therapist! Also 2 months away from getting off my antidepressants!\n\nFor real guys, mental illness is just that, an illness. Get help immediately. The treatment is long and it blows in the hospital (no more shoelaces), but it works. And I feel great.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yji6j/"}
