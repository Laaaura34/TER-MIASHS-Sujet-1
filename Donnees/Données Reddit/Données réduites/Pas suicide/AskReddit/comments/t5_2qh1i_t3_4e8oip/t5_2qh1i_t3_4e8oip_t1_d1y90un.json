My first thought was that I couldn't stand the thought of leaving my dog alone. \n\nI told my mom and she was annoyed that I needed to go to the hospital on a school night. When we got there and the doctors rushed me in, then she started to cry about being a bad mom and I had to console her all night. The doctors consoled her as well. She persuaded me to say it was an accident and they let me go without any follow up. \n\nThe next week I tried sleeping pills but an ambiguous amount - sort of like Russian roulette with pills. Obviously it wasn't enough but I didn't tell anyone that time. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y90un/"}
