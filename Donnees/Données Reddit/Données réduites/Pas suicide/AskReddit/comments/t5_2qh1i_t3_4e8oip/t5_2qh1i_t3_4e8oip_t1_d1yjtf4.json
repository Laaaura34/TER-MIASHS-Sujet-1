The first time I tried I was 16.  I decided that I was going to hang myself in a garage with an extension cord.  I threw it up over a rafter, tied it off on the end and then made the noose.  I got on a milk crate, put the cord around my neck and dropped.  What I didn't realize was that I didn't account for slack and instead of breaking my neck I instead hit the ground and ended up bruising my tailbone.  My first thought was \"Fuck, I even fail at trying to kill myself.\"  After a few minutes of crying my reaction went to \"what the fuck am I trying to do?\"  \n\nAbout 3 years later I tried again but this time decided that I'd cut my arm.  As I sat there bleeding I again thought \"why am I doing this?\" and stopped the bleeding, went and got help and have been good since.  I realized that I didn't want to die, especially in THAT moment.  ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yjtf4/"}
