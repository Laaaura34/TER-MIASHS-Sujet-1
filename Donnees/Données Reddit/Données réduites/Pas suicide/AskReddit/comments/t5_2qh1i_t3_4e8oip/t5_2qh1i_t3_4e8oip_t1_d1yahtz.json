The idea that we so often think that we're worthless or any number of negative things. Meanwhile our friends and family have this *completely different* view of us and it doesn't make any sense to us. She explained how there could be this disconnect between what our loved ones thought of us and what we thought of ourselves so perfectly that it stuck with me:\n\n\"If you treated your friends like you treated yourself, you wouldn't have any friends.\"\n\nIt was this connection that had never been made in my head before. Of course I hate myself, I treat myself like shit. And so all the self loathing we go through becomes this cycle of hate and counter hate except it's all aimed at ourselves and it becomes so important to stop and just start being kinder.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yahtz/"}
