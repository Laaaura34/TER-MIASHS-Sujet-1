As someone who suffered from severe reoccurring depression with seasonal affective disorder for the majority of my teen and early adult life, I contemplated ending my life on several occasions. I know what its like to feel like the pain will never end, like there is no happiness, just fake smiles, and the terror and exhilaration of feeling like I could opt out if I wanted to. During this time, I was on 17 pills a day (antidepressants, sleeping pills, anti-anxiety). I had a class mate that sat 3 seats over kill himself. He hung himself from his family's large oak tree in the front yard. A small group of us from class went to the wake, and it was there I had an epiphany that forever changed my mind about opting out. As I looked around the group of family, friends, and loved one, I realized that the pain you feel, the isolation, the loneliness....you don't take that with you when you take your own life. You leave it behind for everyone else to have to carry for the rest of their lives. That realization never left me, and I never considered opting out from that point forward. \n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yd17w/"}
