That's like getting angry at a person for sniffling when they have the flu.  You get angry and seethe at them for something they can't control, and all that's going to do is make them want to do it even more.\n\nSo, keep being this way if you want to cause people suffering from this disease more misery for the sake of your need to make it about yourself.  They need medical help, not a person who knows nothing about the illness to yell at them. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y78uf/"}
