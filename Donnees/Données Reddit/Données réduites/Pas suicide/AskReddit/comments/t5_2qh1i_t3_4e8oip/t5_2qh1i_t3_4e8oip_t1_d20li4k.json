Everything was bright and I felt really, really light and calm. I had no idea what day it was or what happened. I wasn't even sure if I was alive.  I asked my mom:\n\n-Mom, did I try to kill myself?\n\n-Yes\n\nOh. Ok. I guess I'm alive then. I started having some flashbacks, I remembered the Sun, and running away from something in the cemetery, and then sitting on a bench, swallowing some pills, I think. I tried to remember more, but it didn't really matter. \n\nI wasn't sad that I hadn't died, but I wasn't really happy either. Just very calm. It was really beautiful, these first hours and days after. I haven't felt that way before and certainly haven't since\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d20li4k/"}
