I hate the fact of this barrier. How they're gonna feel and cope. I can't stand continually living everyday handicapped. I'm on the autism spectrum, have bipolar disorder, and ADD. I have to be drugged just to stay 'sane'? I dropped out of university cause my intellect isn't enough to be there, let alone the lower vocational trades jobs. I can't even do anything! Even the basics of driving a car. Most of the time thinking, I wish I wasn't born, I wish my mum didn't meet my dad because he has aspergers and because of that, I'm witnessing their five sons, my brothers, literally fighting, arguing, smashing things between each other virtually everyday. My dad's the most threatening at this. I can't stand it, I hate autism.\n\nI feel alone. Who's gonna be at my funeral if I die? I'm sad at how I can't maintain friends.   Stuff people take for granted. I don't look like I have autism, so I can make friends but can't maintain them, I get liked and approached but am not socially intuitive. I've lost a lot of friends. I'm upset of how the world is promoting acceptance of autism rather than seeing it as a disorder and the need to prevent and fix it. \n\nI still get feelings of death. I've tried everything from psychology, and yes psychiatry. 7 years of everything - if you've name it, I've tried it. It's a cause that's unknown. I hate autism. I'm tired of staying 'sane'.
