I mean, support is good too. I had a nice little tear up at reading some of the sincere and compassionate responses, but people don't often ask me questions about myself; and I'm not much of one for pride or even healthy levels of self esteem, so I appreciate when someone asks me a question that's more than a superficial 'how're you today?'\n\nI'm about to go to bed, so I'm super tired and prone to rambling, but this might be the best time to answer your question.\n\nWhat are my big dreams? My pie in the sky, money and manpower is no option dreams? Shit man, I want to save the world. I want to bring egalitarianism to the world. I want to cultivate the tangled mass of human knowledge that is the internet and make a central museum of wisdom, science, and history. I want to fight for artistic freedom and copyright laws that allow creators to create with less bureaucracy between their art and their audience. I want to inform, and education, and simplify the needless complexity of systems that have been turned against the people they were meant to serve.\n\nBut those dreams are enormous and unwieldy. So how about some smaller, individual dreams? I would've liked to have been a father. Shit, I would've liked to have been a mother, but that's a whole different story. A family, a house, a workshop. I want to make things. Programs, robots, things that make life simpler for people. I live in Alaska now, and I had some ideas for automated snow removal robots; make roads, walkways, even roofs safer from heavy snow build up. Likewise, people have to plug their cars in so a heater keeps their engine from freezing over; so I had this idea to make a 'magsafe' style adapter that would go on your front bumper. No more having to fuss with plugs, no bending over for people with back issues. But I'd also really like to use some of the new technology we have to help people with weight loss. 3D scanning is pretty cheap these days, and I think you could make a digital physical trainer that measures your progress with more than just a scale. Give it a 3D avatar, have it respond to voice commands like Siri. Put tools into the hands of people that need them but can't traditionally afford them. \n\nBut those ideas are costly, and take far more knowledge than I have today. So how about little, attainable dreams? I left my job, came back to school. Y'know, platformer games with their cartoon worlds and happy characters, those got me through some rough and lonely times. I should make a video game; a cute and happy platformer, so maybe I'll be less sad and others can be less sad when they play it. I don't really know anyone with related talents, and I don't have much money, so I'll have to do everything myself. The code and the art and the animation and the sound... and it's just so much to do on your own. I'll get halfway through yet another tutorial, and now I've got a 3D ball or a 2d guy that runs and jumps and dies on spikes... and nothing else comes of it. I need support to keep going, but I don't share my work with anyone, and it's all just novice crap anyway... so I have a notebook full of ideas and little sketches, and nothing ever comes of them. I thought school would make things better, give me structure and assignments; and it has.. but I can't afford to keep going. \n\nSo I guess you can't achieve your dreams if you don't have money. That seems like a sad way to live. But here I am.\n\nSorry if that was a mess. I cried a little along the way.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8vio/"}
