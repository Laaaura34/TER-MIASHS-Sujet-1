After I was done throwing up I cried for about a solid hour. There weren't really many solid thoughts in my head it was mostly a manic rush of really miserable and really angry things. I calmed down and then I didn't really feel or think anything. It was this weird kind of calm where it was like I went on auto pilot. I don't think I ever hit a point where I thought about whether I was glad it hadn't worked or not, it always just felt like \"well that just didn't happen.\" ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y40lh/"}
