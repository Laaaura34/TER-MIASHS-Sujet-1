I was light headed and actually kinda giddy from blood loss but my first thought when I realized my friend wasn't going to let me bleed out was \" damn. Can't even do this right \". It was much later in the evening after I got home that I realized that death , while still alluring, wasn't what I wanted. I was still woefully depressed, so depressed that I honestly felt my family would not care if I died and I really had no desire for life but...as I looked at my bandaged wrist I didn't feel like suicide was the right choice for me. Still battling depression 17 years later but I have never entertained the thought of suicide ever again.
