It was the night of the spring dance, so all of my friends were out. I texted my goodbyes, grabbed all of the medication in the house, and started to pour. I became extremely tired, put down the last handful, and fell asleep. When I woke up, I think I thought \"I wonder if anyone noticed\". My phone was ringing off the hook from three or four of my friends. My mom was asleep downstairs, she had no idea. I answered the call, let them know I'm alive. I sat up, put the remaining medication in the bottles, and put them back. Stuffed my note in my bedside table, went downstairs, and deleted the goodbye from my mom's phone. \n\nI was admitted to the psych ward about two months later when I told a teacher that I should be on suicide watch. He asked if I was serious, he said yes, and brought me to the counselor. He went and retrieved the police officer, even though he was in the middle of class and can't be away for that long. \n\nI was more grateful for that man than I thought I could be. I credit him with my life. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ykd4a/"}
