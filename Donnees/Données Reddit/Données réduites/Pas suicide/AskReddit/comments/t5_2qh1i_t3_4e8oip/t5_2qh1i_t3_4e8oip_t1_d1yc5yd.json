I was being bullied by a group of the aforementioned people and a couple of teachers simultaneously. I'm not going into what the kids did to me, but the teachers took it further than they ever did. I've suffered from panic attacks since I was 10 years old and whenever I got jittery the teachers would pick up on it and make me feel bad for \"putting it on\". During a food tech trip with (fortunately) 2 other students, I had a panic attack, and instead of being remotely reassuring, I was left by the minibus alone. I went home after, I took as many painkillers as I could,and sat on my kitchen floor. I don't remember much but I know my mum called 999 and I had to stay in hospital overnight. My first thought was anger as to why I hadn't died there and then. It's been a few years since then, and i can't say I feel any better.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yc5yd/"}
