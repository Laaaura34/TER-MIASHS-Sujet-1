Not for not being able to accomplish the suicide, but for giving up and having to face everyone again, with them knowing how weak I was.\n\nThe hardest thing I've done in my life, was telling my GF why I did that, and why I gave up even though I had her (she's the most precious thing I've ever had.), she didn't deserve to go through half what I made her go through.\n\nI just realized I've never questioned myself this, but I'm glad you did Reddit.
