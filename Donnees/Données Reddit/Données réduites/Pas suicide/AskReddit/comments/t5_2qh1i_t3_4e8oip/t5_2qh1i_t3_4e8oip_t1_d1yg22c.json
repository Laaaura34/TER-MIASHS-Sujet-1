Should I drive faster in the rain to get there? No, what if I get in an accident and my dog is left alone? I don't have a significant other, although I do have a family that really cares about me. But I always think of my dog first. I got her when she was about 4, and she had been shuffled between many homes before then. She bonded to me immediately, so I do think she has the resilience to deal with another move if necessary. My parents love her and they've told me more than once that if something happened to me they would take her in a heartbeat. But still, I don't want to put her through that. And on days when I'm feeling kind of down and I don't want to do anything, she's a great motivation to get outside and keep on moving. I'm not suicidal, but I do feel down sometimes, and my dog keeps me going. Thank goodness she's going to live forever.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yg22c/"}
