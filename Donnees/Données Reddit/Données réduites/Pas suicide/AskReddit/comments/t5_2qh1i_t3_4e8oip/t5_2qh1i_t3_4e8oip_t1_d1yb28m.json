I just want to say hang in there. When I was in my 20s I went through a very similar stretch where I felt life was over and had my bridge picked out. Went to detox 13 times in two years. Im now 53 with 3 great kids and alcohol free for many years. The years have not always been easy, and the nagging dark of depression is at times looming, but im so glad I stayed alive.
