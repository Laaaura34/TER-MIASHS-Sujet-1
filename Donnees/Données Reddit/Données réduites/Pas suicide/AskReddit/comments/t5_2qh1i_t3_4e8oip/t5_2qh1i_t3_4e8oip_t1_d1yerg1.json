I just want to say thankyou to everyone who has posted.  I have just finished my first round of therapy after having depression for a long long time,  and every time I would have to fill out a form.  It basically asked on a scale of one to ten how you feel,  what you feel able to do and all that jazz.  The last question was if you have ever had suicidal thoughts,  why haven't you attempted suicide this week? I could never really think of an answer.  Looking through a lot of these posts I've now found an answer.  Although I have had and continue to have suicidal thoughts,  they are fleeting.  They may last for around half an hour,  but they are moments,  nothing more.  So thank you everyone for posting in here. It's really helped me realize that just because I feel like that sometimes,  it will pass,  and I will continue.
