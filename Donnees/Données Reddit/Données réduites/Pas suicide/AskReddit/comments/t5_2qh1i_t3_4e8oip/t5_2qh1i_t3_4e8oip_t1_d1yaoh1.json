I woke up on the way to the hospital and when I realised I didn't really think anything or do anything, I just sat there for about 7 hours not saying a word just really pissed off that I was still here then about 2 hours after I got to the hospital it suddenly clicked that i'm going to have to have a blood test and I fainted, don't really remember anything after that apart from when I got home and made mash potato at like 6:30am... All in all kinda a shit night but in a way i'm happy I did it.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yaoh1/"}
