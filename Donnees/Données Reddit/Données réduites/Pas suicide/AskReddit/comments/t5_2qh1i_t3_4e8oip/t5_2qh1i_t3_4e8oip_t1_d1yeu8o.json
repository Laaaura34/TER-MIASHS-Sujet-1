Got stuck in the mud. I then decided I was going to gas myself. So I got out of the car and realized that the back end of my car was too high to bury fully with mud. \n\nAt that point the whole thing was off in my mind and I needed to get a tow. My first thoughts were about how I was a fucking idiot for getting my car stuck. \n\nI was on new meds for my bipolar disorder. I was in a toxic relationship. So my head was all kinds of messed up. This was my last attempt and it happened about ~6 years ago. Although I still get really depressed from time to time. Suicide has been off the table since then.
