The thing that makes me a bit sceptical is that I'm not convinced elevating my mood will do much. I mean there are times when I get very low - kinda depressed in the more standard sense but right now I'm fine - I just don't want to be alive. Difficult to explain but it feels very distinct from the having a low mood. \n\nThat said, it's the next thing to try so we shall see. Really glad to hear that it has worked so well for you though!", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yt67i/"}
