Actually the only thing i've ever read to make me cry. I was very close to doing what you did, but was scared out of my mind of if it didnt work. Reading this I don't think I will ever even consider it again because your story really showed me why I should never do it and why I never did. I don't know how to express in words how much this has story helped me. Thank you.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ysute/"}
