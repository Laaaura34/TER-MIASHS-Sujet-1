I didn't quite \"find beauty in life\" or anything, but I realized things could be much more manageable. I quit my substance abuse that spiralled me harder and I'm much more active in my family. I hate it to death when nameless faceless people say \"it gets better\", and I'm not even going to say that now. What you do is ultimately up to you. My downfall was that I didn't want to change, I wanted to be depressed and drunk and high and fighting friends and family. I don't know what kicked in my brain in the hospital but I did a complete 180. So I won't say, \"it gets better\". It will get better if you can realize that you absolutely have the power to make things better. Believe me, I know it's extremely hard, and I never would have believed it a month ago. But hey, if you really want to hear more, I'd love to help in any way possible.  \n\n\nEdit: I'm sorry I can't reply to everyone, didn't expect this to blow up like this. I'll do my best to answer any questions. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y2wjd/"}
