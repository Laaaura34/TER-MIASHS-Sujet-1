I remember being super depressed, I tied a shoe lace to my closet hanger where you hang your clothes and I made a loop and put it around my neck and I just dropped nearly broke the thing and I decided to get up. I told myself I'm a fucking idiot, I'm too fat, this won't hold. I gave up and later told myself that I can't take the bitch way out. I still get depressed but I use music to calm me down and occasionally self medicate with cannabis. I used to get so depressed I wanted to kill someone else, that day I guess I decided I should kill myself. Glad I didn't ever really go through with it.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9fos/"}
