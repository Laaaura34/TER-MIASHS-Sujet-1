We are made of cosmic elements that float aimlessly amongst the stars - but in our particular configuration, give rise to an individual sentient, emotional, inquisitive and powerful human being. We are the Universe experiencing itself subjectively, yet even though the same building blocks comprise our bodies, each of us is so terminally unique - no one precisely like you, or I, will ever make a footprint on the earth again. That is significant, and so are you. <3\n\nIf you'd like someone to talk to, I welcome you to pm me any time -  can never have too many friends :] cheers.
