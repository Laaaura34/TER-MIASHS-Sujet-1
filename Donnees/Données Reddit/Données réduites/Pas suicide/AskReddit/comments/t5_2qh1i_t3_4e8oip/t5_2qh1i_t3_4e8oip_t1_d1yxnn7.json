I cut myself and when I saw the skin separate like cutting into raw chicken or something, I panicked. It was about midnight, only my mom was awake. Immediately my first thought was I need to tell my mom, I need my mom, she can fix it. I started crying and went downstairs holding my arm, and she right away stood up out of her chair, brought me into the kitchen and helped me clean it out. I was so afraid she was going to be angry, I'd been cutting myself for years, and there was definite sign of that around the wound. \n\nEventually we went to walgreens and gave it a DIY \"stitching\" with a couple kinds of band-aids because I begged her to not take me to the hospital to get real stitches,  my dad would find out that way. She promised that this time she wouldn't but if it ever happened again, we'd do it the right way, and he'd find out.\n\nI just remember when I asked if she was mad at me she said, \"No, of course not. I'm worried for you and I'm afraid, but we're going to take you to Dr. FamilyDoctor and she's going to help you get better.\" I still cry when I think about that. I'm still very depressed, but I could never imagine killing myself with a mother who loves me like that.\n\nI now have a scar on my arm about an inch long and maybe 4mm wide, the size has definitely reduced over time, but I still get really embarrassed by it and want to cover it with a tattoo or something.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yxnn7/"}
