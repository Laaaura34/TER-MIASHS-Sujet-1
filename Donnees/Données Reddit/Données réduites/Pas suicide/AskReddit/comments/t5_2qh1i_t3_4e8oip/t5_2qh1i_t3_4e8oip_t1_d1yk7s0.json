I ended up sleeping through a lot of the pain that people talk about experiencing. I went through a really bad catatonic period where I couldn't feel physical contact of any kind even if I saw it.\n\nThe only thoughts that I kept having until after I got out of the hospital were:\n1.) I should have known that they were lying to me, why the fuck would they ever love me?\n2.) I can't believe I am so smart, but wasn't smart enough to succeed in the one thing I wanted to.\n\nI will admit I relapsed about two years later in April of 2015, but have gone almost a full year without suicidal actions of any kind. I want to say from one person who has dealt with this to another, it might not feel like it but things do get a little better. You can find solace in friends and hobbies. Engross yourself in something that makes you happy it does help.\n\nIf you ever need anything and you feel like no one else will listen, I will. Message me and rant, cry, or yell whatever you need. Please don't leave this world because you feel like no one cares, because I do.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yk7s0/"}
