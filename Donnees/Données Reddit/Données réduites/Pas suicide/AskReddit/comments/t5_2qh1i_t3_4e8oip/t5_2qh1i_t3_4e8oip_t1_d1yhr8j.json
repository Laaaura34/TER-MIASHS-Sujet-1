Doctors have them fill out a document about how their actions have affected them and as long as their affect matches the mood, the doctors will take their word on them feeling better. \n\nThe mental healthcare system is moving to a state of getting people out of crisis and discharging them quickly. This also impacts the types of therapy we are able to implement when they are being turned out before they would show any progress. Health in the hospital setting is even worse, they will send people out who still need to be on IV antibiotics just to move them along. The system is pushing people into the hands of home health nurses even when the patient would benefit from longer stays.\n\nIt's all less a hospital and treatment facility and more a business - cut and dry. We are even told in the hospital that the people we're treating are customers and emphasis is being placed on good customer service as well as nursing skill. I live in one of the largest medical treatment areas in America, as a matter of fact I can't think of a comparable one off the top of my head. These are revolutionary, ground breaking research hospitals, and this is their mentality.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yhr8j/"}
