Made the conscious decision to just crawl into bed and let the pills take me instead of calling someone for help when I knew I was in trouble, I just gave up and expected not to wake up again. When I did wake up I didn't feel anything, didn't feel happy or relieved or upset or frustrated or anything, just totally numb like every other day. Took a long time to come out of that fog. I hope you can find your way out of it some day, I know it's hard.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y5dg9/"}
