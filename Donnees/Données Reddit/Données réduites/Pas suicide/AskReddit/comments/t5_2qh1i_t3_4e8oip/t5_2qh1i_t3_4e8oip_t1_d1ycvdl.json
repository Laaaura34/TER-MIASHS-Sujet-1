I remember when I was a teenager working at a local grocery store.  There was this really nice guy that would come in.  I hardly knew him, just that he was pleasant, and had quite a few health issues.  Eventually he stopped coming in, and I can only assume it was because he passed.\n\nIt's been 14 years and I still think about him every few days.  People care about you whether you see it or not, friend.  You're a fuckin' rockstar.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ycvdl/"}
