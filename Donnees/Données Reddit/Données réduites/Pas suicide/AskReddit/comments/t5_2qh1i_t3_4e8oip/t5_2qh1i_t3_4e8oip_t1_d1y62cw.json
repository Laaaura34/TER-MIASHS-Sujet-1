It didn't work and I woke up to my mom trying to open the door screaming. I was pissed it didn't work, and my life took an even worse turn after, which made me consider trying it again. But by the time I got out of high school, I was over it. I stopped caring about everything, and because of false accusations by an ex, I was terrified of women.\n\nI remember walking down the stairs at my university and bumping into a woman I'd never met And had a debilitating panic attack because I was so afraid of anything coming from it.\n\nSo I went home with a bunch of prescription pain killers to off myself again, and just before taking them, my dad came in and cried about all of the shit I had to go through, And how much he regrets it all.\n\nWe talked, and I've never tried since. Nothing in life has ever seemed to be a big enough deal to even consider it.\n\nTl;dr, same As everyone, oh shit it didn't work.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y62cw/"}
