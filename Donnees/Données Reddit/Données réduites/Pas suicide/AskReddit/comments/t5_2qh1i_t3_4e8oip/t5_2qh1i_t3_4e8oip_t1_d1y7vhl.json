I meant it. I really wanted to die. I never lost consciousness, but arriving at the hospital was kind of a blur. There were some traumatic aspects to how I was treated, both physically and mentally. (I made a complaint some years later, there was an investigation and I received a full apology. Suffice to say they treated me like crap.) \n\nI thought my mum would come to the hospital, hold my hand, be there for me somehow, but she didn't. Realising I was all alone and nobody gave a flying fuck about me was the worst moment of my life. (And no, I'm not wrong. She didn't give a fuck. This is the woman who a) ignored the fact I was being abused by my father and b) used to ignore me or look through me if I was upset.)\n\nI just wanted someone, anyone, to hold my hand and say: I'm so sorry you feel so sad. And nobody did. I was just alone, with nurses talking to me like I was nothing because, they said, they had other patients who didn't choose to put themselves in the hospital. \n\nLife is better now. I'm happily married. I'm a therapist. But I'm not sure I'll ever fully get over the lack of compassion I experienced that day.
