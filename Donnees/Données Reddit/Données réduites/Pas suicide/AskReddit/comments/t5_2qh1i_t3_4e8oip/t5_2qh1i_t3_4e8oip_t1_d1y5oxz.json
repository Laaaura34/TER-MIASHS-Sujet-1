And now they'll never let me end it.\n\nWoke up in a psych ward, the same room I had been in only a year before in the same scrubs and the same problems. Only had a week left until I turned 18, and if I was still there when the day came then I'd be put in psych care for the foreseeable future.\n\nI had to decide whether to be that kid who dies in a psych ward (they make it difficult obviously, my options were either head trauma or a stolen pen) or lock all my problems in the vault and lie to every nurse and doctor I saw just to feel the sun on my face again.\n\nIt's been 3 years and the sun still feels so warm.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y5oxz/"}
