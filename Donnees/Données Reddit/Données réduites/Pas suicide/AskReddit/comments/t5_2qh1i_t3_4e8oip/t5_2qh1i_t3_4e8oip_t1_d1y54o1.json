But making these kinds of generic statements and comparisons are rotten and condescending, sorry to say.  Not to be harsh about it, but I look at my life and all that I've tried and I know it's not a matter of /wanting/ to fix it.  I might as well want to be a different person, a charismatic person, a person without anxieties, or better genetics.\n\nThere's not even advice there for anyone who wants to fix it.  There are a lot of factors involved, but telling someone they want/don't want to fix it and that \"it gets better\" isn't advice.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y54o1/"}
