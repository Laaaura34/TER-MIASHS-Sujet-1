From time to time people would call me to look at someone and decide if they need to go to the doctor's for a \"fit-to-fly\" because they'd been sick on holiday and the airline required they be medically cleared to fly.  Someone called me to take a look at someone and I knew right away this was emergency material.  This woman who was diabetic took some insulin and then didn't immediately get the reading she wanted so she took a double dose.  She was slipping in and out of conscious when I called the paramedics. She entered a coma on the ride to the hospital and never woke up.  It didn't look like a fun way to go.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yswhl/"}
