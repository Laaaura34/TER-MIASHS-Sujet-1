Feels completely patronizing. It's like someone with zero experience in cancer finding out you have cancer and suddenly they're an expert on chemo-alternatives. \n\nA simple \"I'm sorry you're going through that. Help me understand, what triggers those feelings, how can someone help you so I know what to do for a friend\" sounds miles better than \"talk to someone! You'll get out of your suicidal depression I promise!\"\n\n\nEdit: let me clarify, I have suicidal anxiety and depression, I've been in therapy many, many times. I know what drives those feelings and I try to overcome them constantly. \n\nImagine how bad it feels when something shitty happens or you're depressed and somebody tells you to \"just cheer up\". A kind Internet stranger telling you \"just talk to someone\" or \"I've totally been depressed, it will pass\" kind of things feels like I'm being talked down to, no matter your intentions.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y4pb5/"}
