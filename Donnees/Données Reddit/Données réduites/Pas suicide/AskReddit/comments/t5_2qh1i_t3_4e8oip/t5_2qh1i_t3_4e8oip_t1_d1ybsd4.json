I saw this, SketchyJJ. I'm going to share a few things about this and will see how you get on with those. \n\nWe are all going to die someday. That's a fact and I'm afraid there's no way to avoid it. We punch in when we wake up in the womb/at birth, and out when our human shift is over. \n\nThat's life -- finite, but also wonderful, sometimes a little loco, but always unique. \n\nYour parents met one time X years ago, and regardless of the circumstances you were the product of that (hopefully) fun experience. Now the thing is this, you are the result of a specific sperm and egg combination. If it were another you wouldn't be here today. Your life, my life -- all of Reddit exists on the basis of chance. Think about that. It's incredible. \n\nOut of all of the possibilities, your mom ended up with you. Someone she has grown, nurtured and loved for all, and a bit longer, of your life. This is why she's sad. Because in her eyes she's made the perfect human, a healthy one that can live out their hopes and dreams if they choose, and someone she wants to give the world to. So much that she's fighting with you to keep hope alive that one day you'll find something similar for yourself. \n\nYou have much to give, and if you look at the strength of your mom, your friends and that there are thousands in this thread here that care -- why would you want to punch out early and miss the rest of the party?\n\nHit me up if you want to talk, bud! And good luck :)", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ybsd4/"}
