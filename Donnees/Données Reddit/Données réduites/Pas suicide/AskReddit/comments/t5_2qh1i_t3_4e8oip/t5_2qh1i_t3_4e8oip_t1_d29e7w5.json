The reason behind my behaviour was the fact that I have ADHD, which nobody knew at the time. so to the main point, i\u00b4ve tried to kill myself several times but have failed everytime and every time I fail my reaction has been both happy and sad. Happy because my family wouldn\u00b4t get the new that I killed myself, but sad because I was still here and that I knew that I would still get bullied... When I was in something in between 1:st and 5:th grade i tried to strangle myself with a jumprope and later on I tried to do the same thing but with a regular belt.. Been depressed and suicidal for years, but now im just depressed.\nBut If i wouldn\u00b4t be here today I wouldn\u00b4t have had the chance to go to Dreamhack Masters Malm\u00f6 (CSGO event) and interview two of my idols and rolemodels, whereas one has been my rolemodel since I started watching CSGO, and he\u00b4s like a mentor to me so... yeaah. hope this answers your question a bit.. Needed to get out some feelings aswell, hope that\u00b4s okay xD", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d29e7w5/"}
