At first I thought \"Crap I survived and my bill is going to be off the roof\". Luckily I had my health insurance to cover 80%.  But I also realized what I had just put my family, friends, and my partner at the time through. I was looking for a quick way out; I didn't want to deal with the pain or consequences that had just recently occurred. Looking back now I realized that wasn't the answer. Even now I sometimes struggle keeping those thoughts from entering my mind or letting them control me. I have so much to live for and now that I am a uncle to my 3 month old nephew I have to keep pushing myself and telling myself that I am worth it. I have people around me who love and support me. It's easier said than done however I have survived and I'll continue to survive. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y75j7/"}
