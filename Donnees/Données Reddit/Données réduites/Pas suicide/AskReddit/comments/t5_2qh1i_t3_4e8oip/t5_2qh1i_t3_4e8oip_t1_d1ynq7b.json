Truly awful. \nYou think you're stupid and you should just get up and do stuff but you just *can't* \nPeople around you don't get it. You can't explain it any better. It's just terrifying. Looking back actually scares me that I was legit There. \nThe thought of being There again makes me sick. \n\nI've had panic attacks frequently in my childhood and I would honestly rather have those than be There again. At least I know how long my attacks last. \nIt took me months to leave that place.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ynq7b/"}
