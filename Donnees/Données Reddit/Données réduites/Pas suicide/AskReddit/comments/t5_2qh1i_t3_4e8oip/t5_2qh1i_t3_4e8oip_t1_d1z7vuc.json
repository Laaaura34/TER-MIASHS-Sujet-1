I tried to get help, but literally no doctor wanted to treat me.\nSo, Injected myself with an entire bottle of insulin, and took a sleeping pill. I started getting the shakes, and I had this nagging thought that I was going to become a vegetable, I saw my niece who was under a year old at the time, and I freaked out and told someone. The ambulance got there really quickly, like under ten minutes. I live in a nice area. \n\nThe next like 2 or 3 days I was in the ICU having my blood sugar tested every half hour or hour or something, and getting injected with sugar and forced to eat sugar. It sucked and my fingers were bruised and squeezed dry by the end of it. There was a nurse there who was really nice to me though, that kindness really meant something to me, like maybe not all of humanity totally sucks. \n\nI think they only took me out of the psych ward because they needed the bed for someone else. \n\nI'm as lost as ever.
