Decided to just sit in the bathroom and swallow as many pills (tylenol) as I could. Did something like 60. Went to bed fully expecting to die (I didn't know too much about how much Tylenol it would take to kill me) I woke up the next morning and felt the lowest I've ever felt. I felt ashamed, disgusting and worthless. But a small part of me was relieved that I didn't die during my sleep. I can't explain why I changed. My family moved and I just got out of it. It's kind of funny actually. One simple action like changing my setting bolted me out of the darkest part of my life to date.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ybphf/"}
