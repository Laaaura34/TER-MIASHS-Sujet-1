But i swore i could get through this on my own. I only attempted once. and that was the moment that i realised that i couldnt do it. I was desperate and not thinking straight and frustrated and angry and i just threw myself headfirst down a set of stairs, blind panicking me thought that would be best. I was lucky to have not broken anything. \n\nI just remember thinking whilst mid air, i hope my brother doesnt find me when i reach the bottom. it would break him to find his older brother heaped up at the bottom of the stairs. to think that his older brother felt no love. \n\n ive come to think now that my depression wasn't driven by me wanting to not be here or not exist. But i just hated myself. i only attempted once and thats because i was just so desperate. I used to cut but only to hurt and scar myself. im just glad that i didnt break my neck that day because, well im still here.
