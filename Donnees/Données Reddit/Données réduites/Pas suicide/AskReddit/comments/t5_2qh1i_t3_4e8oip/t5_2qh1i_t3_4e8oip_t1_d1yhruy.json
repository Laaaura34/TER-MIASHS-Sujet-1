I'm just putting this out there, I'm just going to type it out. I deal with PTSD and depression. At the time, I was dealing with my issues that I had hidden away after coming home from overseas. Going through a divorce, getting close to losing my apartment, so I got drunk as hell. Got into a fight with my then girlfriend. I racked my shotgun with my girl in the room and her daughter in the room next to us and pulled the trigger. The shell was sitting on the floor, but the shotgun hadn't discharged. I was put in handcuffs and had the police surrounding me with weapons drawn. I tried to fight, but gave up. I was loaded into an ambulance and taken to the hospital. The Sergeant walked into my room and said \"You are a lucky son of a bitch,\" and showed me the shell that should have killed me. I spent a week in the psychological ward. The things I saw there were worse than Iraq. I saw people shit themselves and use it like make up. My first thought when the fog cleared was I should have died, and the barrel of that shotgun still looked oddly tasty. Today I am not doing the best, but I want to live. Mental health is no joke, and we need to look at it a lot better. If anyone is interested, I'll reformat and clean this up in the AM, otherwise this is just getting buried in the Reddit pit of comments.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yhruy/"}
