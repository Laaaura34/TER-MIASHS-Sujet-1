I was so ready. It felt like a dream almost where there was this calm chaos. I was just taking pill after pill and knew that this was it, the end. I had completely given up & was drained of any energy.\n\nBut when he stopped me it kindof snapped me back to reality. There was this strange mix of relief and yet despair. I didn't really want to die I just needed the pain to go away.\n\n\nThen I spent the next two days nonstop throwing up... & being in the absolute worst pain of my life. seriously don't try to overdose. :( ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yoaa0/"}
