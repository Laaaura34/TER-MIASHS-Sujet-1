Then again, it's way less annoying than going without the meds.\n\nI also feel better about it when I look at my retired parents who take something like 73 gazillion old people pills at different times throughout the day, when I only take one pill in the morning.\n\nBUT IT'S STILL ANNOYING. And sometimes it just feels good to whine a bit, so thank you for listening!\n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yin8q/"}
