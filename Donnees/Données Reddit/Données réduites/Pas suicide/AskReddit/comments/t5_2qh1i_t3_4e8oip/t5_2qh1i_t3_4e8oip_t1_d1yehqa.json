It was extremely painful and I called 911 myself. Luckily they were able to get everything out of my system with no permanent damage but if I had I waited until the morning, it's likely I would have died from slow liver failure anyway. Shortly after I ended up dating my best friend and now we're married, have 2 beautiful little girls, and one on the way.
