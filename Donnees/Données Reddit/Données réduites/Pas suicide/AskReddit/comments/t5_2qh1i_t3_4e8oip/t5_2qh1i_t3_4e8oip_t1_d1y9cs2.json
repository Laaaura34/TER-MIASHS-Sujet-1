I ended up sitting on the toilet, shitting my brains out because the doctor decided to give me a laxative the night before, and puking thick, black activated charcoal and pills all over myself and on the floor whilst crying in absolute misery and disgust at myself. \n\nthe nurse that came when I pressed the buzzer was very kind and nice and she got me a basin to vomit in to, stripped me naked and wiped me down with a damp towel to clean me up a bit until I could have a proper shower.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9cs2/"}
