You don't pay for it and your parents don't pay for it.  Suicide is essentially theft/destruction of property because you're destroying something (your life)/Stealing something (The investment society made in you) when it doesn't belong to only you.

No.  I think your body is yours, but that's not what the law says in most places.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6nyz/"}
