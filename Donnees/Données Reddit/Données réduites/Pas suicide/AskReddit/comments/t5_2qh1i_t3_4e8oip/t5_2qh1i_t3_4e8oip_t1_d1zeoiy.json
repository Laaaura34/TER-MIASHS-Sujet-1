Its absolutely part of our being, wired in.\n\nI'm into a bit of Nihilism funnily enough, sure nothing matters, BUT we have the time here while we're here to *make* our own purpose and meaning, whether or not it makes any difference in the entirety of the universe.\n\nOne time here, one time to make things right, however one wants to judge that, we have our own morals and things we stand for, even if it has no worth in the end, I don't believe that matters as much, what matters is that *for the time being* it means something.\n\nFor our time here, for us people, we stood for things, morals meant something, doing good was good! So why the hell not give it a go while being here y'know?\n\nThat's how I see it. I don't allow myself to trail off too much into the Nihilist path and consider how it all doesn't matter, thats just a funny thought in the back of my mind at points in my life, but what keeps me going is the crazy lil' belief that half of these things we value in life have value for the time I'm here y'know?\n\nThanks for your thoughts :)", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1zeoiy/"}
