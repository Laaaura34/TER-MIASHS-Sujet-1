I guess I then decided to go outside instead, where I passed out wearing only pants in the February cold.  A roommate happened to come home and called 911.  I woke up in the hospital some hours later and just felt really numb and confused and ashamed.  The cops came to transfer me to a psych hospital.  They cuffed me, hands behind my back, and threw me in the cop car like a criminal.  Luckily, I didn't have to see anyone I knew for a few more hours.  Then my sister came in, and I was just really, really ashamed of myself for trying to kill myself.  She had read my suicide note, which at this point was just an embarrassment.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ydpmh/"}
