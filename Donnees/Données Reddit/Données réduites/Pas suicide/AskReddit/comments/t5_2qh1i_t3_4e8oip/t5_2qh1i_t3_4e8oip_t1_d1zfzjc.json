I'm similar. I could literally lay in bed or on the couch all day. Prior to my attempt I had a week long spell that kept me bed ridden. I only got up to use the restroom and barely ate anything. My mom called a therapist for me then and they put me on anti depressants and Adderall to help give me energy and motivation. To this day even if I'm not depressed I need some sort of stimulant to have energy..whether it be coffee, a pre-workout powder, pills...something...anything. I have found when I am active (as hard as it is to start the process) I do feel better. I workout 6 days a week now as well as yoga and I've found my mind is clear the whole time. \n    \nI'm not suggesting an outside source to help you with motivation and energy, but perhaps a doctor could suggest something that can help. Most likely you'll get a prescription and though I'm against big pharmaceutical pushing their products on everyone, sometimes some of us actually need it and benefit from it. In any case I hope that you can find peace in your life.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1zfzjc/"}
