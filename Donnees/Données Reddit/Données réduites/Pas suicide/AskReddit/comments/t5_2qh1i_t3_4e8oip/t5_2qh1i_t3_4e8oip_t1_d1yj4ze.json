What you need in addition are tools to help you fight the bad thoughts and feelings. I liken it to diabetes.  Yes, insulin is necessary to regulate your blood sugar, but diabetics need to know how to take care of themselves on a day-to-day basis. So many medical doctors want to just say to a depressed person, \"Here, eat these magic beans, and everything will be fine.\" It would probably be a good idea to see a therapist who can help you develop a cognitive therapy to accompany your anti-depressants.  \n\n\nAlso, on a personal note, I took zoloft, too, and it didn't really do me too much good. Last year I started on duloxetine (Cymbalta), and it works much better for me.  There's a generic for it now, and the cost recently reduced so that you can afford it as easily as zoloft.  All of this may depend on your age, though.  People 24 and under don't handle anti-depressants as well as older people.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yj4ze/"}
