Mom died when I was 19, never really felt bad about it (except that it was the day before my brother's birthday.)  She was overall a nasty human being.  My dad never helped the situation any; he wasn't mean or anything, he just wasn't \"there.\"  So now I've reached the point where he is in very poor health and probably won't be around very much longer, and all I feel is just... I don't even know.  I guess I feel guilty for not feeling guilty.  My husband doesn't even speak to his father and he's always up my ass about calling my dad and this and that.  Shut up.  \n\nEdit: I also spent the last half of my teens and first half of my 20's feeling pretty sure I was the hugest waste of oxygen on earth.  I wanted to die, just didn't have the nerve to do.  Everything changed when I found out I was pregnant with my son.  Now he is what keeps me here.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yhhpu/"}
