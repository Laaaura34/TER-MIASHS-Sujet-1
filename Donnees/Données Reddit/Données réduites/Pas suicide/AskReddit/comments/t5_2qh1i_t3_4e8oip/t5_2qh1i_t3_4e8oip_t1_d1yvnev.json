I think that because of your experiences, you may be able to help others get through hard times and relate on a way that can show them that they aren't alone and that things can change. \n\nI do, but right now my energy is far less than zero because of all of this. I have done that kind of thing in the past, and was even a volunteer/EMT on an ambulance crew for years and did 911 dispatching because I liked to be involved with helping people. But right now, it takes every drop of energy I have to get out of bed in the morning and making it through the day.  IF I get through all of this, I'm sure I'd be willing to help others once I'm out the other side myself.
