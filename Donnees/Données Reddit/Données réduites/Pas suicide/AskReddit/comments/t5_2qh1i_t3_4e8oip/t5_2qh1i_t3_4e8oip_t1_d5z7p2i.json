I blacked out and woke up laying next to the street crying with my best friend and a few others standing around me. Immediately after I was so upset that it hadn't worked and that I was still living. Inside the house I went to the bathroom and cut myself all over my arm and fell asleep. The next morning I woke up in the room with my best friend. The first thing I said was. \"I'm glad I'm still alive\" and she said \"me too\" and we hugged.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d5z7p2i/"}
