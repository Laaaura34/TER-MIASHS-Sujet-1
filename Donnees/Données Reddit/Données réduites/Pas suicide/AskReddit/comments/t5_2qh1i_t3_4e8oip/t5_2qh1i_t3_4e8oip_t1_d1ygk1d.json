Like, a lot. Around half of a 90ct bottle of 750mg tablets, which I was taking because I'm also an epileptic. Anyways, my mom found me in the garage after my ex told her he was worried about me. It had already been awhile since I took them, and I told the nurses at the ER that I had taken like, ten instead of the actual forty to sixty pills that were in my system. So they didn't pump my stomach and they took their sweet damn time transferring me to another hospital. Suited me just fine. \n\nLong story short, I spent the entire night throwing up black vomit and like, possibly hallucinating. The nurses tried to carry me to the bathroom to help me throw up, but I didn't make it and I got vomit all over my gown. This was like, three in the morning. A quick blood analysis showed that I was like, dead. Going to die, *definitely*. The doctor was called in from his house, and they asked my mom to come to the hospital.\n\nThe vomit was coming out of my nose. I really thought I was going to do it. I thought I was going to succeed. \n\nI woke up at midnight two days later with a Jamaican nurse sitting in my room. I started crying and she sang to me to calm me down, and held me in her arms. \n\nAll I could think was that I wanted to go home.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ygk1d/"}
