I decided to do a quick test run to make sure the beam would hold before saying my goodbyes to my family. During the test run, I slipped off my chair and actually hung myself. The panic I felt during those few moments I was dangling was all it took to convince myself I should live. I needed desperately to tell my mother I loved her before I went. My father too. I could only think of getting out of it, so I could give them their well deserved goodbyes, and let them know how much I loved them. When I luckily managed to get my footing back on the chair, I realized I wasn't ready to go. I had so much love left in me. I felt like it gave me a second chance to realize I didn't want to go through with it. I'm doing well now. I have two beautiful girls, and a man who would give me the moon. I'm happy I had a botched run, because I'm sure I wouldn't have realized how i really felt if I got to text my final goodbyes. \n\nEDIT: Wow guys. I was really unsure about sharing this, to be completely honest, and nearly deleted it still after posting. This morning I woke up to so much compassion, and so many kind words, I'm awestruck. People are awesome. You guys are awesome. Thank you so much for being the sort of people who give others hope and inspiration. What an amazing community.
