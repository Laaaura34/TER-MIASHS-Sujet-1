I waited until my mom went to walk our dog and drove her car into our garage and left it running. After an amount of time that I don't really know, I fell asleep thinking this was it.\n \nI woke up a little while later, realized I was a dumbass and that I was doing this over a girl, and turned off the car. I opened the garage and looked outside. I felt like shit. \n\nWhen I looked out, the older couple that lived in the house across the road waved at me. I waved back and that's the first clear thought I had during that entire situation and it will stick with me forever. \"How odd is it that someone you've known for twenty years could have just been in enough pain to do something like that seconds earlier, and they wave at you and smile.\" I went back inside, burnt the letters I had written, and went back about my day like nothing had happened. \n\nA year later I had a full breakdown and finally told my parents. I was immediately put in a home. I've been trying to come back from it ever since. I had a thought one day that maybe I did die, maybe this was some weird Jacob's Ladder/Owl Creek thing and all of this is in my mind. After suffering for months over this I said this to a friend of mine and all she said back was \"would it matter if it were?\" \n\nI guess not. But it's still scary to think about.
