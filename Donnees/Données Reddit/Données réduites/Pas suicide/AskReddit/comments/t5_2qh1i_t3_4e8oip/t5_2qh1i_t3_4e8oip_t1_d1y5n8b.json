Suicide and suicidal thoughts, for me, while being slightly chronic, are mostly due to the abusive people in my life. While I'm still numb due to trauma, im not blaming myself anymore. Suicide comes up only when I get overwhelmed about what ive been through and what ive missed out on.\n\nThe numbness will never go away to an extent with my PTSD, but I am doing better than I have been in the past 3 years.
