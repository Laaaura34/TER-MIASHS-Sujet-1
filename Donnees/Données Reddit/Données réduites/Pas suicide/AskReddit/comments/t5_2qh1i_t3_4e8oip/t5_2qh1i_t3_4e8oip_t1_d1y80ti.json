Makes me smile to hear such a creative and eager-to-help thought. \n\nJust accept that your friend may be far to exhausted to even consider the idea, and they may even feel guilty turning you down, but you strike me as the kind of friend to soothe that sentiment very effectively. I had one buddy who always hit me up to do stuff, regardless of how many times I said no. Sometimes I would feel like a loser always saying no, but it meant something to me to know that the invites kept coming. \n\nI think some people need to be dragged out of the house, they need that buddy that says \"hey I'm on my way over, we're getting ice cream\", but I'm not really sure how to handle that. I don't know where the line exists between being forceful (helping them make the decision to do something you KNOW will be healthy) and respecting somebody's space. \nI know that for me that lonliness was the scariest, and that even if I felt like I was dragging others down by being a shut in, it was better than loneliness. Maybe for others self-worth is more difficult. But no matter what, I think it's fair to say that having a friend is always always always a much bigger asset than being alone.\n\nIt can be really really hard to be that friend to somebody. I've been through my own issues, and I still really struggle to know how to be that friend. But no matter what, you're a truly beautiful person for doing your best to help. Most heroes don't wear capes because they don't know how wonderful they really are, and I think I speak for everybody when I say thank you for being a beautiful soul.
