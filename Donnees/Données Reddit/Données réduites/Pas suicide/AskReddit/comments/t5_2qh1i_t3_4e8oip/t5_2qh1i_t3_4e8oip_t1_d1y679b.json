If you need someone, I'm here. If you need to talk right now, let's talk. Getting over the slump was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. It's different for everyone. Therapy works for some, medication for others, pets too. I'm sure there is something for you. You belong somewhere doing something. You might not be there today, and you might not be there tomorrow. Hell, you might not be there for years, but when you finally get there, it's worth every moment of pain. Every lonely moment. Every second of suppression, abuse, all of it. I know if you can stay strong, you'll be happy. My story's unimportant, but if you want to hear it, I'll talk to you about it. We can talk about you too. Or we can talk about ketchup and mustard.
