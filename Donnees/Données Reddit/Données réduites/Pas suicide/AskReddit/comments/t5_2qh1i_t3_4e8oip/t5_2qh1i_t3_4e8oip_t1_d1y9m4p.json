After a psych assessment I was discharged (I think they were pretty overrun - other than getting my stitches done I didn't see a single doctor), my parents picked me up and I spent the whole day wishing I'd succeeded.

However, I don't think I could ever attempt anything like that again, having seen the effect it had on my family.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9m4p/"}
