Its was revolver, there aren't safety features built into it accept where you pull the hammer down half way it will lock keeping the gun from firing (that's where the whole going in half cocked saying comes from) and I knew that I pulled it back all the way.\n\nThe day prior I took it to an outdoor range and did a couple test fires, made sure that it worked. And it did everything it was supposed to do. I loaded 3 rounds just before trying just in case one of the rounds chose to misfire. I wasn't taking my chances.\n\nFate chose to be against my decision I suppose. It wasnt the first time fate had intervened.
