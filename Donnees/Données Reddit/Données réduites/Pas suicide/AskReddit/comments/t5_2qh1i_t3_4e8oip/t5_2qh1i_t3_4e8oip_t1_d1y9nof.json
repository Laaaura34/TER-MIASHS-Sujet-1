If anything, I should be thanking you for opening up that much (and I mean, I did). I'm actually going to PM you now since I have a lot to say that would be more suited in a private conversation, but this much I'll say publicly:\n\nThose big dreams of yours? Same as mine, and let me tell you, the world needs people like us. It needs people like you. Realism is all well and good, but sometimes we don't need realism - we need people to remind us of what the world *should* be. Not what we *could* be, we've got plenty of people working towards that. \n\nPeople like us, though, we keep the bar high. We look at the world and shake our heads and say it isn't enough, that we can do better for each other and for the world. Sometimes we need that little reminder. Your dreams are beautiful and awesome and I just want to send you a great big hug through the internet.\n\nSince I can't do that I'm just hugging my computer monitor. So hah! Screw you, space! I can totally hug people through the internet.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9nof/"}
