You are simply speaking from a place that has the fortune to not having to deal with suicidal depression to this degree.\n\nShaming people who want to commit suicide by calling them selfish, it's the same thing and has been said by equally ignorant people a thousand times before. My life is my own. I don't owe anyone a lifetime of mental torment just because I might make them feel bad for some time. Asking me to stay alive just because you don't want me to burst your bubble is way more selfish than taking your own life because you can't deal with the constant pain anymore.\n\n\nCool. You've been through hardship and haven't had that feeling. You're not emotionally disposed to feeling that. That's not the problem that suicdal people have, though. Everything could be going right in my life and I could still feel suicidal. It's not just this image of a person who kills themselves over losing their job, their wife or anything.\n\nFYI I've been on both sides of this coin. I am suicidal myself and I have lost people to suicide.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ycjac/"}
