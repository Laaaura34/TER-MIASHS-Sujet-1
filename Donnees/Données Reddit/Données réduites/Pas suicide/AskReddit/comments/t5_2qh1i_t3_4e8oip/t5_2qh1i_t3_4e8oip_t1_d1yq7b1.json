As someone who also has a disability and was teased relentlessly for it as a child, I feel the pain.  Not sure your age right now.  I am 34 and have learned that kids bully other kids for anything real or not.  I used my disability to become an over achiever.  I obtained my bachelor's degree at 20 and master's at 24.  I ended up finding a wonderful man who sees me for the person I am, not my disability.  He is seriously handsome.  Because of my disability I never would have thought he would give me a second look.  I chose to do my best in all I do because I realize there are so many people who come in to the world fully abled and throw it all away and appreciate none of it.   5 years ago I had surgery that changed my life.  Although I am still half blind, no one can tell just by looking at me.   I have 3 kids and I make sure  to tell them they are beautiful just how they are every day because I know kids are soo mean and will try to find something about them to make them feel bad about themselves.  I am so glad you survived and changed your outlook..  In life, it doesn't really matter what anyone else thinks about you.  It is all about what you think about yourself.  Most of the people who teased me have far less happy lives than me.  I don't have anything negative to say about them as it was in the past and they are the ones who can live with the knowledge of what they chose to do to another human.  I will smile and enjoy my beautiful life and I really hope you do to.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yq7b1/"}
