My first thought was something along the lines of: \"I can't believe this. This can't be real.\" Everything seemed off and a bit distorted and I knew that my last thought before I blacked out was that I was dying and nothing was going to stop it. I felt awful in a physical sense, but relieved that I was still here.\n\nMy dad thought that I was just really, really sick (which, technically, I was), so he hadn't bothered me about going to school that day and put a blanket on me at some point. When I told him about the full situation years later, he did lots of research on depression, helped me get appointments with therapists and psychiatrists, and has been there for me overall.\n\nTo this day, when I reach a particularly low state of mind, I think of my dad and all his support, and it gives me enough strength to push through to the end of the day. I try to stay alive for myself most of all, but if I'm honest, my father is one of the main reasons why I live.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9x2g/"}
