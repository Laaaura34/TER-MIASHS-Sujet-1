Of course they aren't always at fault. It's not really a system where you say it is anybody's fault, but rather that they aren't enough to make up for the lack of whatever that is causing the behavior.\n\nIf you have a kid and he plays outside and gets hit by a car is that your fault? I mean you let him play outside. I would say that it isn't, at least not unless there are very specific circumstances that would make it much more likely for it to happen there than normally. But you could've done more to prevent it. That's what I mean that it isn't anybody's fault really but the people could still do better beforehand. There shouldn't be a near miss of your kid getting hit by the car before you start paying attention.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yw07g/"}
