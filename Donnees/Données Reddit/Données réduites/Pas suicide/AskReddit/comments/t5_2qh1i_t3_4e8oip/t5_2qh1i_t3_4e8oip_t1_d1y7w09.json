Right as I blacked out, I heard screaming. My roommate had walked in I guess. We were in a behavioral ward and so we were fucked up anyways but it really really messed with her. It sent her into a meltdown, which is understandable when you walk in to see your roomie hanging from her sandal straps.\n\nWhen I got resuscitated or whatever, she was the first thing I thought of.  \n\nThat was my 2nd attempt before I was 16. I didn't stop trying until I was around 20... But I'm really happy I was in a place that saved me. I had tied myself and moved the bed so there really was no backing out.If they hadn't cut me down, I wouldn't be here. Which I guess I wouldn't mind. I'm apathetic towards death still. \n\nAnd at 24, i love my life. I never thought I would. I still think About it sometimes. I'm bipolar so... Nothing's ever super easy. But..
