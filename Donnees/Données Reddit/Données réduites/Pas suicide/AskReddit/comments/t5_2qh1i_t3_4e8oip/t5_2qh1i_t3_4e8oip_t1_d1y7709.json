Heart was racing so bad that I damn near died of a heart attack... A few hours later, after calming down, I checked the shotgun, cocked the slide again and a shell came out... Turns out, the shell was a repacked/reload and it failed to fire... My first thought after that was \"Holy shit... I literally just fucking failed at something that was SO simple...\" I then proceded to cry for a few hours. Got a phone call from a friends mom that I had not seen in years (the friend and his mom were very near and dear to my heart) and she asked me to pass it down the line that he had shot himself and ended his life and he had left in his suicide note that I was to be contacted... I literally had no words...\nI feel so fucking horrible that he and I attempted suicide on the same night at about the same time and I am the one who came out of it unscathed... Not sure if I should feel bad for him or for myself... Still to this day, at times I feel as though I should be dead and he should still be alive... he had 2 kids and he was a wonderful father where as I myself had/still have no kids and I am a waste of space... :(", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7709/"}
