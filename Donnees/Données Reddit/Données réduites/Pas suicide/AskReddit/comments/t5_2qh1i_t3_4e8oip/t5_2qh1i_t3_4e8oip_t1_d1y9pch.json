I fell from a second story balcony once (not a suicide attempt, I was just an idiot), I first landed on the fire escape railing about 5 feet above the ground, bounced off that and then landed on the pavement. I was badly injured and in pain for months afterwards. Could have easily died if I had landed on my head or neck.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9pch/"}
