I've had several but this was the worst of them. \n\nI remember being absolutely dead inside. I wished it had worked but at the same time I just wanted to be home in my bed. I just wanted the results of my actions and decision to disappear. \n\nIt took about 12-14 hours before the actual effects of the medications I took wore off and I could even think. \n\nI'll never forget that night. It was like everything I wanted to do I'd try to do, then forget, and then try again. It was like I was weaving in and out of consciousness every couple of seconds. I couldn't think. I wasn't scared because I couldn't hold onto what was going on long enough to be scared.\n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8z3u/"}
