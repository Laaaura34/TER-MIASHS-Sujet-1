I didn't commit suicide intentionally but I sure overdosed when I was a teenager.  It was actually really serious, I was in the hospital for two weeks and they couldn't tell me if I was going to live.  But all I could think was HOW DARE THEY CALL MY PARENTS. It's pretty laughable now.  I'm glad they did now though, my mom protected me from a very bad medical mistake that would have ended up with me not being here today. \n\nAnd yes I'm fine now.  This was 12-13 years ago.\nEDIT: To clarify, I was 17 or 18 (not sure) and not living at home, so it was not a situation where they had no choice to contact my family.  It WAS the right thing to do, but I sure didn't feel that way at the time.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ybyur/"}
