I felt, or even *knew*, that things would never get better.  This was my life and I hated it and saw no avenues for it to improve.\n\nThankfully somebody in my life got me to *at least try* some counseling, which led to also trying medication.  It took about 6 months to find a medication combo that worked well for me (prozac and wellbutrin, but what works is different for everybody), but that, coupled with some regular visits to a really nice psychologist who helped me talk through things, very literally changed my life.\n\nI started feeling better and better, to the point where I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop, where I'd plunge back into that same dark hopeless place I'd been, but it didn't happen.  After a few years of feeling really good, I tapered off the drugs to make sure I still felt good, and I did!\n\nDepression and anxiety aren't your fault.  They're chemical imbalances in the brain.  Something to be fixed.  If you're diagnosed with appendicitis, you don't say \"Well, that's unfortunate, I better try to have a more positive attitude.\"  You fix it.  This stuff isn't any different.\n\nSo I dunno if it helps at all to hear someone else's experience, but I felt like things would never get better.  I felt like it was hopeless and stopped caring about my life, but thanks to someone convincing me to seek some professional help, I'm happy again.  It's not forever and you can do this, friend.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ycdg3/"}
