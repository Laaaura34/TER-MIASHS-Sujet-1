I've felt this way for most of my life. I'm 27-years-old and have struggled with severe mental illness (including depression, anxiety, panic attacks, A.D.D., P.T.S.D., Asperger's syndrome, and addiction) for as long as I can remember. I honestly don't remember a time when I was ever truly happy. I have zero friends and only leave my house for occasional doctor appointments. Since I was about 10-years-old, I've been on every psych med, tried every kind of therapy/treatment, seen more doctors, psychiatrists and therapists than I can count, and nothing has ever helped. I used a lot of drugs growing up to temporarily numb the pain and ended up getting addicted to opiates/heroin. I've been clean for almost 2 years, and the depression and anxiety is worse than ever. I feel so much guilt for basically ruining my parents' lives and having them still somewhat support me. I can't finish college or get even a basic job due to being arrested for drug possession and I have to wait something like 10 years to even begin the expungement process (which I probably won't be able to afford.) Sometimes I do want to end it all but I would never do that because I know it would hurt my family. If you want to talk with someone that understands you, I'm always here.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yjieq/"}
