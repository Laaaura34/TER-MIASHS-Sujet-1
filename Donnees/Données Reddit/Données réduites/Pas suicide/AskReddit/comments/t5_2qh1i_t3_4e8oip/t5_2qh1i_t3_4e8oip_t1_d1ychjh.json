I was furious with her right up until I saw her face when I was in the hospital. Out of everyone there she was the only person who's face I remember. I felt like an asshole, how could I do that to my little sister; just leave her alone without a brother to look after her. \n\nThe next time I thought about suicide was when that very same sister was pregnant. I went to the hospital to see my niece who was only 8 hours old and just holding that little girl made me want to live. It's been two and a half years and I no longer let myself get into those dark places. I have people that care about me unconditionally, and it helps that my niece always runs to me before my sister.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ychjh/"}
