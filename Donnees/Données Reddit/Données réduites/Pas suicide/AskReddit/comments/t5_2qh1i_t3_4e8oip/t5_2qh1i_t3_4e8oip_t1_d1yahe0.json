I jumped off the bench and then felt the belt tighten, then it fucking snapped and I fell onto my knees. My first thought was \" if i wasn't so fucking fat I would be dead now\". Went inside and just laid in bed watching the event over and over in my head.\n\nKinda annoyed at myself for failing. My only regret is that I didn't use a proper rope", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yahe0/"}
