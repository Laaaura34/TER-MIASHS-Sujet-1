You can't save her from all of it, but you can stabilize the house until you're ready to talk to her about it. \n\nAlso, I suggest one a month \"date\" nights with your wife. Even if it's just a walk around the block to talk about the week. Nothing heavy and no relationship talks about this stuff, just basic communication to privately connect. It's not a quick fix, but over time it could really help you two re-learn each other. You have to re-learn how to be comfortable.
