She got me down but really didnt say a lot. To this day she is the only person who knows this about me.  I did get help. It took about 4 years of trying different things, but I got my bp1 under control.  Im now living medication free which is nice.\n\nWhats scary is my partner keeps talking about suicide and I just don't think I can cope. It just keeps triggering all the bad memories and he says theres nothing good in his life anymore (including me, which cuts me right through). even worse, I have no idea how to help him. Leaving isn't really an option.  I dont want to turn my back when the person I love is unwell.ental heakth funding cuts mean they dont take it seriously until there been an attempt. He doesn't believe in medication or therapy. It sucks. Whenever he talks about suicide I just cry because I dont know what to do to help him.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1z3yb0/"}
