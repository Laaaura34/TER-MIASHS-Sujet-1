Throaway because almost nobody knows this. Even my closet friends who I consider family. \n\nI've tried to kill myself twice, and I've come very close 2 other times. The coming close incidents I found myself feeling much worse than normal, which was still pretty badly. One of them I attempted to give myself alcohol posioning, and simply didn't drink enough. The second, I almost ingested about 9000 mgs of amphrtamine pills at a friends wedding. I didn't because I didn't want to ruin their day. \n\nAnyway, the main time, I almost shot myself. My girlfriend at the time and our friend left the house to get everybody food, and I was left alone in the house with a loaded gun for about 40 minutes. I realized immediately the situation and in my head I thought \"it's time, today's the day\". I held it and cried for a brief time and sat there with it to my head almost the whole time they are gone. I've seen multiple posts of people saying they thought of their parents, friends, and such...and honestly I didn't. I just wanted the pain to stop. \n\nAs I was working up the nerve they came back and I put the gun down and acted like everything was fine. I didn't do it that day because I bitched out. \n\nI think of that often, though. The fact that I could have had I spent a little less time thinking. However, life has improved as well so on an average day I'm happy I didn't. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y927i/"}
