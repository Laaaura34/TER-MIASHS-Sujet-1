When I pulled the trigger I heard the click. Then I realized that I heard the fucking click. I wasn't laying in a pool of my own blood at my desk but I was fully awake and aware that I heard the sound of the hammer hitting the round.\n\nI sat there for a minute with the gun to my head before lowering it and pulling the cylinder. I checked the bullet and the rim was dented. The hammer had made contact but it didn't fire. It was in that moment I thought \"Have I cheated Death or did Death cheat me?\"\n\nI've had a much different outlook since then. I realized I was mortal, I should have been dead but somehow I made it out alive. From then on I lived a little more. Anything from that point forward was a bonus on the life I was going to have. I bought a motorcycle, I left my controlling girlfriend. I went to the strip club and blew $1500 in a night. I've lived. I've lived more in the 3 years since than I did in the 24 years prior.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6nlc/"}
