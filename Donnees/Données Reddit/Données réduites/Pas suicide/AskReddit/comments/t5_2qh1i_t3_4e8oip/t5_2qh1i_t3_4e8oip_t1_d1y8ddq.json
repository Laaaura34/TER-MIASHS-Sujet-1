I couldn't find a reason to go on anymore. I took the remainder of my previous antidepressants (citalopram) and put all of it in a cup of tea. Never had I drunk something so disgusting. I threw up a bit but drank all of the suicide cocktail. \nI felt at peace and became very, very sleepy. \nWhen I went to lie down on my bed I passed our immediately. I woke up the next day and it was a pretty fucking good day. The stupid thing is that it was an ordinary day, there was nothing special about it. For some reason I was happy again.\n\nThat's it. Next month is going to be the one-year anniversary.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8ddq/"}
