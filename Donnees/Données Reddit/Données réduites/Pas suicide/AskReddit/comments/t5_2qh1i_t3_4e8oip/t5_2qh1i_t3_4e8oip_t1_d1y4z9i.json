I knew as I was drawing up the shot that it was going to be a big one, but it either didn't click in my head, or I just didn't care it was most likely going to kill me.\n\n\nI pulled the needle out of my arm, said \"oh fuck\" and that was it. I woke up to my friends surrounding me, but I didn't fully regain consciousness til about an hour later. The first thought I remember was \"I'm so glad I'm back\" followed by \"I can't do this anymore.\"\n\n\nThat was my last shot of heroin (9 months ago) and my life has since been fucking great. I'm so grateful for my friends who knew CPR and we're able to bring me back. I can't ever imagine leaving my family behind, and the fact I almost did makes me want to slap myself", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y4z9i/"}
