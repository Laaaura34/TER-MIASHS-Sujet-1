There are people who will be hurt. Your existence matters. When we were 14 years old my friend hung himself in his garage with a bike chain. There were rumors, the worst was that he changed his mind halfway through but it was too late. Those were the worst. I can only hope he had changed his mind halfway through and wish it hadn't been too late do do anything about it. But at he same time the thought of he changing his mind but it being too late to turn back is too much for me to bear. It's been 7 years and I still have never forgotten, aqaintances of his have never forgotten. At graduation there was a hole an empty seat in the W section where he should have been. I think about how I'm here walking around living and breathing and he is under six feet of dirt. Never went to prom. Never felt first love heart break. All the things he should have done with us he never got to do. Our town still mourns him. We will never forget. Do not end your life. The hole in the fabric of the world will be immense no matter how insignificant you feel at the time.
