I laid there for almost a whole two hours before I heard screaming and banging on my door.  Its almost as if I was concentrating so hard on dying after drinking all the Nyquil and taking all the Tylenol that I just went numb and couldnt hear anything other than my thoughts; I couldnt hear my mom banging on my door to my bedroom and screaming at me to open the door.  I took amost two hours, or felt like that, until I came back to consciousness, got up and opened the door. That was aslmost 7 years ago.\n\nNow im 20 years old and have been struggling pretty hardcore with depression and anxiety for a good 8 years.  At first I thought I was just a shy kid who didnt want to do much other than play K'nex by myself and listen to music that made me sad, I just thought that was just who I was. That turned into staying home from school because I didnt think I was good enough to go to a 20K per year school, or participate in sports because I wasnt good enough, or even be with my family because I thought I was a burden.  It slowly got worse and I tried to end everything 5 more times after that, for a total of 6 attempted suicides before the age of 21.\n\nI know this comment entry skipped around a lot and may have seemed incomplete, but writing this is pretty hard to do, as Im sure everyone else who commented felt also.\n\nLife is beautiful and worth living; there are people who love you for you. \n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yfn5z/"}
