I'm sure that your comment is helping others in a similar situation. I don't  have depression myself but I know a friend who does. I'm the type of person who cares more for others than myself and seeing my friend go through this tears me apart. Is there any advice you can give on what we can do to help people in these situations? \n\nSorry in advance if this was already asked.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yec1j/"}
