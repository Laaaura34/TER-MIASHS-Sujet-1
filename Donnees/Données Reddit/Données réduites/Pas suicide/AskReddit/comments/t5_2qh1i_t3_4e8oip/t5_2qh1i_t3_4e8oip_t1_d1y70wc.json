What you've just said really means a lot to me. It's been several years now since I've heard something remotely close to what you've said, (given the fact that I have no close friends anymore), but hearing that from you just has me tearing up like a big old softie... but in a good way! I'd hug you if it were possible! Seriously, thank you for the kind words :')", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y70wc/"}
