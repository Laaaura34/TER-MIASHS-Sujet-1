I thought pills would be a more gentle / clean way to go than hanging myself or cutting my wrists.\n\nWhile my ears were ringing and the mostly-full bottle of Excedrin was causing my stomach contents to expel themselves out from both ends, I thought \"this. This is how things could be worse\".\n\nWhen I woke up next, with my mom having taken care of me with the stomach virus she thought I had, I can't put into words exactly what I thought. It was a combination of guilt that my mom cared, depression that I couldn't even do this right, and a resolve that I would never do this again. Things can always get worse, which  means that there's something to be thankful for. And just as quickly as things can get worse, they can also get better.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y53uu/"}
