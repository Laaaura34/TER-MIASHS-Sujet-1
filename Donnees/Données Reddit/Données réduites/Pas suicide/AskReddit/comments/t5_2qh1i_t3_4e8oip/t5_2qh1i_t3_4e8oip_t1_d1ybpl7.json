I was 15. I took a handful of Benadryl. I started falling asleep and thought, 'This isn't so bad.'\n\n\nWhen I woke up, I was dizzy and I had a hard time focusing. Part of me was relieved that I'd woken up, but another part was sad that I'd still have to deal with my life. I can't remember the context, but my parents told me that if someone told a therapist that they had suicidal thoughts, their life would basically be over, it would be on every personal record for the rest of their life. It really scared me from getting any kind of professional help. Home life didn't get better, I just learned to manage my emotions so I wouldn't be driven that far again (mostly getting out more).\n\n\nI've only told two people I did this, both were SOs. The first one told me during an argument, \"Maybe my life would have been better if you tried again.\" The second one is really protective of me and keeps a close watch of any kind of pharmaceuticals I get, I can understand.\n\n\nMy life is much better now, though there are still times when I can feel the tingle to do it again. I worry some times how easily that part of me gets triggered, but the thought passes quickly. Usually I think of all the things I still want to do, sometimes it's as simple as wanting to have dinner with my SO that night, and the bad thoughts go away.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ybpl7/"}
