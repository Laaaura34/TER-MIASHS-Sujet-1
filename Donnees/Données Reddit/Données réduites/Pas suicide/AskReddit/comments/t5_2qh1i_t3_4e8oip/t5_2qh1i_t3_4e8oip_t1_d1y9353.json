There wasn't supposed to be a what next. \n\n/I have MS, and for a long time had spasms that were... beyond violent. Put holes in plaster and drywall kind of violent. Broken foot in the middle of the night because I kicked the shit out of the wall violent. Diazepam, in sufficient quantity, stopped the spasms... but I greatly disliked how \"out of it\" it made me feel... so I decided one day to stop taking it. I don't remember much of the next day or two, but apparently I tried to OD.\n\nThe worst part was, until 3 days later, when they finally had managed to get in touch with my b/f and my doctors office, they withheld all of my MS drugs. Shit was out of control bad, and they were convinced I was just withdrawing from something... nobody believed that I could have MS... I mean, I guess to them it seemed totally impossible that someone could both have MS and be depressed.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9353/"}
