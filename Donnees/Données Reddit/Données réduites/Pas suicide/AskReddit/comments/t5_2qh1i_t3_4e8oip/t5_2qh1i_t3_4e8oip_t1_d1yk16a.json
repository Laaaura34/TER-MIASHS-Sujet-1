I confronted my ndad recently. He kept trying to defend himself with all the good things he's done for me. Or about how I can't fault him for xyz thing he's done because he didn't know and then tried to blame it on me or my emom. But he could not figure out that the problem wasn't what he'd done, but the fact that he could not accept the fact he'd done a wrongdoing or even simply the fact that someone he doesn't think was bad could be considered bad by the person it effected. When you cannot accept responsibility is when it becomes a problem. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yk16a/"}
