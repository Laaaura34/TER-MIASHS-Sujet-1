I woke up as normal thinking nothing had happened and was getting ready for work and my Mum somehow got it out of me that something was up. I confessed to what I'd done and said I felt fine so I was expecting to just carry on the day as normal.\n\nIF YOU TAKE AN OVERDOSE AND WAKE UP FEELING 'FINE' - YOU'RE NOT. GO TO THE HOSPITAL.\n\nParacetamol in particular will take a long time to kill you and it is a painful death as your organs shut down. \n\nIt was to late for me to have my stomach pumped so I spent 2 days in hospital on a drop. I was 17 and had to be on a childrens ward, it was horrible.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ycb91/"}
