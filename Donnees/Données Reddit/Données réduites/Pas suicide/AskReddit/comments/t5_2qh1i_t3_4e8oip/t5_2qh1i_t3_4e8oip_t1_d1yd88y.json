Of course a suicide survivor is going to say that they are thankful for others stopping and helping them, but we don't really know the actual numbers. Some might be faking it or hiding it better now that they are constantly being watched. And others might attempt it again and are just going to stay locked down.\n\nI just find it odd how people think you're being a bad person for doing it and then treating you with kiddy gloves from then on. I mean, the people close to you weren't helpful before so why should you take into account what they want. If they're supposedly so close they should be able to pick something up so it doesn't even happen in the first place. It's just not something that falls on one closest person but essentially all of them.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yd88y/"}
