You must have been going through something extremely awful. How are you doing now? I hope you're ok. \n\nI just commented on the same post as you and saw your comment. Here's what I wrote: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d7ok8ql\n\nAs you can see, I've been suicidal, too. I am so glad that my attempts failed because things can change so much and in unexpected ways. It's likely that things will get better for you, too. Most people who were suicidal at a point in their life who survive it end up feeling grateful that they never went through with it. Right now things are hard and painful, and if you can't find a way to make things better for the present, then keep your mind in the future and the possibilities it offers.
