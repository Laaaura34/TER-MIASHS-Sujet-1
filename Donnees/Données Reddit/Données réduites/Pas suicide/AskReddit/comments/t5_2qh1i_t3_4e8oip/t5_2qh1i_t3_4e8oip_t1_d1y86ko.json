I woke up on my floor surrounded by empty sleeping pill packs, bloody paper towels, and a empty bag of green onion SunChips, mostly spilled, my chosen last meal. Suprisingly, I didn't throw up or anything. My friend was banging on my bedroom door. He had no idea, he thought I was just being lazy, and he wanted to go swimming at a local waterfall. I cleared my mind to help hide from the reality of what I'd done. I felt like I was watching a black and white movie of the day, like I was actually dead and I was seeing what I missed out on. I was really disappointed when I eventually figured out I was still alive. This is the 3rd time I've even brought it up. I regret not dying. I still think about trying again sometimes. I'll try a different brand of pills. Or maybe I'll just shoot myself and save the guesswork.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y86ko/"}
