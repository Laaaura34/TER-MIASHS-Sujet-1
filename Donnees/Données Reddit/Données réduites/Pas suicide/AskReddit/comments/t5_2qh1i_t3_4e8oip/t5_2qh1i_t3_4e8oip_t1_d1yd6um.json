Didn't bother googling anything, just grabbed my antidepressants (just zoloft at the time, thank god) and downed the whole bottle. Talked for a little bit in a skype chat room with my friends, then passed out. Woke up, took a shower, and the minute I got to school people were freaking out, saying \"god, AUserNamedWaffle, why would you ever try to kill yourself?\" without realizing that they were a serious contributing factor. \n\n\nCouple months later I tried hanging myself with the cord of my computer mouse. Right before jumping I realized that my ceiling fan probably couldn't support my weight, and that I'd likely survive and end up with a horribly mutilated mouse. $65 saved my life.
