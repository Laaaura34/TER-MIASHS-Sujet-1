Therapy, many different types of anti-depressants, nothing has helped.\n\n\nYou aren't alone on this one. Another hard thing is that the goalposts always move -I remember a few years ago thinking, \"I really should work out, thats supposed to be good for the brain and might help\", and after a bunch of failures (vigorous attempt, doubting, crashing, giving up, self loathing), I finally landed on a regular schedule of working out. But I made it maybe 2 weeks before I felt worse than ever. I was hoping I had found the silver bullet to kill depression, but it was just a scratch that I could never itch. And nothing I could do was enough. \n\n\nSo yeah, there isn't a magic cure, even the folks who have made big progress with depression will tell you their depression is still there, its just quieter. Posts like the one above mean so well, but you really can't know what depression is like if you've never experienced it.
