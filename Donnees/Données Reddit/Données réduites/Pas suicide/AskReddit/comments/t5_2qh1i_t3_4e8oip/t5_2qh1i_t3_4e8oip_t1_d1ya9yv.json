This is true. The majority of people will likely never know your name. This is also true.\n\nBut this isn't a scale with which to weigh someone's value.\n\nWhen you find a partner who loves you, you are the one who matters to them. You are one of one.\n\nWhen you have a best friend who cares about you dearly, you are one of maybe a couple people who mean as much to that person as you do.\n\nWhen you do something kind for a stranger, for a short time, you are a light in their life.\n\nA person doesn't have to be known by all to have value. They just need to be a light in the darkness of the lives of those around them. No matter how brief, a kindness you do to others makes you important.\n\nLastly, never forget that while you may be one of many human beings, you will only ever be you. There is only one of you, and what you choose to do with the life you have is important, because you will only get to live one life. Don't worry about being famous, or rich. Just live a life that you are proud of.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ya9yv/"}
