There is no quick fix. Hell, there is no difficult fix. The chemical game is extremely imprecise- you are hoping that the negative side effects of whatever anti-depressant you are taking will be outweighed by some semblance of normalcy.\n\nYou hope that changes in your environment, changes in your habit can make the burden smaller. \n\nBut I have learned that it is always there. No matter what chemical, what change in habit, you can't escape it. \n\n\nThis is why it can be just a bit patronizing. Because it isn't like some kind of illness which is healed with the right antidote. Its like a monster you can't escape. You can stuff towels in its mouth, put a towel over it, repaint your room, hope that you get more comfortable. But there is a fear; you're just a small earthquake away from that monster throwing the sheet aside and stepping back into the light.
