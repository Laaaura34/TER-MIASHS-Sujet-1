My surroundings have changed (mainly being back in my hometown). \n\nThe thing that led me to do that was (yes a girl). We started dating our junior year in high school, fast forward 7 years down the road and she was my fiance. The thing that triggered it was when I came home from college one weekend to visit/see her and actually caught her in bed with another guy. That single event is what changed my life the most. Every facet of my live changed, the things I did right when I got up from bed, things I did during the day, people I surrounded myself with, things I did before I went to bed, or things on the weekends, those all changed in an instance and I did not know how to cope with it and move on with my life.
