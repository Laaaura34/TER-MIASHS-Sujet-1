Whether it be assholes yelling at us, spitting at us, or treating us like their personal servants. People dont respect us like they do the police.\n\nSometimes we get dickheads like that right before calls we actually care about, its hard to take mental abuse for hours of the day and be nice to people immediately after.\n\nSome of the nasty medics are guys who have been in the bad areas for far too long. It shouldn't happen but it does, we are all human.\n\nedit: i wanted to add, most of the time its people treating us like we dont know what we are talking about, or being overly pissy about small things like pillow fluffiness and thinking its our fault.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yl7ww/"}
