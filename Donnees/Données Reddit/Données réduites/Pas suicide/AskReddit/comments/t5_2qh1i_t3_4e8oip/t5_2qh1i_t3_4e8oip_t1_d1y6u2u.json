After my first attempt. when i came to myself my first thought was \"how did i fucking fail at kiling myself?\" and that's what kept bothering me for along time. i had a second attempt, and my first thought when i came to myself was \"how the fuck did you fail again?\"\nbut unlike the first time, after the second attempt i somehow changed. i started appreciating things alot more and i don't get angry at alot of things. i have the general mindset that life is to short to be pissed about stupid things (unless you loose in something like monopoly or a video game. then, i reak havoc.)\nso i am actually somewhat thankfull that i tried a second time. if i didn't, i most likely would've still been depressed today.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6u2u/"}
