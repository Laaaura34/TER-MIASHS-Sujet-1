After battling depression for 6 years, it and alcohol fueled my night into a zone that was the perfect mixture for me to do it. 60 mph into a concrete devision.

The only decision that we can not control is death. \"What about when people successfully kill themselves?\" They may have planned it, but when the decision came the maker allowed it. That's what I learned anyway. Still learning. \n- High school senior", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8erp/"}
