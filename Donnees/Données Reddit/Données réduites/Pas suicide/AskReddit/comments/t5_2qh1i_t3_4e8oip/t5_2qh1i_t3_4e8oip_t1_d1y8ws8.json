Two years ago. It was right after thanksgiving dinner with my family(I had been feeling like shit for weeks and holidays are always worse) and we got home around 7ish, sisters and mom left for shopping a half hour later, so a couple minutes after they had left I grabbed my meds(I was taking 5 different pills and if I remember correctly I was consuming about 1050-1075mg of meds a day) and I poured a few into my hand(the largest was 500mg and the smallest was like.. 15mg I think) and I downed them. I woke up around 1am and my first thought was \"god damnit.. better clean this mess up before they get home.\" Forty minutes later they were home and not a single one knew what happened, they still don't.\nThat wasn't my first attempt, my first was in 4th grade when I thought it was possible to choke myself to death", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8ws8/"}
