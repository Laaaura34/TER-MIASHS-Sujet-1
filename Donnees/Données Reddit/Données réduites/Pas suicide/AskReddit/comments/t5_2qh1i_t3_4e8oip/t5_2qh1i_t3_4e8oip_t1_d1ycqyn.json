Two months ago, I confessed to my best-friend since middle school, that I was depressed. I have never had another friend I was that close to so telling her all my thoughts and feelings was a big deal to me. \n\nAfter the conversation, I've barely heard anything from her. She occasionally Snapchat's me or tags me on a Facebook post but that's it. I really just don't know what to do anymore, she was the only person I could confide my feelings to.
