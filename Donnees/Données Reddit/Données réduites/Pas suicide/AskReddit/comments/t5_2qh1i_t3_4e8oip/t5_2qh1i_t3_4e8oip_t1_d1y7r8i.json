Good things could be happening but I'd have the continuing thought of \"what's the point\". \n\nSometimes another person pulls you out or you find a way to change where you're at and those feelings go down for awhile or force you to work through some challenges that take your mind off it. Most of the time it just feels like the depression has taken so much of my life that I'll never recover or amount to anything, so it spirals into wanting a release. \n\nBut when I come out of it and find a really good, fulfilling place in my life it feels amazing, it feels like I'm finally seeing the world how everybody else gets to see it for once. And those moments make knowing I'll have the lows again worth it to push on, hoping that maybe next time it will last long enough to put me in a better place.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7r8i/"}
