This one sits with me a little bit. I'm not a diabetic but I am a bodybuilder and insulin abuse is very real in my industry. I've used it before and I can only imagine the immediate \"oh fuck\" feeling after using 60 units of fast acting. I'll use 10 pre workout and it's a must that I down a lot of carbs during my workout. \n\nI've never found myself suicidal but have thought that insulin is an easy way to do it. Give you can get some form of it without a prescription in most states also makes it accessible. That really scares me. \n\nI really hope you're doing better. I'm a reddit stranger but if you need to talk I'm here.\n\nEdit: Keep a big bag of sugar in the house, even as a precaution for regular diabetic injections, so that you can dissolve it in water and drink quickly in the case of emergency.
