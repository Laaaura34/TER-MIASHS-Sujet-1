He left bruises on my arm when he led me out to the ambulance. I could see all my neighbors outside to see what was going on. My second coherent thought was absolute shame and humiliation. But I also didn't care much because I was still really groggy and really high on the pills I'd taken. Was hoping it'd still work in the ambulance but didn't figure that was likely. Turns out what I'd taken wasn't easy to OD on and they kept me fairly alert on the trip. No stomach pumping just charcoal. Worst thing I've ever had to drink and it left my stomach fucked up for days. Relief wasn't something I felt. My dad of course told everyone what I'd done. So I had to live all that humiliation and shame again after I got out of the psych ward. Living after attempted suicide isn't as bad as the moments leading up to it but it's pretty fucking close.
