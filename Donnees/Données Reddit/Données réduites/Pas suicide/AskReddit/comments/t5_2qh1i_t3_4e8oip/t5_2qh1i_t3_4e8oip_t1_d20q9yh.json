What if I had been nicer? What if I had just picked up the phone? What if I had seen they needed help? Why didn't they ask for help? Why didn't I call more?\n\nAnd that's not to mention the stigma that suicide and mental illness has had in our society for a very long time, and which is only now starting to ease some (but not entirely yet). Many folks still get uncomfortable talking about suicide.\n\nTrust me, with some perspective, you can deal with depression and suicidal thoughts, and the worst parts WILL ease at some point. Life CAN be dealt with, and even enjoyed after a time. But suicide can never be taken back, and loved ones can never be replaced. You may not have lost someone in this manner before, but trust me.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d20q9yh/"}
