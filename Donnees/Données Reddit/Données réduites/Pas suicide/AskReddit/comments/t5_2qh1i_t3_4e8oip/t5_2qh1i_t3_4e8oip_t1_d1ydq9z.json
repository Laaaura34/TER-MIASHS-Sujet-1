This post made me hold tears like a sieve holds water. I am a survivor of extreme depression, I rarely admit it, this post just describes everything exactly. I'm glad to hear you're in a better mindset now. I completely agree with your statement about survivors being laid-back and humble (I think they were your words, I'm on mobile so...). I am thankful for everything everyday, I'm even thankful when I stub my toe. This may seem stupid, but when you've been in a place where you don't want anything and can lose everything, and don't value yourself, when you pull through, it changes. I am thankful I've a table, to stub my toe on, a cat, a family. Even if I am single and have been hurt by previous lovers, I love myself. I do my best to be humble, to be thankful and to be helpful as possible. I send my love to all redditors who are going through depression.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ydq9z/"}
