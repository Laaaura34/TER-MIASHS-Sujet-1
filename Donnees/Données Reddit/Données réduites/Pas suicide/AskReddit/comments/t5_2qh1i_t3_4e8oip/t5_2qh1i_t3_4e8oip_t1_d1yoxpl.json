My father committed suicide when I was 13. \nAfter the initial shock I found out that my two dogs were with him when he did it.They didn't leave his side. Aside from being heart broken already I was heart broken for them.\n\nPlease, if you're ever having a moment when you think life isn't worth living. Look at your family, look at your dog. Know that they love you with the most indescribable love that someone can feel. You are loved, you are important and you do matter. \nPlease PM me if you ever need to talk\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yoxpl/"}
