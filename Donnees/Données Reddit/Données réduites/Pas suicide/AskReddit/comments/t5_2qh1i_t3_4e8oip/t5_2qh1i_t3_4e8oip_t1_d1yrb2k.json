He did some pretty sick things and I was afraid to say no and get the cold shoulder (I liked the attention). I didn't have time to process what happened until I was already in boot camp and I reported him and had a huge investigation take place. When he was finally court marshaled (taken to court) there were literally PAGES OF GIRLS who said similar things happened to them as well. Nobody understood why I was having so much anxiety and crying all of the time, especially in the marine corps. I tried to kill my self 4 times while in the military. Twice by overdosing on prescription sleeping pills, once I almost managed to walk myself off of a cliff, and the final time I seriously considered to hang myself but didn't have anything to do it with. I don't remember what my first thoughts where when I realized that I am still going to live but I am happy that I am and get to spend time with my niece and nephew and my friends and family.
