I survived a 5 storey fall. I remember waking up in hospital, barely conscious and a nurse asked me if I knew what happened. I didn't so she told me. I remember distinctly thinking \"This is all a dream. I remember being on the edge of the window but I definitely turned around. I didn't jump.\" I then lost it again.\n\nBut yeah, I don't remember the jump itself. My brain must have erased it from memory. Just standing on the edge of the window, then looking back into the room... and I was convinced I took a step back but I didn't. I truly wish I had.\n\nOh, and I remember the last thing anyone said to me beforehand. My muum calling me on the phone, telling me to call her if I was feeling down - she knew I wasn't in the best place then. How I wish I had called her instead.\n\nNevermind.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ya66z/"}
