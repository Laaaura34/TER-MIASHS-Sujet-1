This is an overwhelming concept and I'm still trying to confront this problem.\n\nI wouldn't disagree. Other said that you're significant to the people around you etc etc. But if they're insignificant also, why would it matter that you're significant to them? Maybe it doesn't. Everybody will be forgotten, actual rather quickly for the normal person. So yes, it might be all insignificant, even this whole planet is just one among uncountable others. But why should we care? Maybe there isn't a greater sense, something that justifies our being. But so what? At least we can try having some fun being insignificant, it's a whole lot better than being miserable insignificant. There is no real universal answer to these questions and what's left for us to choose from is how we deal with it.\n\nI would like to think that in 60 years time you would much prefer to look back onto 60 years of insignificant joy and happiness than onto 60 years of being sad and troubled about being insignificant while missing out on all the fun things that life has to offer.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ygmx9/"}
