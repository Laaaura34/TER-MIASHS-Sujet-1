Instead of trying again (and the gun was my sixth? seventh? attempt) I changed the life that I hated. I moved halfway across the country...I didn't have a lot of money or a job prospect where I was going but I didn't care at that point and that probably saved me. I figured things out as I went. I still struggle with depression but it's not the beast it was when I was living with my abusive dad and neglectful mom...and I decided if I ever felt suicidal again I'd ask for help.
