I was puzzled and upset that the shotgun didn't go off. The shell was a either a dud, or older than I thought. I even checked it to make sure the pin had struck it. I struggled with depression for a long time after my attempt, but I made it through somehow. \n\nTo this day, it still amazes be that the gun didn't fire. I'm happy to be alive today, and I'm here if anyone needs to talk about what's going on in their head. \n\nStay strong.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ybddd/"}
