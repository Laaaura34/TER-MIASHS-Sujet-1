I spent the next four days in the hospital and then another week in a psych ward and the second worse day of my life was the day I was picked up from the hospital because I could sense my parents disappointment and fear and I was forced to face the consequences of what I did, it was just a pretty shitty time in my life. That was 3 years ago and honestly I'm not doing a whole lot better now but I keep myself alive, more out of fear of going back to the hospital than actual will to live.
