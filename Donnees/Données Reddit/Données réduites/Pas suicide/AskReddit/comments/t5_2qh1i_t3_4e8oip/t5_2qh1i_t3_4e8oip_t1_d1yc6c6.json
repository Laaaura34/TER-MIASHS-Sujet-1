It wasn't very well planned. I'd been thinking about it for a while and finally confided in a close friend, who encouraged me to kill myself because if I was that depressed I might as well, and my friends didn't like me anyway. So I took whatever I could get my hands on - I know it was mostly my sleeping pills but I don't remember how many or what else was mixed in there.\n\nObviously it wasn't enough. I woke up feeling like shit. I really wanted to die, both because I was depressed as hell and because I wanted to make that friend feel bad for being a dick about it. So I woke up feeling confused and stupid and wishing I'd thought it through better. I drifted in and out of consciousness on the way to the hospital, and while I was there I just felt bad that I'd interrupted my parents' day for this.\n\nI didn't regret trying but I regretted failing. I still wish I'd got it right that time because now I'm too scared to try it unless I know that it will definitely work.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yc6c6/"}
