Just over a month ago, I attempted suicide, and then the following day walked out of my school during class and walked for approximately 15 kilometers (almost 10 miles for my friends down south) in 3 hours through Canadian snow. I then spent the next 6 days in the hospital. When I attempted suicide, I felt like i was doing a selfless thing: I was ridding the world of the atrocity that is me. So I slit my wrist, and I'm relatively sure that I did it right and the bleeding from my wrist would have killed me. My arm was getting numb and feeling heavy and I was getting light headed. It was because I stopped myself. I snapped out of it and immediately stopped the bleeding. I realized I may have made the wrong decision about  what I was doing, but shortly thereafter I started regretting stopping myself, and for the past month I've been very conflicted as to whether or not I did the right thing by stopping myself. Thankfully, things may be starting to work out again. I'm now on medication (I wasn't before and I didn't want any because of my very negative experience with prozac) and I will be receiving counseling, which my family and I have struggled to obtain. I think the worst *may* be behind me, and I'm deeply sorry for those whom I have hurt because of what I did.
