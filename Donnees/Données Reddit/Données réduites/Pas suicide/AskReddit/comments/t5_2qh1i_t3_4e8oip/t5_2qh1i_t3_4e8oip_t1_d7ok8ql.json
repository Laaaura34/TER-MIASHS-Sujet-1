I'm going to make a commitment to life.\"\n\nSecond time (age 16): I told my friend after overdosing and she convinced me to go to the hospital. My first thought was, \"She wants me to live so I guess I will stick around.\" I put way too much importance on her friendship and her opinion of me. (I was in love with her and I'm female and she was very homophobic, it was a messed up situation that contributed to my being suicidal.) \n\nThird and final attempt (age 16): \"Fuck! I'm still alive. I need to die ASAP. I'm going to leave the hospital and go lie down on the train tracks.\" Thank Goodness, two security guards physically restrained me from leaving. \n\nUpdate on my life: I'm 32 now and am very grateful to be alive. I've had many good times since those suicidal days of my teens, and bad  times too. Lately I've been going through a painful time. But through it all I stay grateful to be alive. The most important thing is I've found meaning in my life, a commitment and desire to try to make the world a better place, and use my life for that purpose. This keeps me with a strong will to live even when there is pain. \n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d7ok8ql/"}
