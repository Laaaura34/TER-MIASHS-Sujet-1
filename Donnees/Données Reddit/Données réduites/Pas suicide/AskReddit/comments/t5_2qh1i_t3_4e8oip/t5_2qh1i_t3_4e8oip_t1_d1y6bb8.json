I've wanted to but knew I couldn't. I know that when all those thoughts are racing through your mind, this is one of the last things you'll be thinking about. But it's such a strong sentence. \nI lost a classmate to suicide- a few classmates actually. And I have friends and family who have tried committing suicide.\nIf this quote can help at least one person, then it makes a difference. \nYou are loved, you have a purpose, and you'll be stronger after you get past the tough times, I promise.
