The universe doesn't care if I eat ice cream for breakfast or go adventuring for the sake of it. I can do whatever I want and that's cool with the universe.

In a way I'm glad I'm not significant because I don't care about the opinions of others, I'm just going to keep on being me and if I get bored of that I'll change.
