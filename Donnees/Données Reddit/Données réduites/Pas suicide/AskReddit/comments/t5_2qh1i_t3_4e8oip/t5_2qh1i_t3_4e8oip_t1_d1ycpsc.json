After finding my father and dealing with the after math, I soon tried looking positive again. \nFast forward 14 years. I have 2 young kids of my own. That drone is getting louder. That hole is getting deeper and darker. The blackness is chasing me HARD! I start digging into my throat with my pigging knife. My (then) SO rips it from my hand before i could get more than an inch. \nI admitted myself into a local mental health institute and spend then next month and a half recovering. \nThat was a little over 5 years ago now and have now retrained in a field where i can help others feeling rough, i have minority custody of my kids and am loving life. \n\nI'm here to have a yarn with anyone that might be feeling like just reaching out.
