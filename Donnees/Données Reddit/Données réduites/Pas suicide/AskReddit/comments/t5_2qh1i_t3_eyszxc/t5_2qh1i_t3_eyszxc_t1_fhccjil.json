I swallowed a handful of Glimepiride, which raises your blood sugar drastically if you take only one. I, myself, ingested seventeen pills. I remember passing out on the bathroom floor after a few minutes, and then waking up in the hospital. My sister had found me. At the hospital, my stomach was pumped, and I was sent to a psychiatric facility nearly an hour away for 24 hours for trying to harm myself.\n\nThe thing that helped me \"change,\" was the promise I made to my mother. I told her I would never hurt myself like that again, although I've wanted to several times afterwards. I suffer heavily from MDD (major depressive disorder) depression, anxiety, social anxiety, severe self-esteem issues, eating disorders, BDD (body dysmorphic disorder) among others. For me, I've found that writing sometimes helps, and listening to music that soothes my mind. I'm 22 now, and I have not tried it again.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/eyszxc/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_made_you/fhccjil/"}
