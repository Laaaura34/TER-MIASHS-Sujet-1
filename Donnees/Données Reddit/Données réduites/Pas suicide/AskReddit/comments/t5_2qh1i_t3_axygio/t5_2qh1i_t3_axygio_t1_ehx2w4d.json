A friend of mine, very recently committed Suicide, and as hard as it is to cope I'm just trying to get insight on as to why they'd do such a thing. So what I read and why I asked the question, was to get somewhat of a better understanding. \n\nYour answer is similar to those I've read about and a lot of them said, ''I didn't know what I was thinking'', or along those lines. Life is always, always changing and thank goodness you're still here because you're loved. It isn't always people who are depressed either, but, in that moment, I just don't think that anyone can stop it - and that's the harsh reality of it, so kudos and respect to you, for being here, because that's a lot harder than not being, you know?
