I had been stockpiling my meds for years & waiting for the right moment. I was divorced, alone, pets dead, no relationships or family. It was finally time. \n\nI called in sick to work & told friends I wasn\u2019t feeling well so please don\u2019t call. I started taking pills by the handful on a Thursday night. I lost consciousness sometime early Friday morning (I don\u2019t know. This is what EMS has stated.). Finally 5 days later someone called EMS because I wasn\u2019t responding to texts or calls. I died once on the way to the ER and once in ICU. ICU for 4 days then inpatient psych ward for 7 days. I wish they hadn\u2019t found me.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/feyqef/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_drove/fo09c9v/"}
