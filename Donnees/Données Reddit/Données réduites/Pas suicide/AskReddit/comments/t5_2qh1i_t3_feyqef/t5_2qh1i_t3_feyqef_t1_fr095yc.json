The bullet missed my brain entirely, all of the fragments and jacket and bone shrapnel ended up behind my left eye, and inside it. I kept the eye. I'm fit as a ducking fiddle, been working out and playing music. For the first time in 20+ years I font want to die, I'm grateful to finally be rid of suicidal thoughts, though the knowledge that I've got no way out can be a burden. My family and friends have been indescribably amazing, they've all forgiven me and been there, my best friends treat me the same as before, we still hang out just like always. I'm humbled. I knew they all loved me but I didnt realize the strength and grace they all held, it's made me believe in a higher power. Getting shot sucks, it doesn't hurt but the PTSD and flashbacks are devastating and the pain after surgery was mind blowing. 3 weeks in and I'm healing. Thanks for letting me vent, friend.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/feyqef/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_drove/fr095yc/"}
