I recall slowly fading out, the darkness swallowing me, and I swear, right as I was a foot in the grave, I felt a yanking sensation on my chest. Mind you, I live alone. Apparently I went to work the next day. Drove there, worked for half the shift and was sent home for \"looking like death\". I recall absolutely nothing of it. I came to about 3 days later. What else I did in the meantime I have no clue. But when I did come to, I just did a long, self eval. Decided that whatever that tugging sensation was, whether good or bad, it was a second chance to strengthen my will and keep pushing forward.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/feyqef/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_drove/fjtdvzh/"}
