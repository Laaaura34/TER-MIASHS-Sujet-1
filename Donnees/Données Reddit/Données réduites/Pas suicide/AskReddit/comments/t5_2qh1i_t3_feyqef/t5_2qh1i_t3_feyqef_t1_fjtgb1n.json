It only escalated to physical bullying in my 3rd year. Punched my main bully wjom I thought was my friend and stopped going to school. Never realized how depressed I was. For almost a year I shut myself from the world and barely went out of my room. I was so scared of myself because my mind kept givong me ideas of suicide. Never even talked to anyone about this at that time.\n\nThis may be hard to believe but, when I started getting into K-pop, it provided me with even just a bit of distraction, and little by little, those negative thought came less into my mind. Of course a few negative thoughts come into mind from time to time. But when I dove deeper into that genre, I began to dream again, Itade want to do more things and be even a little ambitious. Now I have continued my studies. And I hope when I graduate I could get a job and travel.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/feyqef/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_drove/fjtgb1n/"}
