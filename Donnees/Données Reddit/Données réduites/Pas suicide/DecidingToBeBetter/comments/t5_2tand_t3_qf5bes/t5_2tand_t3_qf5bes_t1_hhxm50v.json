One thing I can say right away: I will NEVER use it again. That\u2019s for sure. \n\nSpeaking of my age, I\u2019m 27, but I\u2019m so immature, that you can think of me as some 13-14 year old child. I\u2019m a stupid and anxious kid. And you are right, I am very fearful, but I don\u2019t know what to do with it!\n\n My friend understand that I have these sort of psychological problems and so they don\u2019t invite me to these kind of parties. We still hang out, but instead of smoking weed, we order some food and play card games. Sometimes they come together to smoke weed and don\u2019t tell me so I won\u2019t feel bad. But I know that because occasionally they tell me something they\u2019ve discussed when I definitely wasn\u2019t around.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qf5bes/im_seeking_help_from_these_weird_thoughts_about/hhxm50v/"}
