For cancer patients, it can help them regain their appetite during chemotherapy. For some anxious users, especially socially anxious ones, weed can alleviate those feelings. It can help others sleep, or feel less depressed. And compared to tobacco or alcohol, it's much safer (though yes, not completely safe.)\n\nFor others, myself included, cannabis has anxiety-inducing properties. Usually this is counteracted by non-THC cannabinoids, especially CBD. But in some people, it's not enough, and it can have the opposite of the intended effect.\n\nBut also, if you've only smoked *once*, it's very possible you simply smoked too much for your size, weight, or age. Most people underestimate the strength of weed.\n\nThere's no reason to feel guilty over having smoked weed. Weed can be fun, let's be honest here, and some people get real benefits from it. Other people use it as a crutch or become addicted, but the vast majority of people simply smoke for fun once in a blue moon.\n\nIf you don't want to smoke, then don't. Don't give into peer pressure and make yourself clear with you friends. If it's a major problem, stop hanging around smokers for your own sake.\n\nIf you do want to smoke, try an indica variety, or better yet, try a CBD-heavy strain (I occasionally enjoy a 10:1 CBD to THC ratio.) If you want to 'smoke' but don't want to get high, you can get CBD-heavy, THC-free weed at most smoke shops. Or find a good CBD vape, I have used both to quit weed in the past.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qf5bes/im_seeking_help_from_these_weird_thoughts_about/hhxkw60/"}
