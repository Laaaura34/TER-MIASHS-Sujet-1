For example, things could always be worse and most of the time someone else has it much worse than you. Another habit is using the opposite of negative thoughts. Instead of self critical thinking, turn them around. Substitute \"I am lovable\"  for \"I hate myself\"  Even if you don't believe it at the moment, you are creating a habit of positive thinking. Once when trying to pay bills with not enough money being a single parent and having faced this struggle every.single.month, I was overwhelmed with not seeing any way out. Finally the thought came to me that even though I didn't have enough money, I was thankful for the money I did have. The habit of thinking \"even though this, at least I have that\" is probably what I use most and is why my family and friends roll their eyes at me. I am bipolar and suffer from depression almost constantly. These habits are some of my coping mechanisms.
