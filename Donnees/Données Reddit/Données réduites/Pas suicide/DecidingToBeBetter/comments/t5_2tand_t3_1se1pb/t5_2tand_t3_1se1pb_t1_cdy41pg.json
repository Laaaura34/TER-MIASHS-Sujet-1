It's not instant - but it can be done.\n\nThe most important tool in your box is **perspective**.  \n\nTake a step back and take stock of what you HAVE (not what they have, not what you want, not what could be better).  What do you HAVE?  Some days...you'll need to REALLY step back to get a good perspective (especially if you find yourself stuck in a grumpy rut). \n\nI didn't have to hunt for food, I have clean potable water that comes out of a pipe into my sink, I have a cupboard full of food, I have access to the internet.  These seem like really stupid things, but when you remind yourself that not everybody had these things, you feel pretty damn lucky.  \n\nWhen you get good at that, start focusing on the smaller stuff.  \n\nI am healthy, I have marketable skills, I have an apartment that is warm and comfortable.  \n\nI've also found that optimism and positivity don't always come naturally - you have to actively CHOOSE them.  It's not easy, and it's certainly harder than being negative.  It's alright to have a negative reaction at first, but you have to take that additional step to improve perspective.\n\nYou've got it in you - just start with the \"I Haves\" :)\n\n\n\n\n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1se1pb/can_you_learn_to_be_positiveoptimistic/cdy41pg/"}
