I see this situation so differently\u2014you prioritized the well-being of your kids so much that you were willing to put up with someone who was frustrating and disrespectful because you were afraid of risking a worse situation than what you had. You said that she did her work well and that was why you kept her. Presumably she didn\u2019t harm your kids (although the theft is obviously very disgusting). What do you want to be forgiven for then? The only person who has been hurt here, it seems, is you\u2014and instead of looking for forgiveness, I think you need to give yourself compassion. You were in a very tough situation, you did what was best by your kids, and you chose not to escalate with a person who sounds like you got the best out of her that you could. In the future, if it\u2019s possible not to be painted into a corner like that again, that\u2019s probably your best solution. But please don\u2019t beat yourself up for not escalating a situation with a person who you knew had your child\u2019s health in her hands.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8l9ra/regretting_not_standing_up_to_my_former_nanny/hgq2ft2/"}
