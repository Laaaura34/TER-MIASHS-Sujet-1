This is something I definitely need to hear because my career is going good for now however my alcohol addiction ruined me and my relationship with my ex. I know he wasn't the one for me but fuck I loved him. \n\nI make this commitment with you as I don't want to one day stumble into my ex and realise I have nothing. I wish you the best and know you can do this!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j0ocnw/this_story_may_give_you_a_lesson/g6ugofv/"}
