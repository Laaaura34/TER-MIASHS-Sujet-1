Our society places huge pressure on boys and men to do this, and it's seriously damaging. \n\nBut luckily you're still very young, and there's plenty of time for you to learn and grow from this. Man, at 18, pretty much everyone is having some kind of crisis about their identity and personality. You're still in the throes of letting go of your childhood identity and figuring out what you want your adult self to look like, and that's almost always a tough, painful, saddening process. It kinda feels like the end of the world, but I promise you, it's definitely the beginning.\n\nIf you are a dude like I assume you are, I think you'd find it fruitful to sit down and think about what masculinity and \"being a man\" means to you, and what society expects of it from you, and how you want to incorporate that into your life moving forward. r/menslib is a good resource for asking questions about that kind of thing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/klmpok/i_cannot_show_emotions_other_than_happiness_and/ghbebnc/"}
