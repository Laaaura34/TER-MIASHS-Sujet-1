So give yourself some credit for making that step \ud83d\udcaa\n\nA bit of homework, however, before the core suggestion. Write down what your values are, for yourself, for the friends you like or want to have, and for a romantic partner.  Take as many sittings as you need to write this down; it might take a few weeks.  Be careful to write everything in the positive. For example \"they don't smoke\" isn't very helpful for your goal, while \"they take good care of their health\" is a more effective message.\n\nWhether your mind is very neutral with people, or wants to be critical, or focuses on the positives, is mostly a habit.  Your strongest habits become part of your \"default mode network\".  Going forward from here, which ever habit(s) you train going forward will gain in strength.\n\n1. Use your values and boundaries to ensure that the people you hang out with are compatible with your values.\n\n\n2. When you are with someone, focus on what you enjoy hearing from them, observing from them, or sharing with them.\n\n\n3. Should a critical thought arise, give it a quick sanity check: Is anyone in physical danger? Is this a violation of #1?\n\n\n4. Otherwise, say a positive mantra silently to yourself, such as: \"I focus on the good in people\".\n\n\nThis is to redirect your attention and focus, and over time, this will be your new \"default mode\" habit.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfp6lm/how_to_be_less_negative_especially_about_other/hi11m93/"}
