They have shoes that are cool, they are out in the gym instead of at home watching TV, they are doing something uncomfortable now for a healthier future.\n\nHopefully it helps if that is something you are looking for.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfp6lm/how_to_be_less_negative_especially_about_other/hi4icap/"}
