I feel the same too. My birthday is in June. I live far away from my parents and siblings. Ever since I moved out, I don't really have birthday celebrated. When it's my birth month I just collect free gifts from online shopping sites that I frequently buy from: Ulta, Sephora, The Body Shop, Hot Topic, Box Lunch, etc. Then on the day (or sometimes day before or after, because I have work on birthday sometimes) I go around, to the mall, eat out alone, or play some video games. A little treat myself but not so much because I occasionally do those too (apart from playing games, I do that almost every day) \ud83e\udd75", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nsq8pm/spending_my_birthday_alone/h0qow0p/"}
