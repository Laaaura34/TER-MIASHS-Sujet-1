Spent my last bday wishing someone special to me would wish me... He didnt. I didnt tell this to anyone, and I know it sounds silly, but even at 11:30pm I was still checking my phone just in case and as it hit midnight I started crying as reality creeped in. I totally feel the loneliness. Wish you treat yourself the way you deserve it. xx", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nsq8pm/spending_my_birthday_alone/h0r29uu/"}
