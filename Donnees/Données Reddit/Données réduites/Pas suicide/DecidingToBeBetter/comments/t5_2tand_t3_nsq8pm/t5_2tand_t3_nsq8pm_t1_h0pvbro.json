You've taken direct action to change your life in the physical and other planes as I teach people. And part of that is making the most of not perfect situations. (IE birthday alone). This is exactly what I tell people. You could have sat alone and tenfolded the misery. Or did what you did--go out and have fun. Like being alone at Thanksgiving---go volunteer at a homeless shelter---you'll feel better than most who are with bickering families. Continue on the long term path of reinvention and new people will draw to you anyway. Hope that helps--Charles", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nsq8pm/spending_my_birthday_alone/h0pvbro/"}
