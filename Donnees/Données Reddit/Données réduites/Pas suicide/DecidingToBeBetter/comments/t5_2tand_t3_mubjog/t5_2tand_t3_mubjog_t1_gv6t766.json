It might take you a little while longer to get sick of your current lifestyle to make any change. I agree with others here that say, start with small things. By completing small tasks on a routine will build a little bit of confidence. When it starts to not take so much effort to do those small things, it'll be easier to add the next change you'd like to make. I should listen to my own advice, cause I'm going through a rough time atm. So don't forget to be your own best friend as well.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mubjog/how_do_i_break_this_cycle_of_me_doing_nothing/gv6t766/"}
