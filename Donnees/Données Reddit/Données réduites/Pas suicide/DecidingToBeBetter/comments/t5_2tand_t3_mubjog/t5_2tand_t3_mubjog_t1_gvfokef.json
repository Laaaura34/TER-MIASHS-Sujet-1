When I felt like that, my therapist told me that I had to get out of the house everyday even if it was just a 3 min walk around the block. Maybe you can start there. For 1 week, vow to get out of the house at least once a day. Tell a friend what you're going to do to stay accountable.\n\nStaying inside drinking, sleeping and not moving makes everything worse. Moving and exercise helps a lot with mental health. \n\nIf the only way you can get yourself out of bed is because you need to, then hack your brain and sign up for a gym class or something. Then you have to get out of bed at a certain time.\n\nYou don't have to feel like doing something to do it. Do it because you know it's good for you and that it's what's going to get you out of your rut and because you are sick of being miserable. No one is coming to save you, you have to save yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mubjog/how_do_i_break_this_cycle_of_me_doing_nothing/gvfokef/"}
