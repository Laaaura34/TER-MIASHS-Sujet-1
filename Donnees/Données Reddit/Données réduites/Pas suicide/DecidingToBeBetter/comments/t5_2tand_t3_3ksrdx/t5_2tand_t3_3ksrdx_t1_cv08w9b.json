Meet all sorts of people. Make friends with any and all of them. Find someone whose interests match your own. Date them regardless of what imaginary numbers you would assign them. \n\nWhen you fall in love with someone they will be beautiful to you. I promise.\n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3ksrdx/how_do_i_accept_the_fact_that_i_am_ugly_looking/cv08w9b/"}
