You complain that women who you think are 8/10 are so shallow that they judge you by your appearance. Might be. Maybe they do that. But you do exactly the same. You don't care the slightest for internal qualities or love. All you care about is getting an 8/10 girl, probably to compensate for your low self-worth. Because you define yourself by your appearance only, and thus women too. THIS is your real problem - not your physical appearance.\n\nI had a friend exactly like you. He felt ugly, and all he was doing all day was rating people on scales from 1-10, comparing them to each other, and spreading bullshit. For example that it's a fact that an 8/10 guy who is with a girl that's only a 5/10 would ALWAYS immediately rather leave that girl as soon as he can find better. What a joke. It never occured the slightest to him that other people might NOT rate everyone else on such a scale, and that others are, unlike him, not always purely appearance orientated. And who rates them on the scales anyway? It's always personal taste. There is no official scale, it's not in your ID \"Is officially measured and a 5 of 10\".\n\nIt was his hypocrisy and his ugly character that prevented him from ever meeting a woman who could have loved him or he could have loved. All he cared for was having a hot woman to show off somehow, and at the same time he hated on them because they dared to be so shallow to ignore him. Another hypocrisy - disdain something you want badly. It will surely come to you then. For sure.
