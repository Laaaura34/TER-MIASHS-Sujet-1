You don't need to learn how to accept your level of attractiveness, you need to learn how to stop judging everyone around you. Of course you can't get a drop dead gorgeous girl if you are ugly. That's like saying, \"I only have  $5,000, how do I accept that I can't buy a Lamborghini?\" With the attitude you have towards women that are as, *or even more*, attractive than you, no one is gong to want to date you. How would you feel if a girl that was significantly uglier than you was bemoaning the fact that you are too ugly for her? Christ, get a fucking grip.
