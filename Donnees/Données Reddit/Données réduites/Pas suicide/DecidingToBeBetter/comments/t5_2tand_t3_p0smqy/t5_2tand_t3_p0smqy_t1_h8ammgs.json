I should I have realized this sooner than later (I'm 19 and in a bit of a tough spot). \n\nBut since you are 15, you can start exploring free open source software, and Linux. Tech may not interest you but trying your hand at video editing, graphic design, motion design, hacking, emulation, development, can go a long way.\n\nJoin various subreddits and discord channels, don't be afraid to ask questions. Also try your hand at movies, anime, music, reading, and see what entertainment you enjoy the most and stick with it. \n\nIn that way, you will find what inspires you and decide what you want to to pursue.\n\nIf you hear even the slightest thing that you never heard before, save it for later and look it up.\n\nUse social media wisely. Don't follow your friends or people you don't know. Don't document your life a lot. Follow news pages, educational pages, a few good celebrities, etc. \n\nStart a blog, website or a github page. Make projects and build a repository. Apply for campus expert and ambassador programs.\n\nTake part in online challenges, reach out to people over the internet.\n\nBuild up your professional accounts like LinkedIn.\n\nTry freelancing on fiverr or other platforms. Start a YouTube channel.\n\nThe possibilities are endless, and at your age and the time you have, you will be far ahead than I was at your age, and anyone else among your peers.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p0smqy/15f_what_are_some_things_i_should_do_while_im/h8ammgs/"}
