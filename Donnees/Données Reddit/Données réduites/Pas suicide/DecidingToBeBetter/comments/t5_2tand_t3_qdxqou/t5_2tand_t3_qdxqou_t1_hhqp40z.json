Therapy and antidepressants really helped me. I would encourage you to try gentle yoga in the meantime, and eat as healthy as you can manage. Don't strive for perfection, just do what you can.\n\nDecide if you want to get better, or if you want to stay like this. If the former, take small steps to get you there. Progress is progress, even if it's slow. And sometimes it will feel painfully slow.\n\nEasy to say, but admittedly hard to do: you need to stop beating yourself up (language like \"I wasted everything\" won't help you heal) and show yourself a little compassion. Getting yourself a doctor's appointment was a good start. \n\nWhat other nice thing can you do for yourself today? Clean sheets make me feel great. Maybe a cozy sweater and a visit to the library. Maybe a hot cocoa and a little walk in the park to enjoy the autumn air. Tomorrow do the same thing again. Be gentle with yourself, not mean or defeatist. Being hard on yourself is what got you here.
