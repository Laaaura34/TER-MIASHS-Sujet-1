You can always go for a walk or sit in your car while you do telehealth.  The telehealth appointments are really convenient because you can try doctors all over the country. I tried 3 in the last month because I needed someone who I connected with and it makes a huge difference. Don\u2019t let your mind limit you. Having roommates isn\u2019t that much of a hurdle, I\u2019m certain you can figure out a way to make a private phone call once  or twice a week for an hour. If you\u2019re not willing to find a way to do something that simple, then you\u2019re not serious about improving yourself. I may be coming across harsh but that is the truth. All of this starts and ends with you. You\u2019re an amazing strong individual and you can do anything, don\u2019t ever tell yourself otherwise.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdxqou/my_depression_has_gotten_worse_now_im_too_weak_to/hhtsf92/"}
