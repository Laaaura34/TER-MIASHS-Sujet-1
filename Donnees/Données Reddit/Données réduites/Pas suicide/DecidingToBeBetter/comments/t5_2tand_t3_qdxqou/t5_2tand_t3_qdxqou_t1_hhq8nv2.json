I'm a little better now compared to the state I was a while ago. One thing that helped me is to seperate my issues and look at them as their own unique problem. When I did that, a few of those problems had a clear solution. Some of them were complex so I just focused on one small problem at a time for which I could see the path to solution. Actually working on that solution is the hardest part but steadily working on it helped make it easier to do every day. And now I am glad atleast a few of my problems are no longer bothering me. The way I saw it, whether I solved such small problems or not, the next day, week and month will arrive. Id rather be there next month with everything the same minus that one problem than be there with it still bothering me. Decluttering all my issues and solving the ones that were clear and straight forward has helped me out a lot and I am genuinely in a better state now, working on my bigger issues. And I am thankful for all the effort that went to getting here.. hope you can do the same, because it's definitely possible and worth it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdxqou/my_depression_has_gotten_worse_now_im_too_weak_to/hhq8nv2/"}
