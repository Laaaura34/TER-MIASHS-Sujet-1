I also need to fix some stuff in my bathroom and room. but this tiring feeling makes everything so hard and I don't freaking know where to start everyday is the same.  I also can't overcome my perfectionism, I feel like i'm doing nothing unless things turn out the way I want to, and that's a huge problem for me and It's so hard to tackle", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdxqou/my_depression_has_gotten_worse_now_im_too_weak_to/hhqz4fl/"}
