I feed on long term goals, I still have some. Without them, my existence makes no sense. I know it's tricky cause sometimes we should just live in the present moment.

I need to be specific, I need to measure, I need to make sure the goals are attainable, relevant and time-based.\n\nThank you kind human tho.
