I'm serious. It doesn't have to be forever. But if you're depressed and anxious enough...It sounds like you can't think straight right now. That you're just \"stuck\". \n\nAlso make sure you're getting enough potassium and magnesium (this has a huge impact on anxiety). If you go the supplement route...there are about 7 or 8 types of Magnesium on the market. One or two are better for anxiety than others).\n\nIf you're looking for something truly immediate...\n\nLook for any of this over the counter:\n\n\\-Melatonin+ L-Trytophan (for sleep)...(Melatonin by itself is not as effective, particularly if you are already serotonin deficient. Your body will just reconvert Melatonin back to serotonin/it won't make you sleep.)\n\n\\-GABA (Anxiety)\n\n\\-L-theanine (Anxiety)\n\n\\-5HTP (Depression+ anxiety)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n...When you feel like you're some what functional...get a gym membership. Intense exercise...the kind that gets your endorphins running, makes all the difference in the world for both depression and anxiety. Trust me. I have PTSD. I would not survive if I did not go to the gym. \n\nIt might be hard to start off. But once you get through that first week and start making it a habit, you'll start craving going. And you'll get exponential returns as far as your mental health.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdxqou/my_depression_has_gotten_worse_now_im_too_weak_to/hhpwsht/"}
