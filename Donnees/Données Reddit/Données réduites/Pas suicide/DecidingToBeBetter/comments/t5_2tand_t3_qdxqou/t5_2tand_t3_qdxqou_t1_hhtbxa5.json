The only time when I dont feel like this is in the first 10 mins of my day. and I can't help it, I've tried medication, I've tried meditation. None of that helps. My mind makes it hard to focus because I know I desperately want this things even if I don't know why so it's hard to ignore those thoughts. Btw I work in an industry that I despise but I don't have the money to do what I want, and that makes me go crazy cause I don't know wtf I'm doing with my life as well, I'm forcing myself to do draining and super stressful things that I hate just because of a couple of extra money. I fear myself, I fear that one day I'll snap and just give up on everything. Money cant be my only motivation in life, its making me so miserable and I feel like im close to experience a heart attack", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdxqou/my_depression_has_gotten_worse_now_im_too_weak_to/hhtbxa5/"}
