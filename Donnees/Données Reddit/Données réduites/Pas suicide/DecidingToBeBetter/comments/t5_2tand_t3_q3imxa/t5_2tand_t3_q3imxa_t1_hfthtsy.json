People don't get it. My boss has told me, repeatedly, that I should \"stand up for myself\" more. And it cracks me up. I tell her, every damn time, \"it wouldn't achieve anything. All it would do is upset X and maybe make me feel better for a minute.\" She thinks they'll walk all over me, and I just laugh since that's nowhere near how it ends up going. \n\nMy dad is the same. He's convinced I'm a doormat because I won't get vindictive with another family member who owes me money. I've considered pointing out to him that he owes me even more, for a longer period of time. But I just remember \"what would happen if I did?\" It wouldn't change his perspective on the other guy. He still wouldn't pay me back. He'd find some excuse as to why \"it's different.\" It would create more tension, and nobody would feel any better at the end. I'd rather never see the money again than fight over something so petty (even though I'm broke).\n\nI'd rather be at peace with my inaction than regretful over my actions. Good on you for thinking things through and taking \"the high road.\"", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3imxa/i_thought_about_my_action_instead_of_being/hfthtsy/"}
