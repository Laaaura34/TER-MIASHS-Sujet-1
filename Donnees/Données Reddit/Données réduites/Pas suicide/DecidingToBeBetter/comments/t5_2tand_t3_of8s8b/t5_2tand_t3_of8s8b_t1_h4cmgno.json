I recently have been realizing that I am the toxic one in my relationship and complicate our relationship way more than it should. Of course no one is perfect in a relationship, but I've started accepting that the trauma and insecurities I have from childhood has bled to my relationships to the point when I get criticized even if it's not a big deal, it felt like an attack on my character or feeling worthless and I would react by expressing frustration and anger. I'm glad that you're growing from your situation and I hope for the best for you.
