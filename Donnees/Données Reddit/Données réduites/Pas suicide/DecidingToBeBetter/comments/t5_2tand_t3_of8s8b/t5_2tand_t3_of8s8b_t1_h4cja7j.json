You don't feel guilt unless you're *now* the kind of person who would *never knowingly do what you did in the past*. Now you recognize that what you did was  harmful, and morally and ethically wrong, that you didn't behave as a healthy and kind person should. And the MOMENT you look back and feel guilt, it means you've already made that change! \n\nUnlike a little kid who thinks there's nothing wrong about hitting another child or its mother, or grabbing a pet roughly, an older kid realizes that these things cause pain and shouldn't be done because (most) people have empathy for living beings. They look back on their babyhood and feel some guilt. \n\nThe next step is to mindfully monitor yourself (mind and actions) and catch yourself, like a mom, when you see your baby lizard brain start to lash out like a crazy infant and do things that you know better-- and when you can catch yourself and pull it back like \"noooo, we don't do that... we react nicely here, even if we are mad we must explain ourself in words and talk about this like an adult\" then you'll be in so much more control... I feel a lot better than I did as a young adult believe me! \n\nYou can do this! You're already better than you were yesterday.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of8s8b/i_realized_i_was_the_toxic_one_in_the_relationship/h4cja7j/"}
