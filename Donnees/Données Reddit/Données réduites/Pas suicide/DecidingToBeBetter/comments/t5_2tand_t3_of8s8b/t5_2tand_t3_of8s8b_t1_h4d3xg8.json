I was so guilt tripped and manipulated to the point I gave up two years of my life to help her attain all the hopes and dreams that I wanted to pursue for myself. Always put her needs above mine and always made to feel like to bad person whenever I raised any issues about how I felt, because it was making her sad. She was clingy and overbearing about her needs and emotions to the point of suffocating. It didn't help that she was suicidal and had cancer. Still, I felt so used. I don't know if I'll ever be able to forgive her but then again, time is a great healer. Hope your therapy provides you with a better outlook on life and you can avoid the same mistakes in future \ud83d\ude0a", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of8s8b/i_realized_i_was_the_toxic_one_in_the_relationship/h4d3xg8/"}
