I\u2019d also recommend telling your recent ex what this breakup has made you realize and that you are working on yourself. \n\nDo you think there was a way he could\u2019ve brought up these issues and help you become aware of these issues without cutting you off completely and breaking up? \n\nWith that attachment style it\u2019s easy for relationships to become toxic when you don\u2019t even understand your behaviours are a problem and how affects others. \n\nI think he should have talked with you about how things made him feel and try to help you realize that there is a problem instead of breaking up. If he\u2019s giving you space to heal on your own then that\u2019s okay but i think he could have handled things better. \n\nHonestly, break the 4th wall and tell him what his insight means for you. Good luck on healing!! \n r/attachment_theory", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of8s8b/i_realized_i_was_the_toxic_one_in_the_relationship/h4cilmm/"}
