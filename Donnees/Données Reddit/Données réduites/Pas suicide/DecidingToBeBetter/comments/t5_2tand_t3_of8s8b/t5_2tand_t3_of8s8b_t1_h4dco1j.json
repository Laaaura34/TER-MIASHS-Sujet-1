I still have yet to be in a serious relationship but sometimes I fear that I might end up making the same mistakes as you described. I have very low self esteem and because of this I tend to cling to people too much in an unhealthy manner. Ive only been in one relationship which was very casual and short lived, but I became very attached to that girl and it would destroy me when she wasnt showing me enough affection. I would panic if I wasnt getting a text back from her after several hours, and I drove myself crazy worrying too much about her. Ive met another girl since then and its the same deal. I wont get a text back from her until the next day sometimes and it drives me insane. She keeps reassuring me that its because she is super busy and she is like this with everybody she texts and she still likes me and all that, but I still have doubt in my mind. I dont like being like this, its very draining. I want to be able to worry about my own life and not spend all this time worrying about what another girl is doing. Its a struggle but Im trying to get better and work on myself", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of8s8b/i_realized_i_was_the_toxic_one_in_the_relationship/h4dco1j/"}
