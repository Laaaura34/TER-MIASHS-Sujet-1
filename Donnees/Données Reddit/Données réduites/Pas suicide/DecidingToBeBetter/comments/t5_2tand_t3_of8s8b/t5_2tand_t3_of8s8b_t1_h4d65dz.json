I\u2019m more hurt than anything but after talking to a crisis counselor, my friends, and my family, I wrote all this down in a journal and decided to post it for others to see. Quite frankly I\u2019m embarrassed because I didn\u2019t realize what I was doing was wrong. It was more to help people like me find help. I\u2019ll mention it to my therapist though, I may have traits of narcissism.
