Same. Granted he was also toxic as fuck in his own way, but it wasn\u2019t until after the breakup that I realised I was also a total trash bag. I am still having a lot of difficulty trying to acknowledge and work on my flaws. I\u2019m in a new relationship now, it\u2019s been 2 months and I recognised last week that I was on the cusp of slipping into needy, guilt tripping, insecure behaviour. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow and I\u2019m going to talk about it.
