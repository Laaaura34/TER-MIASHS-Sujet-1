He was probably the most beautiful person I\u2019ve ever seen. Way, way out of my league. But also _deeply_ fucked up from having been in, essentially, sexual slavery as a young kid. Surprising because we both grew up in London, but I guess it happens everywhere. I can\u2019t even imagine. \n\nIt didn\u2019t work out, because he was phenomenally needy and, a bit like you, doing things that came across _to me_ as trying to sabotage the relationship (such as it was), because he felt like he didn\u2019t deserve a relationship, or thought on some level that it couldn\u2019t be real. \n\nBut I still care about him a hell of a lot, and I hope he makes peace with himself. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same for your ex. The fact that it wasn\u2019t a good relationship doesn\u2019t mean that either of you aren\u2019t good people. \ud83d\udc95", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of8s8b/i_realized_i_was_the_toxic_one_in_the_relationship/h4coi3v/"}
