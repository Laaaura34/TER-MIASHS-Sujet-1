Throughout these past few days after the break up, I was self-reflecting on what I did wrong. While I still thing I messed up on the majority of things, there were many boundaries I set that he chose to break for his own reasons. That released a lot of trauma for me.\n\nI still think everything I wrote is something I really need to work on but just please remember everyone: don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. Boundaries are OKAY. If they can\u2019t respect it, that\u2019s on them.\n\nAnd I appreciate all of your comments from my perspective, from his perspective, and all the advice/support. This is what I wake up to every day and it\u2019s amazing. Thank you all", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of8s8b/i_realized_i_was_the_toxic_one_in_the_relationship/h4gvx45/"}
