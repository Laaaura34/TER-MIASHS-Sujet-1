While I don't think that toxic relationships are ALL the fault of one person or another (it takes two to tango) I realize in hindsight that I was the one bringing a lot of toxicity to my last relationship. Owning it was the first step, changing the behaviors  (\\*this is an ongoing process) is the second, and dealing with the regret (also an ongoing process) is the third. \n\nI'm finding dealing with the regret to be the hardest, and that's where self compassion comes into play (also hard). \n\nCongratulations on taking the first step into your power. This kind of work is hard but HIGHLY rewarding.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of8s8b/i_realized_i_was_the_toxic_one_in_the_relationship/h4ctnr0/"}
