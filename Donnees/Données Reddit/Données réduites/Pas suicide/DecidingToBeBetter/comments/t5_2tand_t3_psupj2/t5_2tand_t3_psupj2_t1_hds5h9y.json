You know you have issues so you  have to understand it will take some work to sort them out.  I do have some direct suggestions that won't help any root issues but may help get the ball rolling.\n\n1. Look to join an AA group.  They are actually pretty cool and a great place to make friends.\n2. Set something up with your bank account or through work so on payday a certain amount of your paycheck automatically gets invested in low cost index funds.  This could be a 401k, IRA or simply just a brokerage account.  I'd suggest using a Vanguard index fund.  This is so that on payday no matter what some of your paycheck is going towards to improving you future instead of being used for gambling.  It should only take a little bit to setup and then you don't have to worry about it again.\n3. Switching to vaping was an improvement so you shouldn't beat yourself up about it.  A common pathway to quitting is to switch to vaping and then eventually quitting.  Don't look at its a failure but a successful step.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/psupj2/i_am_sick_of_myself/hds5h9y/"}
