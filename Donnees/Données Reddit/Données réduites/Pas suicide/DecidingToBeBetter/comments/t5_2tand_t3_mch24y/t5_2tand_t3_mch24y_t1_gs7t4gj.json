I sleep from 10-6 because I like to get up early and run to avoid distractions. I use the last 15 minutes I\u2019m awake to wash up and wind down to get my eight hours. After I run, I do my morning routine. The rest of my day varies inevitably, but dedicating a little bit of time towards self development and care really helps you stay on track for the rest of the day.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mch24y/how_do_i_balance_social_life_health_and_school/gs7t4gj/"}
