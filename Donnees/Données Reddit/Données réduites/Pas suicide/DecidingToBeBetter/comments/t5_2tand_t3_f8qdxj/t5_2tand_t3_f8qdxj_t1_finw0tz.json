This sounds simple, but is actually hard to do, because you have to change years of inwardly-focused thoughts.  \n\nFor example, if you are walking down the street, and see someone, you tend to jump to a judgment of whether that person is someone cool you wish you could meet, or someone who doesn't seem that cool.  To change this, maybe practice looking at the person and wondering about what they are going through, or what makes them tick, or what kind of experiences could be behind your snap judgment of their appearance as \"cool\" or \"uncool.\"  \n\nWhen you make this a habit with strangers, it makes it easier to also have empathy for those around you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/f8qdxj/iwtl_how_to_be_less_egocentric_and_truly_care/finw0tz/"}
