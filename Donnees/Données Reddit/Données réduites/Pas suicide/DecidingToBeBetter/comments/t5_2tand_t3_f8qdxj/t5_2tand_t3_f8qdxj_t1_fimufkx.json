I don't mean that in a \"oh, what a terrible person for not thinking of others\" way. But we tend to gravitate towards what makes us feel good and what benefits us, even in friendships. I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with this selfishness, but a lot of people will take it too far and treat every relationship as completely transactional. To me, maybe your friendships are slightly transactional right now, but also think: why do you want them to hang out with you? Why would you be sad if they weren't there anymore to be friends with? Probably because you like them as people, not simply because you are constantly getting some favor from them. And wanting to hangout with people because you like them is pretty cool! So I wouldn't worry too much.\n\nSuggestions on what you can further do: good, ol' fashioned volunteer work may give you some new perspective. Give favors to a person or group of people who are unable to give back to you. Do this pretty regularly. It doesn't have to be money, it can be time, conversation, etc. But that should at least help you see people with more empathy. \n\nAlso, be careful with empathy. Some people are so empathetic that they feel the pain of the people around them, ultimately hurting themselves in the process. Being a tiny bit selfish is not a bad thing in that sense. It's a good thing to be understanding, but a bad thing to be constantly swept away in other people's issues.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/f8qdxj/iwtl_how_to_be_less_egocentric_and_truly_care/fimufkx/"}
