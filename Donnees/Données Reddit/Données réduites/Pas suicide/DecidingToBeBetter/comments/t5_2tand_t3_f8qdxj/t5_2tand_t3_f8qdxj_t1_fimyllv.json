There are two reasons mainly, the first is that really everyone has something to give, even if it's \"just\" respect, acknowledgement or appreciation, so I technically get something back for volunteering. The second reason is that I simply don't really care about that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/f8qdxj/iwtl_how_to_be_less_egocentric_and_truly_care/fimyllv/"}
