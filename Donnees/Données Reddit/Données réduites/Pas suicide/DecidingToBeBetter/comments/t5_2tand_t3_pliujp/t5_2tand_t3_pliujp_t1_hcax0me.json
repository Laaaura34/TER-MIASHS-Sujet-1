Designate 1 day a week where you aren't doing a damn thing unless you really want to.  If you want to watch netflix or play video games all day then do it.  If you feel like going out for a long-ass hike by yourself or with your girlfriend then do it.  Nothing is a waste of time if it provides value and sometimes just doing something that lets you recharge your batteries provides A LOT of value.\n\n2. Set aside 10-20 minutes a day do some sort of meditation.  There are plenty of types of meditation out there.  It can create some space, calm things down and offer some mental clarity.  It's not uncommon, for me anyway, to realize after a quick meditation session that all the daily mental to-dos aren't what's important today.\n\n3.  Make plans for a long vacation/holiday.  This always seems to help me.  It gives me something to look forward to and then usually around day 3 of the vacation all the baggage from the daily bullcrap that comes with being alive is shed off.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pliujp/what_should_i_do_when_i_want_to_just_give_up/hcax0me/"}
