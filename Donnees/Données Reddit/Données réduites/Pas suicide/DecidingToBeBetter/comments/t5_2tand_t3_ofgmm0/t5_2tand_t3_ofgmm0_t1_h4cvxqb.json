I can't imagine going from limited food to freedom of it all. Here are a few things I did that you should give a try. This is a semi brief list as I don't know the details of your habits.\n\nDrink lots of water. It help make you feel full and is better than any other drink. Try to prioritize it over any other drink. Get a filter like a Britta if your tap tastes funny and you wana save some money over bottled. Seltzer water is also a good option. Also add some lemon and/or lime to give it a little kick.\n\nIf make yourself aware of what and when you're eating. Not just as you're eating but when hunger strikes. Start taking your time to decide what you want to eat and then eat only that. Try cooking your own food if you're not doing that already.\n\nLimit your buying of sugary/junk foods. Don't go cold turkey. Instead aim to steadily decrease. Buy a food item and aim to finish it in a week->2 weeks->3weeks. If you finish it sooner then wait till the end of the week to guy a new one.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the feeling of hunger is most likely triggering the anxiety/stress from when you were younger. This will need time to overcome, less with professional help.\n\nBe kind to yourself. If you slip up and catch yourself eating more. Stop and try again. Again it will take time to adjust and control your eating.\n\nBest of luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ofgmm0/i_cant_store_food_since_i_cant_resist_eating/h4cvxqb/"}
