This means just cutting yourself off harshly could be a problem for that recovery.\n\nAs a consequence, I would suggest tackling this on multiple levels.\n\nIncreasing protein and fiber will make sure your body is getting the message that there is enough.  Thirty grams of protein within 30 mins of waking has incredible benefits, too many to get into it all, but will help keep appetite at healthy levels throughout the day.\n\nAlso, look at what you consider 'good food.'  You may deserve things like pleasure, abundance, and satiety -- but do you really deserve what unlimited chicken wings will do to your body over the course of years if you make it a regular habit?\n\nLast but not least, you would benefit from some kind of meditative inquiry process to really look and feel deeply if there is anything coming up leftover from your childhood to compassionately address.\n\nI hope this helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ofgmm0/i_cant_store_food_since_i_cant_resist_eating/h4dguss/"}
