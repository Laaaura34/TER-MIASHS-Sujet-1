Yes, I could have done better if I had done something another way.\nBut there is one thing I did good, and that's my bed. When I go to sleep, I have the visual reminder that today, I did indeed achieve something - even though it's small. I took 2 minutes to feel good about myself, and sometimes that's all it takes to go to sleep in a better mindset.\n\nI hope it works for you too!\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8wi0l/im_done/eceh1qq/"}
