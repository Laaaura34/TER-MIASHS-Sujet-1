Jason Stephenson was one of my favorites (youtube). This is one I have listed to numerous times: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzZox4uN86o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzZox4uN86o)\n\nI also like meditation vacation. \n\nIf you do 100 days and are looking for something a little more, there are lots of calming yoga videos that are great too. Yin yoga is very slow and great before bed. Restorative yoga is also very nice....or you can just search youtube for 'yoga for sleep', or similar.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ovfau6/day_4_100daysofmeditation/h79swan/"}
