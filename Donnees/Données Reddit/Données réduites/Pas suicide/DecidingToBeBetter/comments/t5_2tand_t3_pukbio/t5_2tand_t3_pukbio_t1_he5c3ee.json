And a soul only get peace when it accept who you are.\nSo, firstly, the question that you need to answer is \"who you are\". For example, it's waste of time when you going to prison just to prove someone is criminal. Agree that?\nTherefore, you have to going on a date with the person of you. Just focus on him and listen everything he says. And you must do it without judgment, comparison or anything else could interrupt your conversation (but remember, there's not your voice at all).\nAt that moment, you'll find out the answer of the question who you \"really\" are. You cant describe it by words, but the feeling.\nThen bring the problems on the table and eat them all with him. Next step, push them out from your soul's butts after you digest all the depression.\nFor me, the comparisons is not the \"root\" of problem, but the way you think about yourself. So just stop judging the persond of you, he needs love too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pukbio/how_do_i_focus_on_myself_only/he5c3ee/"}
