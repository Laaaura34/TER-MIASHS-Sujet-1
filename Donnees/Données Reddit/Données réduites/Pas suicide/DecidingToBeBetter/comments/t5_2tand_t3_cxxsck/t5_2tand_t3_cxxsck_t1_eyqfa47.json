There is this theory that in order to become more resilient, you have to expose yourself to stressers over and over again.  Just like a muscle only grows if you exceed your limits over time. By this I dont mean you should get stressed on purpose and burn yourself out. But what you could do is to consciously do things that expand your comfort zone - or getting used to discomfort. Things like: Ice cold showers, talking to a random girl on the street every day, doing something that you fear every day, extreme sports.. your mind and body will adapt to the changes, and the situations that stress you out today, might become deeply relaxing and easy if you compare it to the stuff I listed above. good luck", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cxxsck/stay_calm_under_pressure/eyqfa47/"}
