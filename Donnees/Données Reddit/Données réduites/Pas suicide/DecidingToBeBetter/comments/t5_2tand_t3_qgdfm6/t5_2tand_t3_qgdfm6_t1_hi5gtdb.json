That's the only real skill of life. If you wanna catch up, just work on catching up.\n\nYou'll be able to because very few people, in general, leverage their time perfectly. In an optimal world you'd be fucked but we don't live in one. The fact that you're trying will already put you ahead of most people. If you try a lot, you'll likely fail at some points - the same applies there: learn from your mistakes and try again. The faster you do that, the faster you'll progress.\n\nGood luck achieving your goals! The past was valuable because it brought you to this point. Can you take yourself the rest of the way?
