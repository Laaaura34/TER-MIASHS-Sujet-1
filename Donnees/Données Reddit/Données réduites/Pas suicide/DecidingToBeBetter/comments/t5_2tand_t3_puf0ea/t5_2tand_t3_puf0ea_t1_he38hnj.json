I tried some kinds of exercises but none of them really stick to me. I believe either it's my depression making any kind of workout feel like an annoying chore or I simply just don't enjoy it. I tried powering through it and doing it anyway but it won't work in the long run. As for healthy eating, a bit of a similar problem arises: I just can't keep a healthy diet up enough for it to start making me feel better. This is why I want therapy, but without it I honestly have no idea how to deal with this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/puf0ea/how_to_deal_with_depression_without_going_to/he38hnj/"}
