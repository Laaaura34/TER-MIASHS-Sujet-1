The closest thing to exercise that I'm already doing is walking outside for like 10-20 minutes. It's just something I incorporated as part of my morning routine to make sure I get any amount of fresh air and movement at all. I tried turning that into jogging or cycling but that doesn't stick.\n\nSo about the diet, is it a good idea to get protein powder when you're overweight? I've gained quite a lot of weight over the course of the pandemic and ever since I graduated school I'd basically just sit at home all day. At some point I did manage to eat some fruits and vegetables for a few weeks straight but my parents don't buy a lot of that so it became hard to keep up. And since I'm not working, nor am I interested in working right now, I can't buy these things on my own.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/puf0ea/how_to_deal_with_depression_without_going_to/he3p2cx/"}
