Have you found anything at all that gets you exercising that you enjoy at all? Sports, rock climbing, cycling, swimming, bench press every workout? All it takes is one form of exercise you enjoy to get the ball rolling. You don't even have to be doing it to get you super tired. Like swimming for example, you don't have to go to a pool and start swimming laps the entire time. Just go and swim a couple lengths. It's better if you have someone to go with, when swimming I find, cause it's harder to enjoy yourself messing around in a pool when you're by yourself. When you've found even one that you enjoy, just do that. Only that. For at least a few weeks, before introducing other similar forms of exercise that you may enjoy. Getting the habit formed with things you enjoy is the best way to form one.\n\nAs for healthy eating, how about instead of cutting out all the junk and switching completely, just try having one healthy meal a day, or an extra serving of fruit or veg with each meal. Something you don't mind, or like eating. You don't have to go straight into a strict diet, and even I don't have a strict diet. \n\nIf you can, get some decent quality protein powder, and just chug 2 scoops a day. It probably won't get you as much protein as you need, if you're not getting much at all already, but it's a start, and easy to do.\n\nIf you want, I'd also recommend the book 'Atomic Habits' by James Clear. It's pretty good at helping form good habits and breaking bad ones, and has decent info that should help you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/puf0ea/how_to_deal_with_depression_without_going_to/he3mov8/"}
