Just like carbs and fat. You probably don't need more than 150g protein a day, and that's if you're exercising regularly. Also, protein is more satiating, and harder for the body to digest, so not only will it make you fuller for longer, but you burn 'slightly' more calories than if you consumed the same amount of carbs or fat.\n\nAs for being overweight, just that by itself can be a cause for depression, as your body isn't running as well as it should. Definitely keep badgering the doctors for therapy. If you keep calling them, they will see you, it just takes a bit of persistence. Call once a day at the same time. Set an alarm. \"13:00, call doctor for therapy, Mon-Fri\". \n\nAnd just ask your parents to buy you the veg you like. Don't expect them to just buy you what you need without telling them. At the end of the day, your life is 100% in your control. Some people see that as frightening,some see as comforting. But however you see it, you are in control of your own fate, and allowing yourself to be controlled at the behest of others, is a recipe for disaster, because nobody will come to you and help you selflessly. Only you can help yourself. Keep hassling the doctor until you get your therapy. No matter how many times you fail with healthy eating or exercise, just start again.
