I'm currently going through a rough patch in my life and I've had many Reddit users reach out to me. I just wanna return the favour. Your post also gave me some guidance into my healing as well so I should also thank you as well!\n\nI'm glad that I could be some sort of help. Again, keep pushing through! If you haven't tried so yet, counselling is always a great option so if you feel like you wanna try it, I say go for it! \n\nCheers.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/evd822/little_advice_from_someone_who_has_been_walking_a/fgj0raz/"}
