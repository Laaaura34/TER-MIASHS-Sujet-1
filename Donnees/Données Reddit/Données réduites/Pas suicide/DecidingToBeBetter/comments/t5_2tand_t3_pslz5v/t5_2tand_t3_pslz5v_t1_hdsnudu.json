I was luckily able to take a semester off to recover mentally (many schools allow up to 2 semesters/a year before reapplying), and switched my major junior year. You don't have to have it all figured out. If you want, stop by your school's counseling center, meet with your advisor/career center. You don't have to have it all figured out now, many people's future jobs differ from their major and people change careers over their lifetime. If you can afford it, I would take the semester off, especially as you're moving to a new country and you have to figure out how and if your credits transfer. It's hard when your parents don't support you, so try your best to advocate for yourself (super hard when you're struggling mentally). Commit to being kinder to yourself, you deserve a break! You can take care of yourself better in the future. You can get through this, even if you have to delay graduating for a bit. Best of luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pslz5v/difficulty_deciding_on_a_major_in_college_because/hdsnudu/"}
