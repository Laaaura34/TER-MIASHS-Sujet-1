It sucks. It feels like you're missing out. The thing is, for a person working in the creative field, it's quite normal.\n\nYou have to stop thinking that original ideas will get you a big playerbase or that they will get you something that a non original idea won't. Cause that's the truth. Most sucsessful games are copied from something else. There's so many battleroyales and FPS games and copy paste RPG games. But still, no game will be 100% like your game so it will still be YOURS. Everyone has original ideas at some point and there are BILLIONS of people so there's going to be \"duplicate ideas\". Don't make that let yourself down.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ncmckt/severe_creative_envy/gy7h76c/"}
