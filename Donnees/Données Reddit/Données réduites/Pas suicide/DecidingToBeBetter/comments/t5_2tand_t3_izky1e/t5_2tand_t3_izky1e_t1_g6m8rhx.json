I love being the guy who doesn\u2019t drink. It\u2019s consistent proof to myself that I have self control and that my priorities are in check (good sleep, health, my physique, mental capacity, etc...). It\u2019s been amazing to me (not the case with everybody) that with each year, it actually gets easier for me to not drink. Such an awesome feeling.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/izky1e/1095_days/g6m8rhx/"}
