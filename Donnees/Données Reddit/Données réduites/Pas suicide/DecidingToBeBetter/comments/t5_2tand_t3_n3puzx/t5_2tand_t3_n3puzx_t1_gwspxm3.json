I was willing to let it all go if things truly changed. I was willing to respect him being distant, I can be that way too. But the lying and the complete inconsideration of my needs on the other end really fucked me up emotionally and I\u2019ll never be able to trust again. Thanks for reflecting and realizing this. We broke up and he blamed me for accusing him of lying when he wasn\u2019t even with a 5 year history of constantly lying to me. I fell into a deep depression blaming myself for my \u201cparanoia\u201d and ruining everything. I\u2019ve been struggling to convince myself that I wasn\u2019t paranoid, and even if I accused him of lying when he might not have been, his history was why I acted that way. He blames me and I need to let go. Someday a genuine apology to her where you admit what you\u2019ve done WITHOUT the expectation to then get back together, will really help her heal.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n3puzx/im_a_manipulative_scumbag/gwspxm3/"}
