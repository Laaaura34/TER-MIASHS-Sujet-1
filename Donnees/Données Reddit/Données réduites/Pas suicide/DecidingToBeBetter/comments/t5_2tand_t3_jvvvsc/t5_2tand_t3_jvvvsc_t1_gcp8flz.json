You fail and you try again. That\u2019s what life is..\n\nThis quote always helps me maybe it\u2019d be helpful to you as well- \u201c All of life is but practice, there\u2019s no performance.\u201d \nTo me it means even the olympian is practicing in the olympic event itself; in the event because today\u2019s a new day.  He needs to again work it all out. Practice makes better.\n\n\nKeep going you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jvvvsc/i_emptied_my_damn_amazon_cart/gcp8flz/"}
