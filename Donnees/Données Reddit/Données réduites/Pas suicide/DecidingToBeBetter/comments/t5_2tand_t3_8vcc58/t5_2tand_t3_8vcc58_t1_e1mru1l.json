Actually admitting it to yourself and worrying about it is a positive step, so don't despair.\n\n>whatever it is that keeps my mind busy. But once I stop for a minute  and just think, I feel that sense of desolation looming within me. \n\nI think you need to just sit down and let that emotion come to you and let it envelop you. It's painful and hard, but you need to accept it, because once you understand these feelings and meditate upon them, it'll help you immensely in finding out where it's coming from, and might to lead to epiphanies. If you have the time, I recommend Eckhart Tolle's Journey into Yourself. It really helped me be more aware of my feelings and that helped me get through some stuff.\n\nI can't help but feel admiration for you when reading your story. Admitting these things and being self-aware, going through rehab and working on yourself, and at the age of 18. You need to give yourself due credit.
