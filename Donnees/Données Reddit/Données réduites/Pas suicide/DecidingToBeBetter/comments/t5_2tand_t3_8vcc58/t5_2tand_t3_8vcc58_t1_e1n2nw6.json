Can you accept yourself when you make mistakes or do something embarassing? The answer needs to be Yes. Stop trying to impress anyone and just do and say what you want. Dont cling on to negative feelings or anxiety. Let go. Stop thinking so much and just Be, do what you feel like doing and say whatever you want...As long as you're being positive or even neutral, youll be fine at the very least. This can change your life, stop seeking validation, being outcome dependent. If you do good youll feel good but if you do bad youll feel bad. Fix that. Feel good regardless of the outcomes.
