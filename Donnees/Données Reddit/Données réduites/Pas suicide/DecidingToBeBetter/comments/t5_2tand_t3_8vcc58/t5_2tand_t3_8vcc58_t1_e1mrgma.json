You know what they are and that there\u2019s an underlying cause to your behaviors. So that\u2019s awesome. \n\nI\u2019d say take some time to really think about it. Be honest with yourself and think \u201cwhy do I need all these distractions?\u201d What are you running from? Why do you feel the need to run from it? \n\nReally think. if you start to panic and get to a place where you wanna push the thoughts away, just take a deep breath, calm yourself down, tell yourself it\u2019s okay, there\u2019s nothing to be afraid of, then keep going. You don\u2019t have to tell anyone, it\u2019s just your thoughts. It\u2019s probably something to do with your childhood or your family or something lol so good luck! This took so much maturity and that\u2019s awesome, it\u2019s fine to have some negative tendencies as long as you know you have to handle them, and you\u2019re working to handle them at a super young age. Haha your future is bright :^) \n\nEdit: also have you ever read catcher in the rye? This post reminded me of it haha. It\u2019s about a teenager going through some struggles like this. You might relate to it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8vcc58/my_life_feels_so_directionless_i_keep_running/e1mrgma/"}
