You don\u2019t have to have everything figured out yet, and tbh what you want in life will change as you get older.

I have 2 years sober and it\u2019s the best thing I\u2019ve ever done. :) It\u2019s okay to not know exactly what you\u2019re doing and it\u2019s okay to be figuring things out. \n\nDid you feel better after writing this post?
