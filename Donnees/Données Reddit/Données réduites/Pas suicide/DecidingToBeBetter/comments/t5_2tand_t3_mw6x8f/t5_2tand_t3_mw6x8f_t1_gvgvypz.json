For example, read the first page of a chapter. Make the deal that if you can read the first page, you'll take a break if you need to, but if you feel like you can do more you will. You'd be surprised how much easier it is once you get started moving.\n\nDon't get too bogged down with planning, outlining, and preparing. Some planning is important, but you have to dig into the real work for more time than you spend planning.\n\nFind more 'active' ways of working with the material you have to study. Paraphrase while you're reading (take notes), summarize things in your own words, make flashcards for things you need to remember, make practice tests for yourself. This will keep you more engaged and hopeful avoid some of the boredom / monotony.\n\nAlso, try to go easy on yourself. You know you're struggling and you're still trying to do your best. That's great.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mw6x8f/i_have_to_study_but_im_too_sad/gvgvypz/"}
