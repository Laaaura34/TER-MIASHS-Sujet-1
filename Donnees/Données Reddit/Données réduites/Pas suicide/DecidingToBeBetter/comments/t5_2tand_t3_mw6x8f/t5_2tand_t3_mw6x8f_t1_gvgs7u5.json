Given the things that are going on in this world and the state of mind we the people are in, you are giving your best and you are doing your best. Be proud of what you are. Acceptance of the fact that you can do better comes next. \n\nStart with smaller things. And be consistent with any routine, let it even be a small thing like giving a smile when you look into the mirror (not in a creepy way though, Lol).\n\nDress up even if you aren't planning to step outside. Start the day like you are going to accomplish and be grateful for the life we have and the day we get to change ourselves. \n\nAnd once you do these small things, you will automatically pick up your books and start reading. Coz then you will read for reading sake and not as a chore. \n\nCheers.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mw6x8f/i_have_to_study_but_im_too_sad/gvgs7u5/"}
