I didn\u2019t have much relationship experience so knowing they dated other people really killed me inside. I just imagined they were comparing them to me in all ways and I would literally hurt my own feelings. Apparently there\u2019s a word for it, retroactive jealousy. \n\nJust remember the person is with YOU not with them. They\u2019ve been with you for 3 years, that\u2019s a long time. If they wanted to be with their exes, they would be. If you\u2019re like me and have low self-esteem, I would highly recommend going to therapy. I am and it\u2019s changed my life. I still have a long way to go but it\u2019s a good start", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/os2hf1/how_do_i_stop_overthinking/h6lzgx9/"}
