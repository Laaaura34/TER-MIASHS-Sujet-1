You only just started therapy so six sessions is barely scratching the surface. It will sometimes get worse before it gets better because you\u2019re learning more about yourself and how deep it is. \n\nIt will take time and you will have ups and downs. But I promise you, it will get better. Being self-aware, especially of your negative patterns is a game-changer. You know you have retroactive jealousy which is connected to your low self-worth. You\u2019ve identified the problem which is already a step ahead then most people! \n\nTherapy will help you dive deeper into where that stems from and thus will help you combat it. I still struggle with low self-esteem but now I\u2019m highly aware of what my triggers are and I am working on avoiding them and also coping when I can\u2019t. It\u2019s helped me change my mindset and perspective. It\u2019s not easy, but over time it does get easier and more natural. \n\nBest of luck!
