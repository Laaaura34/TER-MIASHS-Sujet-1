It's the same as the Transcendental Meditation services you can pay for, but you really don't need to pay.\n\nFind yourself a short, \"nonsense\" mantra (I like \"Om Ah Hum\" - it's Tibetan, feel free to look it up, but it's not necessary to know what it means.) Sit alone for 5, 10 minutes and repeat the mantra to yourself in your head. Let thoughts like \"this is stupid\" and \"why am I doing this\" just come - just keep saying the mantra until the time is up.\n\nI've been doing this for a few months every morning now, and I've noticed a huge difference in my state of mind. It's kind of like controlling the boat on rocky seas. Your mantra is the North star. The boat will rock, the seas will be choppy, but just aim yourself at the mantra. The short time every morning kinda resets your mind/body. If you have time to slow down and focus on a mantra, your body will realize you are safe and that your brain doesn't need to fret so much.\n\nSlowly, you'll be able to distance yourself a bit from the big, scary thoughts. You can use your mantra whenever you want. Wherever I am, when I feel panicky thoughts come up, I go straight to the mantra, and everything loosens up a bit.\n\nBest wishes to you \ud83e\udd17", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/os2hf1/how_do_i_stop_overthinking/h6mhe0q/"}
