Maybe even use this as a foundation for a goal you want to complete in the future. Create a timeline with your goal at the end. Break it down into months and then weeks to stay motivated and keep yourself accountable. Record your wins ( this helps me when I'm feeling lazy or unproductive) and acknowledge your deltas (losses). Make it a personal challenge. You could even gamify it somehow. \n\nMaybe find a new group of friends, advanced further in your career, take a 3 month class for a hobby you enjoy, start a creative project, read some books, write a book, do a marathon/triathalon, start a business, create a course, travel. \n\nGood luck lol \ud83d\ude4c", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/c38vi3/im_devoting_three_months_to_self_improvement_what/erqukd6/"}
