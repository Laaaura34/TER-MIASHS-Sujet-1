I\u2019m glad it\u2019s helping you. Brains are so weird oh my god. I had terrible side effects from a lot of the medications I\u2019ve tried. Intrusive thoughts were at an all time high. I accidentally mixed one with an antihistamine and hallucinated(thankfully nothing scary). They just make my brain fizz out.\n\nMy body develops addictions fast so I don\u2019t even want to try Xanax. I grew up thinking marijuana was heroin and didn\u2019t try it until my doctor asked me to look in to it more and thankfully life has changed a lot. I got on a new anti depressant and so far it\u2019s the only one to ease symptoms. Celexa I think it\u2019s spelled. I\u2019m still worried side effects will show up pfft\n\nMy friend told me to ask about Ambien but It sounded too wild for me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fc5kry/set_a_time_limit_on_your_anxietydepressionbad/fjc0ftx/"}
