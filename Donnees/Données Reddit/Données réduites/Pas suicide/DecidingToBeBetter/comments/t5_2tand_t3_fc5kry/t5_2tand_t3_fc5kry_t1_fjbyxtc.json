It's a fuckton better than it was even a year ago. But when it comes, I have to be so gentle with myself. I had to learn this through hard experience because I always try to be so tough. I also have a tendency to compartmentalize, then never resolve shit. \n\nI hope now you understand why this strategy doesn't work for me. Time, sleep, self kindness. Depression can last for days and I can tell when it's chemical and when it's just a bad feeling.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fc5kry/set_a_time_limit_on_your_anxietydepressionbad/fjbyxtc/"}
