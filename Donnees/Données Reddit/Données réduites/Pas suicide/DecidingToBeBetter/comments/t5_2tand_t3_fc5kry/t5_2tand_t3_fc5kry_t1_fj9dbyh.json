I give it a one-week rule. It\u2019s where I let myself think about it and slowly analyse my feelings and emotions about it. If I\u2019m sad about it, I\u2019ll let myself be sad. If I\u2019m angry, then I\u2019ll let myself be angry. Slowly as I\u2019m releasing emotions and thought, I start to rationalise and see that maybe the incident wasn\u2019t as bad as I made it out to be or anticipated for it to be. Journaling about it helps too. Penning down whatever you\u2019re thinking in the moment, helps you step back from it all to see a bigger picture. I know one week is a relatively long time but it\u2019s worked out for me at least.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fc5kry/set_a_time_limit_on_your_anxietydepressionbad/fj9dbyh/"}
