You have no right to prescribe to me or anyone else how to deal with our depression. As if none of us have developed any coping mechanisms, or know what works for us.\n\nI love this \"learn to deal with your guilt\" BS. I have, dude. So not pushing myself too hard and setting myself up for failure is how I deal with it. This advice COULD help others, OR it could affect them as it does me. Is my experience not valid to you? I guess not. It's your way or no way. Great attitude to offer people trying to be better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fc5kry/set_a_time_limit_on_your_anxietydepressionbad/fjbuk6t/"}
