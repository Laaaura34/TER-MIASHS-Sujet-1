At the beginning it was weird. But once I started liking my body with hair (which is the way it's supposed to be) it was complete freedom. It feels so good. Fuck patriarchy. \nKudos to star being even more beautiful \u2764\n\nNonetheless, I tried not vaxing my face (upper lip/ mustache, never did brows) many times. Let it grow. But people just stare so much that it made me uncomfortable. And it was really hard to get laid - honestly. So that's my last barrier. The only thing I remove from my body.
