The only people who don't like it, are people I have no interest in knowing! It certainly never hindered my ability to date, fuck, or have boyfriends!

I do personally like to shave my armpits, because I find the hair holds onto sweat and starts to smell yucky. I'm still vain! Lol. And I shave my lip now that I'm older and the hair starting growing.
