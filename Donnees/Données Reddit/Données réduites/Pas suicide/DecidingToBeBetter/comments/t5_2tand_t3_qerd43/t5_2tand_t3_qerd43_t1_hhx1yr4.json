I had a couple things that helped. \n\n1) I liked music, lots of different types. But especially loud high energy stuff. \n2) I started copying people that I saw dancing that seemed like they were having the most fun. Usually they were dancing by themselves in their own world, so it wasn\u2019t weird to do the same stuff they were doing. Also I didn\u2019t have to engage with someone else until I felt like I was hitting a groove. \n\nThe more you practice the more it makes sense to your body and you can start jamming on your own outside of venues.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qerd43/how_do_you_learn_to_dance_without_feeling_like_an/hhx1yr4/"}
