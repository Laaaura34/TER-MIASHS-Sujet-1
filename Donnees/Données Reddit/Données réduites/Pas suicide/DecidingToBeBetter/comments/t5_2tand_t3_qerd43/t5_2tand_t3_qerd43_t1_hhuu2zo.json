The steps and movements will feel awkward because your body isn\u2019t used to moving that way. If you want to dance, then do it. My sister is a dance teacher and I can promise you, they\u2019re just happy that you want to learn, and the other students are too busy thinking about how weird and awkward they feel to worry about what you look like.\n\nGet into it!! Nobody is too old to dance, and it\u2019s one of the oldest most human things you can do. As long as you\u2019re enjoying moving your body, your dancing right \ud83d\udc83 Embody that joy you saw in your students, and you\u2019ll be amazed how much fun you\u2019ll have, and how far you can come in a year", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qerd43/how_do_you_learn_to_dance_without_feeling_like_an/hhuu2zo/"}
