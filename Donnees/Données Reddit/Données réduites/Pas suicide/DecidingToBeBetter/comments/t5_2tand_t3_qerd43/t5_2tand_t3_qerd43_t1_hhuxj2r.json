If it makes you feel better I was always a very awkward dancer as a kid, I never took to it naturally and was just very shy and self conscious and didn\u2019t actually want to be there. \n\nNow that I\u2019m an adult and actually choosing to be there, I can focus on repositioning my body/isolating my muscles rather than feeling like a goof and being overly conscious and embarrassed of how I look. Basically what I mean is the way you approach dance makes all the difference(viewing it as building a physical skill essentially the same as weight lifting or running correctly has worked for me now, rather than in the past where I focused on how I compared to the other dancers, usually people more experienced than me, for example)\n\nDancing is super fun, and an awesome way to work out because the time flies! I\u2019ve only done Latin/ballroom (like on dancing with the stars/strictly come dancing) so i can\u2019t speak from experience for jazz/ballet etc but any dancing is going to be a cardio workout and a leg day rolled into one at the very least. I hope you have the best time!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qerd43/how_do_you_learn_to_dance_without_feeling_like_an/hhuxj2r/"}
