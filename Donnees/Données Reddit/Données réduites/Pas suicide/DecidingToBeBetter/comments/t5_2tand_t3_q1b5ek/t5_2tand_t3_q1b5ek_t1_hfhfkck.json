That both helps keep my mind falling into a depressive spiral, and makes sure i actually do what I need to do. So like for example I need to vacuum right now, I haven\u2019t felt up for it, so every now and then I just do some other tidying around so that my house still gets cleaner. Obviously this is easier said than done. I\u2019m definitely still struggling with it, but it helps.\n\nI also started going to the gym regularly and thats done wonders for my mental wellbeing. I used to hate myself for wasting days or sit for hours depressed and unsure of what I want to do and end up doing nothing, but that\u2019s helped with both those things. You could try something similar, or even just going for a walk the same time each day. Just something to get out of the house, maybe get some fresh air.\n\nI\u2019m also on antidepressants right now. It\u2019s not for everyone, and the side effects when I first started them were bad, but it works for me. Definitely not a cure all though\n\nEdit: I still have bad days. It\u2019s gonna happen. But be kind to yourself when they do \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1b5ek/i_want_to_stop_falling_into_depressive_slumps_and/hfhfkck/"}
