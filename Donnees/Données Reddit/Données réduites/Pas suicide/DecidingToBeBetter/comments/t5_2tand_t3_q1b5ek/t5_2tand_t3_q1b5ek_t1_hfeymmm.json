In my case it\u2019s mostly unresolved trauma but there\u2019s other things I figure out as I work on it. In my experience working on deeper rooted issues has helped me to combat the depression and gain tools to keep it at bay for the most part. It\u2019s really hard to take a good hard look at yourself and dive deep, and it can be excruciatingly painful, but I can assure you from personal experience that in doing so you\u2019ll look back and be glad you did. There\u2019s plenty of help and resources out there to help guide you in the right direction, I know it\u2019s scary and seems impossible most of the time but I promise you have so much more strength than you realize.
