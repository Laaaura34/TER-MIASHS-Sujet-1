I\u2019m glad i came across to this post and see some great comments that may help a little. I\u2019ve been pulling off a lot of stuff i\u2019ve been wanting and needing to do. Then I thought i\u2019ll change my environment. I lay out hobbies i used to enjoy or wanting to do in a visible spot for me to see everyday. I move around my plants and made a comfortable space. It may not be much but it did help with my mood, knowing i can control what i put around me. A little task does make a difference. I hope you\u2019ll find what works best for you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1b5ek/i_want_to_stop_falling_into_depressive_slumps_and/hfe8x0q/"}
