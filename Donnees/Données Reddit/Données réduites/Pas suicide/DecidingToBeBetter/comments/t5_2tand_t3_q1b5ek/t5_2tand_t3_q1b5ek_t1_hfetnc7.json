The truth was, \"this is something that will always be with you\".  \n\nUp until then, I had always been trying to run from it. Once I accepted it, it allowed me to learn to live *with* it.   The best way I've found is by developing healthy daily routines that include meditation and exercise.  Try to start one healthy habit, and challenge yourself to keep it for 3 months straight.  No days off, no matter what. \n\nIt's not a perfect fix but it helps.  During the pandemic I let some of my habits fall away and I slipped into my deepest depression in a decade. I learned it is more about perseverance than perfection.  Also if you're able to seek couseling or therapy, I've heard that can be a world of help too. \n\nMy advice is be compassionate with yourself , don't beat yourself too bad, and find a few daily practices to give yourself momentum. There will be setbacks. Perseverance over perfection.   Start small, and work up from there. No matter what just keep going. In my experience, (and to steal your analogy): **Despite our best efforts to control it, the tide always rises. Try not to focus on the water, train to be a better swimmer.**\n\nI know it can be a hard place to be, but you *can* do this.  Best of luck, and if anything I can do to help, please let me know.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1b5ek/i_want_to_stop_falling_into_depressive_slumps_and/hfetnc7/"}
