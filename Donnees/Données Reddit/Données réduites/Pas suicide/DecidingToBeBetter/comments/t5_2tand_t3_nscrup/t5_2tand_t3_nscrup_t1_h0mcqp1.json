Oh, right, \u201cdeciding to be better.\u201d \n\nFunny how I found this post because I, too, was selfish in a relationship that ended because of me. I cheated on her, and we broke up. It\u2019s been 3 years. I haven\u2019t dated since, but I\u2019ve learned amazing things since then. One of the hardest things to overcome was the people- and the voice in my head- that told me I was permanently a selfish person. But as these 3 years have passed, I\u2019ve had this notion that MOST EVERYONE IS GOOD, even though we do bad things. You did a bad thing. You are not a bad person. \n\nI never fixed things with my ex. I apologized, but that\u2019s all I could do. I\u2019m never gonna get that girl back, and I\u2019ve had to deal with that. I\u2019ve also had to deal with the notion that there are many people who will NEVER even consider dating me because of my track record. But for every hard-hearted person out there, there\u2019s a person who forgives and forgets... I\u2019m sure of it. To be honest, I only want to be around the people who forgive (and this isn\u2019t just my guilt talking.)\n\nYou did a bad thing. (Or things)\nYou\u2019re not a bad person.\nDecide to be better.\nThings will get better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nscrup/i_21_m_was_selfish_and_destroyed_my_relationship/h0mcqp1/"}
