You seem very smart and introspective, which greatly helping in your recovery. I'm sure this was therapeutic for you to write and it helped me today to read it, even had a couple of laughs.\n\nI've been there and am there right now. The dark thoughts (not suicidal) have been a big part of my life and contributes a lot to my depression as well a my severe anxiety and panic disorder. I've just started touching on the subject with my therapist and it's pushed us into action with trying CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) together. It's going to be some tough work. All of the motivation and positive actions you've taken is inspiring.\n\nThanks for writing this today and good for you for your progression and successes! Keep it going!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cfdfee/my_experience_with_depression_and_my_road_to/eu9h7s5/"}
