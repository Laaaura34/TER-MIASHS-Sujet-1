Pretending you can is pointless. It's in fruit and vegetables. I cut my sugar intake by likely 90% and felt nothing different, the last bit that consists of 2 cookies is not going to be a night and day difference. For reference, I'm not overweight, not sedentary etc. I think people attribute being generally unhealthy to sugar and it's part of a much larger overall change in personal health that they attribute it to sugar.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pp6izw/gone_a_month_without_sugar/hd2tkjf/"}
