You still have a long way to go but the end is not your goal. The goal is the path that leads to where you want to end in life. \n\nI too am 22 and started when I was 19. I recently started my own business from scratch because I chose not to work for some boss. What I\u2019m trying to tell you is that within 3 years you can already have something.\n\nDo this: \n1. Making the decision to be the best version of yourself.\n2. Live in the moment. All there is is the generous present moment.\n3. Surround yourself with likeminded people.\n4. Stop caring and comparing what others think of you.\n5. Have a routine. This will create habits. Habits create succes. (Good habits)\n6. Invest in your mindset.\n7. Get enough sleep. Around 8 hours.\n8. Be positive. \n9. Wether or not you believe you can. Either way you are right.\n10. Be as happy as you can be!\n\nI hope this will help you man. You decide what your life will look like.\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kkcac9/its_too_late_to_start_is_better_say_goodbye_yall/gh23kf7/"}
