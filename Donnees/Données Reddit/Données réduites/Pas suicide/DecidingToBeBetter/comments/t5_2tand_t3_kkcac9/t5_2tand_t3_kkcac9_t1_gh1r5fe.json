You can never live tomorrow until it\u2019s here, and you can never relive yesterday. \n\nWhen I was trying to get my shit together, I would wake up and ask myself \u201cwhat is ONE thing I can do today to help make myself happier?\u201d\n\nTry and set a goal. Once a day, make one small step towards who you want to become. If you want to get fit, go for a walk every day. Want to learn a skill? Practice for 20 minutes every day. Do SOMETHING each day that puts you on the path towards where you want to be. Doesn\u2019t have to be some big huge thing. Just something small. Measurable. \n\nAlso, know when to go to bed and just call it a day. You can always start over in the morning and get another chance to make good choices.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kkcac9/its_too_late_to_start_is_better_say_goodbye_yall/gh1r5fe/"}
