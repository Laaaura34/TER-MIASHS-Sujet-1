There are hundreds of opportunities whether it's being a UPS driver (who make $30+/hr), a welder, cosmetology, cybersecurity, or a zoologist. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**you HAVE to do one thing to find out what you would rather prefer doing.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's hard seeing your parents grow up, I understand, both of my parents are in their late 40's with no retirement funds and I still fear what may happen when they decide to stop working, but that doesn't mean all hope is lost. **Motion before emotion**, no matter how shitty you feel, keep moving even if you're dragging your feet, you'll make it to the finish line if you just keep the momentum.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kkcac9/its_too_late_to_start_is_better_say_goodbye_yall/gh2cbw2/"}
