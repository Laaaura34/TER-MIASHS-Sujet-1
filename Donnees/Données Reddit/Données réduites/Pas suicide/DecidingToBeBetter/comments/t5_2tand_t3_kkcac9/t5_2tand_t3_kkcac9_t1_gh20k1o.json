Don't view your past with guilt, see it all as a learning lesson to make you a better you NOW.\n\nDon't compare yourself to them, only compare yourself to who you were yesterday? Why? Because you don't share the same history, past or future! For instance: perhaps they weren't depressed during their teenage years as you were. \n\nAlso, when you once again chase your goals, be careful! Make sure you are enjoying the journey and not just looking at the destination. Because to be anything, you have to suffer. It is all about choosing what you want to suffer from.\n\nI wish you the best!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kkcac9/its_too_late_to_start_is_better_say_goodbye_yall/gh20k1o/"}
