You can practice to not spend so much time in your head. Or figure out if certain lifestyle habits are making it harder for you to stay present/not in your head. Quality of sleep, diet, exercise, and human connections all can cause it or make it worse. For me I am the worst when I am feeling lonely, it\u2019s my number one trigger, and this whole social distancing thing has been really brutal.\n\nHope you find a way to turn your life in the direction that will make you happy :) you are not too late, that is one thing I am 100% sure about.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kkcac9/its_too_late_to_start_is_better_say_goodbye_yall/gh3x2ev/"}
