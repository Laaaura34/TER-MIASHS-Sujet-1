I am also 22 and all my friends are doing better in life except me who is just lost and confused. To make this worst my bf recently broke up with me so it really feels like my life is just continously going in a downward spiral.\n\nRight now I am trying to be better tho and I am starting to take things one day at a time. If you like reading books or listening to audio books, I suggest you try to look for The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, it kinda helps me in my struggle with how I see my dreams and my future. Focus on the present, and do something today that your future self will thank you for!  Best of luck! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kkcac9/its_too_late_to_start_is_better_say_goodbye_yall/gh2aym7/"}
