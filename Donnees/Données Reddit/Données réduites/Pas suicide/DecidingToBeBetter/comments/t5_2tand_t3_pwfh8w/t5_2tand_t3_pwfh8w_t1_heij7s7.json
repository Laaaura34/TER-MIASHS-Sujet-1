I guess i've been addicted to youtube for a lot of years now, since i was 10/12 yrs old. I have no problem with it tho, because i know that all of my peers waste more time on stuff like tiktok and Netflix. That is 10x more braindead content than what i watch on youtube, so i'm proud of myself. But it is a real problem, and i guess we just have to stop. Doing a full Dopamine Detox will help you find interest in your studies a lot easier. I need to do one soon, because else i'll deteriorate too lol. School and homework is getting harder, and i keep procrastinating by watching youtube and being on social media.. it sucks man, but it could be worse", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwfh8w/i_want_to_ditch_my_youtube_addiction_but_i_dont/heij7s7/"}
