You're on YouTube because you literally have nothing better to do. Occupy yourself with things that matter.\n\nAdditionally, I would start a new YouTube account.\n\nThen for a week or so focus on ONLY watching educational videos. Stuff related to your master, personal finance, psychology, personal development, business, etc. Anything that you think will be useful later on in your life.\n\nRight now the YouTube algorithm has trained you to keep watching useless shit. By doing the above YOU train IT to present you with videos that make you a better person. If you're gonna be on YouTube, better to have that time be spent usefully, right?\n\n(When you do want to look up some different things, do that in incognito mode, so you don't mess up your recommendations)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwfh8w/i_want_to_ditch_my_youtube_addiction_but_i_dont/heh1si4/"}
