It's just a start.\n\nYou could also switch to audiobooks. But don't do it while scrolling mindlessly on your phone.\n\nTry giving yourself other daily goals to accomplish (eg. workout, drink 2 litres of water, read 10 pages of a book, etc.). Make a diary to keep track of it and make sure you don't lie. At the end of the week, check how you did, and try to get better the next week. If you like an incentive driven approach, make a rule like \"I will only watch youtube if I complete all my daily goals today\". If you're competitive, do this with a friend or partner, share your progress with each other at the end of each week.\n\nP.S. if you are using Android, there is an app called Goal Tracker which has a widget with a very simple UI. It has helped me keep track of my self care habits and given me a lot of motivation to get better. I've successfully formed habits that I never thought I would. (For context, I used to be on youtube pretty much all day long)\n\nAll the best!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwfh8w/i_want_to_ditch_my_youtube_addiction_but_i_dont/hehbbl0/"}
