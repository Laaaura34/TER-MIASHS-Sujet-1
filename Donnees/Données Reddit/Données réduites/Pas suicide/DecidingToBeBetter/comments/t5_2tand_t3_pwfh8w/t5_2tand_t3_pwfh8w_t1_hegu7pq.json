Switch phones for a while. This is a heath and school-success issue. It's something you might be able to call addiction and needs attention. You feel like it's impacting your quality of life and you are compulsively indulging even tough you feel,it isn't benefiting you.\n\nYou will find that you can focus on school at school, and life when you are home. You will find new things to enjoy, like cooking a nice dinner and hand washing your pots and plates. Reading a fun book you picked up at the library on a whim. Walking downtown to pick up dinner. Hanging out with friends and family. Talking on the phone while doing chores. Walking under the trees as the season changes... Or watching youtube video after youtube video while the memory of your half-done paper and poorly scored recent test results tugs at the back of your mind\n\nYou can do this. You'll enjoy it! It will be all good and very little will be missed. There will be some adjustment pains the first few weeks, but I'd you stick to it the positive results will pay off well", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwfh8w/i_want_to_ditch_my_youtube_addiction_but_i_dont/hegu7pq/"}
