I have never been hateful ... but I have definitely argued with people to try to change their mind, aka, for no reason. I have tried to stop arguing on the internet, because it is impossible to have a nuanced argument in text.\nI save those \"discussions\" for face to face time.\n\nOn your point of not saying those things if you were face to face? That used to be the case(mostly). But people have said such hateful things for years on the internet, have seen a sitting president say hateful shit. They now feel it is ok to say that shit in a crowd. No matter what the consequences. \n\nOnce again,  good job. Some people never do feel any kind of concern or empathy for people not like themselves. They now classify them as the enemy.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0w1p3/i_hated_people_who_hated_me_then_i_hated_everyone/h20eyfu/"}
