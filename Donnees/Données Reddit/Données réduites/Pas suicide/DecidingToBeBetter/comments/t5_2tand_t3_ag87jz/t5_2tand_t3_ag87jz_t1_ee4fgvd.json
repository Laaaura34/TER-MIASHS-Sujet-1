But yes I'm sure you can find a few things to do during your day, I think it's really important that these routine things are focused on activities for yourself, that you do alone or with someone u appreciate, like exercising, relaxation, tidying to make your place feel nicer to you etc. For me it acts as a way to really take intimate time with myself, to learn how to appreciate myself, and it's rewarding because these things you do also have a positive effect on your health (exercise) or looks (skin care routine for example) so it encourages you to keep going. I guess even adding one or two routines is already enough if you are very busy! \n\nI wish you the best!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ag87jz/i_set_up_a_routine_and_its_helping_me_feeling/ee4fgvd/"}
