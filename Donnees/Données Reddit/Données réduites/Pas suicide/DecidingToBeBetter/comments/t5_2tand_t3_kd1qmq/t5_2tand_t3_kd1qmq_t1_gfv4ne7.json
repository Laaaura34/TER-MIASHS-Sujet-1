Instead do things in a new way, even if it\u2019s just sitting in a different chair or a different room. When I first quit I started spending lots more time cooking because that was something I didn\u2019t do while smoking so I was in the kitchen a lot and it felt like a fun new thing. I\u2019d eat then I\u2019d go to bed very early and read for hours before I went to sleep. If I sat in the normal place I felt like I was trying not to smoke but if I did these new things it just felt like I was doing something different and fun and it didn\u2019t feel as weird to not be getting stoned. After I\u2019d lost the habit of smoking I didn\u2019t continue cooking as much (although I did learn some new recipes) and I\u2019ve rarely read in bed since, but those small changes in behaviour made it so much easier to break the habit in the first month or so.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kd1qmq/im_starting_my_nonweed_journey_from_now_on_cheer/gfv4ne7/"}
