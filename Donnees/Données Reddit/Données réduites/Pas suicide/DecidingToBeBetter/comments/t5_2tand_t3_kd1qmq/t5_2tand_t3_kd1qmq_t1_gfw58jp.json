Keep being active which helps generate endorphins to to help you releases dopamine naturally. Keep drinking water  which helps flush out toxins prohibiting you from maintaining peak performance. If you feel side tracked or not your usual self, it\u2019s all a process. My #1 advice is journaling. There\u2019s no quick resolution! The higher power is always with you! No matter how low or how positive your feeling always stay connected with the higher power. God is my savior and he sure is many others because we are his children. Stay out the negativity and think positively, start small with what your grateful for and continue to build and elaborate as it will help you maintain order in your life and realize your in a better situation than others. Always reach out to your loved ones and close friends who dearly care about you, not your smoking buddies who only use you for a convo whenever your high. Hope you manage to benefit from something I said , good luck in your progress!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kd1qmq/im_starting_my_nonweed_journey_from_now_on_cheer/gfw58jp/"}
