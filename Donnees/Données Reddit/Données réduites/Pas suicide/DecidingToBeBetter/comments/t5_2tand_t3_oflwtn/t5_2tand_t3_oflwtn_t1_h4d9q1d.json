That was a huge first step for me. I got into action sports and when I\u2019m at a skatepark or surfing I\u2019m extremely present. Being in the moment and so caught up in what\u2019s happening around you turns off the negative thoughts for a bit. When you\u2019re out there having fun you feel good about yourself and develop more self worth as you do it more\n \n\nThis can be any outdoor hobby that you can get caught up in. Shooting hoops at a local park, learning how to skate, mountain biking, etc. You don\u2019t have to be good or very athletic. It\u2019s about having fun and getting better than you were a week or a year ago\n\nOnce you break a barrier like this and find something you can excited about you obsess over it a bit and it can occupy some of your mental time which takes away from the negative thoughts", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oflwtn/how_to_accept_that_feeling_good_is_possible/h4d9q1d/"}
