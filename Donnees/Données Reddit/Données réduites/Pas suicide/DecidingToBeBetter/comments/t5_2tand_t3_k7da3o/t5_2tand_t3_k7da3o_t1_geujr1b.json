I\u2019d love to be able to read more like once a week maybe but I find it difficult to fit it in my schedule (although if I start to wake up earlier, I\u2019ll probably have more time). \n\nI\u2019m lucky that I have my teeth care routine down pat as that is pretty much what I do for a living and I\u2019m happy with my skin care routine. \n\nThank you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k7da3o/2021_12_month_challenge/geujr1b/"}
