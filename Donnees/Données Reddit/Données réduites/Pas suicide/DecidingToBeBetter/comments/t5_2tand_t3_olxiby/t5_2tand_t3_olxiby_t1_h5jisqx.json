I will give it a watch. Trying to be easy on myself. The hard part is, no one is pushing me, no one is on me about any of it. Its all internal. I want to be better for my family. I want to make sure I help my parents retire and they don't have to keep working. My father is in his 60's and mother in late 50's. I just want to help them since they gave so much to me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/olxiby/battling_depression_anxiety_and_fillers/h5jisqx/"}
