There are a lot of ways to go about it.  An easy way is to start being honest when you just have a bad day.  You don't have to go into details but when someone in that group asks how your day was then simply reply honestly instead of the habitual \"Fine\".  It's a start.  It may get people asking questions and you can decide how much you want to go into in the moment.  Let yourself be a bit uncomfortable but don't give yourself a panic attack over it.  It will get easier with time.\n\nAnother thing I sometimes do is if I have to share something I am uncomfortable with  I just say it as nonchalant as possible.\n\nOne of my favorite books on dealing with dysfunction we inherited through childhood is How To Do the Work by Nicole LePera, if you are into that sort of thing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q6n4xq/being_more_open_and_vulnerable/hgcylfq/"}
