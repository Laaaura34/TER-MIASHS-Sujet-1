I'm in school for Computer Science, and spend almost the rest of my time on that. I average 6 hours of sleep and about 2 hours of personal time for exercise, eating, taking care of the household, and stuff like that. The rest of the time I am working on classes. Saturday and Sunday I usually spend 4-6 hours of quality time with my wife and child. So if I had to average, 44 hours of work and school per week, because I still do school work on weekends.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lefcd6/life_is_better_with_purpose_create_yours/gmcvwqc/"}
