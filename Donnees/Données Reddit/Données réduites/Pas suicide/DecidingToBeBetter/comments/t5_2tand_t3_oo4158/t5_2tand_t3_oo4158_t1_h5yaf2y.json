This might help I know it did for me. I once heard a speaker say it\u2019s better to do something for a short period of time rather than not at all! So let\u2019s say technically your supposed to brush twice a day two minutes each. Instead you brush for 15sec or even 30sec, at least you made the attempt and it was better than not doing it all! Small steps can lead to greater outcomes down the line. Also I was in braces for almost 5 yrs, believe me when I say brushing is not the most fun thing to do. But, it\u2019s worth it. I believe in you, small steps!! \ud83d\udc4d", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oo4158/dental_hygiene_brushing_teeth/h5yaf2y/"}
