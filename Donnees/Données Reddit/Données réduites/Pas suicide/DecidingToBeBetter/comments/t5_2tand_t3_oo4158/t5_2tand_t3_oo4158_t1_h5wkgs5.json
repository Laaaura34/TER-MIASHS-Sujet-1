At the bathroom sink I keep my electric toothbrush and two tubes of toothpaste I randomly pick from.  They're both Crest, but one is a strong minty whitening and the other is all purpose.  I have tried other brands,  but keep coming back to Crest. \n\nIn the shower I keep my manual toothbrush and Crest Kids Rainbow Sparkle.  The flavor is much less minty and a bit sweet.  So when I shower it's a  \"treat\" to brush lightly, gargle like crazy and feel super clean coming out of the shower.   \n\nI don't necessarily brush 4 times a day, but the randomness and variety of different have taken the monotony and chore out of brushing.   \n\nWishing you continued success. Splurge on some toothpastes you like!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oo4158/dental_hygiene_brushing_teeth/h5wkgs5/"}
