I did my dissertation on how depression and anxiety impacts oral health, as someone who has had their fair share of those things let me tell you even those in the job aren't angels, and I got into the role after years of neglecting my own teeth when I was younger.\nYour teeth and gums will thank you, as will your whole body! We're finding more connects to our oral health than we first thought, so it's awesome you've made these changes.\nIf you slip, be kind to yourself, and if you only brush once, make it at night, as this is when our saliva flow rate slows and we lose some of the buffering and protection against bacteria, so having clean teeth before bed is best. \nKeep up the great work, 10 days is a good way to it becoming a habit.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oo4158/dental_hygiene_brushing_teeth/h5xhj0u/"}
