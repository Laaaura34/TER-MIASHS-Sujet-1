Not as severe in intensity as an opioid withdrawal and it depends on the amount, frequency, and how long you\u2019ve been smoking. For very heavy users who\u2019ve been smoking multiple times a day for years, they have a high chance of developing [cannabis withdrawal syndrome](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=https://cme.csam-asam.org/sites/default/files/17%2520Cannabis%2520Withdrawal%2520Syndrome%2520-%2520Budney%25202004.pdf&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NqZQYciTPMKbywSX34PQCQ&scisig=AAGBfm20gTATamDEB5GM8kIelhUY54611Q&oi=scholarr) and [cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/c/cannabinoid-hyperemesis-syndrome.html).\n\nSource: a pothead who smoked a 3 grams of concentrate a week for almost a decade, currently in rehab and starting Marijuana Anonymous. \n\nIf anyone has a hard time quitting weed, I\u2019d highly recommend rehab and going to a Marijuana Anonymous meeting. If you need help quitting, there\u2019s no shame for asking for help.\n\nI also recommend trying to figure out why they\u2019re using (usually from an adverse childhood experience). For me it was running from my anxiety and depression caused by suppressed sexual trauma and emotional neglect from when I was young. I was self medicating and it worked for years until it didn\u2019t and made me more paranoid and get really bad panic attacks/nausea. \n\nIf you just quit weed or any drug and not do the work on dealing with your emotions and your past, I can guarantee your addiction will come out in other ways (whether that\u2019s other drugs including alcohol, sex, gambling, shopping, video games etc. [addiction transference]).\n\nI\u2019m all for the legalization of marijuana and decriminalization of drugs but I don\u2019t agree with people who think weed is harmless. For some people it will be, but everyone\u2019s body and chemistry is different. I\u2019m worried that there will be a generation of kids (who are already dealing with so much as it is) who won\u2019t know how to deal with their shit and navigate life without needing a fix to get through their day.\n\nIf my story resonates with anyone, or just need someone to talk to, PM me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvhd7f/please_help_weed_is_killing_me/hed2a85/"}
