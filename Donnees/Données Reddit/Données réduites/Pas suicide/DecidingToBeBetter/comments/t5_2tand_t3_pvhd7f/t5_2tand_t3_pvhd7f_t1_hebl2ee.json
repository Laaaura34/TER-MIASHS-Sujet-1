I still eat edibles from time to time or have a toke or 2 but I'm no longer addicted. Honestly I know this advice sounds unhelpful but you just have to stop. Get rid of your paraphernalia, delete your dealer's number, and just power through the withdrawals. It also helps to replace it with something else, I got myself a vape and I smoke cherry or strawberry flavoured clouds instead. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvhd7f/please_help_weed_is_killing_me/hebl2ee/"}
