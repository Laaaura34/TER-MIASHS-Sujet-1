Getting more light in your life is the only way to get rid of the darkness.\n* Throw away all smoking-related stuff.\n* Try getting a decent sleep schedule. Start by stopping to smoke in the evening. THC really messes up your biorhythm.\n* Avoid friends who smoke for a bit. It will be harder to quit if you surround yourself with temptations.\n* If you smoke weed combined with tobacco, the addiction might be for tobacco, not weed.\n* Find another friend who is serious about quitting, focus on it together. Some support and social interaction can go a long way.\n* Finally, don't think that one joint or one puff won't hurt. It will.\n\nIt's all about being able to resist the temptation and for that you need to be strong minded. You can train this by meditating, having a decent sleep schedule etc. I can't stress my first point enough. Try getting to a better place first before quitting.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvhd7f/please_help_weed_is_killing_me/hebzpul/"}
