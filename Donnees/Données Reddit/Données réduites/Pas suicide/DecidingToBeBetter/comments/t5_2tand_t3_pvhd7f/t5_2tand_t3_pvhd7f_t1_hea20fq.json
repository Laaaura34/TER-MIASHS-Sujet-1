This is probably the hardest, quitting is easy but to reduce intake is where the major work is. There is no amount of high that one blunt can't solve. Start my smoking alone, if you manage to smoke a blunt by yourself a day, try smoking a blunt for a week. You need build a habit of not constantly chain- \nsmoking, cause you are indirectly telling your brain that you are forming a new habit. As time goes on, trust me you will even smoke a blunt a month and before you know it, you've quit. I'm a living witness, this is how I quit smoking weed. Above all I moved away from friends that also smoked because I decided to take my journey serious. If you really mean it to quit, take a step today and start making changes. \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvhd7f/please_help_weed_is_killing_me/hea20fq/"}
