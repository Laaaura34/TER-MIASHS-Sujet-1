You don\u2019t need to stop being friends with them, but you should stop putting yourself around weed and enabling yourself for the time being. There\u2019s a myth that being strong-willed and having great self control are what make people successful, but it\u2019s actually just people not putting themselves in a scenario where they ever have to utilize self control in the first place. If your main problem were losing weight then you would quit working in a bakery. Your friends will understand if they are really your friends.\n\nSecond is, the addiction of using drugs is more of a habit than many realize. Stay occupied with things that you feel really stimulate your mind, things that you can kind of get lost in just doing. Whether that\u2019s reading or playing video games or drawing, if it\u2019s something that you feel makes time go by fast, that\u2019s exactly what will be really good for your brain to relearn how to dedicate itself full time to activities without needing to be high. It\u2019s extremely surprising how much of alcohol and drug abuse is caused largely by being bored and having no real passions.\n\nThird, nobody commenting here is a fucking doctor, so take everything you read with a grain of salt. Seek professional help and therapy, please. There\u2019s no shame in it. Hugely powerful, and will enable you to make progress beyond what you alone are capable of. Do not deny yourself the opportunity to get help from people who want to help you.\n\nBest of luck.\n\nEdit: grammar", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvhd7f/please_help_weed_is_killing_me/hebd9oh/"}
