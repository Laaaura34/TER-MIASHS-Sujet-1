Also, once you\u2019ve calmed down, apologize to your brothers and tell them that\u2019s the wrong way to treat people. Let them know you\u2019re trying to get better.\n\nYou can also tell them that you are close to losing your temper and it would help you calm down by whatever: playing in another room, being more quiet, watching a movie or show, etc. now this isn\u2019t a solution but a gentler threat because they\u2019re not responsible for your behavior. This will just help you while you try other things to help yourself.\n\nIf they respond to this, then try just saying \u201cIt would really help me right now if you could [alternate behavior]\u201d. Then it\u2019s not a threat. This part is important, reward them after you\u2019re in a better place and let them now it really helped and thank them. Then break out popsicles, play a video game with them, give them the attention they\u2019re unsuccessfully trying to get with their current behavior.\n\nStart meditating, YouTube and Netflix have videos to help you. Being in the moment will help you change your reactions.\n\nI\u2019m much older than you and found this out much later than you. I\u2019m proud of you for asking the questions and the effort to improve yourself. You can do this!\n\nP.S. check out r/BehavioralMedicine .
