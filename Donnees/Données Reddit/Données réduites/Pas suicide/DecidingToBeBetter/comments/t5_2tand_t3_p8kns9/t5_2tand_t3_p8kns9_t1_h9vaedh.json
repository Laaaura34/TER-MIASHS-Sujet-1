While this is certainly nothing to feel any shame about, I can see how emotionally a lack of experiences in this area would feel like a missed opportunity.\n\nYou sound like a very capable person based on your description - from what I can tel here the only thing that has really set you back is your own mother\u2019s dependence on you. To be clear, it is a GREAT thing you have been so kind to your mother. On the other hand; you are absolutely correct, this is a very unusual circumstance.\n\nNow I\u2019m still missing the question - are you asking how to start getting some of those experiences sexually/romantically? That\u2019s super easy (especially since you\u2019re tall/built well). Download Tinder and Hinge, upload the best quality pictures you have and start swiping. Really nothing more to it than that. Go meet people and have a few hookups, and keep your eyes peeled for a relationship along the way. The details of this can be more granular (how do I ask someone out, how do I get their number, where do we go for a first date, etc), but these are the very specific questions that I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re asking. Are you looking for advice in these more specific areas?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p8kns9/missed_out_on_my_20s_need_help_on_where_to/h9vaedh/"}
