I was a fat kid. When I was in 7th grade I joined the cross country team. After one of the first practices I ran two miles and then another half a mile home. I had never ran anywhere near that far and I came inside super excited to tell someone. My sister and her boyfriend were there and they said, \"There is no way you ran that far, you're way too fat, stop lying.\" And some other insults. I never got any encouragement from anyone and the coach didn't seem to want me around either. Sorry to vent this here lol. Appreciate what you have because some people were raised by wolves!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jjqauf/came_back_from_my_run_this_morning_to_my_mom/gagtwkm/"}
