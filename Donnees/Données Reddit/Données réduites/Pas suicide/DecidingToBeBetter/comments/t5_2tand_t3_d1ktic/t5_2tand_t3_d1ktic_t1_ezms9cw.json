It's my senior of high school. So my schedule is packed so I'll pump these out as fast as I can, but I can probably only do 1-2 posts a month. I also want to do a side project, like start a podcast or Twitch stream, taking about different topics like self development, Social issues, Q and A's. I prefer Twitch because it's a lot more interactive. Please give me some feedback. For new viewers I have older summary posts.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/d1ktic/grant_cardone_100_ways_to_stay_motivated_summary/ezms9cw/"}
