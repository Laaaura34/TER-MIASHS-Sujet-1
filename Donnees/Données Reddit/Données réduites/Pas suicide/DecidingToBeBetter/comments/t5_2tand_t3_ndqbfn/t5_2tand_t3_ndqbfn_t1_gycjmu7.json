It was written to function as a guidebook for application of stoic principles to morality and self conduct. If you're interested in some direct examples of Stoicism being applied to worldly issues, I'd recommend \"Letters from a Stoic\" by Seneca, where he gives advice to his pen pal.\n\nPeople will probably encourage you to read \"Meditations\" by Marcus Aurelius but I am not a big fan as it was not intended to be read by other people and was his private memoirs, so your mileage may vary with what you get out of it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ndqbfn/im_done_with_letting_people_make_me_feel_like_a/gycjmu7/"}
