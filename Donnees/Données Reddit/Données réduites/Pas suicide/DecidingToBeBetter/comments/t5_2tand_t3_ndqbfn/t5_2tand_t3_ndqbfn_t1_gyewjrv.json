He tells it like it is\u2014a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*k is his antidote to the coddling, let\u2019s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.\n\nManson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited\u2014\"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault.\" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.\n\nThere are only so many things we can give a f*k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.\u201d\n\nIf you want more book recommandations don\u2019t hesitate to DM me..\n\nJe suis avec toi mon fr\u00e8re.\n(I will make updates of books after I arrive at home).", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ndqbfn/im_done_with_letting_people_make_me_feel_like_a/gyewjrv/"}
