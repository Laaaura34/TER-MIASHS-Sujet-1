Are you human? You could use some therapy. You don\u2019t need to be abused, broken, hurting, sad, angry, confused, lonely or anything. Just find a certified therapist (I personally prefer actually MD\u2019s) and go talk. \n\nWhy? You\u2019ll learn a ton about yourself and how you operate. This understanding will give you superpowers in your life. You\u2019ll be more successful, find life more rewarding and just plain easier. \n\nSource: someone who did a psychoanalysis for 6 years 4x / week plus several more years at 1X / week.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jh8m75/stop_telling_yourself_you_dont_need_therapy/g9zcem1/"}
