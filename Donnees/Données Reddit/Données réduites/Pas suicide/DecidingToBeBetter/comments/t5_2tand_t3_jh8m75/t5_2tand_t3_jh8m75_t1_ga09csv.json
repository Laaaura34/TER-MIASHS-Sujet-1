I lost my father when I was 13, my house burned down 2 months prior. That year changed my life forever, I thought for the better till now. I have major trust issues because of the life style I was in before now. I went to therapy when I went through a divorce but didn't give it very much effort. Now, I'm tired of fighting my mental battles that I thought I had control over. I honestly cannot thank you enough for this post as I'm going through a diagnosis of potential bipolar or ptsd and I'm 33. It has literally taken 20 years to let go and say, \"I can't do this alone anymore, I need professional help.\"", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jh8m75/stop_telling_yourself_you_dont_need_therapy/ga09csv/"}
