Mine is through a university, they offer sliding scale treatment as part of their therapist training program.\n\nThat is also just one of the sliding scale places near me. I'm not sure what kind of research you've done into it on your area or if you only found the one place, but many mental health centers, college programs, or community counciling centers offer some form of free or reduced cost therapy. I do live in a fairly well populated area, but I hope there is something available near you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jh8m75/stop_telling_yourself_you_dont_need_therapy/ga43th5/"}
