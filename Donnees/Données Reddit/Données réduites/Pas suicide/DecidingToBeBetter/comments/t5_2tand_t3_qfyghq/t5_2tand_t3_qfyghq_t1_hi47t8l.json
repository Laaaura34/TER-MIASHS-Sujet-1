We heavily emphasise on the importance of succeeding the tasks. As a result, we think, \"well, we didn't try do this explains why I did poorly\", but we get so depressed when we try so hard, and yet not succeed. That idea that we try and fail will brings up all the negative feelings we have, e.g. Anxiety, stress, etc etc. \n\nWays to improve severity of procrastination for myself: I put less importance on the task which encourages to try and if I fail, it's not the end of the world, and don't focus on \"success\" of being better than others (I'm really competitive), but start competing against myself (achievement focused instead). Also, removing all distractions within reach, e.g. Uninstalling Facebook, Instagram, and reddit during weekdays, and reinstalling it on Friday night.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfyghq/all_i_do_is_procrastinate_and_when_i_try_to_study/hi47t8l/"}
