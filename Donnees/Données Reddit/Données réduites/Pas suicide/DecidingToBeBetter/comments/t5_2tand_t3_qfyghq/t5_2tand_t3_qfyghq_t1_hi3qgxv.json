Though I've also recently found that I'm a little more productive with no sounds or earphones in at all \n\nI also used to go to the library to try to study, mostly just cause I either didn't want people to judge my taste in YouTube videos, or I felt guilty for wasting a charging dock for laptops when others needed one for study or work. I always got too awkward to switch my screen if I had the feeling people were essentially looking over my shoulder \n\nAnd after all that, I still get distracted too easily, but those have helped a bit with giving me short boosts of productivity", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfyghq/all_i_do_is_procrastinate_and_when_i_try_to_study/hi3qgxv/"}
