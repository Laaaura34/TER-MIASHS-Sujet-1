If so, you can join one of the online accountability communities. I use Focusmate.\n\nTry reaching out to other friends and committing to working on something at the same time. This is Focusmate offline.\n\nYou could try something like the Pomodoro technique to get started, so you know you're getting a break soon. \n\nIf you like to compete against yourself, try the Productivity Challenge app. It has helped me at times.\n\nUsually, getting started is the hardest part. There could be some other underlying issue. Someone mentioned ADHD, but depression can look like this as well. I'm sure there are other diagnoses as well. Contact a doctor, if you think you're dealing with a deeper issue.\n\nAnything you do at this point should be considered a win.
