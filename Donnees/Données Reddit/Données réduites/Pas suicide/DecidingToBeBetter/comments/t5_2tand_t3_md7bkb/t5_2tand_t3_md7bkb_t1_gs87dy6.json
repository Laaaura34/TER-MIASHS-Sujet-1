If you want a 2nd drink chug another big glass of water and wait five minutes. It will slow you down on the in take and fill you up plus keep you more sober. Besides its just a good habit to have we don't drink enough water anyway.\n\nFor the porn if you get the urge dont cave! try to tug it out only using your imagination its how our forefathers did it and they were stronger men than we are. Im new to this one but what im trying. Im thinking if I fight off viewing porn and work that imagination muscle enough ill have self directed porn everywhere I go! Or ill just have the drive to get laid more  but both are good. \n\nSide note I got recently from a buddy about working out. Just do 1 set of 25 push-ups, 25 sit ups, and 25 squats every day first time you think about it (right now). It takes less than five minutes you don't need to change or go anywhere and you accomplished something that day. You can add edit and make it your own when it doesn't feel like a chore anymore but for right now take that win.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/md7bkb/how_can_i_spend_my_free_time_instead_of_drinking/gs87dy6/"}
