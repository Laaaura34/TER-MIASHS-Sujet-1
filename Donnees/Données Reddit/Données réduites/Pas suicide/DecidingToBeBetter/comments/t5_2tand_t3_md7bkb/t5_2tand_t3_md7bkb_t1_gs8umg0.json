When you don\u2019t know how to help yourself- start with helping others. Try maybe volunteering for cats/dogs shelters or some people organizations that might need help. Yea it\u2019s your free time but I can tell you from experience that it\u2019s soooo fulfilling!\n\n2. Read books. You\u2019ll become richer in your mind and in your life. \n\n3. Go outside, sit in the park, look UP in the skies.\n\n4. Just try to remember that YOU ARE AND EVERYTHING AROUND YOU IS A MIRACLE! \nJust think about it,  the sun is shining every day for you, you have plenty of beauty and nature around you, your body is an amazing organism that helps you see, hear, taste, talk, touch,move yourself from place to place, FEEL!!!\nYou are enough! Many people would DREAM about having your body and your life.\n\n5. Work out! Invest in your body, it\u2019s your best friend! Take long walks with good music, take out the energy you keep while you\u2019re at home.\nWhen you\u2019re feeling depressed or bored- do something for your body. Jump for 10 mins, run or do some stretching. Your body will thank you! Your body is your best buddy. Choose to feed your body with the best foods and choose to cherish it! \n\nSure, now life seems boring and unfair and you\u2019re used to one thing but that stupid pandemic ruins plans... well, hardships always come and go. Sunlight ALWAYS shows up after the storm is finished \ud83d\ude1c\nSo,instead of focusing on removing the darkness- try to light yourself and shine on!! \n\nYou are enough! \ud83d\ude0d\nLove yourself", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/md7bkb/how_can_i_spend_my_free_time_instead_of_drinking/gs8umg0/"}
