I feel the same about many books, you\u2019re practically reading into peoples life stories and years of experience. Many of us go through similar things whether we realize it or not, in one way or another. You articulated it perfectly, couldn\u2019t have said it better myself. Beautiful world out here it\u2019s all perspective & what you make it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nnkakj/life_lessons_from_the_black_sheep_of_society/gzvu2nq/"}
