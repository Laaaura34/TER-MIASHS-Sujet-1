In many different ways. You can love your friends, family, significant other, your pets (I have a German shepherd puppy that likes to be cuddled 24/7 lol that\u2019s love also). Love is really everything, to your last line I agree people can get this rush and etc but generally when I do good things I don\u2019t ever do them with the intention I\u2019m getting anything back. As an example I once starved and have a connection to food, I can\u2019t stand to see someone starve. I\u2019ll do whatever I can to make sure someone eats even if I don\u2019t know them and notice. I don\u2019t ever want anything back or even any good karma etc. It\u2019s just the pure intention for someone to care about another. Energy is contagious, live righteous. Love does exist in many ways, it\u2019s definitely real & I feel the core of our experience as humans. I didn\u2019t even think anyone would read this post but the amount of love and positivity I\u2019ve received back from it literally made my day and inspired me to continue writing and much more, that\u2019s love it\u2019s universal. Keep a positive, light hearted mind state and be your self, the right individuals will align. Everything happens on its own timing all you\u2019ve got to do is plant the seeds. A small intention can go a long way.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nnkakj/life_lessons_from_the_black_sheep_of_society/gzxjj6k/"}
