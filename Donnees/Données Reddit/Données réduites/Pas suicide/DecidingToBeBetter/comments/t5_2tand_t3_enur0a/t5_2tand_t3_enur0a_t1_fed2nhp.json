If OP, as a man, simply and only wrote what you said, he'd get the exact same support as a female OP would (get a divorce, hit the gym etc). Yeah, this is Reddit, 90% of relationship advices are \"you deserve better, break up with him/her, relationships can't be fixed\" etc. OP never said how much time has already passed since those events happened. Sometimes you need the person next to you to be your reality-check. Maybe she's been supportive for who knows how long, and can't stand it anymore. Your point, in the linked comment, is basically saying \"yeah, keep feeling bad, don't improve yourself for someone else\". Let's say OP likes to gamble. He says \"yeah, gambling is so much fun, sometimes I lose our family's money and then we all suffer, but it's fun\". Would it still be okay, in your earlier point, for OP's wife to be \"supportive, in better or worse\"? I know it's not the same, but you get my point. This was his wake-up call, and even the OP himself said that he'll get better himself not depending on if they'll stay together or get divorced.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/enur0a/i_finally_actually_listened_to_my_wife/fed2nhp/"}
