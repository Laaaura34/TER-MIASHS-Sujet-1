The you she knew, she loves this you but as you said, can only watch you deteriorate so much. I\u2019m happy you took it upon yourself to get better for yourself, your daughter, her and your late father.\n I know I\u2019m a random woman, but I\u2019d like to extend my encouragement to you. Making an effort to focus on bettering yourself while grieving is difficult, but you\u2019ve made the decision and that should be your first win! \n\nThe good people of Reddit are here for you. Get help where you can. Thank her for the talk and Godspeed, fellow human. \n\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/enur0a/i_finally_actually_listened_to_my_wife/fe62c5m/"}
