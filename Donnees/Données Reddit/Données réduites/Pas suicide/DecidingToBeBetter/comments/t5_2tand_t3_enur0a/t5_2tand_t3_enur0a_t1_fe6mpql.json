Grief can make any person into a snarling beast. It can make someone do pretty crazy things. Thank God your wife stuck by you, and thank God you started to listen to her.\n\nAfter my Dad's death my Mom alienated everyone who tried to help her, and then put half of her life savings into a financial pyramid. She only snapped out of her downward spiral when she lost that money. \n\nYou want to get better. That's a really good start. I would recommend using your family and friends as a kind of mirror. They love you. They won't manipulate you into something that would turn out to your detriment. If you start feeling angry and snappy, try to put into words the things that make you feel so. I find that for me the \"I statements\" work really good. Ie *\"I am feeling angry right now, because she advised me not to buy that thing, and that makes me feel like she doesn't trust me with my own finances,\"* or something like that. \n\nDon't stop yourself from expressing positive feelings to your wife. Tell her you love her, tell her when you are happy about something. I know from my own experience how disheartening it can be, when a person you love so much starts spiraling down, and you can't do anything to help. Expressing your positive feelings will both help you contextualize them and help her recognize that the situation is not hopeless. \n\nDealing with grief is not a minute thing. It will take time. Don't stop, don't be afraid to say when you are sad, or desperate, or hurting. If you can find a therapist, good, if not - remember, you are not alone.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/enur0a/i_finally_actually_listened_to_my_wife/fe6mpql/"}
