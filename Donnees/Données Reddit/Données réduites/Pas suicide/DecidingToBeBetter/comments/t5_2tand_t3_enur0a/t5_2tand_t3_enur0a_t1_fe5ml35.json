I'm proud of you :)\n\nI like the once-a-week start small approach myself. Small achievable goals. Once you start feeling more comfortable at the gym, it's easier to go. Better than making it seem like a chore and a to-do list. Soon it'll make you feel good and you'll want to go!\n\nAt least that's how it's worked for me, with a start small approach.\n\nKeep going forward brother.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/enur0a/i_finally_actually_listened_to_my_wife/fe5ml35/"}
