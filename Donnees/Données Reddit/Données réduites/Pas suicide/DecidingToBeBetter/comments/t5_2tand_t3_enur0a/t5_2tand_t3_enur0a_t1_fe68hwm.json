Thank you for posting and sharing yourself.  I\u2019m a traditional person. Men should listen to their wives!   After my dad died and my spouses dad died we both changed.  Our marriage isn\u2019t going to make it.  I wish my husband listened to me.   His mental health is definitely taking a toll on his body.  Suffering is part of being human but it doesn\u2019t have to be the only way.  But your willingness to listen to your wife reflects that you aren\u2019t giving up on life, regardless of what the future holds.   This warmed my heart and gave me hope for my fellow humankind!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/enur0a/i_finally_actually_listened_to_my_wife/fe68hwm/"}
