An empty boat is also on the river. At some point it drifts over and bumps into your boat. You don't think much of it at you, you just carry on down the river. Later you see another boat, this time there is a person in it. Their boat drifts over and bumps into yours. \"Hey!\" You shout angrily. \"Watch where you're going!\"\n\nIn both situations, a boat bumps into yours, but your reaction is totally different. It helps to see life, events, and even people's behavior as empty boats. Things just happen according to their nature. You can (somewhat) steer your own boat, and you can definitely steer your reactions to the things that happen around you, and nothing more.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g2lmqb/people_are_not_going_to_change_i_need_to_change/fnmxd0o/"}
