I\u2019m similar to you in that I can be overly critical and judgmental toward others (mainly in my head, I never wanna hurt people, but it\u2019s still wrong) but I\u2019m also extremely critical of myself.\n\nThe fact that you\u2019re not critical of yourself should make it easier to transfer that treatment outward.
