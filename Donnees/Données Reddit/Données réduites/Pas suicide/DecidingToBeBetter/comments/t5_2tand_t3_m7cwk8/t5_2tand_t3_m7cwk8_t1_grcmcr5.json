It is such an incredible hard thing to do and you should be so proud! But the more I read about it you basically have to go cold turkey and replace it for something else or you'll go crazy. Something else meant drinking water or just taking all my anxiety on working out and it worked!\n\nQuitting smoking opened so many possibilities too! You start sending messages to your body that you're taking care of it. I kept incorporating new healthy habits because now I was a non-smoker! So yes! be so very proud! I hope all happiness and health for you <3", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m7cwk8/releasing_a_decade_of_unhealthy_habits_anxiety/grcmcr5/"}
