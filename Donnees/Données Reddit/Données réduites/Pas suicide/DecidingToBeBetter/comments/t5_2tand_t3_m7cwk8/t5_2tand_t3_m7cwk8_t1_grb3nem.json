It has been very intense months of work and I do never want to let go of that hope. I do constantly keep coming up with little ways to fight those negative mostly internal influences. The more I study the mind and myself, it all ties to working on being empathetic. Towards your own pain, needs and others. \n\nI am so happy that at least one person thought this was a bit motivating. I've barely told people about my progress because I didn't trust that I could make it this far but it looks like I'm not stopping :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m7cwk8/releasing_a_decade_of_unhealthy_habits_anxiety/grb3nem/"}
