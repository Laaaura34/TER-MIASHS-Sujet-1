I don\u2019t mean being regretful or anything like that, but rather being out of touch with my current reality.  I was \u201cjust 50lbs over my normal\u201d for 5 years.  I was in a messy unorganized \u201ctemporary apartment\u201d for 6 years.  I didn\u2019t make any effort to make friends or meet people because I had so many friends\u2026 that I hadn\u2019t spoken to or seen in years (or very rarely if we were still in touch).\n\nI can\u2019t imagine what I might\u2019ve accomplished if I had taken an actual inventory of my life *at the time* and not as it was before.  I don\u2019t worry about it though, because I exist now and that\u2019s what\u2019s important :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ohsrat/ive_decided_im_gonna_start_living/h4rrufa/"}
