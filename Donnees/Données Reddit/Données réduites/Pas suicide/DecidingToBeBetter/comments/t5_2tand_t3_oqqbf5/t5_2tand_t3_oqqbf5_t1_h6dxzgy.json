Feels like you get lil brain shocks all the time, the worst nightmares you've ever had, and generally not a fun experience even if you think you're doing it right. I guess I'm a lucky one bc I don't think I did any permanent damage, but there are real possibilities like that other commenter mentioned.\n\nThe SSRI was not making a big difference for me so can't speak a ton to feeling like the same \"you\" before and after. My best guess from the little experience I had would be you'd keep the therapy and person you found, but losing whatever chemical crutch the meds were being may make it easier to slip back into old patterns. You'd just have to work harder and be aware of that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oqqbf5/is_there_a_possibility_of_returning_to_the_state/h6dxzgy/"}
