Do you feel that chemical imbalance is itself something that you are a victim to and it is not something you have any control over?\n\nIn my experience that type of feeling is heavily influenced by factors which we do have some control over, such as diet and exercise. I've both experienced both sides of that myself and have seen it in many others; where poor diet and lack of exercise results in a consistent chemical imbalance. While I'm sure there are some outliers that probably exist, I've never met someone who was both relatively fit and eating right who had a consistent chemical imbalance. (I think expecting there to be precisely no imbalance all the time is unrealistic in any scenario)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oqqbf5/is_there_a_possibility_of_returning_to_the_state/h6kdphw/"}
