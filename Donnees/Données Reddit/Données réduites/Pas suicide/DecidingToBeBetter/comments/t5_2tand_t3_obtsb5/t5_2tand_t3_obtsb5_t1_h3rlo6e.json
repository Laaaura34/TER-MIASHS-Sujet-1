I have messed up relationships and friendships from drinking too much before. It\u2019s the point now where I would not put myself in those late night drinking/club situations again.\n\nIt\u2019s good to meet people when you\u2019re sober and when both of you know what you\u2019re doing and can make sensible, clear-headed decisions. I\u2019ve caused myself endless anxiety from drunken nights out and ill-advised flings with people throughout my years (I\u2019m twice your age so I\u2019ve got a lot of memories to cringe at!)\n\nI will say that even at home you still might want to watch how drinking affects you. I\u2019m still mad at my mate on our gaming chat the other day. He got increasingly aggressive and sweary while playing, properly getting angry and lairy at us all the while thinking he was being funny. It was cringey and I don\u2019t want to play online with him anymore, as this keeps happening. I think he does similar of flipping into different moods. So I\u2019d be wary that even at home, alcohol can definitely still affect your mood (and friendships) in unexpected ways.\n\nGood luck and it\u2019s really good you\u2019ve come to this realisation at this time. It took me too many years to see the negative patterns in my life (stresses and ill advised relationships) were often heightened by being on nights out and making daft decisions. Choosing the very wrong people, for example, and then having to extract myself. Alcohol lowering inhibitions does not help at all.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/obtsb5/i_am_done_getting_drunk_at_bars_for_the_sake_of/h3rlo6e/"}
