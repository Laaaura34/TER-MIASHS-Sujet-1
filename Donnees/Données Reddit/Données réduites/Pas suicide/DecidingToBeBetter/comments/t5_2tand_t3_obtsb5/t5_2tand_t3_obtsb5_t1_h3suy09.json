I'm actually so proud of you for realizing you need to be better for your own sake. When I was 18 (I'm 26F) I was already a couple of years into avoiding men like yourself. You'll get what you're looking for if you stop looking for it at bars and I have to say this again I'm so proud of you for already realizing this at such a young age.\n\nNever stop being introspective. Never stop examining yourself because life is about growing and always trying to become a better person. Hopefully you'll find a woman who will help you continue to learn to be better. And hopefully you will have friends that want to encourage healthy behaviors as well. \ud83d\udda4\u270c\ud83c\udffb", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/obtsb5/i_am_done_getting_drunk_at_bars_for_the_sake_of/h3suy09/"}
