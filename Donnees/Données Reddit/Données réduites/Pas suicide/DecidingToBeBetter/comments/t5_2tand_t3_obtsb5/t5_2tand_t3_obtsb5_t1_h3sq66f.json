I lost one of my closest friends last year because she had bpd kept being really horrible to me whenever she drank so you are doing the right thing. I would also just mention that therapy is good but also don\u2019t make it your whole life. Try to have some hobbies / exercise etc as well so that you have other things to focus on. I\u2019ve noticed that some people with bpd who start therapy make it into their whole personality and it actually gets them stuck in a rut and it\u2019s all they ever want to talk about", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/obtsb5/i_am_done_getting_drunk_at_bars_for_the_sake_of/h3sq66f/"}
