BPD can really fuck with you when you're sober let alone drunk. It's quite the reason I stopped drinking so much. Stone cold sober for almost a year before I decided to have a drink here and there once in a while. It sounds as if you've got the same issues I did with it. Might be best to pull back for a bit and reevaluate what drinking means to you.\n\nWe all have a vice whether it's drugs, exercise, sex etc etc. They are okay as long as they don't control us. With BPD it is easier to slip into that manic or depressive state especially with alcohol since it's a depressant. Usually I'm in a good mood when I drink but there comes a point as does with most people where it's too much. It's good you recognized what you did and the issues that arise from it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/obtsb5/i_am_done_getting_drunk_at_bars_for_the_sake_of/h3qizh1/"}
