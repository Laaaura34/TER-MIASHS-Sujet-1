Im gonna give you some critical advice. DO NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO DATE ANYONE UNTIL YOU HAVE DONE SERIOUS WORK IN THERAPY AND FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT YOUR MENTAL WELLBEING. We are more likely to get abused than your average person, we are also more likely to engage in abusive behavior (albeit unintentionally) than your average person. It is so fucking painful. I wish I could go back and do more therapy when I was 18. I would be so much better off right now. DBT has really been a life changer for me. Idk if you can relate, but sometimes I just get so angry at other people and I say horrible things, and it feels like I cant control it and im watching myself in the third person. I want to get this under control before I try to date again. I have yet to be in a relationship where I wasn't being abused. Good luck friend.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/obtsb5/i_am_done_getting_drunk_at_bars_for_the_sake_of/h3rnkpo/"}
