For me it was motorcycling, camping, travelling. Do fun stuff and you'll eventually meet someone you vibe with.\n\nWhen covid hit and people were all \"I'm not going to be afraid, I'm going to go out and live my life [read: this was always in reference to clubs and bars being closed]\" i actually had a high degree of pity for them because I was able to stay within Covid guidelines and social distance while exploring my state by motorcycle and camping in some beautiful areas and meeting some great hosts and other adventurers. It also put me in contact with a friend i really missed from high school.\n\nAbout to tackle my first off-road heavy trip and it's in Colorado. I'm nervous and stoked but I'll come out with stories.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/obtsb5/i_am_done_getting_drunk_at_bars_for_the_sake_of/h3t6mw1/"}
