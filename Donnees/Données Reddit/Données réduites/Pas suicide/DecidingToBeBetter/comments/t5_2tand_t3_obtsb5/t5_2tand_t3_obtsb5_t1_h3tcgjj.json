Not saying money is all they want but that\u2019s up their on the check list. Quitting drinking is probably something you should do if you act like that. Reminds me of my child hood friend. When I was 21 we would go to the bar then a few drinks later I\u2019m with a skitso syco that hates himself and everybody in the world. Sad to say my child hood friend noticed he was weird as f*ck drinking so he turned to drinking at home. Five years later after six pm the kids crawling around like a baby so wasted on sailer jerry. Truth comes out when your drunk. Ive always loved my child hood best friend but he\u2019s so mean and a asshole every time he drinks. He definitely has bpd you can see it when he drinks.He is no longer my friend haha nobody\u2019s got time for unstable people. Especially when they are just plane old rotten and mean. FYI going out doesn\u2019t mean you have to get drunk it just means to enjoy your self. Society has a way of making people think they have to drink after it gets dark out if you go out not true at all. Wish you the best of luck", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/obtsb5/i_am_done_getting_drunk_at_bars_for_the_sake_of/h3tcgjj/"}
