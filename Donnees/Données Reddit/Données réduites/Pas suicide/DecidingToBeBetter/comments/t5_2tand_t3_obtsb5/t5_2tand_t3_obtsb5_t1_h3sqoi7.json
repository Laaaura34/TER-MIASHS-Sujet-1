I realised a similar thing a couple of years ago that going clubbing and getting drunk with random people wasn\u2019t the thing for me so there was no point in trying to force myself to enjoy it. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I still enjoy having a few drinks with my friends every now and then, but that\u2019s totally different to this heavy drinking culture a lot of young people prescribe to.
