She usually gets depressed or starts screaming about how I\u2019m an awful daughter, that I don\u2019t love her, that I don\u2019t do anything, that I hate her etc.\n\nWhen I literally cooked every meal from the age of 14, cleaned the house everyday too, was homeschooled and isolated from any friends or even family outside of my little sister, her and my dad. I also had an undiagnosed autoimmune disease and was just called lazy if I wasn\u2019t doing something all the time. \n\nYou\u2019re doing the right thing by choosing not to drink, my life would be a lot easier if my mum chose not to.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/obtsb5/i_am_done_getting_drunk_at_bars_for_the_sake_of/h3ta2dz/"}
