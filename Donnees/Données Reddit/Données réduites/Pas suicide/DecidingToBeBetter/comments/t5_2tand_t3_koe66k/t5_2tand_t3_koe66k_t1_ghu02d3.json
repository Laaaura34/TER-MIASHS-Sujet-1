Love your job and love the people you care for, but don't forget to take care of you!\n\nI had a pretty traumatic upbringing, and later became a teacher.

Unfortunately, it isn't humanly possible. To not set myself on fire for others is a constant battle, even 15 years in,  but I am winning it more and more every day!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/koe66k/i_got_a_40_gpa_after_almost_dropping_out/ghu02d3/"}
