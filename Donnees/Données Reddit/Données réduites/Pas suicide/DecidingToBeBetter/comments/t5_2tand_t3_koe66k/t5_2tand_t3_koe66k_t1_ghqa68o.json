One good thing is that the antidepressant I\u2019m on doesn\u2019t allow me to drink alcohol (more than 1 drink) and I have to sleep more than 5 hours a night or else my brain fucks up, so it\u2019s a great little boost of support. I will be consistent, that\u2019s my goal ! Happy new year to you and thanks again \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/koe66k/i_got_a_40_gpa_after_almost_dropping_out/ghqa68o/"}
