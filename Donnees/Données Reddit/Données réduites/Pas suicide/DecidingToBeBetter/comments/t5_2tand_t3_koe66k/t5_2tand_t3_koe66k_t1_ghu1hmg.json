I taught in a nice suburb (for the higher pay while single.) When I got married and money wasn't AS important, I worked in the hood because I wanted to make a difference, and ALL kids deserve a great teacher. I did not set boundaries, and tried to save everyone, and ended up working myself to death. Also, the school environment was toxic in ways that I could not fix. I had to accept that as much as I loved the kids and wanted to stay, I had no control over how administration ran the school, and had to leave for my mental health. Now I am happily in a lower-income school that is ran generally well. I can set boundaries and know that I am still helping kids learn without taking it home with me as much.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/koe66k/i_got_a_40_gpa_after_almost_dropping_out/ghu1hmg/"}
