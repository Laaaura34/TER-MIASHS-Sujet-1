Thank you for being proud of me, this comment made me smile. And it\u2019s funny you say that because I\u2019ve always felt like my true calling was to help people in that way, whether through teaching / mentoring. Thanks for motivating me further, I\u2019ll see what I can do! And you\u2019re right, I definitely learned a lot from people who have been in my shoes before rather than random trained psychologists or life coaches who just do it to do it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/koe66k/i_got_a_40_gpa_after_almost_dropping_out/ghtze3z/"}
