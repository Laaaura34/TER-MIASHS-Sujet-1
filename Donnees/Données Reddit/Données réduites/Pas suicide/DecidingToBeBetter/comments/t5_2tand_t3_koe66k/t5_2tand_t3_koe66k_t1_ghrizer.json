When I done with the graduation then my uncle had refused to support me further with my studies, Technically I was mentally very weak and being a Asian and foremost from developing country it was very hard for me to bear my education expenses for the study So I quit my studies.\n\nI am now 33 year old but I still feel the need of that I should have the studied further.
