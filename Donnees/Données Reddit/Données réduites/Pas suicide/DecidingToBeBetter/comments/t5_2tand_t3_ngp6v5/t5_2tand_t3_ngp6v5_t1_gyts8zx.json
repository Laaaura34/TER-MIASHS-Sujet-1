Like I had to trace it to something, I just had to. Even if the answer is as simple as you just don't talk to people enough. And that is probably true because the truth is usually simple that's why it hurts so much. And you have to put the ego aside, and talk to people even when it hurts in many different ways and keep going back, you have to keep going back to it, even when it all feels wrong, and eventually it will change. And that's what hurts is knowing that is the solution but understand why you would split your mind doing that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ngp6v5/going_back_to_liking_people/gyts8zx/"}
