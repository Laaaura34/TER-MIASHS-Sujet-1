Sex is a natural thing, so it seems normal to have porn added to that. But porn is anything but normal, pure and natural sex. It\u2019s goal is to pervert the act as much as possible. It destroys love, and makes it all about the dopamine rush. Porn is one of the leading causes of human trafficking. It causes people to view each other as sexual objects, or worse. I know you mentioned many other crimes and true, depending on what we\u2019re talking about some of them may be \u201cworse than porn\u201d so to speak, but you have to look at the degree of things. Is rape worse than porn? Sure. But why do people rape in the first place? Their sexuality has been completely hijacked. Most of these horrible things start with porn. The brain on porn is a dangerous thing. You get tired of something, the dopamine rush isn\u2019t the same, and need to go deeper. Most serial killers or sexual criminals admit that it all starts with porn. Most people have no idea how deadly this can be, because it\u2019s hidden behind the guise of your mindset. Where it\u2019s just a normal natural way to indulge. And no judgement or shame on you, believe me I had to learn it myself. I hope this message helps you. I encourage you to do more research. Watch some videos. Go to r/nofap it is the most productive and genuinely good subreddits I\u2019ve ever come across. Everyone is so supportive. Post a message there and I\u2019m sure many people will help you understand", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m30p4q/i_have_created_a_set_of_rules_against_addiction/gqnqj5c/"}
