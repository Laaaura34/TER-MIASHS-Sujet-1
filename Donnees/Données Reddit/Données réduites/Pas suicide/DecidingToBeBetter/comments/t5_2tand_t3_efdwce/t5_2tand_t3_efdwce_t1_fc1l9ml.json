It helped me stay sane when I cut off my old social group. I made lots and lots of great internet friends :)\n\n2) exercise!! I did sets of 10 pushups throughout the day as well as dumbbell workouts here and there. I saw little progress at first but then I started to notice my muscles growing. I\u2019m a little swole now haha.\n\n3) hobbies!!! I\u2019m passionate about music, and  rapping/ singing really helped me throughout the year. But if I\u2019m gonna be honest, there were only some moments throughout the year where I really felt passionate about music. Every other moment in between was just a gray mundane. Not everything is grand and gold. You just have to push through it some days :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/efdwce/day_365_of_quitting_meth_im_officially_one_year/fc1l9ml/"}
