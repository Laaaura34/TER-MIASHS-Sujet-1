But I\u2019m determined to work on not letting it. I try every day as much as I can that day and that\u2019s enough and ok and you can too.  Just try and think of all the ways you can work on it. Things you can do to help.  For example I try to balance my life more by trying to get a little exercise in every week and meditate or go out or whatever just stuff I know helps me I try and do. \nI know it\u2019s hard. Plus I go to my therapist too and don\u2019t miss health appointments.
