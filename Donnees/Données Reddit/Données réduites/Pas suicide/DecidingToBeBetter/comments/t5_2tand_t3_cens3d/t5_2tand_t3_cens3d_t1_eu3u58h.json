Honestly, I feel a little sorry for people who look back on high school as their \u201cgolden years.\u201d You have so much more freedom now that you\u2019re in college, and this is your opportunity to find people you really enjoy being around. You\u2019re more than halfway there by recognizing the ways in which you are the problem. Now Just go out there in the fall and grab life by the balls! \n\nIn high school, I thought I was an introvert because I had been so badly bullied in middle school that I just focused on not being noticed. When I got to college, I realized I could be whoever I wanted to be, and I decided I was going to smile and talk to everyone I could. People really do respond when you introduce yourself and show a genuine interest in them. My sophomore year of college, I ran into someone I knew from high school (in-state university), and she laughed and chatted with me because the previous weekend she saw me at a local all ages club dancing on a table while an acquaintance\u2019s band played. She was shocked but pleasantly surprised when she realized it was me, and we had a nice conversation because she saw me in a different light. You have this same chance. And it seems like you understand it goes both ways - give the people you meet, and even the people you already know, the chance to pleasantly surprise you. Stop looking at high school yearbooks and go forward to make new memories by being who you want to be without set expectations for what the perfect college experience should be. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cens3d/how_do_i_stop_being_so_goddamn_salty_over_my_high/eu3u58h/"}
