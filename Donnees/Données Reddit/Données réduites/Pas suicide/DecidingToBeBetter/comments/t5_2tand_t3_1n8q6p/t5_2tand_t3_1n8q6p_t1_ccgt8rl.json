What helped me get over that was thinking of conversation in a different way. Small talk is important, not because of the content of the conversation but because of the person you're having the conversation with. Even if it's a stranger, everyone likes someone they can shoot the shit with, so to speak. I recommend practicing on this skill just because from personal experience, I've learned to enjoy mindless small talk as much as in depth conversation. It's just a way to bond with your fellow man, don't loathe it, love it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1n8q6p/eavesdropping_on_happiness_wellbeing_is_related/ccgt8rl/"}
