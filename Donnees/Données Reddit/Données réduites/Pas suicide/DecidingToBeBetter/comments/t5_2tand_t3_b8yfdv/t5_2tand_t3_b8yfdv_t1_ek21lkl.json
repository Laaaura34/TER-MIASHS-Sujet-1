If you can\u2019t help your own life what are you going to do just give up? I don\u2019t see how I\u2019m being an ass or hurting anyone with advice. It might fly over peoples heads that they\u2019re bored everyday because they\u2019re not progressing. It\u2019s not like you have to have a soul sucking job either. And it doesn\u2019t only mean make more money I know some very happy people who just choose not to have debt and live a nomadic lifestyle traveling the country in a van or by hitchhiking. It\u2019s literally anything you take it as, maybe someone may like sitting in an office all day, maybe someone wants to go work on an oil rig and pay off all their debt in a few months before they get off the grid. If that normal path sucks to you don\u2019t act like theres not many more options dude. And don\u2019t act like this may not help at least a few people, someone working at mcdonalds may love to go get a higher pay at a 40+ hour job even if traveling a few weekends a year.
