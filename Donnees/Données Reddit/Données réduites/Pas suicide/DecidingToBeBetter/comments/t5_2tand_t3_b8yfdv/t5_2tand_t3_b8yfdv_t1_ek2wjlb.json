I try to frame things in a more positive, yet realistic view.  The alternative is grim, not helpful, and most likely hurtful.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly our approach! He has gotten a lot better over the years. It does not affect his actions or his life. He\u2019s successful at work and in his hobbies and all that. It doesn\u2019t paralyze him, and he doesn\u2019t not do things or take action based on those feelings. We know where the anxiety comes from. He will say to me, \u201cI\u2019m feeling very anxious. Is everything ok?\u201d And then we talk a little about things: we have money, we have all our needs met, nothing is broken, nothing terrible is happening, and we know that his anxiety is a relic of living with a mother with an amazing personality disorder. (Like, really- she\u2019s a showstopper!) And then he lets it go. He\u2019s fine. \n\nThanks very much for taking the time to write to me. I really appreciate it. Feel free to tell me more and I\u2019ll take input. : ) ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/b8yfdv/if_you_constantly_feel_bored_you_probably_need_to/ek2wjlb/"}
