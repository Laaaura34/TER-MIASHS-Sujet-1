For some that does include doing a lot. I understand some may just think you should be in the moment always content with who you are and even content without anything to do, but that surely does not apply to everyone. I don\u2019t take offense in it, I think it\u2019s always good to be mindful and present... BUT that may not always bring meaning and joy to someones life. I\u2019m not saying go be materialistic always chasing a thrill, but some people may get true happiness out of their hobbies or travels. A lot of people find their meditative state through solely focusing on one thing without cloudy thought. When I work out it\u2019s just me and the weights. When I ride my motorcycle it\u2019s just me and the road, not much thought to cloud my mind. It\u2019s similar to a meditative state I get when I just meditate but it\u2019s beyond that. No thoughts, just pure happiness and meaning to my life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/b8yfdv/if_you_constantly_feel_bored_you_probably_need_to/ek3m10w/"}
