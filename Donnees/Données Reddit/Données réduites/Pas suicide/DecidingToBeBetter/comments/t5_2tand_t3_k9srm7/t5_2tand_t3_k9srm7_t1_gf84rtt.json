When it's a desperate, isolated, disabled & elderly family member with no one else to turn to and in the throes of blackest depression & despair, it's hard to make even the justified argument that you've now heard it all for the 347th time and can't take it anymore, especially when they won't listen to you and want someone to magic the world into a different shape rather than suggest what they might try to feel better, if not improve anything.\n\nKnowing that I, myself had been in that very place at one point, but didn't burden anyone with it - and, fortunately, did not become overly suicidal at the time - only confuses me further.\n\nI'm letting someone hurt and take advantage of me - and not helping them - if I stay.  But I'm cruel and abandoning someone with no one else if I go to protect myself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k9srm7/its_completely_ok_to_remove_yourself_from_a/gf84rtt/"}
