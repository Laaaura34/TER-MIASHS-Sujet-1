He had older siblings who lived with them who could help him so I didn\u2019t think that they were short on help. Turns out they also couldn\u2019t go because of quarantine restrictions. I couldn\u2019t go out too because there were no exceptions and he knew that. I also live with my old parents and grandparents and couldn\u2019t risk bringing home the illness. \n\nHe said his feelings were just gone after that incident, that a woman who couldn\u2019t do everything for him isn\u2019t the one he would see himself marrying. I know I\u2019ve been there for him everyday for anything prior to this. \n\nAt first I blamed myself. I should\u2019ve risked getting arrested or exposing my family to a virus that can kill them to show I love him, right? Wrong. \n\nI slowly realised that it was me giving too much and receiving nothing all the time. And before this it felt fine because I wanted to help. I always felt better about myself when I am helping. I felt needed. Then during the only moment I couldn\u2019t offer immediate help, I sadly was no longer the person he wanted.\n\nThe people who love you for who you are regardless of what you can give them will stay. And when other people don\u2019t, let them go.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k9srm7/its_completely_ok_to_remove_yourself_from_a/gf8w0kn/"}
