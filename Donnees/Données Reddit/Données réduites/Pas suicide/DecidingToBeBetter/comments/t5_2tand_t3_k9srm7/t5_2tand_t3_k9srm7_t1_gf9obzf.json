My closest friend of 3years never listens to anything I say and constantly talks over me as if I'm talking to a wall and she's not even listening. I tried to tell her how much it hurts me and yet she keeps doing it. Now, I'm not clean either, I do stuff that hurts her too but today I realized that this isn't good and I told her that I have set some boundaries (there were little to none before). Words were exchanged, she said goodbye, so did I.\n\nI feel bad for a lot of reasons but I somehow feel lighter because I don't have many people I call friends and the one that I consider the closest always lets me down and so I think it was a good decision. I hope she does good in her life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k9srm7/its_completely_ok_to_remove_yourself_from_a/gf9obzf/"}
