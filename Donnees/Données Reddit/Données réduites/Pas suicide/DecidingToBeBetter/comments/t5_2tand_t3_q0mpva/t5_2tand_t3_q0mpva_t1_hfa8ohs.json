Seriously.  Don\u2019t \u201cgive it a rest for a few days\u201d; delete the whole ass app!! Before you know it, you\u2019ll start feeling better, begin to see \u201cfake\u201d for what it is, in all of its forms (on social media and IRL), and realize that, while self-improvement is a wonderful thing, your life is frickin awesome just the way it is. \n\nThe IG stories,drama and \u201cnews\u201d that your friends and associates talk about around you will start to sound like mindless drivel, and you\u2019ll say to yourself \u201cy\u2019all sound really dumb!\u201d  And you\u2019ll mean it. \n \nA few months or so later, someone will send you a link to a funny video on IG. You\u2019ll click it and eventually laugh at that silly, fake and forced \u201ccomedy skit\u201d by an actual \u201ccomedian\u201d. \n\nThen you\u2019ll look down see that you have some unseen notifications, and say to yourself \u201coh snap. I forgot I have an IG!\u201d  Then you\u2019ll likely chuckle (as I did), and scroll your way to account settings to delete your profile forever. \n\nOr not. \n\nEither way, please try not to compare yourself to people and/or things that are nothing but an extremely well constructed illusion of reality. No one or no thing is perfect. \n\nTake good care, Friend. \u270c\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0mpva/im_so_sick_of_being_depressed_and_watching_others/hfa8ohs/"}
