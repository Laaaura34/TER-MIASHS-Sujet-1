A journaling exercise I learned in therapy that has really helped my self esteem uses this same idea. Basically you try to talk to yourself like you would talk to your best friend. You take two different color pens in one color you write out your problem or feeling that you are struggling with and then with the other color you respond as if you were giving advice to a friend.\n\nI agree with what others are saying, getting of social media does wonders for your mental health. But if you don't feel ready to get off 100% at least take the apps off your phone. I did this a while ago and it made a difference on my concentration and my anxiety. I no longer have the option to impulsively open the app and  mindlessly scroll through out the day. If I want to go on I have to actively choose to go to my computer and login to facebook or Instagram. I still go on once or twice a week if I am in the right mood but most days I don't feel like making the effort.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0mpva/im_so_sick_of_being_depressed_and_watching_others/hfbkeb3/"}
