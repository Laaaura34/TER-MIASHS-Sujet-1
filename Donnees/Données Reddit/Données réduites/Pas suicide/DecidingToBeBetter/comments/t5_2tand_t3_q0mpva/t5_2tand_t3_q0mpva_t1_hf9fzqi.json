The one bit of advice I'd give is...\n\nTake it gradually, start small. Make 1 change at a time before moving on to the next.\n\nWhy?\n\nA. Sometimes (not always) planning to make wholesale changes can in itself be a vast daunting task and cause stress. It can set us up to fail\n\nB. Small gradual changes are easier and quicker to achieve.\n\nC. Small changes over time mean you end up with lots of little \"goals\" and are able to reward yourself for each one = greater sense of achievement. \n\nSo delete 1 social media app to start with. Congratulate yourself after a day without it. Or head out for a 20 minute walk. Again give yourself a pat on the back. Whatever small goals work for you and give you that sense of achievement.\n\nAnd know that the lives people show on social media are almost always a veneer. 99% of people also have their own challenges in life that they don't wish to publicise.\n\nGood luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0mpva/im_so_sick_of_being_depressed_and_watching_others/hf9fzqi/"}
