I hope to get there as well, currently just over a month here. I'm not doing a program or anything either. I wouldn't say I'm \"white knuckling it\" I'm mostly just happy to be sober and not fucking up my life anymore. I know that could change at any moment though. Usually somewhere around the 6 month mark is where the insanity of the first drink or drug happens for me. God I don't want to keep repeating this hellish cycle though. Maybe I need to be working a program or getting some kind of counseling or something, but I'm not really sure tbh.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k7hld6/one_year_sober_today/gerkymn/"}
