I have 2 years clean and I\u2019ve been in 12 step programs since I got clean, I can\u2019t recommend it enough. I\u2019ve done both NA and AA and there\u2019s a ton of online meetings for both if you wanna dm me I can send you the link to the mass list of meetings! They\u2019re every half hour for NA pretty much. :) also, I had a really weird time with depression after getting clean and it took me up till a few months ago to decide going on an antidepressant was the right plan for me and my recovery and overall well-being. There\u2019s nothing wrong with taking medication as prescribed! Much love, I\u2019m very proud of you. One year is a motherfucker, dude. Shit is so hard, and you\u2019re doing something so so good for yourself. Hugs!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k7hld6/one_year_sober_today/gespop5/"}
