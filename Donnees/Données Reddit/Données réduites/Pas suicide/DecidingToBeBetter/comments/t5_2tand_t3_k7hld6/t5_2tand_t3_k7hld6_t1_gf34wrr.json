But I would really like to emphasize how important it is to deal with the emotions that are causing this need. You have to give yourself what you need in order to live a happy and sustainable life.\n\nFirst step is done => get rid of the thing that is actually causing more harm than good.\n\nBut I wouldn't consider this done until you see some clear improvement in the emotional state, otherwise, you risk having this tire you over time and maybe make fall off the wagon.\n\nNot trying to discourage, on the contrary, this is great progress and you can use the momentum to keep going!\n\nStay strong!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k7hld6/one_year_sober_today/gf34wrr/"}
