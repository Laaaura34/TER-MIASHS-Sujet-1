That's great that you're trying to improve yourself. Something you can do are mantras, like hugging yourself while saying \"I love me\" in the mirror. Try to keep in touch with new people. It's hard to ask for contact info, but many people will say yes! Keep texting on a weekly basis and slowly feel out if you can trust them. Like videochatting/calling and sharing small secrets and gauging their reaction. I'd recommend less time on social media to help with the self worth and comparing lives. Being comfortable by yourself and in your own skin is so important! In time, cut out toxic contacts. Hopefully you can forgive yourself. You can also make a list of your accomplishments and goal setting, and combat negative thoughts with more positive ones. I'm on this same journey too! Having just one or a few close friends by the end of life is all you need :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ows61b/has_dealt_with_depression_loss_of_friends_finding/h7m2ail/"}
