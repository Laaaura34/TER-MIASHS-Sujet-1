It can be difficult to crack open the first time and you mentioned you wanted to write without judging yourself, which is a great start.\n\nI\u2019ve been in therapy off and on for the last ten years due to trauma but experience a lot of the things you\u2019ve written here. \n\nTo address your practical questions about therapy in medication, these can vary by person. A therapist typically will not prescribe you medication unless they are licensed to do so (assuming you\u2019re in the US here). Your insurance can connect you to therapists in your network or you can also search Psychology Today - this is how I found my last provider. I tend to search for someone who is trauma informed and does \u201cparts work\u201d or \u201cinner child work.\u201d This sounds corny at first but I\u2019ve found it to be the most helpful and transformative for me. If that sounds good to you, I\u2019d consider it.\n\nAny therapist will likely have you do an assessment or intake and spend the first few sessions just learning about you and your life and the biggest things bringing you to therapy. I would recommend being very honest and patient with yourself. Therapy takes effort and time to start working. Of course if you don\u2019t mesh well after a few sessions, you can always shop around. It won\u2019t hurt anyone\u2019s feelings.\n\nTo your concern about medication - that\u2019s very normal and I was worried about it changing me too. When I needed it, medication was very helpful. It has its pros and cons like anything else. I was on some meds for a while but got to a place where I didn\u2019t find them necessary but continued therapy even when I felt \u201cbetter.\u201d That\u2019s been a good decision for me over time. Everyone is different, but I will say my sister and my wife both take meds that people think are \u201cintense\u201d but have made huge positive impacts on their lives. Again, it\u2019s a personal decision and best made with a professional, but it can be helpful and not necessarily a permanent fixture of your health care plan.\n\nHappy to respond if you need more practical support on finding a provider - best of luck in your search! You deserve support, peace, and to be heard.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mjfcsk/i_feel_like_its_time_for_me_to_address_my_mental/gta4lno/"}
