So glad to hear those resonate for you. And thank you for hearing my story as well. This subreddit is a really cool corner of the internet. \n\nAnd I\u2019m so glad that medication part came through. I realized I had internalized a lot of beliefs and expectations about medication before me and my family went through the process more recently. I\u2019ve also learned to accept alongside my sister that for her, she does require medication for the long haul. And that\u2019s ok too - we all need accommodations throughout life and sometimes those are more long term and come in pill form.\n\nGood luck with everything!!
