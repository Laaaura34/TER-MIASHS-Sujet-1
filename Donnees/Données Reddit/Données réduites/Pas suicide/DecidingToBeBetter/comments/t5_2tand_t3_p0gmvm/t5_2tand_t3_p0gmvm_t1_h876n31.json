So many times in relationships we let the other person define who we are to the extent we no longer know what WE want or even like! For example, my ex husbands favorite color was blue, when we divorced a friend was helping me move and redecorate and asked what my favorite color was, I didn\u2019t have a clue!

Use this time to discover yourself, so when you are ready for another relationship, you will be offering the real you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p0gmvm/ending_a_big_chapter_in_my_life/h876n31/"}
