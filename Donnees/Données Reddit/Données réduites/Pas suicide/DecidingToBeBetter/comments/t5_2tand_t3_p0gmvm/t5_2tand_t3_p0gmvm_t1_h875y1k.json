But the amazing thing about love you'll certainly find too is that it is more than possible to have with different people, and *nobody* is exempt from that. Not even you :)\n\nOne thing I felt when my high school love of my life and I broke up was like I would never find anything like that again in my life, and it was crushing. What I discovered was that that was true, but not a bad thing. The differences in the relationships I had afterwards made those relationships even better than the first. The first was a great start to helping me better understand what I need and want and what to look for. This applies to you too. Now you know signs of toxicity and you know what you want to avoid in the future. That's a recipe for success when it comes to finding someone way better for you in the long run.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p0gmvm/ending_a_big_chapter_in_my_life/h875y1k/"}
