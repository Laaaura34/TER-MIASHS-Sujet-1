Food and sleep (even if you need to ask the doc for some temporary meds) are nourishment for your body and mind so please dont skip these even if its just small amount of food, eat regularly. You will get through this, reinvent yourself and grow from this learning experience. Plus, you dont deserve to be chated on or to be mistreated, no one does so dont look back, look forward, there's so much of goodness ahead of you. One day at a time and you will be your happy self again. Till then, lean on your support group and know that you deserve happiness and someone who treats you right but till that person comes along, please treat yourself right! \u2661", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p0gmvm/ending_a_big_chapter_in_my_life/h86iy8e/"}
