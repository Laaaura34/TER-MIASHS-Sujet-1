Have you ever considered getting treatment for anxiety?  It might be easier to do that rather than expect a fundamental personality change just from trying to be more 'tough'.\n\nAlso what you describe isn't really about how tough you are, it's about how confident you feel.  Toughness is your resiliency to adversity and your general mental and physical ability to keep going and endure despite challenges, discomfort, etc. So if you're tougher, you might still FEEL that discomfort or worry, but you will be less likely to allow yourself to respond to that discomfort. \n\nHow do you toughen up in the way you're asking, though? For most people it's fake it until you make it.  For others, confidence isn't what they need, skill is.  Sometimes, finding something you're very skilled in will MAKE you less timid and more confident/ traditionally tough. And for most people, experience is the best teacher.  Annoyingly, you might have to be anxious and uncomfortable for a fair while before you develop the proverbial thicker skin and feeling of confident assuredness.  \n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5qj8l/how_can_i_toughen_myself_up_as_a_32_year_old_man/h9b56n2/"}
