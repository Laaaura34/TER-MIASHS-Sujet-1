When I discovered the tricks my mind was playing on me, among other things, it really broadened my perspective, and made me much less anxious/worried. I don't even practice what I read about most of the time, but instead of feeling ashamed, I can now laugh about stuff much more easily, and I feel generally more at peace..  it's just nice to know more about the reason why you feel the way you feel, and what you can do about it. \n\nTwo books that have helped me are The Power of Now,  and The Untethered Soul. I'd try out the second one. [audiobook on yt](https://youtu.be/oXh-50pdyRk) could listen to it for half an hour and see if it's something you're interested in.\n\nI usually don't read myself. But out of videos, reading online, and doing whatever else. I found that listening or reading to books can actually create a pretty big impact. Not just every book, many books I try and don't really get much out of, but a handful of the right books?\n\nYou could read/listen to 48 laws of power to see through the power plays in your surroundings. [audio](https://youtu.be/j1wybuRhlLs)\n\nAnyways, I think if you really want to change yourself in a certain way, the thing holding you back most (probably) is your own perception, nothing else. \n\nPeople react to what they see, most communication is done non verbally, what you put out into the world you get back, idk, I wish you the best of luck in getting what you want. \u270c\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5qj8l/how_can_i_toughen_myself_up_as_a_32_year_old_man/h98eq13/"}
