There's a couple of people who are quite timid that I works with and they get on brilliantly. All that matters is their skill/ability. There are plenty of tasks in most jobs that require someone who can just get their head down and get on with it. The most timid person I work with uses a cutter most of the time, sticks ear defenders on and just goes without having to interact with too many people. The rest of the team just wave in front of him at lunchtime etc, to make sure he eats & he's still invited out every time, even though he rarely goes.\n\nThe right team will make it work with you, don't be afraid of going for the job you want.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5qj8l/how_can_i_toughen_myself_up_as_a_32_year_old_man/h996vzk/"}
