I was a skinny, short, \"dork\" growing up and many people tried to pick on me or bully me.  I realized 99% of the time if you call them on their bluff,  they back down.  It doesn't mean challenging them  to a fight or verbally assaulting them, it just means finding a way to get across that you wont tolerate or care for their BS.   Some times self deprecating humor works, sometimes asking them to explain themselves in front of others works, taking them aside and speaking to them privately, or when worse comes to worse....verbally roasting  them or telling them, let's get it over with now because I'm not taking this BS every day.  I was fortunate that I had a couple talents most of the bullies didnt....a VERY sharp and quick witted tongue AND I was far stronger than I looked.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5qj8l/how_can_i_toughen_myself_up_as_a_32_year_old_man/h97tnp2/"}
