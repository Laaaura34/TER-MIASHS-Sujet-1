I started in high school and took a different path before getting back into it after I lost my job at the start of the pandemic. I\u2019ve always been timid and for the most part avoided eye contact when interacting with my peers. It was hard to get past it. The fear of judgment or being made fun of. Shit hurts. Now I\u2019m not so bad. I\u2019m a lot more confident than I was 10 years ago. Nobody really cares if your slightly awkward or lack some social skills. Just go in everyday and be engaged. Learn and work your ass off. Over time you\u2019ll build more confidence in the trade and your ability to communicate with your coworkers/peers. \n\nAlso, if you make a mistake, learn from it. If your asked why you made it, explain what you should have done.
