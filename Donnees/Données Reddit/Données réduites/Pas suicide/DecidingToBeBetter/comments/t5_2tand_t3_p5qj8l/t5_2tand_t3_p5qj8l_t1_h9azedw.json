It\u2019s self protection but a lot of grappling and throwing with partners. It can help you socially because you have to work with and interact with others. It can normalize being around others.\n\nGoing to the gym alone isn\u2019t really social enough for me. Being on a competitive team is too much social/pressure as I\u2019m not good at sport. But learning with a class on your same level and progressing with them is fun, low pressure and you go at your own pace and progress when ready", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5qj8l/how_can_i_toughen_myself_up_as_a_32_year_old_man/h9azedw/"}
