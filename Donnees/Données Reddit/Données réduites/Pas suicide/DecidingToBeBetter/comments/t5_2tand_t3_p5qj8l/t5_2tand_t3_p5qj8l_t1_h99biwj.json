Probably at some point in your past, you learnt to repress your Masculinity. You can break down those walls and let it flow through you again\n\nAlso start learning Brazilian Jiu Jitsu\n\nGood on you for thinking this way btw. Many people look for excuses for why they shouldn't have to change. It takes courage to be willing to look your flaws in the face and commit to trying to change them. That's 60% of the battle already.\n\nI came across [this playlist someone made on youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8Y1XrJtIlB-L393Exfud7uX1HXzpu_00) which seems to be like a collection of examples of the masculine spirit in action, both in songs and in speeches and stuff. It really helped me hone in on getting a clearer vision of what this 'masculinity' thing I was aiming for is. It's much easier to chase and develop something in yourself if you have a clearer idea of what exactly it is, and this playlist really helped me see that better and get in sync with that mindset\n\nDid i mention you should join your local BJJ gym? Best thing for it out of everything imo", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5qj8l/how_can_i_toughen_myself_up_as_a_32_year_old_man/h99biwj/"}
