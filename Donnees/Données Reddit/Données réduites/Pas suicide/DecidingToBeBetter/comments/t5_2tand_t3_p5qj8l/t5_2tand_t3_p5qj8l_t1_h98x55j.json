Go lift weights, pick up a martial art, get that landscaping job. This things will toughen you up. You have no problem as far as I\u2019m concerned. Get that job even if you\u2019re timid, you\u2019ll come out of your shell with experience. Just do shit that scares you, you\u2019ll survive, and you\u2019ll feel like more of a man because you faced your fear. You gotta take emotions out of it and just do.
