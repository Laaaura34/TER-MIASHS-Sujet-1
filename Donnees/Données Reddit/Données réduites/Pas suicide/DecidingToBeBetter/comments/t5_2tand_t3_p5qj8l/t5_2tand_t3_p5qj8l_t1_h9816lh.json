But more than anything, just strapping on some boots and doing it.  Face your fears.  No one's going to call you a pussy or a pansy or whatever your dad/high school bullies called you.  This isn't high school anymore.  I'm a 38 year old gay guy working in IT in a rural factory right now, in the South.  I do not butch it up, I'm just myself.  You have to be vulnerable to get what you want, which is acceptance/self acceptance.  You're only going to find it by being yourself in the face of what you perceive as danger.  If you're good at your craft (or not, but willing to put in serious effort), people will like you.  Be kind, be honorable, be vulnerable.  Basically, be a good person.  You'll be treated like one.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5qj8l/how_can_i_toughen_myself_up_as_a_32_year_old_man/h9816lh/"}
