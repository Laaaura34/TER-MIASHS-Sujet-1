Make yourself comfortable in uncomfortable situations. Cold showers , running, social situation, anywhere u can push your boundaries.  Realize that for every terrible scenario that could play out there is probably an equally awesome one that is just as likely. Take a risk, your gonna fail,  but failing is way better then not trying. Failing gives you the opportunity to learn and grow. It might sting a bit but try again. You will be better and more equipped. You get to decide who u want to be. Not any one else. Good luck my friend.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5qj8l/how_can_i_toughen_myself_up_as_a_32_year_old_man/h99hpq0/"}
