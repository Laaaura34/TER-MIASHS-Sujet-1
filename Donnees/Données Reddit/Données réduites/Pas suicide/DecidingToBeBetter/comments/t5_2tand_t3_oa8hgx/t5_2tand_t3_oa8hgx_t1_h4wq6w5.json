My husband plays video games when he's not working and with his friends. It got kind of bad especially in our earlier years of marriage. Now he's cut down significantly. He spends more time with me (granted we just watch tv shows together but it's better than not spending time together at all). And I've noticed sometimes he'll go off and do his own thing that's not gaming when we're not together and he has free time. Gaming can be addictive just like anything else. For me I got addicted to Wow years ago and was spending too much money on it (spending $25 on mounts etc). After about a year I just decided to quit. Of course not having a job anymore to finance my addiction to the game helped me to quit too lol.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h4wq6w5/"}
