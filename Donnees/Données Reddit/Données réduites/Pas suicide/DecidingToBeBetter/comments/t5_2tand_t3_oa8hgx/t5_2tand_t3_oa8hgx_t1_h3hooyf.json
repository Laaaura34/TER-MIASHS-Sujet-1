I hated my life and how directionless it was and how mediocre I felt. Skyrim allowed to me to explore so much and experience so many things that don\u2019t exist in reality. \n\nI gave it all up when I met my husband. He encouraged me to go to school, live up to my potential\u2026 and I haven\u2019t played for 3.5 years now. I traded it in for higher education and doing my own real life hiking/camping. I feel better now and I have my own real quest lines to get my bachelors degree done and apply to medical school. I don\u2019t feel that need for escapism.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h3hooyf/"}
