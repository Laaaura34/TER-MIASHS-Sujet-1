My silly little example of 6 hours a day for 87 straight days being an obvious example of problematic gaming. \n\nAnd I tend to disagree with you, on your point that \"...generally you can't infer from how much someone plays that they are an addict and don't actually enjoy playing; even if it's close to all day every day...\" \n\nAll day everyday would be a clear example of problematic gaming as well. I doubt you would be able to find a psychologist in the world that would say that that was healthy behaviour, even if they worked in the video game industry.\n\nOf course everyone is different and it must be looked at on a case by case basis, and a problematic level of gaming for one person might not be problematic for another. \n\nI'm just trying to make the very boring point that addictive gaming is an insidious thing and people can be much deeper in its grasps than they themselves even realize.\n\nEdit: I realize you made more points there. Some interesting ones too. Maybe I'll reply later and engage them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h3h57sc/"}
