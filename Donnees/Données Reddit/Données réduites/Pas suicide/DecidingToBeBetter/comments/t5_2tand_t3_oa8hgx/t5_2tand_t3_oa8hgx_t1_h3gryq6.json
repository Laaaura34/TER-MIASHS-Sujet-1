Which isn't something I'm proud of.\nLast time I checked, before I quit altogether, I had played DotA 2 for over 2200 hours. I used to write video game reviews for an online publication. I've owned nearly every major system at release. I won't list my entire bona fides, but they're there.\n\nI simply know first hand what excessive gaming looks, but more importantly, feels like. \n\nI know that a great game can keep your attention for hours and weeks on end. And in moderation gaming is a totally valid hobby. It ceases being a hobby and becomes an addiction when it's no longer done for pleasure. When it's simply done to curb cravings or to pacify a depression it's something else entirely. That's what I'm talking about.\n\nAnd the difference with gaming compared with those other hobbies you've listed is that gaming produces almost nothing of value.\nReading, grows your vocabulary, teaches you things, expands your horizons.\nBaking nourishes you and others.\nPainting is a creative and expressive venture and can bring joy to yourself and others.\n\nThe few positives that gaming provides pale in comparison and everything that gaming does provide, real world activities provide it much better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h3gryq6/"}
