You are going to find so much time to learn a lot of cool and new things. I unfortunately also got addicted to video games ever since I was a kid to about 20 years old.. I am 21 rn and this past year has been the best without video games. I was being neglectful to the relationship I am in and never realized how harmful that was. Now that I have all this time it\u2019s amazing how much I can do. I\u2019d say the number 1 thing for me out of quitting video games is that I am growing so much as an individual and it feels a lot better than the adrenaline from the games I\u2019d play.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h3gq29i/"}
