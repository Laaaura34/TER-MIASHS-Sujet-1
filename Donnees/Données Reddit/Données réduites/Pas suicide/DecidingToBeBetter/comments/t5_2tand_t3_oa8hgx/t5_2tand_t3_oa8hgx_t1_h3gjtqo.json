And during that time my friends have developed real careers, families, great social connections, serious hobbies, serious self development.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m here as a middle aged man sucking down hit after hit of weed and ordering in Dominos so I don\u2019t have to cook and can watch the Sopranos.   \n\nIt\u2019s disgusting. All of the major traumas of my life (post childhood at least) could have been avoided if I hadn\u2019t been burning every opportunity I had with a bic lighter. In some parallel universe where I grew out of it at the age of 25 like most of the people I know, I\u2019m not some loser in a tiny messy apartment full of junk food. I\u2019m a father with a beautiful family, and I\u2019m highly respected in my field, and regarded highly in my community.  \n\nI\u2019ve been sober the past couple of days and the utter horror of this wasteland I\u2019ve created is hitting me really hard.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h3gjtqo/"}
