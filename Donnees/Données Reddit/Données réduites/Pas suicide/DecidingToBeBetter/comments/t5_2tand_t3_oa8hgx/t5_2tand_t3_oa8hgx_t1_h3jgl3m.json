It is so easy to lose control of the hours you spend on gaming. I had more or less the same problem as you in highschool(except that online gaming + subscriptions was a bit less of a thing) cs and total war rome took all my hours of the day. After starting to travel the need to game went away and I realised spending money on travelling is so much more rewarding! Only now with the current situation the urge to game came back and for me it is now way healthier and easier to play and moderate hours. \nI hope you can make your dreams come through and experience the world :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h3jgl3m/"}
