I got you. I am the same way but with movies. I'm 30yo and sometimes I get hit by this kind of curtains that leaves my mind blocked about future and perspective.

Gym, objectives, discipline. Therapy is a good way too.  \nWe can always reschedule our life for the better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h3i9c6y/"}
