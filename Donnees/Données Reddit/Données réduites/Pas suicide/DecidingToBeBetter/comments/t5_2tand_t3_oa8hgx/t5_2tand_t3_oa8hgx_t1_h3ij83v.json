What has happened with modern technology is that, whether gaming, looking for \"likes\" and porn addiction is it drops excessive dopamine into the system. A natural drug that gives a minute high--that's why you felt addicted--because your brain was. We have a serious problem in society with over stimulation in the social media world and nothing in the real world. As said--moderation is fine--this social media has benefited me as it is a side business with YT and my self improvement works. But too much even for this YT'r is entirely too much--I get the same agitation/dopamine drop. So I hang out for awhile daily to help people, but my real \"highs\" are intense physical fitness and hiking in the mountains and desert canyons. By all means game--but exactly what you suggested is true--it should be a small part of your life and the real world should be your highs. Hope that helps everyone---Charles", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h3ij83v/"}
