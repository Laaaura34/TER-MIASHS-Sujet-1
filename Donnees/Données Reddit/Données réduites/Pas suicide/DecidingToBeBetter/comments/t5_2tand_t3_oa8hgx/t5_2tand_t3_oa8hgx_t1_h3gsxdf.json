Most video games don't teach anybody anything, because vast majority of the time games are designed to be slow paced and addictive, you don't achieve much in 1 hour in comparison to doing something else. This is coming from someone whom has a college major in game design (video games + board + lottery/casino slots mixed type degree + minor in CS) and has been a video game addict for 17 years. If you read how to assemble a tent and learn some survival tips from camping book in an hour, you'll gain some knowledge that can be utilized. Obviously, you can also play survival video games, but ask yourself how much are they teaching you in an hour? Outside of marvelous video game mechanics that discard manual interaction like showing how to smash a rock with another rock to initiate a spark, most of the things are useless.\n\nThere are more \"valuable\" games out there with a focus on educational side than entertainment, but they aren't popular, because people desire escapism not education.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h3gsxdf/"}
