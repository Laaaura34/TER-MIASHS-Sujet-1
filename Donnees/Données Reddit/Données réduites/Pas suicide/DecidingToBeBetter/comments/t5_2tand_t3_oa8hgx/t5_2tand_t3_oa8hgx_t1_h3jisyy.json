It's a hobby for sure, and gaming has it's place. I have many fond memories playing video games with both of my boys when they were little, but as a solitary endeavor, it amounts to a huge time suck.... An escape, which is fine if you don't have goals or objectives that the time would be better spent on, in your example, studying... But time being the finite resource that it is, is far too precious to waste on video games..... IMO... So good for you!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h3jisyy/"}
