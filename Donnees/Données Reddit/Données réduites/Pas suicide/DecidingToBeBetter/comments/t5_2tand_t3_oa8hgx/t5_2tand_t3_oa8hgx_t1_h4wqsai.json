I've never had an addiction to alcohol or weed or anything like that yet I haven't accomplished anything great either in my life. I'm 37 and still childless and only make $34K a year at a soul crushing call center type of job where I'm being micromanaged to no end. And this is even after getting my bachelors and my professional certification. The only good thing I ever accomplished was getting married to a great guy. He on the contrary has a thriving career in software development and is making a 6 figure salary. He's accomplished the things I never could and probably never will. I'm living vicariously through him.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h4wqsai/"}
