Not everybody has the capacity to do that and rarely people succeed like that. I'd say start thinking more about why gaming was causing you problems. It's not a one day process because you have literally been playing for God knows how long. So to think that you can give up in a single days introspection would be wrong.

And wish us luck as well. We're all struggling.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h3jxwhm/"}
