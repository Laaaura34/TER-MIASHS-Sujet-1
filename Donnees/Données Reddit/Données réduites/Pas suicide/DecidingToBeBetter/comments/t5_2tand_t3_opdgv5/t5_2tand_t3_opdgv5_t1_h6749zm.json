The English language has a bit of a blindspot about \"work\", it doesn't differentiate well between the work of grinding and the work of pursuing.\n\nYou have little endurance to apply yourself to meaningless effort. Humans are *very poor* at grinding without a goal or sense of progress, most of us can't even do it for an hour. \n\nYou have almost limitless endurance to pursue a goal that is meaningful enough to you. Humans are *very good* at chasing something down over long distances and time spans.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, if your \"work\" feels is pointless to you, you're either doing the wrong thing or don't have the right reasons.\n\nFigure out your goal and your meaning before setting down to work work work.\n\nWhen you do have the right goals and reasons, it won't be grind grind grind - it'll be chase chase chase.\n\n(Also, my 2 cents as someone who did their \"big world trip\" at the age of 30 rather than at retirement age: endless freedom to travel IS NOT a worthwhile life goal.)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/opdgv5/you_dont_need_motivation_you_need_to_work/h6749zm/"}
