I don\u2019t have ADHD, but I\u2019ve definitely struggled with all those same problems (of course nowhere near to the same extent as someone who has been clinically diagnosed). So I can only imagine how overwhelming it can be. \n\nI think the best we can do is find strategies that work for us. The best way to do that is to get the help from therapy and medicine when we need it.  \n\nUnfortunately this post can\u2019t address everything. I don\u2019t think work is the end all be all, but rather that without the action from work all our goals will just remain in our heads.\n\nTaking care of one\u2019s well-being comes first of course. Learning how to manage self-talk is crucial. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/opdgv5/you_dont_need_motivation_you_need_to_work/h66ku20/"}
