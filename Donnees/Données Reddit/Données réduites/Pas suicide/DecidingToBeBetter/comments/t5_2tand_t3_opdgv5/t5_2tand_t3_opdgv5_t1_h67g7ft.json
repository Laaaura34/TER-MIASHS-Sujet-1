This is me. I keep pushing my deadline to ease up on my work life. \"Just six more months, then I'll start working on my business, or do things I want to get done\". I've been working two jobs and barely managing to eat, gym, and get rest. I'm keeping one day off to have a social life and look after myself, and do some fun stuff. But fuck do I miss just playing some games for hours, or sitting and designing something for a whole night and losing track of time. My work life has slowly killed my motivation to do things for nothing in return. I keep doing overtime even on days off thinking, well whatever else I had wasn't going to make me money. It's a shit life, but hey 6 more months and I swear I'm done. \n\nSorry to vent it out on you but it's definitely very relatable, the self help books definitely help my thoughts and the stoicism sub here is great too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/opdgv5/you_dont_need_motivation_you_need_to_work/h67g7ft/"}
