Self-care and well-being come first. Unfortunately, for these posts, I try to focus on one thing at a time. \n\nWhen I say *work* I\u2019m shedding light on the action required to turn our thoughts into reality. Not work work work nonstop to burnout. Rather that you can\u2019t avoid it. It\u2019s a necessary step. It is the *action* portion of bringing our goals into fruition. We can\u2019t just hope they come into fruition, we need to act, and that action comes from working. :) \n\nAll the best.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/opdgv5/you_dont_need_motivation_you_need_to_work/h66z8bd/"}
