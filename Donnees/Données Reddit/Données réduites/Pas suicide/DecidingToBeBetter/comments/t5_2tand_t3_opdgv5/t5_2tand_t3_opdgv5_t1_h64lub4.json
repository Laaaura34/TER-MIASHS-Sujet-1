Don't see it as a failure that we skip from thing to thing, starting projects and never finishing them. We learn so much about so many things. I'm sure you've had moments where you've displayed really depthy knowledge on a subject with an expert in that field, with no idea how you know it.\n\nSadly we're just not built for capitalism. Because all of these hobbies we pick up and put down can't be monetized, and we can barely tolerate full time jobs, we feel deep shame and guilt, like these are character flaws. But judging everything by how much cash it can generate is such a new thing to the human brain. It's crazy how deeply it rewires our sense of self-worth.\n\nIf you were rich these wouldn't be flaws, you'd be a \"renaissance man\". A term that exists to praise people who have strong knowledge and interest in disperate areas, from botany to bronze welding. But we're not rich. And we're expected to grind.
