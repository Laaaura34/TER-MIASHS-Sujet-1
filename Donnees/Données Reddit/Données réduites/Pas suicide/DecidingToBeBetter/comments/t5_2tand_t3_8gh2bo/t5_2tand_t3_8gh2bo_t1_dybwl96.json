As I mature, however, the orderly predominates and the chaos increasingly wanes. Still, I miss that guy who, in my 20's, was lot more fun and carefree, and who still managed to accomplish quite a bit, despite the chaos. For what it's worth, I think it's important to embrace both sides and to strive to keep them in balance. You can learn to find joy in \"smart boring\"; for example, I find virtue and enjoyment in small disciplines now, like doing the dishes, making my bed, and putting stuff away. 20's me? Forget about it. And more mindfully indulging \"fun dumb\" gives you most of the benefit with far less risk of, say, accidentally over-doing it (or dying). So I wish you well, fellow traveler.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8gh2bo/jumping_between_two_states_of_mind/dybwl96/"}
