The concept of order is just organised chaos, an arbitrary system of rules and regulations for which we feel we should abide by. One of mankind's greatest strengths and fallacies is our irrationality, which we try to rationalise as best we can. We feel that if we can do that, then everything will work out just fine, right?\n\nBut there's always that beast of wanton chaos that brews inside us. That itch to see what lies beyond the walled garden. That itch that drives us to bend rules, to hack the system, to cheat, to lie, to steal, not just because we want to bend them for our benefit, but because we also want to chase that thrill of operating outside of those normal parameters.\n\nAs someone before me had mentioned, you will need to try and find some balance. A middle ground where your orderly self and your chaotic beast can come to terms with the reality of your own existence, and be at peace with each other. This isn't something that you do once and then live in eternal serenity, but a struggle that you will face daily. The duality isn't necessarily the problem, but how you choose to address these conflicts is key to finding that balance.
