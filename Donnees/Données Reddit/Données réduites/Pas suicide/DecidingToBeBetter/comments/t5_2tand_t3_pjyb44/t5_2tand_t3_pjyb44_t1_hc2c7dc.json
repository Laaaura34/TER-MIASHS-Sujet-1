You nailed it. I have major regrets about my choices then and though of course now would never give my son up, the longing for what could have been is most definitely holding me back from moving forward. Even though I said I have finally accepted it, it keeps coming back up... I keep thinking of it as this tough pill I have to swallow over and over. My therapist used the words radical acceptance and I almost tore my hair out. But your comment has made me see things differently. Maybe if my perspective shifts it doesn't have to be a tough pill. This very well could be the solution to moving on. Journaling was a huge part of my life up until the birth of my son. It was the first time since age 9 I hadn't journaled every day. And that remained true for the last 9.5 years. I think it is time I bring it back.\n\nI'd been saving a little bit every month since his birth so we could do some world travel around the ages of 10 - 12... two years ago I had to use all the money I'd saved because of a careless mistake. I hope I can figure out a way to still make this dream come true...", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjyb44/how_do_i_get_back_on_track_after_ten_years_of/hc2c7dc/"}
