Your old life is now behind you. Saving $15K is also quite a feat for most people. The fact is, your life is now on track. You're a great Mom! Have you thought about taking the experience you just described and create a course or program to help individuals that are facing the same or similar circumstances? You could start by just getting a job so you keep your cashflow coming in and you don't drain your savings. While you are doing that you could do doing some coaching/consulting a few hours a week helping people. There are many many opportunities out there but this sounds like a natural fit based on the experience you have had turning everything around. All the best!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjyb44/how_do_i_get_back_on_track_after_ten_years_of/hc15pio/"}
