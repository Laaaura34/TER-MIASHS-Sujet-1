A nice meditation+journaling routine would probably be really helpful through this transitional time. You don't have to get crazy with the meditation. One minute with your eyes closed while following your breath would be enough. Thoughts will pop up and then you can journal about them.\n\nI'll go ahead and make the point of how good things are for you again. They just don't feel like it because you experienced CRAZY good so young. Like\u2026 you really must be in the 0.01% in terms of what you pulled off by 23.\n\nYou got this. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjyb44/how_do_i_get_back_on_track_after_ten_years_of/hcw2ybi/"}
