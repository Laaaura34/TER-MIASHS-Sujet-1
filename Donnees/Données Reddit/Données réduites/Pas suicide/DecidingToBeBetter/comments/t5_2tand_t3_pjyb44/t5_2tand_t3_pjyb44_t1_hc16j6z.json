Sure. Coding boot camp? Those work. Find a job? That works too.\n\nFor the record you're still EXTREMELY young. Like\u2026 yeah, I get that you're not fresh out of college and you have a kid now, but you have LOTS of time to do stuff.\n\nIt sounds like you're trying to make a decision based on the idea that you've wasted time and don't have a lot of time left but that's not true.\n\nAny of the things you listed could work out fine, especially for you! (Based on that back story.)\n\nI recommend taking some deep breaths, realizing you're in a REALLY good spot, and taking your time to figure out which direction you want to go in.\n\nReally, you're clearly extremely smart/talented, you have a stable situation with savings, and you have plenty of time. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjyb44/how_do_i_get_back_on_track_after_ten_years_of/hc16j6z/"}
