OP, do you have a calendar or check box when you complete a day? That could be very self-affirming when you develop a streak. \n\nIm sure that you are giving up nicotine totally, but if you do have an urge to smoke a cigarette, are you increasing the number of steps that it takes to get a cigarette? E.g. a friend of mine smoked like a chimney and then decided that the only way he would purchase cigarettes would be with cash. Since he never carried cash, he knew that he would have to drive to an ATM in order to get cash to purchase cigarettes. Long story short, he was successful in quitting. \n\nAnother idea would be to think of a cause that you would hate supporting (e.g. a certain political candidate/ social cause, etc.). You could hand over some money to a friend and direct him to give that money to that cause if you reverted to your old ways. \n\nGood luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mf2j8a/smoking_my_last_cigarette_today_excited_to_wake/gsnfdw7/"}
