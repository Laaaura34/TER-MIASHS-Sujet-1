You could put a big X over every day in the calendar that you didn't smoke. For me I find it really encouraging to see the month filling up with X's for a habit I kept up.

As someone else here said, it's just a pothole but that doesn't mean you have to stop driving entirely.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mf2j8a/smoking_my_last_cigarette_today_excited_to_wake/gslg8j5/"}
