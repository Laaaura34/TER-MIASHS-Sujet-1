It helped me because smoking (the action of inhaling and exhaling smoke) has been a calming habit of mine even if I don't need the substance (nicotine, weed, etc.) itself. \n\nAs someone who didn't like flavors in the past: more interesting flavors = keep your mind off the fact you're NOT smoking nicotine\n\nJuices can be expensive but some shops have sales for like $1 a bottle. If you can't browse them yourself & they hand you a bottle, ALWAYS make sure it has 0 nicotine. My partner has been a little over a year without nicotine but occasionally they hand him the 3mg nicotine on accident even though he explicitly said he wanted 0 nicotine.\n\n**Not encouraging you to continue smoking in any way. \n\nProud of you for quitting! Remember your reasons for quitting and it's okay to slip up some days. You're still lowering your cigarette consumption at the end of the day and that's what truly matters!!
