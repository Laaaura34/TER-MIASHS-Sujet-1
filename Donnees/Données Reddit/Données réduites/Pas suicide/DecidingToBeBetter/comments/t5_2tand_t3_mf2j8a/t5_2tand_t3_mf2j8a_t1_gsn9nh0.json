Eventually you do get better at \"riding the waves\". \n\n- baby steps, get through the next minute, then 10, then 30, then an hour etc. If you ever falter, fall back to building up your tolerance of dealing with it in manageable blocks. \n\n- sugar, gum, peppermint tea. Things with strong flavours can be a good distraction. \n\n- just getting outside for a walk. Sometimes if cravings got bad and I felt I was going to lose my shit I'd go and cool off. \n\nBest of luck and no matter what, keep trying.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mf2j8a/smoking_my_last_cigarette_today_excited_to_wake/gsn9nh0/"}
