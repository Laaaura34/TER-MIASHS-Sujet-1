I rarely think about it and when I do it is in a negative way... like, why did I do that? Why was I so stupid to give all my power and energy to a cigarette?\n\nThe first few weeks will be hard. For me, I also hit a weird timeframe around 6-8 months where it got hard again and I\u2019d challenge myself with the thought that I could be a \u201cweekend warrior\u201d and smoke on occasion, but not be addicted. I didn\u2019t give in. I know my personality and would be right back at it.\n\nYou will be so glad when you have quit and get past the hard stuff. You won\u2019t regret not smoking in the long term. Take care of your body. Keep busy, read inspirational things and bookmark things for hard moments. Use apps (smoke free) which keeps a clock running and gives fun while encouraging feedback.\n\nYou can do it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mf2j8a/smoking_my_last_cigarette_today_excited_to_wake/gsn75di/"}
