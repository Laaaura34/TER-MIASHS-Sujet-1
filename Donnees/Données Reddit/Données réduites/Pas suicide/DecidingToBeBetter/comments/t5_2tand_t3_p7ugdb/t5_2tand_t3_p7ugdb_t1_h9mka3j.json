She's willing to manipulate and lie to you so that you stick around. If she actually wanted to see you she would make the effort to do so and she certainly wouldn't have shook you off the Seattle trip only to take another guy and then lie about it. \n\nDon't drive yourself crazy trying to get inside of her head. Even if you were to be straightforward and ask her outright to explain herself - this is in my experience - she will likely not give you an honest answer. It's maddening but something you'll have to learn to live with. \n\nI know it hurts really bad and the best thing you can do is feel the pain and keep a clear head about the situation. You will come out a stronger, more confident and overall attractive person if you use this opportunity to honestly assess your own role in this and move forward. We attract situations like these in life in order to expose our blind spots. I think you may have had a different idea in your head about the relationship than she did, and that's okay, but it can cause a lot of pain when stuff like this happens. Owning up and accepting what is grants enormous power.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p7ugdb/i_think_i_just_saw_my_friendship_fall_apart/h9mka3j/"}
