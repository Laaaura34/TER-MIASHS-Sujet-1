I really don't want it to define and I am only 18 and don't want it to go on like this for the rest of my life. I don't really have access to therapy and I feel like if I went to therapy, my mom would think that she messed me up, blame herself (and me) and I don't want her to feel \"guilty\" or that it is her fault. The college I am going to in the fall offers therapy, but I am scared that they might think I'm too messed up and affect my career choice (doctor). But I think I am I might start visiting them in secret without my mom knowing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hkdg4n/i_realized_i_am_toxic/fws22ae/"}
