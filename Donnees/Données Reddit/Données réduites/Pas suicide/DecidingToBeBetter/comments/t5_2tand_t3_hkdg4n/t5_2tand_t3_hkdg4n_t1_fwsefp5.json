I honestly don't know if i am or am not, but all i know is I want to change. I want to be happy and healthy and glowing.  I would honestly be done to read that book and any other self-care books that you (or anyone) would recommend. My mom was only 20 when she had me plus she just immigrated to a new country without family, so I am trying to not blame her. I feel like I have grown past blaming her. I feel like she was so young and scared and I don't know. I guess i don't want to blame her any more. I just want to heal, and not look back ever.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hkdg4n/i_realized_i_am_toxic/fwsefp5/"}
