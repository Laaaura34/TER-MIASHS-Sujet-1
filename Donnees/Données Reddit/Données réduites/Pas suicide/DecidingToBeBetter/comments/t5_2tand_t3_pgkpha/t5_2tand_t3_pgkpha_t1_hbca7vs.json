Like an hour ride might be killer on your butt but a few months from ago your butt doesn't start hurting until 3 hours in.  If you are on a casual cruiser you could do a gel seat type thing.  On a road bike(or any bike really) you can get a pair of cycling shorts that have gel built into the pants.  I wear these 100% of the time I am cycling.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pgkpha/bought_my_first_bike_as_an_adult_and_took_it_for/hbca7vs/"}
