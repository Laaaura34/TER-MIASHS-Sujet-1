This happened for me too and caused me to stop smoking weed and start taking my life and relationships more seriously. I think it's maturation, and being ready to accept and work through flaws fears and emotions. Some people grow up and start acting like adults but they can't admit to their imperfections and it makes them susceptible to meltdowns and abusive/defensive behavior. Being able to recognize and maturely handle criticisms and concerns, ESPECIALLY from within yourself, makes for much smoother confrontations later in your life. Being able to accept the truth rather than fight and deny it is everything!! Congrats!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iegwur/fear_of_confronting_emotions_is_like_fear_of/g2iqeco/"}
