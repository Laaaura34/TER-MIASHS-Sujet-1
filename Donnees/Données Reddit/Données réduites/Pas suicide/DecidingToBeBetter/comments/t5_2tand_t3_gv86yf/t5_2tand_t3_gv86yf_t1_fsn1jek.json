I do know programming ( I m not sure, but u can say I am intermediate in programming).  I am not into this education system where I learn all the theoretical stuff and never able to do anything related to the practical world. If I have no problems with this time zone. Will there be any use for me to take this session you are talking about. I am aware it's starting from the basics, still, I hope there must be other phases in it. \n\nI want to be a part of the impact that technology can bring to this world. I am not the kind of person who gets some awesome ideas, but I love to work for it.
