A lot of the time, we live content, until people start to see the need to project their own insecurities and awful standards onto us by putting us down to feel better about themselves. As someone who also has body dysmorphia and is slowly trying to get out of the mindset too, I'm so happy to hear that your relationship with food is improving, and I don't think it's weird at all as to how it developed. I'm really sorry all that happened to you, too. \n\nEveryone seems to cater to those who are trying to be thin, and of course that's valid too, but for those of us who are naturally thin, people seem to find it fine in poking jokes or ridiculing us about it. I used to be teased diarrhea just because of it back in primary because of it. \n\nIt's great you're deciding to accept yourself and doing better now. I learnt the hard way that people will always find something negative to say. I put on weight too from binge eating a lot before as well, a healthy amount, too - and I remember being called fat for it. I was 57 KG, and my friends gasped at the number on the scale - that was 'fat'. So I lost weight (not from starving, but I forced myself to walk everwhere to 'punish' myself), went down to 53. The compliments flooded in, but then the eventual \"wow, you've gone way too skinny.\" So I realised, *wow*, there really is no winning here.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ppiib5/how_i_developed_an_eating_disorder_in_the/hd59aod/"}
