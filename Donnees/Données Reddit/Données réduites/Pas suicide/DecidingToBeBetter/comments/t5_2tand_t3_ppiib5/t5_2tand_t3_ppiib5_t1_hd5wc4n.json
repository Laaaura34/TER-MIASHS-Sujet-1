I'm starting to really believe I too have body dysmorphia and binge eating disorder. I've been binge eating since I was 6 years old. My weight has fluctuated from a size 2 - 16 every other year for the past 25 years. I am bizarrely good at hiding the weight too, only hanging out with people at night or something when I'm heavy or telling my SO I'm sick for a week when I'm trying to lose the binging pounds I put on the week before. I always thought I was just undisciplined but I'm going to talk to my doctor about it for real.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ppiib5/how_i_developed_an_eating_disorder_in_the/hd5wc4n/"}
