As a kid my home life was not secure, and one way that this was shown was in food (basic sustenance, not sweets or treats) being used as a \"reward.\" If that sounds insane, that's because it is. In college I went out of control thinking that my new freedom of having meals guaranteed to me was going to somehow be taken away from. I developed a binge eating disorder as a weird pseudo- survival mechanism (?). I don't mean to post a sob story, I just wanted to say that I understand what you went through being the one struggling with no support because your \"problems\" dont present themselves in a cute little gift bag that everyone on the city streets can identify and validate. The point is that I wasn't taken seriously because I wasn't dying to be a skeleton, I was just killing myself with excessive food. Cheers to self improvement! \ud83d\udc4d All the best!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ppiib5/how_i_developed_an_eating_disorder_in_the/hd5dq16/"}
