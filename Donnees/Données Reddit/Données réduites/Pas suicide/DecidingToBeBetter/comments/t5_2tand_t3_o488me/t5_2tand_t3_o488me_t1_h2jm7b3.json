Your better, happier future self will be a product of the small steps you took each day that accumulate over time. I highly recommend you check out the book Atomic Habits! It really helped me understand how our brains work and how to set small goals towards a better self.\n\nAlso, you cannot change yourself from a place of self-hate in the long run. Even if you have to fake it at first, coming from a place of self-love is soooo important. Love yourself enough to push through those negative thoughts and habits, one at a time.
