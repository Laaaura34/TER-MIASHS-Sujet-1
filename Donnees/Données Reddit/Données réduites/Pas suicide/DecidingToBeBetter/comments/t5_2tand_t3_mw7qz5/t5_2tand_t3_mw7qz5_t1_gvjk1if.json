Existential OCD feels so bad & makes me feel extremely sad alot of the time. For example, I read a text message from my dad, suddenly i think, oh wow, my dads in his late 50s.. Something could so easily happen to him, and he could die. Then it breaks off into this big web of shit like: if he died, i have no clue what happens after death, would he just cease to exist? Then i feel extremely sad, because hes christian & what if the religion he spent his whole life believing is all just made up? Then I start thinking about ways to convince him to sign up for cryopreservation after death... Rinse & repeat this thought process for almost any time i interact with someone i care about, its torture. I've already signed up myself for cryopreservation of my brain if i die... And the most annoying part is, I never had ocd about this before, after i got in pretty minor car accident 6 months ago, its all i can think about. Sorry for hijacking your post, just wanted to let you know i understand, sending hugs.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mw7qz5/how_to_stop_being_the_slave_of_own_desires_use/gvjk1if/"}
