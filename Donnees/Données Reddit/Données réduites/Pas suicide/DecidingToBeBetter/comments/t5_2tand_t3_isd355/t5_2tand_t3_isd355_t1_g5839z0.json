I changed my life entirely but it took until I was 27 for me to give myself the exact speech you gave him, nobody is gonna save you except yourself and swallowing that pill of extreme accountability for my own life was the first step in changing everything. I\u2019m happier than ever before, more money, best shape I\u2019ve been in years, quit smoking (still light a blunt once in awhile though.), got sober from alcohol and I\u2019m currently learning to weld as a career and I\u2019m learning Spanish. Sex isn\u2019t the primary reason to exist when you\u2019ve got other real attainable goals in mind and really once you decide what your standard is for yourself your choice in women change too, they\u2019ve got to be more than just hot if you\u2019re gonna date them they have to have a real sense of worth that adds to your life and that extends to everyone in your life once you fix yourself or start to. I hope the guy takes your advice because believe me it fucking works once you stop bitching and start doing. Good luck to the original guy.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/isd355/looking_for_someone_to_try_and_give_me_hope_if/g5839z0/"}
