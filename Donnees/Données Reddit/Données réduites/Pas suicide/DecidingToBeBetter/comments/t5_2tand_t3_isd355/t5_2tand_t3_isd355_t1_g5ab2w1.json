My upbringing was very similar. The thing that\u2019s finally pushing me wasn\u2019t independence, ironically. It was having a friend go homeless, and being there while they pick up the pieces themselves. Suddenly I realized I\u2019m responsible for my life because it could give me flexibility to help my loved ones\u2019.\n\nImagine your best life. For me it was an imaginary wife whose dreams I could one day help support - even if it\u2019s just a little bit. I thought of the couple friends I have and us all bettering ourselves together. I don\u2019t believe in codependency but I do believe in family. And that not all family is by blood.\n\nThese days I make money. Not enough to be fully independent, but I start small, and I\u2019m happier for it. I recommend you do the same.\n\nMy advice? Envision your family, whether that\u2019s kids of your own, a huge social circle, a ranch with animals, some kickass colleagues and their partners, or a couple kids you mentor on weekends. Then try to make some money, or push yourself in ways you were too prideful or ashamed to do before. \n\nI\u2019m not my final goal yet, but I\u2019m happy that I\u2019ve moved forward whatsoever. You got this. Set your goal \u201clow.\u201d As time goes on, your low bar in front of you, without realizing it, will have become very, very high.\n\nIf you put yourself in more positions to make $10 this week than you did the last couple, then you\u2019ve definitely succeeded.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/isd355/looking_for_someone_to_try_and_give_me_hope_if/g5ab2w1/"}
