And if you have it in you to do so, don\u2019t hold back calling them out on how rude they are. If you don\u2019t, try not to take it personally because someone who loves you and cares about you truly wouldn\u2019t be so rude about it.\n\nI\u2019ve heard steroids do that, just know that what you\u2019re doing is great for your body. And don\u2019t give up because it is the steroids and as you\u2019ve mentioned, those are temporary! Just be patient and easy on yourself. You seem dedicated and if you stay disciplined the results will follow!\n\nI\u2019m always here if you need to talk!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oowqwk/no_matter_what_i_do_im_not_making_progress/h640sv3/"}
