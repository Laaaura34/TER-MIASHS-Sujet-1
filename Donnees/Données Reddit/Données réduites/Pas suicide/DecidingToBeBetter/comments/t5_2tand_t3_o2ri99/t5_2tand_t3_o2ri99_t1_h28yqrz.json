Part of me feels guilty saying, \"Ok, kids, it's time for some quiet time!\" Because I worry that what they hear is \"Ok, kids, Mommy's tired of you so go away!\" Which, if I'm being honest, some days is the case. Not literally, of course, but when I start feeling sensory overload, really the only thing I can do is go put myself in a \"time out.\" Some days I catch up on extra cleaning, some days I just take some time to just chill because it'll be the last chance I have to do so until bedtime.\n\nIt sounds like you're the standing guardian for your niece, did I read that right? There's definitely a difference between parenting your own kids and having to parent someone else's. Throw in family drama (which I'm guessing is why you're raising your niece) and mental health problems, and that's a recipe for a shitstorm that I do not envy, even if you only have the one kid. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o2ri99/realizing_im_a_shit_parent_progress_update/h28yqrz/"}
