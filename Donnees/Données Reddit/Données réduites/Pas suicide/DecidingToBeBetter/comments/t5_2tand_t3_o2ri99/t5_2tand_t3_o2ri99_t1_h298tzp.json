It's so great of you to be so supportive like that!\n\nMy brother and his BM were and are absolute shit bags. Always on drugs, constantly assaulting each other. Toxic shit. They'd drop my nephew off for months at a time, like literally not seeing them for 2-4 months some times. Just long enough for whoever was taking him to get used to having him around before they picked him up. They refused to sign custody over because it would mean losing his disability check every month. They're the proof, in my mind, that the system is broken.\n\nI mention this only to tell you I understand. My parents would be standing guardian, but I'd help out with him a lot.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o2ri99/realizing_im_a_shit_parent_progress_update/h298tzp/"}
