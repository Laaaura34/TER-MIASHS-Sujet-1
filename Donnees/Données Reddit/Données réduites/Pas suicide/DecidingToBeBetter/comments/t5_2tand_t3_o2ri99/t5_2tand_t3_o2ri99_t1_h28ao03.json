I will keep this story close to my heart in the dark times. I am working with my therapist to build my own confidence enough to confront her and/or simply lady down boundaries, both of which I'm terrible at! \n\nUnfortunately she is also an all day, every day alcoholic who hasn't left the house in nearly a decade, so there are some additional barriers to overcome. And she didn't raise me, we really haven't had a relationship my entire life, so if I were to disappear she wouldn't be losing anything. \n\nI'm really happy for your success story! I'm sure your mom is feeling lighter and all around better too", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o2ri99/realizing_im_a_shit_parent_progress_update/h28ao03/"}
