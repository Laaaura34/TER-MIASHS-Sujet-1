It sadly isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve been through this and the first time I let myself go.. for 9ish years or so and I was never happy with myself. Since I started working out (beachbody workouts because I Didnt know where to start myself) I\u2019ve felt so much better mentally and so much happier. Going through this again I refuse to let myself go again. Best of luck to you! Always here if you need to chat!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oorlqp/post_break_up_goals_im_making_for_myself/h64117b/"}
