I don't want to freak you out but there have been studies showing that a sudden desinterest in cigarette like you are describing can sometimes be an early signe of lung cancer. I don't have a sudie in english to link but you can probably find them by googling a little. I am not saying that you have cancer, you may very well not have one ! But maybe you could talk to your doctor to see if you can get some test done ? Better be safe than sorry... it's a little stressful to do but it can make an enormous difference when this sort of deasease are discovered in the early stages. I really hope I'm wrong and I'm so sorry for bringing such a negative idea when you are feeling good about yourself and taking care of your health in an amazing way, but I could'nt take the risk not to say it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qh9zft/feeling_like_a_brand_new_human_now/hidujza/"}
