Watch pretty much any episode of House and you'll see what I mean.\n\nAnother big piece of the puzzle is Metacognition- observing the thoughts I think gives me Clues that can lead me to my Beliefs, my \"programming,\" which I can then, with the help of my therapist, address and make adjustments... \n\nThis applies to the body as well- becoming Mindful of my bodily sensations gives me Insight into my emotions/ reactions. I didn't know I had PTSD until I was basically shouting at my supervisor like I was back in Afghanistan, and I realized I was sweating, my heart was racing, which I THEN realized meant that I was pumping with Adrenaline. (Moments of Clarity like this are incredibly rewarding, by the way)\n\nYou wouldn't climb Everest without a sherpa. This journey is just as daunting; stay safe.\n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fet7j3/except_for_therapy_too_scared_to_go_does_anyone/fjvgwc3/"}
