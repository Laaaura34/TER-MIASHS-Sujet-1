It\u2019s easy to read a diagnosis online or in the DSM and assume we have a disorder and not treat the full bio/psycho/social environments.  As others have mentioned, cognitive behavioral therapy is a great tool to learn and unlearn behavior and thoughts that might be what prevent you from engaging in what you feel like avoiding.  If there are reasons for avoidance, those need to be addressed with a professional. Trauma is different for everyone and avoidance is a very common response.\n\nWhile you are getting support and encouragement I would recommend you learn more about what AvPD and see what has helped others.  Try not to compare your symptoms with others.  Some conditions can be treated with tools you are able to learn from books, but having a therapist as a guide and teacher for those skills can be super helpful.  A lot of therapy is changing to become more accommodating with phone and video, so you might have more options with treatment.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fet7j3/except_for_therapy_too_scared_to_go_does_anyone/fjuyieo/"}
