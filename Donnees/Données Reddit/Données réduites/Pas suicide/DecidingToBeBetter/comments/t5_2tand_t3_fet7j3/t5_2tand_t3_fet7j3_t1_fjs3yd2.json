I had been in and out of therapy my whole childhood so I didn't want to go in my adulthood. I had completely isolated myself from everyone who cared about me due to being in an abusive relationship (which only exacerbated the BPD). It came to a point where I just couldn't take it anymore. I wanted change. Only when you want change, can you make the difference. No one can force you to do anything. I convinced my abusive boyfriend to take me to see a therapist (I also have anxiety where I couldn't drive myself anywhere) and it was a slow start. But therapy helped me work through my disorder; work through my thoughts of abandonment and self loathing and irrational behaviors. And now I am so much better. Sure, I have my moments, as anyone else, but I actually have friends now, am in a healthy relationship and I am fulfilling my dream. Therapy works as long as you want it to. I believe in you, along with the rest of your internet buddies here. You can do anything you set your mind to, you just have to want it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fet7j3/except_for_therapy_too_scared_to_go_does_anyone/fjs3yd2/"}
