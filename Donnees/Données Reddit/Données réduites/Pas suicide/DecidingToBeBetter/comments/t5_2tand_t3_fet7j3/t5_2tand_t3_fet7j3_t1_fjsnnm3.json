I remember feeling like I was suffocating in crowds. I remember heaving and shaking as I told my general doctor I needed medication, now. I remember how I struggled to go to class, show up to my exams, talk to my group mates and it cost me that entire year. I was too afraid to ask for help and I lost so much because of it, and I regret it so much.\n\nI went to therapy and I was prescribed meds. It's been 3-4 years now, I can make phonecalls and send emails without flinching. I can raise my hand and ask questions, seek help when necessary.\n\nMy mental health is far from perfect (I'm severely depressed) but that hurdle has been overcome. It wasn't just the meds obviously, but they put down a barrier that made me go out and do what I needed to do. I would obsess for hours on how to formally send an email and now I barely think of it twice.\n\nI know it's harder than anything to seek help. But not doing anything only makes things worse. I promise you'll feel so much relieved and feel like things are so much easier when you actually manage to ask for help.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fet7j3/except_for_therapy_too_scared_to_go_does_anyone/fjsnnm3/"}
