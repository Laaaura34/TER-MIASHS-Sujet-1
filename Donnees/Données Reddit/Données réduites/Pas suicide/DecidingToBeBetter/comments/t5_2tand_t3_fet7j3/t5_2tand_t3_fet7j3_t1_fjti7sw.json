I'm basically the definition of avoidant personality. CBT, I took it for years and it didn't help. When I started DBT I cried my eyes out realizing that I finally had help. I don't know if I can post links but I'll find the workbook I'm using. I go to a DBT group therapy but the workbook will still have a big effect without the group therapy. I preach DBT to anyone who'll listen!  Found it!  https://tinyurl.com/tsydu4l", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fet7j3/except_for_therapy_too_scared_to_go_does_anyone/fjti7sw/"}
