Exercising does nothing for me, emotionally. I was lifting weights for 3 days a week for 8 months, I've been on a swim team, took ballet classes, done cardio - it has zero effect on my energy levels. I'm still exhausted and depressed every day. I don't waste my money on the gym or classes anymore. The one thing I've stuck with is riding my bicycle, because I save gas by biking to a nearby store for small shopping trips. Having a destination in mind and feeling like I've done something useful is why it doesn't feel like a complete waste of time. It doesn't make me happy but I feel like I'm being productive, like I'm doing something I \"should\" be doing.
