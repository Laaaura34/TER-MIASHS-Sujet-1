I just really enjoy listening to them because they make me feel better, so I usually do a 15-20 minute positive one in the morning and a 20 min depression/anxiety relief one at night while lying in bed. 8 times out of 10 I fall asleep before the 20 min is over. So it's a double whammy for me because sometimes I struggle with sleep too. If the first one doesn't put me to sleep I'll listen to one of the 90 minute \"sleep\" specific ones", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ax6shz/depression_a_list_of_things_that_may_help/ehszngf/"}
