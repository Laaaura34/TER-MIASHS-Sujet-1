I've dealt with depression for a majority of my life and the things stated in the list are things that have worked for me personally.\n\nI know the feeling of not wanting to get out of bed and forcing myself to anyway.  I've been locked up in a bathroom slitting my wrists because I wanted to feel SOMETHING!!!\n\nThese are all things I've done that have helped me to feel better.  I realize medication is needed in most cases but I want to put other approaches out there because believe it or not there are people who don't want to depend on a pill to be normal and would like to try other approaches. I've been on antidepressants and hated them.  So thus the list of things that COULD potentially help.
