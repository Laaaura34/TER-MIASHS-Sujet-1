Exercise would help if I didn\u2019t have chronic migraine. \n\nLook up the bio-social model.  My childhood, teenage and adult life were full of different forms of trauma.  I spent years in a mental health community.  Also in migraine clinics.  Depression just doesn\u2019t go away for some of us.  SSRI and SNRI do nothing, nor MAOI.  We can only hope that life stops slinging shit at us, and embrace the angels in our lives who love us for who we are, depression, borderline, migraines and all.
