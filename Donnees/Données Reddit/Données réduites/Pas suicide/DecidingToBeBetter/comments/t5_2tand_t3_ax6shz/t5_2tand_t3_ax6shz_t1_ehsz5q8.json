Even guided meditation makes an impact and eventually you'll get so used to creating breathing habits that allow you to focus on that over your thoughts that you won't need the guided stuff. However, I still really love the guided ones. If you pay for the app (you don't have to, it's a free app) you can take courses so it takes the guess work out of it for you. Just listen to the daily lesson and your done. I have found though that I like listening at least twice a day, once in the morning before getting out of bed to one of the morning meditations and again before bed as they really help put me to sleep while listening to something positive/mindful.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ax6shz/depression_a_list_of_things_that_may_help/ehsz5q8/"}
