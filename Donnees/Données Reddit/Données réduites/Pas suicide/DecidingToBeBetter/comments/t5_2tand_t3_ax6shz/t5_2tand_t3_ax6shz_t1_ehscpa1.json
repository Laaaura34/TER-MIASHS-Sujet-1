Add to that living with a person who tried to off themselves because of anti-depressants.\n\nEven if someone isn\u2019t prepared to be medicated, it is still better to be monitored by a professional psychiatrist.  As much as you believe putting out another option is important that is how much I believe the narrative of taking care of it yourself is harmful. I don\u2019t know the extent of your depression, but I know that for those closest to me their depression is LIFE THREATENING.  They are struggling to take care of it themselves which is making it worse. It\u2019s not someone anyone should be convinced they can handle on their own, that\u2019s how suicide happens.\n\nFor over a decade I was convinced that if I just took better care of myself I wouldn\u2019t have symptoms of my various mental illnesses. It makes you feel like a failure when they continue to occur because you can\u2019t change it.\n\nNote: I know by everyone can afford mental healthcare. There are some great options out their for free or low-cost mental healthcare but that of course varies by location.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ax6shz/depression_a_list_of_things_that_may_help/ehscpa1/"}
