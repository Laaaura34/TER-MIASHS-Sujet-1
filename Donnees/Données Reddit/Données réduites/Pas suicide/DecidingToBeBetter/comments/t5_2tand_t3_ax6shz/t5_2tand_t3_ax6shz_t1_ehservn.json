As someone currently fighting the big D, I've tried most of these things (bar church and affirmations). They have certainly helped in my case. I'm not 100% \"better\", but I dont feel anywhere near as low as I felt about 4 months ago, which was pretty terrible.\n\nAnyway, one other thing I do which helps is end my daily journaling (well, almost daily journalling) with 3 things I'm grateful for. Some days these are harder to think of than others, but I generally go to bed with positive things in my head and it helps me get to sleep.\n\nFull disclosure: I'm also taking 20mg Fluoxetine but I've read loads about how exercise, diet and mindset are really game changers. I want to be able to cope in a few months when I am weaned off the meds.\n\nJust know that things are never as hopeless as you might perceive them to be and you can get better.\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ax6shz/depression_a_list_of_things_that_may_help/ehservn/"}
