The best way to think about it is this: trying to meditate is already meditation. If you are using any of the many meditation methods out there, you're meditating regardless of if you achieve altered states of consciousness.\n\n  There are theories about how long you should do at minimum to have any benefit and pretty much everyone agrees that a high frequency (ideally everyday) is important, but meditation is not something you do to impress other people or to reach a certain goal. Meditation can be many things, but in the context of this discussion I would say it's a form of self care. In that case, as important as discipline can be, I would suggest that you go easy on yourself. Try to do it everyday, but don't feel guilty of you don't manage to. Otherwise you're just creating one more problem inside your head.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ax6shz/depression_a_list_of_things_that_may_help/ehsnynr/"}
