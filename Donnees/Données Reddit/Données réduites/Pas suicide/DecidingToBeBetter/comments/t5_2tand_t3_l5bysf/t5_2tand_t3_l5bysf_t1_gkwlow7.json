A year after I stopped self harming I got a small rose tattoo over some of my scars as a promise to myself that I would never do it again and I kept that promise and it\u2019s been 4 years! I didn\u2019t want to cover them completely because they are a part of my life and the struggles Ive been through and I\u2019m not ashamed of them. You have done an amazing, incredible thing overcoming this and I am sending you a huge virtual hug! Be proud of yourself!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l5bysf/one_year_with_no_self_harm/gkwlow7/"}
