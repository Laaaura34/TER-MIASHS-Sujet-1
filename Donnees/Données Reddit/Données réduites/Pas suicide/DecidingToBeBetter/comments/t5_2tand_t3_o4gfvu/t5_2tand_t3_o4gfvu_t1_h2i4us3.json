Her methods are based on Rational Recovery by Jack Trimpey, who created this technique called Addictive Voice Recognition Technique (AVRT). \n\nThe technique recognises that the human brain consists of two parts, the \"primitive animal\" brain and the \"human\" brain. AVRT calls the \"primitive animal\" brain as the Beast Brain, which causes the voice of craving, basically the part of the brain that is responsible for your addiction. To overcome this, you have to learn to recognise this Addiction Voice by being able to identify when this \"voice\" is speaking to you, by recognising its patterns and imagining it as an entity that is separated from your true \"self\", which is the human part of your brain.\n\nYou can read a longer introduction here:\n[AVRT](http://hams.cc/avrt)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o4gfvu/how_do_i_stop_binge_eating/h2i4us3/"}
