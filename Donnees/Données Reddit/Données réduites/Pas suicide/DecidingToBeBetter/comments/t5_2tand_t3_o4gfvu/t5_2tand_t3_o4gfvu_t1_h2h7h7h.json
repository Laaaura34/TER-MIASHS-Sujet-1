Start with intermittent, maybe OMAD, only fluids, and eventually a whole day or three. \n\nIt will be a mental challenge at first, but it actually gets really easy once you've beat the first hunger.\n\nFasting improves your relationship with hunger and food very quickly. You get to understand what's just cravings, what's necessary for your body to function (not that much), and do some kind of reset that kills any bad eating habits.\n\nIt's also a very good option to help decrease your caloric intake in order to lose weight. Doctors often recommend doing a fasting day once a week. It's not a magic cure, but you will definitely decrease your calories for the week and be surprised that you actually don't need food everyday to perform at the same level.\n\nBesides you should decrease your carbohydrates. Your insulin levels are very important when it comes to binge eating and carbohydrates are your enemy. Spiking your insulin levels is like a drug. It triggers your hunger and cravings and you can't help yourself but eat - preferably more carbs. Fasting is a great tool to break this vicious cycle, too. Don't cut them out completely, it makes things harder and unsustainable. Just know that they are generally not as good for you as protein or fat.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o4gfvu/how_do_i_stop_binge_eating/h2h7h7h/"}
