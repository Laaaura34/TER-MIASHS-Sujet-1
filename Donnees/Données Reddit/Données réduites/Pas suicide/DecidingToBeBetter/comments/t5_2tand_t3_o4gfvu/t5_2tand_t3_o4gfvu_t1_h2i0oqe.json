Which is getting accustomed to eating without distractions and listening to your body but also not designating foods as good or bad necessarily. Having a balanced diet and allowing yourself to eat a brownie or something when you feel like it takes away a lot of the power and guilt and makes the addictive component of food greatly diminished. Doesn't work for everyone and it's a journey, but I rarely ever binge now, and when I do it's like 2 plates of food rather than before which was a loaf of a bread, jar of Nutella etc. Like enormous amounts. Look into it maybe. \n\nAlso, be super critical of what a deficit is. You may already know a lot about things but just in case. There are a tonne of factors that go into how much energy you need, and you're a lot more likely to binge if you're consistently eating under what you need eg. One of my friends is a 170cm woman who is moderately active but due to bad resources thought she should be eating 1500cal a day. That is not enough!!! She has now lost a lot of weight and kept it off by having an intake of 2300cal. She rarely binges now and still enjoys her favourite snacks, where as before she was eating really strictly most of the time then binging because her body wasn't getting what it needed. \n\nEveryone has different ways they go about things, but I would advise against fad diets and plans imo, and if you can get a couple of sessions with a dietician it could be really good for you as a base point.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o4gfvu/how_do_i_stop_binge_eating/h2i0oqe/"}
