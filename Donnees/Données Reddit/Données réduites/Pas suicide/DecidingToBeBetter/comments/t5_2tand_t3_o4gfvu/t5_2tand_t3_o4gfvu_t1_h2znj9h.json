I am in remission for BED, but I lived with it for ten years and it completely ran my life. In my case, binge eating became disordered after I restricted too much for too long\u2014 if this is the case for you too, intermittent fasting and one meal a day is a bad idea. I tried these both and they made everything worse. I ended up in the hospital once, because my electrolytes were so screwed up from fasting and binging.\n\nI ended up going to a doctor, who listened to me and took me seriously, and referred me to a health at every size (HAES) dietician. It\u2019s been a long long road, but now I can eat intuitively, without much guilt, and very rarely binge (maybe once a month, and they are pretty tame).\n\nIf you think it is turning into an eating disorder, I\u2019d really recommend you looking for outside help. It\u2019s so easy to get trapped in our own heads. And diet culture glamorizes disordered eating.\n\nIn any case, I wish you well! Binging is so uncomfortable and I feel for you! You\u2019re not alone.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o4gfvu/how_do_i_stop_binge_eating/h2znj9h/"}
