To *make* me a good girl.\n\nIt took me this long to realize that nobody can make me do anything, and that the power to change myself has to come from within. I have the desire to be better. I'm taking the first steps. I don't presume myself so skilled that I won't still stumble, but I feel like I'm stumbling towards the light of better days, rather than just aimlessly around in the same dark pit.\n\nTherapy is my (well-paid!) friend, as is remembering that life is hard, but that it is also beautiful.\n\nGonna try to work more outdoor walks into my day. Lots of other things. Thanks for the kind, warm words, stranger. \u263a\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kw6bfz/today_i_unsubscribed_from_over_400_nsfw/gj37vhp/"}
