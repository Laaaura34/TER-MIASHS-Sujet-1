You may find that your partner isn't the right one for you once you embrace your full self. Or you may find that what they wanted is different than what you had assumed. Or that they grow with you and appreciate your journey even as it takes you away from who they thought they wanted to you to be.\n\nThe only person that is with you from the day that you are born until the day that you die is *YOU*. So be your best self, life your best life, and trust that you can find the right people to walk with on your path. They don't have to already be walking with you.\n\nIt definitely helps that I am not ovulating this week. Those times are difficult, my hormones sometimes take over my thought processes. But, I will work to focus that energy into productive things like exercise or cleaning or something.\n\nAlso, honestly, therapy helps. And getting enough sleep. And knowing that mismatched libidos are hard to fix, and that if more frequent sex is very important to you that you need to find someone that feels the same way.\n\nBaby steps. Pick a destination, and then don't be so fixed in your focus as to miss opportunities to seek other destinations as they become apparent to you.\n\nStay positive! I'm glad me talking about my struggles has been able to help you look at some of your own in a new light.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kw6bfz/today_i_unsubscribed_from_over_400_nsfw/gj4zg5u/"}
