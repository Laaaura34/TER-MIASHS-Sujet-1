That is always nice to hear.\n\nAlso, I think one of the biggest pieces of clarity for me out of all of this is that it doesn't matter who other people want me to be, because I have to wake up and go to sleep with myself. I need to like the person that I am, and after that I need to like the people that I specifically choose to focus on in my life. Any people that are in my life not through my own choosing can think what they want of me, and that is there prerogative.\n\nI don't know that I am fully there yet, but I feel a lot closer to living that way than I used to.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kw6bfz/today_i_unsubscribed_from_over_400_nsfw/gj54pvv/"}
