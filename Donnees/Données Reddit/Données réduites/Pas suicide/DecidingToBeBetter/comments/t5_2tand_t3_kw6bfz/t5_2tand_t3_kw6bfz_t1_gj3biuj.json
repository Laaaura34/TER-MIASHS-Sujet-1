And at one point unhealthy relationship with hookups, porn, and sexual anorexia if you can believe that\u2019s a thing. \n\nCheck out r/slaa or just SLAA website, I didn\u2019t work the program but I went to meetings for a while and it really helped me. A lot of people have gone through this! Congrats on your revelations and healthy steps!\n\nPs - in terms of Reddit, I have multiple accts. I used to have one for nsfw stuff. If you\u2019re trying to cut back/out, maybe create an alt acct for that stuff? It might help to control how much time and energy you spend on them, and at one point you might even lose interest in logging on. Also for kink have you heard of fet life? Idk if I should recommend if you haven\u2019t heard of it, there are some creeps and fuckboys on there but it\u2019s basically like fb for kink.
