Kudos to you, as this space is a good one to formulate our thoughts and write our personal narratives. Also kudos for staying so refined in the face of such a hateful and judgemental response to your journey of *deciding to be better.* They took every piece they could snag their shitty hook on and tug in an attempt to reopen the wounds you've clearly healed.\n\nI honor your journey and path forward. It's difficult enough without complete strangers inserting their hate. Good on you for not falling into their trap!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kw6bfz/today_i_unsubscribed_from_over_400_nsfw/gj3jmem/"}
