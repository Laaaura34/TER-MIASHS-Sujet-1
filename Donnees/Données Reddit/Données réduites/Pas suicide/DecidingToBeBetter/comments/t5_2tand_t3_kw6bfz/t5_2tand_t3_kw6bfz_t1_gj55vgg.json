Knowing I don't have anything new to say, I swiped and swiped. But my mind and my heart refuse to let go of this post.\n\n\nYou sharing your story, vulnerability, your true desire and taking that difficult first (430) step towards proving yourself. That touched me on a different level.\n\n\nI was in a similar situation as you, marriage-wise and kink-wise, and I can totally relate to the rush that you get when you start getting attention on Reddit and the freedom you feel when you can FINALLY be true to yourself and your kink. When that happened to me, it feels like I'd been holding my breath this whole time and I could finally let the air out and just breathe. There's an air of calm and contentment and self love. To not let yourself be oppressed and controlled by others' cruel and torturous neglect, to be free of the cage that had been a prison for so long, that keeps getting smaller and smaller every day squeezing the life out of you.\n\n\nI'm so so happy for you to be taking the healthy step towards your journey. I'm new in my journey to freedom too, and I might have already found the one, though I didn't intend to. I'm in therapy and learning about love, being able to put my needs first, and addressing my social anxiety. I know the guy I'm with is definitely the one but I'm not sure if I should be with him cause I don't wanna miss out on exploring myself either.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kw6bfz/today_i_unsubscribed_from_over_400_nsfw/gj55vgg/"}
