I enjoy that the authors in More Than Two also talk about how it is totally reasonable to be poly and celibate, or poly but in a committed monogamous relationship, as well as the hard talk about how hard poly is to do right, especially with society so geared up towards monogamous relationships.\n\nThere are parts of myself that could be happy in any number of lifestyles. I just need to find the right path now that I am more aware of my desires, and the right people / person to walk that path with. This pandemic sucks ass for the meeting people part, but I'm getting a lot more time for personal development and reading and such because I am not out chasing relationships.\n\nThanks for the recommendation! You know it is a good one because I'm already reading it! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kw6bfz/today_i_unsubscribed_from_over_400_nsfw/gj3ia6l/"}
