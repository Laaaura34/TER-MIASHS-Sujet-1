There would be nothing wrong if you wanted to be someone with an NSFW account, btw! It just wasn't something that was serving me any longer.\n\nI posted this here because I live in a very conservative area. Even talking about owning a dildo or a butt plug is gonna raise eyebrows with most of my friends. There is a kink community here that is small and strong, but I haven't got much into that. Only really had my freedom right as covid started. So Reddit was my outlet for my NSFW behaviour, and it seemed like the only place I would be able to talk about moving away from some of that behaviour.\n\nThank you for your support! I hope you are well, too!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kw6bfz/today_i_unsubscribed_from_over_400_nsfw/gj5154v/"}
