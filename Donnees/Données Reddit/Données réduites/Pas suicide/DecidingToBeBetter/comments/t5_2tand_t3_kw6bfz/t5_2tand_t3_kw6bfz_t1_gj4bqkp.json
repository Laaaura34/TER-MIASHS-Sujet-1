I have kept this account, I still have a few sexy subreddits that I am subscribed to. You have taken things to the next level! Congratulations!\n\nTell yourself you are doing well, and use all of this spare time you will now have to find a hobby or a passion that, when you are 90, you can look back and say \"I spent hundreds of hours honing my skills at XYZ and look how amazing I am now because of it\".\n\nI've recently lost two close relatives. One with no notice and one with weeks notice. Another is facing a terminal cancer diagnosis. I look at their lives and think about the things I see as their triumphs and the way that they spent their time. They were all complex people, they all have bad sides, but the positive things they did are things that I want to be remembered for, things that I want to contribute to. Find some positive place to direct your energy, and as someone else told me here, be kind to yourself if you relapse. Set goals, and wall towards them any progress is still progress.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kw6bfz/today_i_unsubscribed_from_over_400_nsfw/gj4bqkp/"}
