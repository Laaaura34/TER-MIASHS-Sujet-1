Working hard does not necessarily mean working ridiculous hours. Give somebody 9 hours, from 9am to 6pm. Different people can get different amounts done over that time span.  \n  \nYou\u2019re ambitious, want to be successful? Concentrate on optimizing those 9 hours. Want to get in really deep? Work 9am-8pm\u2026 even then, you still have several hours each day for you and your relationships.  \n  \nBut, trying to work every waking moment 7 days a week really doesn\u2019t work. You can do that for a while, but you\u2019ll burn out. It\u2019s like trying to be productive by never sleeping. You might get a bit more done for 72 hours, but then you\u2019ll lose productivity when you become a basket case.  \n  \nSo, \u201cworking your hardest\u201d should still leave time to nurture the relationships in your life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pm89om/how_do_i_24m_balance_being_very_ambitious_and/hcgry5q/"}
