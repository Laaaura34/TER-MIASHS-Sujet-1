Communicate. Maybe take a course on relationship communication together or go on a couple's retreat if that's something she'd be into. Work on making time and scheduling time together so that you both have something to look forward to and so that the time spent together it prioritized. It's not prioritized at the expense of your dreams, it's prioritized by being the thing you schedule first (outside of mandatory work times). Also remember that you need time for self-care, exercise and to see friends. If possible, make sure you schedule some of those things together so you're getting in more time together than if you kept everything separate.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pm89om/how_do_i_24m_balance_being_very_ambitious_and/hcgholq/"}
