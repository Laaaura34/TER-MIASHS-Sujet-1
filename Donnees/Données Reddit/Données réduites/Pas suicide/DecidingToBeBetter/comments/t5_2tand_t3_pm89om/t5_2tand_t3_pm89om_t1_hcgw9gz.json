I would bet my life that it's the single biggest source of regret for everyone in developed economies. \n\nSave yourself the stupidity.\n\nThe particular irony of this is that people who slave away sacrificing their lives are actually *under-valued*, for they take the amount of time they've been paid for, and say \"actually, **my time is worth much less than that** and then give a bunch away for free, becoming progressively sillier as their overwork takes its toll\".\n\nPretty soon they're the office clown - always working extra yet always on the verge of a breakdown, needing to put in twice the hours to get half as much done. When promotion time comes around, do you think anyone is saying \"let's give a job to that guy who works like a slave and is always at breaking point?\". Not only would they not want to lose all that free labour, but they wouldn't see you as fit to lead *because you wouldn't be*.\n\nBe a great partner. That's something you can take to the bank, possibly for the rest of your life, and there's a very good chance that learning to appreciate what matters will actually put you further ahead in your career anyway.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pm89om/how_do_i_24m_balance_being_very_ambitious_and/hcgw9gz/"}
