The thing he's done very well over our 31+ years together is spontaneous time together. \nSpontaneous road trips,  dinner,  basketball at the park,  kayaking,  hiking,  mall,  camping, weekends away, museums... really anything you could think of. \nI'd be on my way home from work and he'd call to say we're dropping the kids off at his sister's,  how quickly can I be packed for a weekend away?\n\nSaturday morning were doing chores, he'd tell the kids to get their shoes on were leaving as soon as everyone can get ready.  \n\nWe never knew when he would have time for an adventure, but these times were/are so incredibly important to all of us. \n\nJust because you have a crazy schedule that's unpredictable doesn't mean you can't shut off work for a minute and just spend quality time with those you love. If you love them,  think outside the box and figure it out. \n\nWe didn't take a scheduled vacation every year like most people do.  But I'd trade a yearly vacation for our spontaneous adventures any day of the week!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pm89om/how_do_i_24m_balance_being_very_ambitious_and/hch6jif/"}
