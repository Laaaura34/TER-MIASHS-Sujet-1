One thing I found in my own life was that I could create more time for those two big priorities by optimizing in other areas and cutting time there.\n\nI employed two strategies. The first was to spend money on things that would save me TIME. It\u2019s worth having a more expensive apartment if you have a dishwasher, washer and dryer. (Major time savings) Want to save time cleaning? Get a roomba. Wasting time driving to work? Consider mass transit. It takes longer but you have more control over that time. Instead of driving you can handle work emails or work on projects etc. There are lots of areas in life that consume a lot of time without adding much value. Find ways to cut those first.\n\nThe second strategy was to combine areas that I DID want to allocate time to. Both health and friendships are important to me so I found a running club. Now my exercise time doubles and friend time. There may be areas where you can double up as well.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pm89om/how_do_i_24m_balance_being_very_ambitious_and/hcgba6o/"}
