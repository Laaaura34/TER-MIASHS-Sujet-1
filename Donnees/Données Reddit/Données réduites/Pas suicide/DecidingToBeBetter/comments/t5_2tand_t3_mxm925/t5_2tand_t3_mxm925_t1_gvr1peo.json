Improvement is about \"leveling up\" from here. If you can only manage to study for 2 hours at the moment, then one small step forward from it should be your starting point (provided you've already established habit consistency, if not, ALWAYS start with it). After 2 or so weeks maybe you've improved your focus to 3 hours, after another 2 or 3 months maybe you're at 5 hours, etc.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mxm925/i_start_every_day_thinking_i_will_do_this_do_that/gvr1peo/"}
