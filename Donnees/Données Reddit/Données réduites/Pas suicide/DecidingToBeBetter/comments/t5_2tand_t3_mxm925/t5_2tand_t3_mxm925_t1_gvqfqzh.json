I studied 30-90 minutes a day, depending on the semester and my classes and graduated with a 3.95.  I think that you feel like you\u2019re failing because you\u2019re setting wildly unrealistic goals.  How about you set the goal to study for 2 40-50 minute periods a day instead of 1?  Doubling your study time instead of trying to multiply it by 8 or 9 times.  You\u2019ll still do more than you\u2019re currently doing, but it\u2019s something that you can actually achieve and feel proud of.\n\nHave you heard of SMART goals?  Specific, Measureable, Achieveable, Realistic, and Time bound.  Refocusing your goals may help you achieve as well.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mxm925/i_start_every_day_thinking_i_will_do_this_do_that/gvqfqzh/"}
