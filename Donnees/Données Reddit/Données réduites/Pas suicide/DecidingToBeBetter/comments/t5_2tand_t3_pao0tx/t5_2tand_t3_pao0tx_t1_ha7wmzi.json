Also, I have a technique I want to share called the Daily Temperature Reading by Virginia Satir, who is very well known for pioneering family therapy. So basically it is a daily check in that you use with your significant other. \n1 Appreciation- First, let them know how much you care about and appreciate them taking the time to listen and support you. You can do this by telling them one thing they do or have done that you appreciate. Ex: making dinner, picking up the groceries \n\n2 New information- present anything new that\u2019s going on they don\u2019t know about. Good or bad. Can be as simple as you finding a new song, weather update etc.\n\n3 Puzzles- bring up anything you are wondering about, worried about, or need clarification on\n\n4 Complaints with request for change- exactly that. Gently bring up something that you would like the other person to do differently. You can use an \u201cI\u201d statement (I feel_______ when you/because of_____. Please_____. \n\nOr simply \u201cThis is my complaint___, this is my request-___\u201d\n\n5 Wishes, hopes, and dreams - something you\u2019re looking forward to.\n\nThe idea is that you alternate completing the steps. Don\u2019t argue or answer questions, just share and listen. After you\u2019re done, thank each other for sharing and maybe give a hug/kiss. I think this will help you with equal sharing and consistent so things don\u2019t build up for you. \n\nSorry it\u2019s so long!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pao0tx/how_can_i_handle_my_stress_better_so_that_i_dont/ha7wmzi/"}
