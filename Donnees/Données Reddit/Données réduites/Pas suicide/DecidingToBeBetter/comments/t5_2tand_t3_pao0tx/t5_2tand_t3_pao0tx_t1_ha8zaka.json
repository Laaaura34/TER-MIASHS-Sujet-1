It has happened a few times, and at that point I usually just shut down completely and curl up in a ball until it passes.\n\nYou can try:\n\n1. Identify your emotions and practice what you would like to say before you get home. When we are upset, it\u2019s easy to fixate on unrelated things to focus that negative energy on. Instead, try to identify the actual root of your stress. Even if your conclusion at the end is \u201cI don\u2019t know I just feel mad\u201d, that\u2019s ok. The important thing is to recognize that your fury over shoes not being on the shoe rack, the news, or some other petty thing is just your own shit getting projected somewhere it doesn\u2019t belong. It helps you let go and stop escalating. \n\n2. Before entering your home, take some deep breaths and repeat a mantra (Try picking three reliable, positive things in your life to focus on, or favourite calm memories to replay)\n\nYou also don\u2019t need to be completely free of that stress and negativity to tell her what you are feeling. \n\nThe important part is to not attack her or make escalating negative statements about others. It\u2019s just \u201cI feel x way right now\u201d and \u201cI will try x for time interval to calm down\u201d. Keep it dead simple. Even in a stressed out state you should be able to squeeze that out and then stay silent long enough to hide away in a safe place.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pao0tx/how_can_i_handle_my_stress_better_so_that_i_dont/ha8zaka/"}
