You bring up a very important and different perspective which I really really appreciate.\n\nI have thought about how my childhood has affected my behavior today. My mom is extremely loving and caring for me, perhaps maybe too much. By sulking and crying I would always be catered for, I wouldn't be punished for it. Over my childhood, as this repeated, I began to associate my sulking/crying with positive rewards.\n\nI think my girlfriend is the first to directly tell me how this affects her.

I always knew in the back of my mind how bad this was for me and for the loved ones around me, but something really stroked me when my girlfriend was up front about it", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pao0tx/how_can_i_handle_my_stress_better_so_that_i_dont/ha88xx3/"}
