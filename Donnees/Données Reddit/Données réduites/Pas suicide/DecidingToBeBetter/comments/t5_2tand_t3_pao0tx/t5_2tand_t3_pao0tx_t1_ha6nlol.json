I have a high stress job that would spill over as it's hard for me to mentally detach. My daily routine now includes weight lifting as soon as I get home. This helps me decompress and compartmentalize my day. I get home, lift, then go eat dinner/bathe the kids/put them to bed/etc. It's helped immensely with not bringing stress home. This insulates my loved ones from my burdens, so to speak.  \n\nI know your post didn't reference professional stress, but perhaps you could try something similar when you're having negative feelings. For example, if you're in a bad mood (for lack of a better term) try willing yourself to go for a solo activity, like a long walk (or jog, or bike ride, you get the idea). Pop in your head phones, put on a playlist or audiobook, or just take in nature, and focus on just absorbing the moment. This should help clear your head and \"center\" you. It's kind of like meditating but with some exercise mixed in (I like to multitask). \n\nIf you think my input trivial, you may very well be correct. If that is the case, however, I think professional advice may be your best option to get yourself sorted.
