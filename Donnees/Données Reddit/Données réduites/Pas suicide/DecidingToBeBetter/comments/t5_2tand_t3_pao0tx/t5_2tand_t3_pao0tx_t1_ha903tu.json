I think you\u2019re already on the right track with changing careers and reducing the amount of stress in your life. Other things that can help are cutting out toxic people and situations from your life, intentionally devoting time to be present with your emotions whether that be through journaling meditation therapy or anything else that helps you to get in touch with your feelings. As someone else mentioned, exercise is also great because it can help to move static feelings and energy. And even though your life is busy it\u2019s important to devote time every day to doing something that you love and that genuinely brings joy into your life. We all make mistakes. When you do it\u2019s important to be accountable to the people that you harm and apologize. And take intentional steps to change the behavior. Also try to stop saying that everything is OK when it\u2019s not. You might not even be aware of what\u2019s wrong but when she ask you that know that something is going on and maybe you can say \u201cI am not able to express what I\u2019m feeling right now\u201d and then spend some time with yourself so you can get in touch with your feelings and process them so you\u2019re not taking them out on others.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pao0tx/how_can_i_handle_my_stress_better_so_that_i_dont/ha903tu/"}
