Communicating here is key! Don't be afraid to tell people how you feel (you don't need to give the reasons why you feel that way) and to express your needs.  \n\nWhen I was younger, everytime my mum would come back home after a stressful day, she would be really tense and would yell at me for no reason. \nThen, I asked her what she needed in order to feel calm. She didn't know back then, but together, we figured out that she needed the apartment to be clean and tidy. \n\nI used to be messy, but as I understood how tired she was after a day at work, and how important it was for her to keep the apartment in a clean state, I tried to as much as possible to with her needs.\n\nSo I'd say \n1) Be aware of what makes you feel stressed/anxious and how it affects your interaction with others\n2) Tell people how you feel\n3) Figure out what are your need in order to feel less stressed \n4) Communicate that need!\n5) Breath.
