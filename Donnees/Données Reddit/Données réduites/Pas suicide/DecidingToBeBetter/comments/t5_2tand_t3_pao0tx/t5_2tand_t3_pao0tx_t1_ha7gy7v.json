I actually got to the point my coworkers went from saying I was a saint and loved working when I was to saying I had turned into an A-hole. For everyone's sake, I left the job. I didn't really need it much anymore and it just became a chore to go to each day. \n\nIf I had to do it again, first I would directly identify what is making me stressed and see if it was something I could deal with. At the job I was at, the best I could do was just not let it bother me, to just reframe my mind. \nIf I could so something about the stressors, I would. Perhaps talk to a close coworker about it to see if they had any ideas. \n\nI definitely would work on not bringing it home. Perhaps go to the gym or go for a long-ish walk right after work. Something to decompress before heading home. Yes, you'd be tired, but it creates a barrier between the time you leave and the time you get home. It also sort of works like therapy or meditation, gives you time to think about it and just let it go. On the other times, tell yourself that whatever happens at work when you're not there is not your problem. It's someone else's place to fix it. If they try to call you, tell them they can bill you for the time it takes to troubleshoot because you are not at work and you are not paid/equipped to solve the problem when you're not at the office/workplace.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pao0tx/how_can_i_handle_my_stress_better_so_that_i_dont/ha7gy7v/"}
