So the brooding and sulking is probably actually your way of seeking affection. That is what you were taught by your mom.

Everyone needs to be loved on once in a while; you\u2019re just conditioned to ask for it in the wrong way.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pao0tx/how_can_i_handle_my_stress_better_so_that_i_dont/ha8axkj/"}
