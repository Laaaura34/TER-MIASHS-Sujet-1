Finally got back into healthier habits, and I\u2019m feeling so awesome! \n\nOne thing I noticed about myself was that I was not receiving the amount of calories I needed in a day, which made me feel exhausted. Think about the food you eat, stay hydrated, maybe even consider taking a daily vitamin supplement! \n\nNot sleeping well really gets to you, so to make sure I pass out when I want to, stay active throughout the day! Do 10min of exercise in the morning and build up from there, take breaks to go for a walk, etc. try not to take naps, but if you\u2019re really tired lay down for 15-20min. If you\u2019re in bed at night not sleeping, try getting up, walking, read a book, etc.\n\nConsistency is key, you\u2019ll probably still feel exhausted for a few more weeks when you first implement changes, but hopefully that will soon disappear! \n\nHope this helps, you got this dude!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ngki47/how_to_break_the_cycle/gyrhbr4/"}
