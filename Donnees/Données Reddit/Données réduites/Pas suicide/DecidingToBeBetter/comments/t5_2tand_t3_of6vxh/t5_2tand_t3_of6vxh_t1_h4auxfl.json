The thing about life is that not much is certain. Just enjoy the moments you have and always work on progress...\n\nNow, if your heart wasn't in the relationship, it's best that you let her go. Nothing worse than being with someone that doesn't truly love you but settled.\n\nI just hope you didn't leave her because you got attention from another woman. It's exciting when you meet someone new. But then, as time goes by, you need to deal with the fact that initial spark was just a spark. Everyday life isn't very exciting - chores, grocery shopping, that kind of thing. Looking for a new place should be exciting, but can cause anxiety too because of so many unknowns... Also, if you have too many options, your anxiety will increase because then you wonder if you are going to make the right decision.\n\nI guess my advice is - just do it. Do what you want to do, and sometimes, it's best to do it alone and not have to worry about another person. \n\nYou are still young and have so much to experience and learn. Don't stop learning!!\n\nGood luck, buddy!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of6vxh/at_22yearsold_i_feel_like_an_adult_with_no/h4auxfl/"}
