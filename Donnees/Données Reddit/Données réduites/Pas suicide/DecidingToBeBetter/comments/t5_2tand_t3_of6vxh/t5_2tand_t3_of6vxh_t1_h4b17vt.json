Not saying you need to take pills or something necessarily, but maybe talking to a therapist would help? \n\nAlso, even if you\u2019ve never had anxiety before, I think for a lot of people (such as myself) the pandemic has brought to the surface some deep seeded fears of dying/mortality. Which has caused us to question certain things about our lives/wonder what else is out there. (Sort of similar to the cliche of the 45 year old guy buying a sports car and banging the secretary once he hits the midlife crisis and is reminded that he won\u2019t live forever). \n\n\nBut whether or not this is the case with you, I agree that breaking up with your gf is the mature thing. It doesn\u2019t sound like y\u2019all are compatible; you both deserve someone who is on the exact same page about marriage/children bc it\u2019s not really something you can compromise about", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of6vxh/at_22yearsold_i_feel_like_an_adult_with_no/h4b17vt/"}
