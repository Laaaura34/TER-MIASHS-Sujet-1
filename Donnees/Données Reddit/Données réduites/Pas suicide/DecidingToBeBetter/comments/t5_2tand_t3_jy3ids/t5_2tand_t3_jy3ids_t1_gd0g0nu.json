Your forging a new way.\n\nYou want a comfort blanket because your minds full of imagination on who you could be, if just you risk falling one more time.\n\nSomebody hurt you in the past, bad. But thanks to your mental strength, you know that you can survive emotional impacts and not shatter completely.\n\n Your not bad luck, it was good luck. You cant control what somebody does, so if they were shitty as a person thats not your lack of luck, its their lack of decency.\n\nThese are just a few reframes of some of the things you said about yourself. You describe your negatives very vividly (at least from how i read it) it makes me wonder if your not becoming identified with negatives of your life to martyr yourself to your own cause or if your just a little self focused because your trying to get better. \n\nYour probably nowhere near as bad as you think.
