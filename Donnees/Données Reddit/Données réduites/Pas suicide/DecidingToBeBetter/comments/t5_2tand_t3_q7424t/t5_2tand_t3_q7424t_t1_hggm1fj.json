I have had a similar experience as you and stuck to light beers in the end which didn\u2019t affect me as much and stopped me from reaching that point of drunkenness. Your friends will likely try to get you to drink the shots if they are anything like mine were, but once I resisted once or twice they would just go on with the shots and leave me out of it.\nI would say that the evenings started to feel differently for me through this, the drinking/drunkenness made me feel part of the group, if I was more sober/in control then I felt less a part of the group and more aware of the emptiness of it.
