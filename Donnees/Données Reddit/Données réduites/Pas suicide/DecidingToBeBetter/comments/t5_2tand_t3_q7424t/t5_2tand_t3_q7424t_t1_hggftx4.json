Even if you add another drinking sesh each month but reduce the number of drinks you have by half, you would be drinking less overall and also in each individual session, less likely to go overboard. Not sure if that makes sense. Also, lower alcohol beers help if you want to drink at the same pace as other people but not get so wasted.\n\nEdit: also stay away from the shots. Sounds like that's the slippery slope that leads to more drinking. \n\nAlso, I am not qualified on this stuff, so don't take my advice too seriously. Maybe the therapist has good ideas.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q7424t/alcohol_and_embarrassment/hggftx4/"}
