But I fought my way up, and now I'm in college. I am meeting so many people who were born into semi-rich families. First I felt like you, it seemed so unfair. But once I started hanging out with these people I realized they weren't any happier than I was. They just had different problems. Because there is so much that money can't fix. Bad genes, abusive relatives, social awkwardness (which made them quite lonely), things like that. I know it sounds like cliche, but after witnessing these things I wasn't bitter anymore. I think they'll still have quite some advantages in life, but oh boy... that's alright, I wouldn't want to deal with some of their issues.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dvyxuf/how_do_i_stop_being_bitter_about_my/f7h81ja/"}
