I've admitted to myself that the abuse was NOT normal, and I've taken the responsibility of seeking counseling. But I'm also thankful that my material needs were met. \n\nYES. \n\nI grew up middle class with my basic needs met but it was a highly dysfunctional environment. I am over forty now and still trying to \"grow up\". And I have also talked to a counselor about this stuff. I believe that my mother, father, and step father were all lousy parents. And I say that now without anger and hate, it is just the way it was. Who knows, maybe they helped show me what NOT to do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dvyxuf/how_do_i_stop_being_bitter_about_my/f7hmdld/"}
