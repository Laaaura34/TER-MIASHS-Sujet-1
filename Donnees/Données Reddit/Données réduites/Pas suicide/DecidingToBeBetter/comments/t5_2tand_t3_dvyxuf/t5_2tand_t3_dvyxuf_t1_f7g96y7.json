I definitely feel you. I know in my life I have played the \u201cwhat if\u201d game too many times. What if my parents had a healthy relationship. What if I was born into more money so I didn\u2019t have to worry about how I am going to pay for gas or for textbooks. Honestly what helped me more than anything is to stop feeling sorry for myself. Accept the past as it is and focus on what you can do to change YOUR future. After a certain point of growing up you are able to live your own life with whatever tools your parents showed you. From your post it seemed like your moms work ethic is a perfect example. She did whatever it took to make sure you guys not only survived but thrived. Although it may not have been the most glamorous upbringing, you have to be grateful for what you do have.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dvyxuf/how_do_i_stop_being_bitter_about_my/f7g96y7/"}
