By focusing on this, acknowledging that you just aren\u2019t as intimately familiar with anyone\u2019s burden as you are with your own, you can more easily let go of the advantages you feel they have, because you know it\u2019s not the whole story.\n\nIt really sounds like you\u2019re doing this already though. Maybe I\u2019m late to the thread.\n\nAll the best in coping with these unwelcome and probably unintentional feelings. It\u2019s normal, if that helps, to resent anyone who seems to have an undeserved advantage.
