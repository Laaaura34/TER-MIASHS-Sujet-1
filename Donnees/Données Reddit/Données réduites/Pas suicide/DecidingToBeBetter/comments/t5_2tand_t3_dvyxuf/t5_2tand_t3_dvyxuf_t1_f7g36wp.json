Maybe they envy you for something that you had that you don\u2019t even realize. Everyone has their own story and experiences that shapes them, but they\u2019re not always apparent on the outside. \u201cDon\u2019t compare your insides to other people\u2019s outsides.\u201d \n\nIf you meditate or pray, maybe ask to be relieved of these feelings. Exhale and let these assumptions and feelings of animosity or jealousy toward others go. \n\nChannel your energy into political activism so that we can have a more fair system where there don\u2019t have to be such disparities between those who have privilege and those who do not. \n\nBest of luck to you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dvyxuf/how_do_i_stop_being_bitter_about_my/f7g36wp/"}
