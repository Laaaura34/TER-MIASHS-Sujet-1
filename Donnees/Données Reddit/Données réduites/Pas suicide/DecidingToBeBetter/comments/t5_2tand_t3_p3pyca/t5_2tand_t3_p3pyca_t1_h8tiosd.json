I have had my moments of giving up, feeling scared, victimizing myself, not feeling confident enough to be on my own, but it's basically just living through hell daily, so what's the point of that. Regardless of how we feel, we keep pushing through life and unexpected things happen often enough, sometimes good and sometimes bad, but the point is - something always happens. It's easier to make an assumption that since a few scary things have happened, that's what it's going to be, and it's best to be prepared, but in reality, we really don't know what will happen, and we make a better chance to create the life we want if we are open for opportunities - hoping for the best, keeping trying, taking a break where needed and going further. Being hopeful feels a million times better than desperate and given up, and even though it's not always easy, it's so worth it, cause it gives us more energy to go places we want to reach.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p3pyca/one_year_from_now_i_wont_have_most_problems_i/h8tiosd/"}
