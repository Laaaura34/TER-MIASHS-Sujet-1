The whole parenting thing is lots of new territory for me, and some things, like creating stability, I learned from my mum, but some other things, like unconditional love and a positive mindset - I learned it as an opposite from what my family did when I was growing up. In a way, it has been an anchor to eventually point in the right direction, so I guess there is that.\n\nI am happy that despite having had quite a tumultuos childhood, you can have such a wise and positive perspective towards life - I think that's the real strength. They say we create our own world, and I think it'a true in a sense that it's the emotions we go through that leave the greatest impact, and if you stay positive and hopeful, the emotions will be lighter too.\n\nI hope your and your mum's lives stay smooth, so you can enjoy them properly!\n\nAnd thanks a million for being kind :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p3pyca/one_year_from_now_i_wont_have_most_problems_i/h8tag2c/"}
