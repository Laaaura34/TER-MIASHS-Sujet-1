She let the drug completely take cover her life and has not discovered her willpower to do so. I basically grew up without out while she was going in and out of jail, I am 22 years old, mom 44, and she has never changed. She has never had a career , she\u2019s never had anything, cocaine is her life and she will do anything for it. Including, stealing from her family, using and abusing people, steal from stores, steal my brothers weed to trade it for cocaine, steal my Girl Scouts money for cocaine...etc. \n\nMy three siblings and I don\u2019t talk to her, my family doesn\u2019t even want their own kids to know her,and nobody really wants anything to do with her because everyone is sick of her shit. I have never had any type of relationship with my mom and it for sure has fucked me, my family, and my siblings up. \n\nYou\u2019re so strong for being able to say NO, I believe in you to keep that mentality. You don\u2019t want cocaine to steal your life away from you. \n\nCongrats and happy birthday!!!<3 stay strong \u2665\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mxjckz/quitting_cocaine/gvqyiws/"}
