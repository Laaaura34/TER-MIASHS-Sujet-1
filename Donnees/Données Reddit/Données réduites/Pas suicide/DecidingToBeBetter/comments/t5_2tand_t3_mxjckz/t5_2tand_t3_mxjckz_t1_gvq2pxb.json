You can do this!  As a former cocaine user,  I understand where you are coming from.  I was lucky and never truly felt \"addicted\" but was also very impulsive. I guess I was a functioning addict from about 19-21 and managed to keep it all together somehow. \n\nNow, as someone in my mid-30's and I have been clean for many years, I look back on that time and feel an immense amount of guilt.  I managed to get out okay but I've lost a lot of friends to addictions since then. I often think of all the ways my life could have ended up very differently.  \nStay the course, it's worth it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mxjckz/quitting_cocaine/gvq2pxb/"}
