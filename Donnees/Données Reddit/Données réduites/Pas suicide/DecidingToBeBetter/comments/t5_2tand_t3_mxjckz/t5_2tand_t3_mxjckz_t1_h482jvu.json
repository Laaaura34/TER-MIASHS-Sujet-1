I\u2019m so happy for you and hope you are doing well!! \nThis is my first time ever sharing this with anyone, so I\u2019m a little nervous lol and tbh I\u2019m Not proud to say this but I was a heavy cocaine user for about three years. The past 2 months I was doing almost .7-1g a day sometimes more! I\u2019ve told myself so many times that I needed to stop but always found  myself back in the same spot.. I had a pretty big heart to heart with myself  and realized it\u2019s gonna kill me if I don\u2019t stop. Now I\u2019m on day 6 of sobriety and it\u2019s been hard. The cravings are constant and it\u2019s been tough to fight against the urge, but I\u2019m buckling down this time around and not fuckkng around. Seeing this thread is giving me extra motivation to be a better me, so thanks for sharing your story.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mxjckz/quitting_cocaine/h482jvu/"}
