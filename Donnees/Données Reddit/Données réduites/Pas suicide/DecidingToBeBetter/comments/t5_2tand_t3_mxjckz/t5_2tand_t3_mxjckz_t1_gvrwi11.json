It seems like you have the right motivation and understanding to really kick this.\n\nOne thing I would recommend is you should explain to your friends clearly that you don't plan to take cocaine again, and they shouldn't offer it to you. Make it a serious chat. If they are real friends they will respect that, and it'll be much easier to avoid it if it's not being offered to you. If they don't respect that, then honestly you probably should find better people to hang out with.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mxjckz/quitting_cocaine/gvrwi11/"}
