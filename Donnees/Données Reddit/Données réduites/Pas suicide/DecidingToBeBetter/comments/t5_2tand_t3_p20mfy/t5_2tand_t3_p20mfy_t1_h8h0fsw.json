You have to find ways to improve on yourself before you tackle how to interact with others. You really need to combat all those issues. I have to be honest some of the points I didn\u2019t really understand, but overall, you have to be kinder to yourself and allow yourself to grow and learn from your mistakes. As hard as it is, don\u2019t focus on all the things you\u2019ve done wrong, accept them and try to move on and learn from them. That\u2019ll help you avoid making the same mistakes over and over again. Take a second to think before you act as well - you can\u2019t go wrong with that :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p20mfy/any_help_is_appreciated/h8h0fsw/"}
