Exercise every day even if it's just a 30 minute walk around the neighbourhood.\n2. Keep the kitchen clean, wash all dishes and set up the coffee for the next day.\n3. Change the sheets every Friday afternoon instead of randomly within a 2 week period. Sets me up for the weekend :-)\n4. Write at least 3 things in my journal before bed each night to cover one thing I've done for my mind, body and spirit that day. Ending the day thinking about something positive helps me go to sleep happy.\n5. My cats and I got into a strange routine of chilling in the garden for 30 minutes each evening after I've finished work and they've had dinner.

It's surprisingly peaceful :-)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pbc9x9/top_5_habits_that_havehad_kept_you_sane_healthy/hadc7yc/"}
