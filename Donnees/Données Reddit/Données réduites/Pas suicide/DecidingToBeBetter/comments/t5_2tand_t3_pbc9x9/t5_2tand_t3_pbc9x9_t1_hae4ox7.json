Incidentally, I'd never had surgery in my life and during covid I've gone through two surgeries, one very basic and one that I'm still recovering mobility from six months later. My best habits during the pandemic:\n\n1. Exercise, even when I was recovering I went for short walks and slowly increased intensity in my workouts\n2. Journaling. It's hard for me to get to doing stuff and planning ahead is hard, but I've found that just taking it one day at a time and planning just one day's schedule ahead makes all the difference for me.\n3. Cleaning. Being home all the time, I noticed that my mind feels more cluttered when my environment is, so I'm putting more effort into doing a little bit of cleaning all the time\n4. Being honest about my health at work. I've told my boss I've been plagued by thoughts of suicide on and off, so I've been able to spread out my hours and make sure I get to exercise at least three times a week to lessen the thoughts, while still being able to do a good job.\n5. Talking to the friends that really matter and checking in with them.
