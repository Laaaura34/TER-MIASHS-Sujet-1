There is a straight path from my room to the kitchen about 10 meters long. I have a sedentary job so adding some activity was essential.\nI've learned there is some experimental evidence that walking is not only good for physical health but for mind too, preventing depression and boosting creativity.\n\nThen, there's a habit of finishing all household routine tasks before bed to free morning hours for more productive tasks.\n\nNext, I always have some hobby as a subject to explore and a skill to master, like baking sourdoughs or hydroponic gardening. It should be something i would not just do out of boredom but really like and enjoy in order to get dopamine boost.\n\nThen, I always have a book to read, either on my current hobby or on self development.\n\nAnd finally, a habit that fits well with the first one --  analysing my day and redefining my goals each evening. We tend to default to status quo, to the path of least resistance, so its important to regularly remind ourselves what do we want to achieve and what kind of effort is required. I usually wander around the apt with the lights off, which creates a sense of solitude and helps to focus on my thoughts and self-reflection.\n\nEdit: mistypes and formatting.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pbc9x9/top_5_habits_that_havehad_kept_you_sane_healthy/hac89fy/"}
