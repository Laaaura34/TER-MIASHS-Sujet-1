I obsessively research what my plants and pets need, I prepare for emergencies, I learn about their potential diseases, I give them time to play and rest and the best possible diet, I give them stimulation and cleaning and check their mood multiple times a day. Her point was not to treat my body like an enemy but like a dear pet that needs to be washed and fed and exercised too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hx8dsh/phrase_self_care_as_a_gift_to_yourself_instead_of/fz7b4n5/"}
