It\u2019s hard to say what beliefs you have that need to be challenged and likely coming from a starting point you might not know what they are yet either. I advise lurking some of the friendlier feminist subs like r/trollxchromosomes and just listening to what women are saying when we bring up the misogyny we face in our daily lives. Try to be careful to avoid terf (anti trans feminist) spaces because they like to pipeline people and trading one extreme for another isn\u2019t good.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jowp1h/how_to_address_my_misogyny_and_sexism/gbdi2ll/"}
