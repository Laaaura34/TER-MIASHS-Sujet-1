It\u2019s been a nice escape from the harsh reality of the world. I took a 6 month break from social media because of depression. I came back once I felt like myself again. Now I\u2019m back hiding because of all the triggers that are happening every day.

Don\u2019t get me wrong I love the positive aspects but they do not outweigh the bad.
