So I planned out my day and then emailed my boss with a summary of what I planned to accomplish that day.  I requested that my boss let me know if he/she wanted to change priorities on any projects or even add new ones in.\n\nOn top of completing those tasks, I also filled in with \"busywork\" that I knew our system recorded timestamps on.  I left a clear trail so my boss could easily see that I was staying busy with my tasks.\n\nIt worked out well.  It gave my boss an option for feedback but also didn't require immediate action in case my boss was busy.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g1rkm7/what_would_a_secure_person_do/fniofi4/"}
