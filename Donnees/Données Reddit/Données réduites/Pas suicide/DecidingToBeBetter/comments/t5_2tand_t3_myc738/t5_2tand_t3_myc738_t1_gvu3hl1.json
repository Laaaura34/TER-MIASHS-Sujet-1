I don't religiously write every single day nor do I limit myself to write about the things I'm grateful for. I write about whatever is going on my mind and it's specially useful for the times when I feel pretty down and can't seem to think about anything positive about myself or life whatsoever. \n\nI think the journal you bought might be useful and I'm sure most people will find it really helpful, but in my personal experience I think it's better to try journaling with a notebook you like and write about anything, even if it's not especially encouraging. But anyway, I'm glad you decided to give journaling a try, I hope you enjoy it. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/myc738/anyone_have_success_with_journaling/gvu3hl1/"}
