You put zero expectations on her to stop and reply outside of nodding and smiling or saying thanks. I think you did a great job.  \n\nOne think that might help with these nerves and such is complimenting other people randomly. I try to give a completely random person a compliment once a week if the opportunity to do so genuinely arises. I'll tell another woman I like her shoes or her dress, her nails or her hair. If it's guys I tend to compliment shoes or shirts or something that stands out.   \n\nIt feels really good to be nice to other people. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cciqb2/today_i_did_something_that_felt_really_good_for/etp1x9y/"}
