I was a DJ and a night club promoter in a major metropolitan city. \n\nI gave that life up years ago for an IT job. The introducing thing is kinda new. I was always super outgoing, but this extra step was something I added a few years back.

I look like a suck up.\n\nIt's not a big deal, but something I have to learn deal with. I'm learning that some people will hate me for no reason, so I have to accept that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cciqb2/today_i_did_something_that_felt_really_good_for/etpk606/"}
