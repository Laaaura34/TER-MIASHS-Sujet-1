You have your whole life ahead of you! \n\nStart small! There\u2019s no timeline. Just start doing little things daily, so as not to get stressed or overwhelmed, rest when you need to. \n\nSomeone said make a list, and that\u2019s a great place to start. You can start with very small things, like going to be earlier, or cleaning your room, etc. There are also apps that help with goal setting.\n \nI would also suggest some sort of light exercise, even if you just walk on the treadmill once/week (again, start small). Focus on how you feel mentally after you get in a brisk walk or other exercise. \n\nNobody is perfect. Don\u2019t get mad at yourself for going backwards. You may start working toward a goal, like waking up earlier and going for a walk in the morning. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to do it every single day.  You may do it for a day or two, then not do it for a day or two. That\u2019s okay. Just get back up and try again.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o2z0vh/i21m_really_want_to_be_better_but_i_always_either/h2a7m4v/"}
