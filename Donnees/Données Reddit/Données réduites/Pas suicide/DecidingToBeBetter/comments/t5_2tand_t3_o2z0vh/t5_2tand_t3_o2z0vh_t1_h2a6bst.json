Listen to that voice that tells you you are full of potential, but first you have to make small changes. I love the first poster\u2019s advice. Though you are unable to afford therapy, you can perhaps afford a meditation app, or free version of one. Start with just the first 15 minutes of your day doing a mindfulness meditation, to help you center and focus. This will be a good first step to then make other small changes. You have so much time ahead of you. I\u2019m so proud of you for wanting this change. But make it gradual and give yourself credit each day for even the small changes. Each step will bring you closer to where you want to be. Give yourself this gift. It is so evident in your words that you are worth it.
