I'd also encourage you to try and journal your thoughts. No one has to ever see it, you can destroy it after if you want. But next time you get those urges, write down how you feel. Write down why you feel that way, and also write down the cost if you succumb. It'll hurt like hell, but then it'll be over.\n\nGood luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pmq84k/i_need_help_battling_my_porn_compulsion/hcno6sx/"}
