Interact with those lil' demons and be sure to tell the real little ones how much you love their costumes! Halloween is the SHIT for small kids and that excitement is wholesome goodness. \n\nOn a different note, it's important to recognize the no matter what, the world continues on. People will die, leave us, get sick, breakdown, cry, etc. Shit will continue to happen, no matter what, on every damn day of the year, at least for *someone*. We pick up and carry on b/c that's all we can do. Life is still beautiful and great regardless of some of the hard times. In fact, without hard times we wouldn't be able to appreciate the good ones. Halloween is still a day full of fun. Maybe one year it wasn't for you. That sucks for sure, but it has everything to do with your family and nothing to do with the holiday. I understand there's a connotation there but recognize that is just a coincidence and nothing more. Don't let that one day that happened 7 years ago ruin a lifetime of dope ass ghoul shit.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/plqmmc/my_parents_divorced_on_halloween_of_2014_this/hccn9a2/"}
