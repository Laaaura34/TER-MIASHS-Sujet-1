It sucks, and I\u2019m sorry.\nThis isn\u2019t really about Halloween, but when I\u2019m having a bad day or feel upset about something in general, I have a few tricks that make it easier and put me in enough of a better mood to make the problem feel smaller. On Halloween, here\u2019s what I think you should do:\n\n-make sure you get enough sleep the night before. Not enough sleep WILL make you feel even worse and you won\u2019t want to get anything done.\n\n-listen to some soothing music while you do your stuff during the day. I have a playlist that I literally named \u201ccalm down\u201d and I listen through it when I\u2019m stressed sometimes. I can send you the link to the playlist if you want!\n\n-eat some candy! Like other people here have said, Halloween is a totally separate event and you should try to think of it that way. Plus, even if you\u2019ve had the worst day ever you WILL feel at least a little bit better when you\u2019re chewing on KitKats:)\n\nHope this helps!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/plqmmc/my_parents_divorced_on_halloween_of_2014_this/hcetyxd/"}
