I tolerate fish.  I made up Fish Friday a while ago (partly in honor of my very Catholic grandparents) so that I would eat the healthy fish, but I am not particularly fond of it.  Recently we moved it to Monday so we could get fresh fish from the farmer's market on Sunday.\n\nAnyway, we didn't go to the farmer's market this weekend and today we went out to lunch with a friend at an Italian restaurant.  Two of the specials were fish, and not only did I choose a fish one but I chose a NEW fish (flounder) over one I knew I liked (salmon).  I ended up liking it!  I even liked it better than the salmon dish (my friend ordered it and we traded some).  Alas, I was not brave enough to try my husband's shellfish dish.  Still too stinky!  Maybe another time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1tkeub/what_is_holding_you_back/ce91xaz/"}
