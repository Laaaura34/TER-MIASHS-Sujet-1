Maybe it can help you a little bit:\n\n>There's a survival training technique that teaches that should find yourself in an awful situation \u2013 no water, eating ants, sick and waiting for rescue \u2013 you need to figure out a way to make tiny steps to improve your situation to avoid slipping into a helpless state of surrender. In the survival scenario, that might mean fashioning yourself a slightly better lean-to. In your situation, that might mean discovering a new shortcut in Excel that saves you 20 seconds. Or finding a slightly more efficient route to the bathroom. The idea being that if your situation is terrible enough, you're not going to make much headway trying to come up with a holistic solution. If you break up your big problem into ten thousand micro-problems, you can suddenly see a path to success. You need to escape learned helplessness by finding some way of reminding yourself that you are, in fact, master of your fate, that this is a temporary shit job.\n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1tkeub/what_is_holding_you_back/ce8z7ot/"}
