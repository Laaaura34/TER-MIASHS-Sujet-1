I know myself enough to know that #1 is the bane of my existence, and it works on EVERYTHING in my life.\n\nHere's how it works in VIDEO GAMES of all places: I'll research a game, research characters to \"pick a good character\", watch videos, play for a week or two, manage to have very basic performance, realize that I need to keep sucking and keep improving and get demotivated. Yes, that's in fighting games btw (Street Fighter, Tekken, that kind of stuff).\n\nThis is so prevalent that people are willing to avoid playing the game again altogether as soon as they reach a medium-to-good online rank, because losing might make them lose points which would reinforce the reality that they really didn't made it up there on their own and they can't hold their rank.\n\nAnd don't get me started on my other hobbies, one of them being a matter of life and death since it involves a steady income.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a1sa4m/here_are_the_worst_mistakes_that_are_stopping_you/eavua9z/"}
