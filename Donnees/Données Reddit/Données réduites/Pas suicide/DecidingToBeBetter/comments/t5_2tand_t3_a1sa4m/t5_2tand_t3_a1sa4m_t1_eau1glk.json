(Like a diploma? Did anyone even WATCH Wizard of Oz?) \n\nI don't know if any of us is truly capable of betterment, but that's not a bad thing! We can have different circumstances than we currently do, but that's just different.  Because \"better\" will always be a sliding scale. If you keep seeking some sort of \"arrival\" at betterment/improvement, what happens then? Now you're good? Why not just accept yourself here and now and that *better* doesn't exist. It's just an intangible, fleeting thing that will be just out of reach. *Better* is all relative to your conditions. \n\nSo here's my contribution\n\n**9. There's actually nothing to improve upon**\n\nYou are your SELF. Go explore and take on the world and collect experiences. Set goals and pursue what you find compelling. Take all you can from your world, but know that and be compassionate and caring and for the love of god just be genuinely kind to others. There's nothing that will make you any better because you're already the best so get out there and act like it. You cannot fail.
