I took a week of \"intuitive productivity\" - that is, doing what I want, when I want it and for how long I want it. I learned that I enjoy doing lots of things in short sprints, and once I've allowed myself to do that, I started trusting myself more and became more confident. I also meditate daily and I taught myself the technique of imagining that I am the clearblue sky, and my thoughts and feelings are the clouds passing me by. I am aware of them, but they are not me. I apply this technique whenever a negative feeling starts overtaking me, so it has no control over me anymorr. I can be content in any situation now, I am really proud of myself for that. You can do that too!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oyii6v/i_want_to_be_comfortable_by_myself/h7tx9wz/"}
