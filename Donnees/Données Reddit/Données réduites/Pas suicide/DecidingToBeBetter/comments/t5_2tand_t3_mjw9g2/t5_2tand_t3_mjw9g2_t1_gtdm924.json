But it might also be a way to express how thankful he is for her . We just dunnow. Supposedly this is the first time he shared the severity of his emotions, and so before he tried to do it alone, so I think it is a bit fast to call it codependency. Even more because he stated a lot of other people than his gf in the end. We just can\u2019t say and it isn\u2019t our task, but i do think sharing emotions with your loved ones is a pretty decent advice anyway!\n\nMy boyfriend is a therapist, and I have several mental illnesses so we have to set up pretty sharp boundaries to avoid him acting like my therapist or something like that. I never expect him to fix me, but the fact that I can talk about just anything and that he will stay calm and just listen to me is extremely valueble. It\u2019s not treating someone like a therapist treats his clients (as he does on his job) it is just the listening and understanding which is comforting.... our relationship has been pretty solid for years. Im seeing a therapist as well , but thats a whole other thing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mjw9g2/i_beg_you_please_read_this_if_you_feel_like/gtdm924/"}
