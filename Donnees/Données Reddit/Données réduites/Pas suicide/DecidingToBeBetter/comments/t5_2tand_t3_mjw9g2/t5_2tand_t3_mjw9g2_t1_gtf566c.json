That factor really tilts the story from this \u201cbeautiful, vulnerable experience of finally seeking help\u201d that you\u2019re trying to illustrate, to an unhealthy, toxic way of getting someone roped back in to something they just tried to leave, whether consciously or subconsciously. Now I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the case, because only you know your life and relationship, I\u2019m just letting you know how it\u2019s perceived from an outside perspective. \n\nI guess my goal in writing this is to hopefully urge you to consider sitting down with her, while your head is clear, and making sure that she really is ready and willing to help you in the way that you need. Because as someone who\u2019s been in her shoes before, it\u2019s very hard to say no when someone you care about calls you like that, no matter how desperately you want to leave. But t I can assure you, even if she said yes and came back, unless her heart is in it, it won\u2019t end well.\n\nI hope for nothing but the best for you and your girlfriend, and I apologize if my perception of the situation is inaccurate, but I hope you know nothing I said was written to be judgemental/attacking in any way, shape or form.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mjw9g2/i_beg_you_please_read_this_if_you_feel_like/gtf566c/"}
