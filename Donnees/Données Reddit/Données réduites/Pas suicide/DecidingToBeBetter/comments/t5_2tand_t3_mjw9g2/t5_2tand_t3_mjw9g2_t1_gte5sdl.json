I feel a lot like you explained that you do. Thank you for being an inspiration. I'm cheering on you! I hope that you asking for help will strengthen you and your bond. Wishing you the best\n\nI'm going to point out that the people who comment that it's toxic should try to reread the post. I think it's a bit of a difficult line about asking for help and to ask and accept help. I agree to the last thing you said. It's not toxic to ask for help. I guess it's more toxic to ask and not accept help. Or toxic to demand help. When you ask and really open up, people are allowed to say no. I've kind of wavered between the two a lot, and actually being open for help is what the key to support and happiness is.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mjw9g2/i_beg_you_please_read_this_if_you_feel_like/gte5sdl/"}
