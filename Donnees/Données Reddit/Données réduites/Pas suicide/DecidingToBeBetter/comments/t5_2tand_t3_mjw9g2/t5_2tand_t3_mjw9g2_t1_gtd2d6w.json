I don't think I'm really ready to let other people help and i don't know if i ever will be, but I needed this post anyways. I read books because i feel like it is other people helping me without having to deal with the social aspects. The only thing i will say is that i wouldn't feel comfortable telling others i can't handle my own mental health because it puts a lot of pressure on that person and I don't want that kind of codependent relationship. Ultimately, the way I see it is we're the only ones that can actually help ourselves. Others just help us help ourselves.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mjw9g2/i_beg_you_please_read_this_if_you_feel_like/gtd2d6w/"}
