Yesterday I was at a party of a friend, just close friends, and it wasn't terrible, but it did remember me how is it to feel like thinking of ending my life is quite conforting. I have some mental health issue or disability (might be autism or at least is similar), my thought and emotions might get to different from normal people sometimes and it's too noticible, it makes me tired to hide it and it makes me sad to feel like once more people looked at me and realised I'm not worthy. I was just trying really to be there and not make people unconfortable, but I just reached a point after two hours in which I didn't want to talk to anyone anymore; this friend should know this, however she kept pushing me to stay or not fall a sleep... like she was, like she thought she was helping. I'm sorry, this is just meaningless words, there isn't anything you can say that can make my problems go away I'll cope with them. Just wanted to say I liked reading your post ahahah.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mjw9g2/i_beg_you_please_read_this_if_you_feel_like/gtclyjx/"}
