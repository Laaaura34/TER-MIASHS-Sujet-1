Just remember that there always needs to be a balance. Partners should be aware of when you are struggling but they do not need to know every dark thought and they should not be excepted to fix the other person. I have a partner for strength, a therapist to learn coping skills and identify areas of improvement, a psychiatrist for medication, and a support group to share experiences with. I hope you decide utilize the resources around you to see which are the best fit. It takes a whole group of support to overcome severe depression. I wish you the best and you are taking an amazing step by accepting that you can\u2019t do this on your own.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mjw9g2/i_beg_you_please_read_this_if_you_feel_like/gtdm05b/"}
