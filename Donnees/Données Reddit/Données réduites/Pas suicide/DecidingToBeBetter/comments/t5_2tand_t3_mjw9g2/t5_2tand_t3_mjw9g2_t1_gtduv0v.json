They have their own problems to deal with.\" thinking and admitting helplessness. I always try to wear a mask of \"There is no problem\", but it slips away and my bad mood is being exposed.  \nI don't like to talk about it, cause I feel a little ashamed of that. but I had that bad time last week. Days of uncertainty, guilt and slight self-hatred. No suicidal thoughts, but I really felt like I'm the only one responsible for all the evil and letting down others (which is not true).  \n\n\nIt was hard. Maybe I should just talk. Talk. As you said. And not forget, that vent, ask for help shouldn't be a reason for feeling shame.  \n\n\nSorry for bothering, just telling my point of view. Thanks for that. And I wish you better times and I hope, that those dark clouds won't come back, but if they do, you'll have enough strength to make them disappear.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mjw9g2/i_beg_you_please_read_this_if_you_feel_like/gtduv0v/"}
