I'm happy to say I'm now over 5 years clean/ sober. I know you mentioned that cannabis is your problem, for me it was heroin and crack, however I choose to see all mind altering substances as the same as they all take us to the same dark place. \n\nFor a long time I tried different ways to get clean, I could maybe get a week or two then I'd end up using, I steadily became more and more unproductive until I was unemployable, lost my vehicle, home, etc etc and eventually ended up in a residential rehab..\n\nAnyway, in terms of recovery when I compare the early days of trying to do it my way, day counting and white knuckling it, life wasn't much fun, it was hard as I'd be doing back flips in my head trying to grin and bear through the days.\n\nLater on, in the rehab I was introduced to the 12 step approach to recovery. I have to say, honestly, it's so much easier, my life is wicked now, I've got so many great things in my life but more importantly Im happy in my own skin, I don't need to use to get through the day.\n\nRussel Brand has done a lot on 12 step recovery, and Cocaine Anonymous has a great approach to the steps ( it's not drug specific btw)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l6glpy/i_want_to_quit_smoking_weed/gp1srse/"}
