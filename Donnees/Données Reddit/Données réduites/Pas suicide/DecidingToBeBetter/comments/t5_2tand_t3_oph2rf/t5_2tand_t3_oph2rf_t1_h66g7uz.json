I have bene porn free for a year and has changed my life. Check out   r/pornfree. Also read up on supernormal stimuli, as porn is a form of this. Also meditating and exercise help a lot. And I also suggest quitting social media as well, as instagram was a trigger for me. Lastly, I suggest reading up on not taking your thoughts seriously, and reading books by Eckhart Tolle. Im back to having sex and it is so much better. Good luck, I KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oph2rf/i_will_try_to_quit_porn_for_good_for_the_first/h66g7uz/"}
