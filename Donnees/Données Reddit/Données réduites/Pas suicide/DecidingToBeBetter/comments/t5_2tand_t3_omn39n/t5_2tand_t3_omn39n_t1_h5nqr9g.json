Mediation with a pre determined thought goal, such as today I\u2019m going to sit for 30 minutes and think only on a singular aspect. Or free flow meditation where you let your mind wonder for no specific amount of time. Both are great options and it should be noted that meditation is most effective when you dedicate real thought and time to it. Not just \u201coh I\u2019m in my car for 20 min and I want to think deeply while I drive\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s also super beneficial to incorporate meditation in your routine and practice it repeatedly and often times coming back to thoughts that you have pondered before. \n\nI\u2019m a huge fan of the mindful app and the meditation guides they provide. I highly enjoy running, yoga, or other forms of simple activities that can be done solo while meditating on my thoughts. \n\nA great thought to meditate on for anxiety specifically is to think about the relationship between anxiety and being excited.
