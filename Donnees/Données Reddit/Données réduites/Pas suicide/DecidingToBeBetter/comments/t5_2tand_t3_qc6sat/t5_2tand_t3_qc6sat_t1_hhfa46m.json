I realised for me, also late 20's smoked since 18 and managed to quit for a year, is change of environment, and the first day after is the hardest. I find by day 2 not smoking I kind of forget what it feels like and that really helps. Change of scenery is great, maybe even go camping for a weekend, or rent out an airbnb, or go do a sport getaway weekend or something. some type of 2day getaway where you dont take bud, and then when you get back just keep it up. I also downloaded an app called grounded that helped, helped to have a timer and feel more accountable. It is easy to stop, and probably the easiest of all drugs to give up, so we are both lucky in that regard.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qc6sat/how_can_i_finally_put_an_end_to_smoking_weed/hhfa46m/"}
