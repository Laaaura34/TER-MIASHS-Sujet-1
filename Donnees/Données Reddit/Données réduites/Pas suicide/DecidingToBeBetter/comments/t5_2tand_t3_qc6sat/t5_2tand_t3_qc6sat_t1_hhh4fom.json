Try and try to evaluate it as if you were advising a friend instead of yourself.  There are plenty of online tests offered by heathcare organisations.\n\nBut for what it's worth, here's the test I was given.\n\nBuy your usual bag of weed, roll up a nice fat one, and do everything you normally do to maximise your enjoyment of it - listen to music, go walk in the woods, browse porn - whatever you like to do stoned.  Really make the most of it.\n\nPut the rest of the weed in a box or bag, and put a bit of tape over to seal it.\n\nWrite a date on the box that is 3 days from now.  So if today is Monday, write Thursday's date.  Then write :\n\"If I break into this before (the date), that means I need to think of myself as an addict, and need to stop using it.  If I don't, then I know I can control it\".  Then put it in your usual stash place.\n\nWhen I did this, I lasted until later that evening before I had rationalised the whole thing as a pointless exercise & broken into my stash.  This is what first alerted me to the fact that I had an addiction problem.  It took a while longer to accept it, and maybe a couple of years to actually fix it properly", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qc6sat/how_can_i_finally_put_an_end_to_smoking_weed/hhh4fom/"}
