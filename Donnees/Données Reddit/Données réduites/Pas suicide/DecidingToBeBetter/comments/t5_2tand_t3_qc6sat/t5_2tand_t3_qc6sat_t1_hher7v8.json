I really do recommend looking at that subreddit, especially the top posts of all time, it really changes your perspective on how it affects you. A lot of people do feel better after quitting and become more successful.\n\nFor me, it helped to change my opinion of smoking. I felt like it was messing with my memory, and enjoyment of things, I also felt constantly paranoid and the negatives outweighed the positives. I reminded myself of that and just used the logic that instead of 'giving up' or 'quitting', I was taking a small step to improve my life and hopefully become the best version of myself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qc6sat/how_can_i_finally_put_an_end_to_smoking_weed/hher7v8/"}
