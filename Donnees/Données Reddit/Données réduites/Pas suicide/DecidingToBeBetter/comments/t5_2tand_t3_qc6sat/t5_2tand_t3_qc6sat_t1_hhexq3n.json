As soon as I had to stop my normal routine and quit smoking weed, a world of stuff started to open up. Normally I\u2019d rip bong around 11 am and basically pretend like I was doing something productive, but now that I don\u2019t get to rip bong and actually have to find stuff to do, I find myself realizing how much I DIDNT need weed to do stuff. I feel like I\u2019m retaining information better, my heart doesn\u2019t race as much, I don\u2019t feel so dazed and forgetful. I\u2019m hoping this gives you some insight just cause I\u2019ve smoked very heavily (about an eighth everyday too) for 6 years and thought I NEEDED it to relax/destress/be interested in things, but it\u2019s so important to remember that your sober brain needs catering to and that weed can distract us from that sometimes; it\u2019s also good to connect with your sober self and realize that you are capable of many things and that your clear mind is strong and a wonderful asset. I would try working out/reading/studying something new/learn something new like woodworking or cooking or some shit hahahaha it\u2019s good to replace a smoke break with something different. At the same time, if it\u2019s not impacting you a TON maybe just try saving it for special occasions or restrict yourself to only smoke during a certain time like after you\u2019ve finished a project or something like that. Hope this helps in some way, good luck friend!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qc6sat/how_can_i_finally_put_an_end_to_smoking_weed/hhexq3n/"}
