At some point they do ask why you are seeking therapy; If you can\u2019t pinpoint exactly why you\u2019re seeking therapy that\u2019s okay, they\u2019ll work with you to figure out why you feel a certain way. From there they all take different approaches to help you approach your issues. \n\nTalking to my friends who are/were in therapy, it seems like everybody has a different preference on how they want their issues to be approached; you can always find another therapist that makes you more comfortable, cause at the end of the day you want to find a therapist who you\u2019re willing to work with week after week.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mwllvz/ive_been_in_therapy_for_two_months_now_and_my/gvldsfu/"}
