Not even if you were 60. The danger isn't in time passing, it's in giving up on yourself.  Get some therapy to help with confidence and with goal planning, and start taking steps toward pursuing the things you want. :)  \n\nAnd don't forget nobody on social media has their life as together as they make it look. These feelings are actually not uncommon for your age, especially with all the societal pressure of the idea that we should know what we want for our whole life, so early in life. Which really isn't fair anyway, nor even that applicable to working in today's economy. \n\nTake a breath. You are doing just fine. There is no \"too late\". There are only opportunities waiting for you to feel ready to go after them.\n\nETA pro tip: Instead of beating up your past self, recognize that you didn't know what you know until you knew it, and you can't judge yourself with what you know now on how you acted before you knew it; you could only do the best you could with what you knew at the time.
