I'm 28 and sometimes I spiral into questioning what I've actually achieved, but I'm really trying to shake off that \"you need to have your whole life sorted by the time you're 30\" feeling that's pushed on us. Focus on being happy first, then remember whatever you want to do, it's never too late to do it. Some great actors only started acting in their 60 or 70s. Time is gonna pass anyway, so whatever you want to start today, do it! It doesn't matter what age you'll be when you finish/achieve it. You'll come to be that age anyway, so you might as well do the thing!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hguak5c/"}
