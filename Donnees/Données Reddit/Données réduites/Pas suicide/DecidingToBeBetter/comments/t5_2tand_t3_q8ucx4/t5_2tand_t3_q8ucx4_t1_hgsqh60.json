But mainly I would guess you should be preparing for your Saturn Return. A moment to re invent and be reborn. \n\nThere is a process of your old self dying, and a new person being born that happens during that transition I think. \n\nTrust me I went through it......You come out of 27 to 30, a different person than you've been. \n\n0-27 are like your first life. Probably 30-60 are your second life, and then I dunno what.\n\nBut man its never too late. Life is always giving that opportunity to try new things and keep doing shit. \n\nTurning an older age doesn't make you feel any stuck than it has too. I think its just the nature of what habits people get into at those ages, that can make them seem unchanging. But if your in a state similar to your younger self, than you will still be craving change and new things live you always have. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe point is.....nothing is over. The new stuff is coming. You'll see, there is more and more life coming around the corner. You just gotta live it. Hang on, the ride is gonna keep going.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hgsqh60/"}
