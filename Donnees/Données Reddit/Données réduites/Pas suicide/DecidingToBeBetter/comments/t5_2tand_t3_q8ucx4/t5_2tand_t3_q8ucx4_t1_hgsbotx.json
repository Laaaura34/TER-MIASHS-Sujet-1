Still not where I want to be. I make ok, can save every month, but I have no schooling and do a manual labor type job. Not overly strenuous tho. But I still feel like if I quit my job, I wouldn't have a better option. Right now I wish I was 25. I never had life figured out at that point either. And some circumstances in life kept me there. But I'm making progress now at least, and wondering what I can accomplish in the future. Keep going man, you have what it takes, it's not ever too late to pursue your dream!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hgsbotx/"}
