Turns out I hate making stuff for business assholes, so when I was 22 I thought I\u2019d take some time off to discover what I really want in life.\n\nI\u2019m now 36 and am about to get my associates in Mathematics and go on to a university to get a degree in Stats. As a bonus, I have enough art credits to get a free minor in art in design. \n\nYou\u2019re not too ok\u2019d at all my dude. Take a class or two at your community college in those fields to see if you like it. If so, great! Go for it! Plus, at only 25, you could go all the way for a doctorate and still be young enough to get some use out of it. If you discover you don\u2019t like it, then give it some more time to figure it out. Take another decade if you need to. It\u2019s ok. You\u2019re ok. It\u2019s going to be ok.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hgve0su/"}
