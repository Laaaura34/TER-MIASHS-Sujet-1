I know that 25 feels like a long time and that you have to have stuff figured out because so many other people seem to have it figured out. Here's the thing. Even many who genuinely think they do are going to discover they didn't. The number of people who are dead certain what their life path will be and, at 50, find that turned out to be true is VANISHINGLY small.  \n\n\nI'm 46 (and posting this from a Reddit account that's like 16 yrs old), and stoked to be starting a path to replacing my 20+ yr software career with a plan to do a bunch of things like finally get back to the writing of sci fi that I enjoyed when I was younger, but abandoned to make money. And building up a wood/leather workshop making stuff. And launching a YouTube channel about the work I do in that workshop. And, and, and, and.\n\nEven that software career was actually me turning an English degree in 1998 into trying technical writing, hating it, pivoting to being a web developer and finding that I enjoyed it and I now coach software teams on how to write better code and work better together.\n\nThe point is that I'm starting more things at 46 than I was starting at 26 and the stuff I was starting at 26 didn't turn out how I expected. Just do what you can, look for opportunities and strive to be better every day and you may delightfully surprise yourself with where you end up.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hgsds2b/"}
