I'm turning 24 in a month. Since I found out about computers I wanted to know more about them. The problem was (and still is) that I'm too dumb in math and physics. I started getting into programming last year. Got myself some crash courses about languages and started to learn more about Linux and it's purpose. I also have a pointless degree in culinary & tourism. I was always anxious and extremely shy when around other people & It only lead downhill once I got older. Imagine a guy who's got low self-esteem & fears people to be a waiter, cook or tourist guide. Sure, I taught myself english & german since I was 3 years old, but it's basically nothing I can show for.\n\nI currently work as a mechanic installer. I'm 90% of the time away from home traveling around Europe (or outside of it). I work 11 hours from Monday to Friday. Does it sound insane? Yes it does. But the job pays well, at weekends I have free time for learning & my coworkers are literally my friends since I don't have any back home.\n\nI'm also a lost cause, but hey, If I won't try I might never know what will happen. That's what keeps me going. Even if I make it into the field at 27 or 28, I'll be proud of what I achieved.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hgsfdlq/"}
