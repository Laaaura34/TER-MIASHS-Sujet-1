I\u2019m pushing 25, this December actually. I have absolutely no idea what I\u2019m doing or where I\u2019m going and I don\u2019t even have the first stepping stone of a career laid out. What I thought I wanted to do isn\u2019t what I want anymore and I feel like I lost my chance to do anything else. My future feels behind me. \n\nBut then again, I remember that I\u2019m going to be 25 anyway. And then 26, 27, 28, etc. That\u2019s inevitable. So I might as well be 25 and starting a new path for myself. Might as well be 26 and taking new classes. Might as well be 27 and on my way to something. It\u2019s better than nothing, I guess. \n\nIt can feel overwhelming at times, especially in this age of social media where we can see what everyone else is doing better than us. But it\u2019s your life, your path, and you\u2019ll figure it out no matter when! 25 really is young, and by this point we\u2019ve actually been children longer than we\u2019ve been adults so I think at some level we\u2019re all still trying to figure out shit out. \n\nSorry if that was a ramble, but I do wish you the best, OP!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hgths3h/"}
