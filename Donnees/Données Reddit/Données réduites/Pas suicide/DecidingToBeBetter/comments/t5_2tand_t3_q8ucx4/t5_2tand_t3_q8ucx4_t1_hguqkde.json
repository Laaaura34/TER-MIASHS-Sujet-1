Some people get tied down by a demanding life like supporting their families or other obligations, but if you can make it happen then make it happen. Never feel like it's too late. Just because other people have a degree and job they hate at 23 doesn't mean everyone falls into that same stereotyped \"made it\" category. Most of those people now hate their life because they didn't know what they would really like to do with themselves before investing so much time and energy into a degree for a field they are now stuck in. If you like science go for it. It is a hard major but figure it out. You can be a chemist a lot of different places if you're good in chemistry. But if that is what you have wanted to do then do it and don't fret. Would you rather be working right now hating everyday or graduate in 4 years into something you love. Life is moving forward with or with out your approval or anyone elses. Make a decision and jump on the path. Live life the way you would like and with out wondering whether it's too late. It will always be too late if you think it is, it will also be the perfect time if you think it is. So, what do you think?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hguqkde/"}
