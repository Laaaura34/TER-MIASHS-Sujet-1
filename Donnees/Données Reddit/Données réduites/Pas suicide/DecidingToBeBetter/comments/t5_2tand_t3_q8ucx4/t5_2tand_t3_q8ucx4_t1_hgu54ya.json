If you're not fully successful at 20 you should be gased. There was a time to choose you career and life when you were six. When you're 15, you should be an expert in relationships. Being 18 without serious achievements in competitions is a disgrace to humanity. 26 years old farts don't learn and develop at all. That's why they never ever achieve anything after that age limit. 27 is when dementia hits. 30 is when you're way too ugly to show publicly. How could you be so irresponsible when you were 5? You should be way smarter than you stupid parents and the rest of your environment.
