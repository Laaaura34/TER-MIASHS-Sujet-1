I\u2019ve just started a post-baccalaureate health program, which consists of all of the pre-requisite classes for healthcare careers. I\u2019m leaning towards physician, but am also considering nursing/Nurse Practitioner, and Physician\u2019s assistant. Physician route will take a total of 10+ years depending on specialization. I\u2019m also still working full-time in the career that I\u2019m transitioning out of, so I\u2019m unable to take a full load of classes which means it may take even longer than 10 years. I have many more responsibilities in my 30\u2019s than my 20\u2019s, so I have to work at least part-time if I want to avoid crippling student loans. Anyway, I\u2019m just taking it one day at a time and when I\u2019m overwhelmed and frustrated that it\u2019s going to take too long, I\u2019m reminding myself to be grateful to have a job right now, I\u2019m healthy, and that I have the opportunity to make this career change. I\u2019m also thankful for the organization I volunteer with that provides free medical care at concerts; so I\u2019m gaining healthcare experience and am able to watch some or most of a concert depending on how busy we are.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hgsn7fh/"}
