I have a degree in sociology and a minor in criminal  justice and I just moved back with my parents and working for Daddy Bezos. The only thing I learned the whole time at college was that it was a waste of four years (my option). I could have spent my time better exploring other options and trying new things, but no I had to focused on my studies.

I have always self doubted myself, i think it started in high school and go worse in college (prob bc of the terrible romantic relationships i always found myself in). Right now my mind is focused on trying to make money and enjoy the little things in my life to help smile just a little bit.
