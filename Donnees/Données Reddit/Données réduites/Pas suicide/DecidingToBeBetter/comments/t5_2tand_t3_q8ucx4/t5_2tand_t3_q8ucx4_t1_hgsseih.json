I went back to school at 25 to get a diploma in engineering technology and was super worried that I was going to be the old bum that had wasted his years. I'd say the majority of the people in my program were 21-27, several people were in their 30s, and even one student was well into his 40s (maybe even early 50s? I didn't ask.) This seemed to be pretty common for the other STEM programs at the school too.\n\n I'm 31 now and although on paper things have looked great over the past couple years, I didn't feel like my career trajectory was going in the direction I wanted so I am now trying to join a new field and build other skillsets. Over the next few years, I might even continue education to get my degree or maybe go back to school for something completely different that I am passionate about.\n\nI guess what i'm trying to get at is, don't sweat your age and don't be so hard on yourself. People go back to school or make big life changes at all different times in life, and for all kinds of different reasons. As the years go by and we gather other life experiences, our perspective might change and so might our plans. You're living this first hand right now, and growing pains can sometimes be a motherfucker. That said, having a plan and taking action is exactly how we achieve our goals in life, which it sounds like you are already doing.  \n\nChin up big dawg, you got this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hgsseih/"}
