And yet I felt very little satisfaction in life. The feeling hasn\u2019t abated much, if anything it\u2019s worse. I think the reality is that age is but a number, and accomplishments don\u2019t mean a whole lot if you can\u2019t find the value in you. \nMy best advice is it\u2019s not too late to learn to love yourself. And the longer you wait to choose this path, the harder it is to create that change. \nPS- very very few 25 year olds *actually* have anything figured out, they\u2019re faking it.
