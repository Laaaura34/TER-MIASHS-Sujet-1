I feel so behind, so lost, so worried that it will take me forever and ever to catch up and achieve my goals (also in science and research, academia, writing, and especially women's health). This post caught my eye because I also worried that 25 is too late to begin again. \n\nBut my husband changed my mind. He completed an undergrad degree in finance, worked at a bank robotically, joined the army, and only realized his passion for computer science at the whopping age of 27 (whopping relative to us). Now he's 29, doing what he loves everyday, learning new things and taking his time exploring his career and developing himself. \n\nI'm here with you friend, we can get there with a positive mindset and taking life one step at a time. The key I guess is to be in the present, give it your 100% and make small efforts everyday to get to your goal.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hgtmn5r/"}
