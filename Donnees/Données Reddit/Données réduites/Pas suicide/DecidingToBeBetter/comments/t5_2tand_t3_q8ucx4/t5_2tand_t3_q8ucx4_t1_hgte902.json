It's funny how when I was your age it felt like I was SO BEHIND and like I was coming in so late to the game, but now that I am 31 (32, in like a week actually!), I feel young and like I am very much beginning. I feel like I am in flow and exactly where I ought to be, if anything ahead of a lot of my peers. I think its just a part of being in your 20s, you are a young adult and you feel like you are supposed to have all your shit together. \n\nThen, as you get close to (or hit) your 30s, you start to see that *nobody has their shit together*. Like, **nobody**. If it's not their career their struggling with, it's relationships, or money, or hygiene, or organization, or addiction issues, or serious mental health issues, or a lot of mild mental health issues, or family problems, or physical health issues, or a combination of those things. Or other things I couldn't think of. And it starts to feel okay, because we see that we are all juggling a billion things and we just *never have a clear picture of other people's lives*, so there isn't really anything to compare ourselves to anymore. \n\nThere is no such thing as too late, because we don't get to schedule life, or when we learn lessons or have epiphanies. The best thing you can do is plan from where you are, not where you wish you were. \n\nI'll end with my favourite quote on the topic (it's attribution is all over the place, it's generally considered traditional wisdom):\n\n\"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the second best time is now.\"", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hgte902/"}
