Lots of people don\u2019t know what they truly want to do until like 35. I\u2019m 30 and I just started pre-med because after x life experience I figured out I want to change the psychiatric industry and help patients avoid what I had to go through as a teenager on. Before that, I wanted a career that was \u201ccool\u201d to me and that I \u201cthought\u201d I wanted but it did not come from the heart. I worked in finance and I was miserable. Ask yourself why you want to work in science, is it because you idealize it or is it that you truly would find fulfillment in a specified field, from your heart? You will be MISERABLE again otherwise. Hell, I did not think I had the confidence to go to med school. Looking back, I was foolish for thinking that way. All I had to do is get up and start enrolling in and going to school, the rest would take care of itself. Once I turned 30 I thought life is too short not to do what I love and screw it! You really need to stop being so hard on yourself and putting yourself down, that\u2019s not doing you any justice or helping your situation. Put your adult pants on and realize you have the whole world at your fingers, you can do literally whatever you want just put your mind to it. You live in America.
