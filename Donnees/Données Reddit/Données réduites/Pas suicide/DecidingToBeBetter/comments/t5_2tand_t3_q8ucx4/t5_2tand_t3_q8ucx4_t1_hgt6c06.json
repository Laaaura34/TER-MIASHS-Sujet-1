I\u2019m a junior majoring in biology and minoring in chemistry. I have a 3.8 but right now I\u2019ve taken a break. I want to be a doctor but I\u2019m scared I\u2019m too stupid bc I\u2019ve always been a terrible test taker. Not to mention I haven\u2019t been on campus since my freshman year due to covid so the quality of the education I\u2019ve received is not up to par, in my opinion, for someone who\u2019s going into a medical profession. I haven\u2019t even applied to start back in the spring bc I\u2019m terrified to go back and become a huge disappointment to myself and my parents. Especially since we\u2019re already in so much debt from my schooling already. I feel like I\u2019ve become a lazy degenerate bc I just work part time, help my family, and smoke A TON of pot. I\u2019ve also been mad depressed, which I\u2019m on medication for, and I feel like I\u2019m stuck and I\u2019ve permanently fucked my life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hgt6c06/"}
