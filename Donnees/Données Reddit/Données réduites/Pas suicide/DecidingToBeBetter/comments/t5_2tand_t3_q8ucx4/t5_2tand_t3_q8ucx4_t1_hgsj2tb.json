The list of things that I did not do in my 20\u2019s is long\u2026.but I didn\u2019t realize it until I hit my 50\u2019s. \nBetween 20-30+ it\u2019s ok to be figuring out what you want to do. That\u2019s what you should be doing in your 20\u2019s! Try different things, internships etc. Will your current job pay for schooling to get you were you want to be?  If so, that\u2019s a good trade off. If you can travel DO IT! I had a great job at your age. Not my dream job but a safe job. I did zero traveling and in late 20\u2019s got married, had kids & worked ft. Only one kid left in college now but my husband is probably losing his job by end of year and is 11 years older than me. So that will wipe out travel $$.  \nYou don\u2019t need to have your life laid out for you at 25. But on your deathbed can you look back and say you worked in a lab that cured XZY or helped someone live a better life?  \nThat would be a life well lived! \u2665\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hgsj2tb/"}
