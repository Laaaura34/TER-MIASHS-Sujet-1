Though it kinda also depends on what you want. It's never too late to learn and grow as a human being. If you want to retire at 30, maybe it's too late. \n  \nNext, you're being way too hard on yourself but that's ok because we all did that in our 20s too. Just know that it's normal. None of us had it figured out at your age, trust me. Ok, maybe one in a million do,, but that's super rare. Most of us felt just like you.  \n\nThis next point is most important. In my 30s and 40s, what I considered to be achievements changed dramatically. In my 20s I felt just like you. I mean, exactly like you. I hope that, like me, when you are in your 40s you can look back at your 20s self, shake your head, smile and laugh at how young and silly you were. Don't let this society and culture mislead you. Simply being a good human being who cares about and looks after  other people, the planet, and all its creatures is the single greatest achievement. The rest (finding your purpose, carving out a career, making a living) will get sorted out with time and patience.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8ucx4/ill_be_25_in_a_month_is_it_too_late_for_me/hgu75cy/"}
