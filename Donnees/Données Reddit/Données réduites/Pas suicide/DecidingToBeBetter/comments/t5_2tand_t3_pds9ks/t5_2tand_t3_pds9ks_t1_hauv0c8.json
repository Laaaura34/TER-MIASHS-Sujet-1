For example, staying out of the kitchen and eating before going food shopping. Find something to replace the mindless scrolling through shopping sites. Log out, delete wishlists, and deactivate one click checkout. Put your wallet and cards in a safe place, maybe within like 3 zippered bags while at home? Figure out what is driving these desires, is it comparison, boredom? Exercise and mute whenever you see a commercial playing. Small steps to changing one or a few habits at a time! Keep a handwritten shopping list and stick with it! You can always treat yourself a little from time to time. Make the good habits easy to do and reward yourself accordingly so you feel motivated to do them. Make them fun! Like I'll dance to fun music and cook things I like (in advance, so I'm not hangry while waiting). I always recommend journaling and meditation to clear your mind and know your own thoughts better. I think art, like doodling, is easy to do, convenient, and fun! Don't be too harsh when you inevitably fall, just try again!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pds9ks/i_need_to_start_having_more_control_over_my/hauv0c8/"}
