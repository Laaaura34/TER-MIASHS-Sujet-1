I was/still sort of am in the same boat as you, don't have a whole lot going on other than work, little friends to speak of, although the ones I have I love.\n\nBut I was the same in high school, thought I was better or more mature than a lot of people, which really limited my social circle, the one thing you've got up on me is not being a quitter, I could never stick to anything for more than a few months until I got bored.\n\nNow that I'm 20, almost 21 and I look back, I can see how little I've done and how much time I've wasted, it sucks and I'd be lying if I said I don't think about it daily and it gets me really low some days.\n\nThe best way I found to shift my mind set was to force myself to take up hobbies and go see friends and family, we can't change our past, but we can look back and see where we went wrong and learn from it and learn how to change ourselves for the better.\n\nAt the end of the the day, we're human, we make mistakes and we regret them, but we can learn from these mistakes and make a better future for ourselves. Hell a couple of months ago I wouldn't even dream of posting a comment on Reddit due to anxiety, but I realised that getting hung up on the small things has a cascading effect onto every other part of my life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iaqri7/decided_to_stop_being_a_loser_todayyyy/g1q72e1/"}
