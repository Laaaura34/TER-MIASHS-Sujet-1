Routines are boring and methodical. That is why they are routines. They are the things we must do so we can make time for the things we want to do.\n\nYou mentioned that you have a lot of free time on your hands. What sort of things have you used to fill that time with? Do they provide you some leisure or means toward self-improvement? Life can become mundane if every day feels like the one that came before it. That is why I would suggest breaking up your routines as much as you can.\n\nWhile it is good to question things beyond your literal and figurative \"four walls,\" don't let that become something that weighs you down. If anything, use that as a catalyst for self-discovery, learning, cultivating your interests, to work toward a path that will bring you the fulfillment you seek.\n\nI have had a lot of the same thoughts you have had since this pandemic started and it sucks to feel like the world is at a stand still. However, we are continuously moving forward, albeit at a slower than normal pace right now. I have started thinking of this time as a gift, a chance to not be so concerned with the day to day of everything around me and think more about my own progress.\n\nI hope you will be able to do the same.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfiv3i/i_feel_like_im_stagnating_in_life_despite_making/hi0beqy/"}
