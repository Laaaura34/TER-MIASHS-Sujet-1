Try to build new habits slowly. Going to work or even working from home can be boring because it\u2019s doing the same things everyday.\n\nTo make my daily routine interesting, I listen to music and sing along with the song. It\u2019s a good way to start my day. I also listen to inspirational messages. I exercise before I start my daily chores.\n\nOne of my friends has been working from home since the pandemic started. He got bored by just staying at home the whole day. He decided to travel with his dog while doing his work remotely. My husband and I also travel while he does his work. He can work anywhere as long as he has his laptop.\n\nAbout your next question, if I have 2 years of free time I would spend it with my siblings. They live a thousand miles away from me so I will take that opportunity to spend time with them. The place where I was born and raised has a big impact on who I become now and I want to help the needy people in my hometown. I will encourage my siblings to organize a feeding program so we can bring happiness to those who are in need in the community.\n\nI hope things will get better for you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfiv3i/i_feel_like_im_stagnating_in_life_despite_making/hi0yi5u/"}
