What did work was transitioning to a masturbation/porn habit that was much healthier. When I get that craving I go jerk off in the bathroom while scrolling through some NSFW subreddits. Basically, I do it as fast as I can and then go about my day. This way I've been able to satisfy my cravings but I no longer have this porn hobby that takes up a bunch of my life. I've cut down the time spent on porn from ~10 hours/week to ~30 mins/week. (I never did the math before that's crazy)\n\nEven if you want to go cold turkey eventually, this is a good way to start because it'll ease you in to it. It also overwrites the bad habit with an okay one so if you slip up you're going back to the okay one instead of the bad one.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ogmu9q/i_cant_quit_porn/h4k5esu/"}
