Porn is unhealthy, but the masturbation is not. When I'm healthy I masturbate a lot and I'm 45. Why quit it? I can think of only 1 reason - when it affects your work :) But you said you do it at night, so unless it takes you entire night and you have some sleep left, it's OK. Do not fight your body and yourself. Masturbation is good. Just the porn is bad. I mean the most of it. My watching of porn consists of wasting hours to find one good clip among countless bad ones. Most of the porn is ugly, not to say disgusting, and pathologicaly violent. I hate watching people not enjoying sex, or dudes doing this with women while looking as they raped their cell mates in prison. Am I that weird or the porn is so bad these days?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ogmu9q/i_cant_quit_porn/h4ka65g/"}
