Finding something to fill the hole you will create with the cutting back on porn. And sitting/reflecting with your cravings.\n\nalthough one note i do have is maybe consider just progressing down to 0% instead of going cold turkey, \n\nthe semi-bad news is now all that is left is consistency and a lot of vigilance. dont beat yourself for falling back into bad habits, just use it as a reminder that what you are dealing with is a problem and you are doing the right thing by trying to solve it.\n\nrelapses happen with all forms of addictions. hopefully one day you will find that the distance between major relapses has been growing. \n\nwishing you the best of luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ogmu9q/i_cant_quit_porn/h4jvcqo/"}
