Put out bit by bit to a community. Since design, maybe a watermark for safe keeping? \n\nAfter that, you can be gungho and mass produce work to feel things out faster. It's basically a \"fuck fear\" attitude and going after volume to dispel everything/learn quickly\n\nI was thinking of doing this by making more threads in subreddits than commenting in individual threads\n\n>feeling that I am not myself\n\nAt least now you can see how far your imagination can wander. The dissonance is between how we think of ourselves vs. how others see us.\n\nNaturally, you cut back on mistakes to not expose what you think is the shitty part of yourself. Do this enough times, and you end up not talking. If it gets bad, then you'll be like me where you drift in and out of conversations for several reasons\n\nTalk to people. One-on-one gives you best chance to have deep meaningful convos/bonding time. I did a lot of Skype calls during my early days when I decided to get better\n\nBig plus is you build trust/goodwill/relationship that you can cash in down the road when you're a world class designer. \n\nCan I have your autograph?\n\n\n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/5a5ujc/i_need_as_much_help_as_possible_please_do_this/d9e2e0t/"}
