I didn\u2019t full on start collecting crystals and aligning my chakras (I still don\u2019t) but more about philosophy on life, meditation, souls and the concept of a soul, purpose, positive thinking, affirming myself with words. \n\nIt all led to me understanding that people are not mine to possess. That rule of freedom that is true for them is also true for me, and I\u2019m still capable of love and compassion without the need to keep it forever. Life/nature is built on abundance and cycles and the beauty of it is that as long as I\u2019m alive I can love again and can be loved again. This is also true for friendship.
