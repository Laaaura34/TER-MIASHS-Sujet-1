I've been on a very similar journey but I feel like you are light years ahead of me! Your post rang true of so many aspects of my past and their associated baggage. I think I need to read this every day until I don't forget. I have an all-or-nothing personality which is essentially the same black-or-white thinking that you speak about. I don't know why but your post has brought much needed clarity to my own journey. Thank you again! Congrats on finding balance in your life!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h91kfb/making_decisions_based_on_energy_has_helped_me_so/fuv8lz5/"}
