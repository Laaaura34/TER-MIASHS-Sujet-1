I was lucky, I had a trusted friend tell me I didn't ACTUALLY care about anyone else.  So I asked him how to care.\n\nIt's a journey, man.  Once you put your mind to it it's a heart crushing journey with ups and downs and careless moments with caring ones.\n\nI'm just super happy you had your moment of realization.  It makes life so much more livable and lovable.  I have clinical depression, but the days I have to feel good are 100x better now.  \n\nYou go man, I'm proud of you even though I don't know you.  Let's care together.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iryab0/i_woke_up_this_morning_in_a_fit_of_slobbering/g553259/"}
