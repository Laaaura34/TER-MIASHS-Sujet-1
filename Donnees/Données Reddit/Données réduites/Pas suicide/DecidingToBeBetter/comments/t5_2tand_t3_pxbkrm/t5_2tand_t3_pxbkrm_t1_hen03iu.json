In a sense, you're already there, you're making the good, loving choices for yourself. We shouldn't have to hide the desire to be more aesthetically beautiful. These changes will come with effort over time and you will be so pleased. I find that focusing on being stronger, more agile, faster and healthier leads to more satisfaction over time and you will see changes in your body anyway. The way your body looks will will be a cherry on top of how your body feels! Some people hurt their bodies for beauty, that's why that shouldn't be the main and sole focus. Lots of love and encouragement to you! \u2661", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxbkrm/what_can_i_do_to_feel_better_about_it/hen03iu/"}
