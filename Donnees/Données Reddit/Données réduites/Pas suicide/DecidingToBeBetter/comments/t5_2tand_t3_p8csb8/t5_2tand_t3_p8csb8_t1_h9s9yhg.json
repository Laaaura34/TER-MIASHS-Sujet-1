I think it\u2019s perfectly legitimate to encourage people and point them towards jobs, as I do sometimes. And I don\u2019t give money to the long-term beggars shouting \u201cbruvva? got any change?\u201d every single bloody day outside the supermarkets. Those people choose to beg as a lifestyle choice, and I\u2019m not inclined to give them anything.\n\nBut what I was talking about above is people who won\u2019t give money to someone who presents as being in an emergency situation and needing a small amount of money to get home, or call someone, etc. These situations do happen - I\u2019ve been in them myself. And I think there\u2019s something wrong with anyone who, for non-financial reasons, is so insecure, and so afraid of the supposed humiliation of being ripped off, that they won\u2019t help someone who appears to be in need.
