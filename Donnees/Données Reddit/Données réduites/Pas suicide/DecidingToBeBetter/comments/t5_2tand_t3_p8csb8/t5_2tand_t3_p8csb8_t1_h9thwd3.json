But this thinking is weirdly flawed. Why not give $ to a person directly? At least you know 100% of the proceeds are going to the person who needs it. Do not assume that cash will be used for substances- but also, who the fuck cares? Moral judgments of someone who has so little are so pointless. Sometimes being handed a $20 bill can feel like the world hasn\u2019t abandoned you after all. Providing someone temporary relief from a shitty situation should make you feel good- regardless of how it is ultimately spent.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p8csb8/20_seconds_at_a_stoplight_changed_me/h9thwd3/"}
