Offering water and food will actually reveal the scammers because they will usually, very rudely many times, let you know they asked for money, not food. I lived in Northern California (Bay Area) for over 10 years and the scams are real. \n\nThere is the ran out of gas scam, been attempted on me maybe 10 times at different gas stations. Then there is the this is my family scam, as people are much more likely to donate to those panhandling with children present. The my car broke down, can I please use your phone scam usually ends up with you losing your phone. Almost all of the scams prey on human compassion. \n\nI think your attitude towards these folks might depend on how desensitized you are to it based on where you live. I can\u2019t go for a walk or drive anywhere without being asked for money. Every major stop light. Outside every bank or atm. Outside every restaurant. Aggressively and expectedly asked for money. In an economy with an extreme general labor shortage no less. What I\u2019m saying is it can be more than deep insecurity, it can be actual valid life experience.\n\nEdit: But it\u2019s a great thing to do for those that you know are in need and just need a break, a chance to get back on their feet.
