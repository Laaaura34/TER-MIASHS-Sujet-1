Doubtless there\u2019s an element of truth in it, that some of the more organised beggars are not _literally starving_ in the way they make out, but it\u2019s usually exaggerated way beyond plausibility. I went to quite an elite private school in London, and I had several friends in Little Venice (where houses average about \u00a310-20m, which is about $15-30m) where the local legend was that one of the beggars outside Warwick Avenue tube station, in the middle of the neighbourhood, had a house on the road itself. I can see the purpose of these legends, in assuaging our guilt, but I wouldn\u2019t literally believe them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p8csb8/20_seconds_at_a_stoplight_changed_me/h9twbhm/"}
