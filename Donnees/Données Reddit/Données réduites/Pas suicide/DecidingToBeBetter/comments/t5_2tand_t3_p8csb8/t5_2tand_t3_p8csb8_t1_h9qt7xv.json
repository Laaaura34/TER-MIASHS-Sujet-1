I was pulling in to see how long it would take to get my tires changed, and as I did there was this guy that just seemed 'wrong' for the location. He looked like he should be on a beach in Cali trying to catch a wave. I was in the mountains of Virginia (not a backwards place, world class universities around, but we don't have people looking like surf bums here). As I drove up to see about my tires I passed his car and saw California plates (guess I nailed the stereotype). He had a sign as I was leaving asking for food or gas money. I was suddenly compelled by this guy's ambition to travel to the other side of the country while throwing himself to the fates. I went to the Arby's up the road and bought a meal, and then slipped a $20 into the bag for gas. \n\nWhen I gave it to him he didn't know about the money, just that it was food. He was so excited and appreciative. Kept saying 'thank you'. I just said, \"Don't throw the bag away till you look in, that's your gas\". \n\nI told a friend of mine from Connecticut about this later and he was like \"dude, you just got taken. Don't ever give money.\" But, to be frank, I would rather be taken doing something good, than to be \"street smart\" by being an ass hole.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p8csb8/20_seconds_at_a_stoplight_changed_me/h9qt7xv/"}
