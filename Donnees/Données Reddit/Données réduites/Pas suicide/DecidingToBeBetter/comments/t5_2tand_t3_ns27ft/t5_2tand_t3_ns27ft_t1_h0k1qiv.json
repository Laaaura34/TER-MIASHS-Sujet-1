Im dutch and I\u2019d say it\u2019s not necessary to learn dutch to study here. Most people, especially the younger generation, speak english well. However speaking dutch is a lot easier/more natural to dutch people of course, and older people may struggle with it. Also it\u2019s maybe nice if you\u2019re interested in learning more about the culture, since you could watch dutch tv, understand the music, read articles in dutch etc.\n\nNone of the international students I knew was trying to learn dutch though, so it\u2019s up to you if you want to! Message me if you\u2019d like to know more!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ns27ft/im_gonna_learn_a_new_language_give_me_some_advice/h0k1qiv/"}
