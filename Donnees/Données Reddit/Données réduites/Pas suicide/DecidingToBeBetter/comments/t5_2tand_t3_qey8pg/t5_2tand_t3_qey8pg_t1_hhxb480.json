Even even all the signs are there, it's hard to admit to yourself that that's what it really is. For me, once I took that step, a lot of stuff clicked into place - so good job!\nIn my experience, I just though I (and everyone else) was sad and tired and that's just how people live, but turns out I could have (and should have) been getting help for that.
