Couple that with the risk of getting married in America for a man and it's downright depressing. I own my own business, I'm well traveled, interesting, live a great life, but there's something missing, and women don't fill that hole like I thought they would. So my advice is keep trucking, doing things you enjoy, and maybe look at the fact that you are free, childless, successful, and figure out what else to do with your life. It's tough and there's a lot of variables at play ( social media, dating apps, toxic dating culture, women incentivized to behave poorly). I feel your pain and you aren't alone and it's most likely not your fault.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwtpir/how_to_lower_expectations_and_just_genuinely_be/hekrs49/"}
