But there's also a point where it may be more helpful for you to focus on working on yourself rather than criticising your current friend group. There's really nothing wrong with being less social and being content with life as it currently is. I don't think being a \"weak willed\" person is necessarily a bad thing either, these people are just choosing to live their lives how they see fit and you need to do the same. Focus on yourself, do what makes you happy. Just try to do things that you feel good doing and that you feel like help you improve as a person. You can't control the thoughts and behaviours of others so it's not really worth worrying about x", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m5tlk6/my_friend_group_is_centred_around_weed_video/gr1uvl7/"}
