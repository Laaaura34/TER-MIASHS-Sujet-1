Maybe once a week or two you still game or do whatever with them to feel a sense of connectedness to others and to not burn bridges. Be honest with yourself and accept that maybe you're outgrowing the group and continuously find new ways/people to connect with. Y'all just growing differently. \nI'm going through something very similar right now and so far this approach has allowed me to feel like I still have those people as friends but not get hung up on those connections and see them in a much more neutral light. Hope you can take something away from this!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m5tlk6/my_friend_group_is_centred_around_weed_video/gr2lpa9/"}
