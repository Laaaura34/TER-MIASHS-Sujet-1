This is something I struggled with for a looooong time. I used to categorize everything into good or bad and form a lot of false dichotomies in my head. OPs friends definitely don\u2019t sound like great influences, especially the thing about not wanting to change lol. But for example, there are people out there who are very motivated and driven but are also stoners. \n\nEverything is a spectrum. It\u2019s okay to be on the computer high sometimes, and it\u2019s also okay to go out and hang with people. But definitely make the right choices for you and surround yourself with people who make your happy. That is definitely important. The people around you can influence you in a ton of ways.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m5tlk6/my_friend_group_is_centred_around_weed_video/gr226c4/"}
