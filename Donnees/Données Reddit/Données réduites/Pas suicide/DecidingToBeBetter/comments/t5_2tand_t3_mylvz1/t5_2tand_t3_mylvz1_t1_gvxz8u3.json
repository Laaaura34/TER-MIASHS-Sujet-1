I was 29 and at the end of my law degree before I got diagnosed with ADHD. I always had imposter syndrome because everything seemed so fucking hard for me and I wondered how everyone else seemed to breeze through all the material and assignments, while I felt like it was a Herculean task just to read a fraction of the stuff. There were also a bunch of other symptoms like hard time with emotional regulation, etc. It never occurred to me that I could have ADHD, but once my psych identified it and tested me, I did some research and it\u2019s absolutely wild how underdiagnosed (or misdiagnosed) it is in women. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression in my teens, but once I started getting treatment for my ADHD the anxiety and depression largely dissipated. Makes me wonder what my life could have looked like had I been diagnosed earlier. A lot less anguish and self-hatred for sure.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mylvz1/i_finally_found_a_book_about_cognitive_behavioral/gvxz8u3/"}
