For some reason the OP's post resonated so I thought I'd reply. I think it's because I've spent most of my young adulthood (I'm 25 now) trying desperately not to fall into this trap. \n\nOP, I don't know about you, but when I left the organised structure of school and university it was difficult to adjust. There's so much you COULD do that's it's difficult to pick and choose what you SHOULD do. There's no right answers anymore, which is scary. \n\nYou might think that all this introspection and analysis will eventually lead to an epiphany of some kind, but actually I've discovered it doesn't. ACTIONS do. It's your actions that derive experiences, and experiences that will drive your life decisions. Don't fall into the trap of analysis paralysis (google it) - if you have options A and B, and they're both going to get you OUT of your parents house and doing something SOMEWHERE (with some potential for future career/social prospects), just do it. DO IT. \n\nIt can't possibly work out worse than where you've led to right now unless you make rash judgments. \n\nThe important thing here is to DO something - anything. Sometimes you don't have to be good to start, you have to start to be good. \n\nSo... start. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/6ba27k/not_sure_what_to_do_i_need_help/dhla8d6/"}
