A therapist and/or mindfulness meditation can help you focus on ideas:\n\n-There are greater things in life than avoiding trouble.\n\n-Staying out of trouble is not the same as being a good person.\n\n-You\u2019re denying yourself the opportunity to be truly seen. You\u2019re hiding your mistakes, or \u201cbad thoughts\u201d, or things unlikely to be well-received, which doesn\u2019t really allow people to get to know you fully. You\u2019re also missing out on the wonderful experience that is \u201cbeing bad and being forgiven.\u201d People who grew up lying like this as a coping mechanism often never got to experience this phenomenon as children, and we tend to be unsure that we will still be loved if we mess up. If you never got that as a kid, it\u2019s really transformative to experience for the first time as an adult. Really, really lovely, you should try it.\n\n-You\u2019re denying yourself the opportunity to really know yourself. When you lie, even if you know it\u2019s not true, it allows you to sort of...not really examine the truth too hard. I\u2019ve noticed that once I say the truth out loud, to another person, in a time where I usually wouldn\u2019t, it a) exposes some sort of truth or deeper root that I need to work on and b) makes the thing I was lying about seem WAY less dramatic and severe. If you\u2019re someone who has been very hard on yourself, consciously choosing to tell the truth/not hide can actually show you that wow...this was not even that big a deal in the first place, and keeps you from distorting it/subconsciously blowing it out of proportion in your head. \n\n-The big takeaway is that practice makes perfect. The more you do it, the more you\u2019ll learn about how you feel, and why you feel that way. Practice being intentional with the things you say....as someone who has (had?)  this same vice, I found that the lying/hiding tended to just slip out, and it would take me stepping back and taking the second to ask \u201cIs that actually true or is that something I just said?\u201d Then you can get to the point where you ask that question BEFORE you say the thing...and it becomes a lot harder to lie intentionally when you point it out to yourself that that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing. Mindlessness was a huge factor in most of my lying.\n\nHope this helps in some way! Congratulations on deciding to be better in this way; I promise it\u2019ll make you happier/feel more free in the long run!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkr1ax/how_do_i_become_a_more_honest_person/gnm1tka/"}
