I think we've been in really similar situations (though I had the sedentary job first and now have the on-my-feet-all-day job). Keeping myself busy with cleaning would be much more useful than letting messes pile up while feeling like crap. I will say I have started exercising regularly and it has really helped me already. However, I find meditation hard to get into, despite how commonly it's given as advice. My time off work feels so limited and precious to me that it's hard to get myself to sit and meditate. Especially when it hasn't seemed to do much for me. \n\nBut maybe the guided meditations will make it more useful to me. That Netflix show might be worth checking out.
