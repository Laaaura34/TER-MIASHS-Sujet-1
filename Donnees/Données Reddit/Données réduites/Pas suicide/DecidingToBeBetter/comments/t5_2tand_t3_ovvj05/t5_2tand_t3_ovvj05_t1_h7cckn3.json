And after that I started accepting myself that I am lonely because I never had tried to do anything ...MY WHOLE LIFE I RAN AWAY FROM PAIN BUT NEVER GOT RID OF IT BUT ADDED MORE BURDENS, PAIN IS NOT SOMETHING TO RUN AWAY FROM IT IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE DEALT WITH FACE TO FACE WITH GUTS AND COURAGE AND BRAINS...., Listen even If I tell all this I know a book that will help You If you are willing to read \"The Subtle art of not giving a fuck\"Author :- MARK MANSON ... Remember \"Every emotion is there for a reason it is a evolutionary part of us , it is not to make our lives harder but identify problems that are not easily understood by our logical brain , pain is also a emotion , a feeling of alert from our brain that something is wrong, Solve the problem the pain will not be there\" .Sorry for the long rant I only hope it will help you even if it doesnt, read that book i suggested best of luck brother ...\u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ovvj05/anyone_know_how_to_combat_loneliness_when_alone/h7cckn3/"}
