Zhuang Tzu is an ancient Taoist philosopher. Taoists tend to disappear away from what's known as \"The Red Dust\" or the chaos of society. They generally act a bit like benevolent loners. Willink, however, has written books about becoming a better person and organizing your thoughts and goals to strive for the betterment of your role in your community. These two men have helped me greatly, and they may have something for you as well. \"Attaining Unlimited Life\" is a good long read, but the interpretation in my opinion is slightly bias toward Confucianism, \"Becoming an Eminently Qualified Human\" by Jocko Willink is a quick and useful read. If Zhuang Tzu takes your interest, I recommend \"The Tao Te Ching\" translated by Red Pine, an ancient book of poems by Lao Tzu, who inspired Zhuang Tzu. This is also a quick, yet dense read.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ovvj05/anyone_know_how_to_combat_loneliness_when_alone/h7dmm98/"}
