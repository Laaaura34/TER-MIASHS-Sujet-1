I have restless leg syndrome which is caused by low dopamine and it makes me wonder if there's anything else I'm missing haha. I hope you continue to find happiness everyday and the best years of your life are NOT behind you. I hated high school and after college I had serious anxiety and confidence issues. I was never successful in my career. And then I had kids and to my complete surprise, I am the happiest I have ever been in my life. I never thought I'd choose to have kids but if I was struck by lightning tomorrow I'd die content, that's how much I enjoy being a parent. Moral of the story: it is never too late to be happy and you never know where happiness will come from.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lsbm3a/went_out_of_home_after_4_years/gosg4y3/"}
