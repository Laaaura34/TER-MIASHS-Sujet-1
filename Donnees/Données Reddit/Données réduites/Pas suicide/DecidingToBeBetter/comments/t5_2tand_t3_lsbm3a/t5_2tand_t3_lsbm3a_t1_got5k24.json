Sometimes it takes everything I have just to get through a normal work day without having a breakdown (I don\u2019t even have a stressful job) and I tend to beat myself up for it.

You\u2019re fucking worthless.\u201d I\u2019ll try to remind myself that getting through the day unscathed *is* productive. My goal is to still strive to be more productive without hating myself when I don\u2019t succeed.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lsbm3a/went_out_of_home_after_4_years/got5k24/"}
