Glad you could relate. I guess you could also tell that since narcissist parents are quite manipulative and we, as kids, always (maybe not everyone) try to satisfy them and draw their attention for getting approval for the things that we\u2019ve achieved but we fail, and in my opinion it can develop a sort of a very bad issue in our minds which can make us unable to distinguish between the types of attention that we seek and receive from other people. The fear of being judged can stay with you for the rest of your life if you don\u2019t do anything about. Specially, when we know parents are the closest people to us and when you can\u2019t trust them for giving you the love and courage you want so may be convinced that you will never ever get that from anyone else\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lsbm3a/went_out_of_home_after_4_years/goqul5w/"}
