Breaking anxious patterns is so hard.\n\nYour post really tugs at my heartstrings because I went through a very similar time as a teenager. Dropped out of high school because of my social anxiety and basically stayed at home all the time with my narcissistic dad. I\u2019m 21 now and doing a lot better - I got my GED, started community college, cut contact with my dad, and have a few good friends and a boyfriend. I\u2019ve even mustered up the courage and finances to travel a bit!\n\nI guess I just want to say that I\u2019m proud of you for taking care of yourself and that your situation is very overcome-able even though it may not feel like it right now. Keep it up! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lsbm3a/went_out_of_home_after_4_years/gorvrsg/"}
