Living a life that is hard as fuck. I have friends who always tell me that their life is \"colorless\" and they wanna change it, but they dont have the bravery, motivaton or energy. I always told them that \"i know how it feels, but you just gotta hold on and change things one step at a time.\" I have another story to tell them now. Thank you for sharing. Your life has just started and i'm so proud of you for taking the big step. We humans are cabable of almost anything if we put minds into it. Set the world on fire and show everybody what you got fam! I believe in you. \ud83d\udc95", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lsbm3a/went_out_of_home_after_4_years/goqczc2/"}
