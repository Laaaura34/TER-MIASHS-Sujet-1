I had just started tap before even trying to lose weight right before COVID and I do want to go back to that, but lately I\u2019ve been dreaming of getting me some gloves :D before that I traveled various countries alone because I wanted to. Was I nervous knowing I\u2019d be uncomfortable about my body doing these things? Yes. But I decided in a rare moment of wisdom in my early 20s I cannot wait for my goal weight to live my life. I have so many slim wonderful friends in my life tell me they wish they were as brave as I was about just doing what I want, when I want. (This was in regards to solo travel, not doing things while fat lol) and I knew I just had to cuz these were my dreams and I didn\u2019t know if or when I\u2019d ever get my dream body, but my time to be less encumbered by responsibilities was running out anyway. (Ahh the days of taking a 2 week long vacation and not worrying I wouldn\u2019t have enough \u201cdays left\u201d for the holidays.) and honestly I think making myself realize I could be awesome without being skinny or slim helped heal a lot of the scars that led to my emotional binge eating to start. I\u2019m still working on that stuff but it was definitely the first steps to freedom from toxic mentalities about what being fat meant to me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q7ja8f/i_want_to_learn_all_these_different_things/hgk88u1/"}
