Did it take me 4 hours? Yep! Was I the fattest one there? Probably but I didn\u2019t notice. Because it was me against the pavement and the distance. Runners passed by and yelled encouraging words and gave me high fives. I was proud to be a runner that day! I finished. And I am so damn proud of myself! I\u2019ve hiked at 270 lbs. I\u2019ve done kickboxing at 250 lbs. Oh it was hard! But it was FUN! I loved being active and it ultimately helped with my weight loss! Don\u2019t let your weight hold you back. GO FOR IT!! Have fun! No one even cared that I was at kickboxing! In fact, even the most athletic and physically healthy guys (I\u2019m a girl) had their asses kicked in the classes! Go at your own pace and just move, just have fun! If they\u2019re going to judge, they\u2019ll judge whether you do it or not. So, make yourself happy! As my dad always told me \u201cWhat others think of you is none of your business.\u201d \nIt\u2019s hard at first. It really is. But once you get that first time out of the way, it just gets easier! I promise! Get out there and LIVE LIFE as YOU want to! \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q7ja8f/i_want_to_learn_all_these_different_things/hgixiq6/"}
