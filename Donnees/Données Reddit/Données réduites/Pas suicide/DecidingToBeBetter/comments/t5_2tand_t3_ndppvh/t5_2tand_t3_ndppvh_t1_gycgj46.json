Everything I do, from losing weight and elaborate daily grooming procedures to jobs and courses, is so I can do YouTube as a hobby and eventually turn this into a full-time job.\n\nFor now, I took some time off because I just couldn't do vids. This pandemic and my body's condition prevent me from doing this. Every day one of my parents is at home, or if they aren't, they come home just as I finish my online classes. Needless to say, they don't like the stuff I post. And because of my weight, I am far from presentable on YouTube. Until I lose weight and move away, I'll be on hiatus. It's not like I got something to lose, just my sanity gradually", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ndppvh/whats_your_motivation/gycgj46/"}
