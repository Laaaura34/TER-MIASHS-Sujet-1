I\u2019m obsessive about food. I gave up caffeine, drugs, ciggies and alcohol (occasionally), but I can\u2019t stop binge eating to save my life. It\u2019s my crutch.\n\nThe only difference here is that I\u2019m not overweight. Are you constantly eating unhealthy food? I eat some really unhealthy food, but the main basis of my diet are vegetables and fruit. Also, try cutting out one thing. Just one. Eat as normal everything else, and don\u2019t make another change until this one is normalised. It\u2019s marginal gains that add up. \n\nSo years ago I used to have 2 sugars in my tea and I cut down to zero. I drink 7-10 cups of tea per day so that really adds up. Then 3 years later I stopped drinking soft/fizzy drinks. This is a huge saving on calories. This was 10 years ago and my current change is switching yogurts. I used to eat a really high calorie lemon curd yogurt and I switched to a vanilla yogurt with 1/3 the calories.\n\nI also cook the vast majority of my meals myself. \n\nIt all sounds like small stuff, but because I\u2019ve done them slowly, literally over 13 years, it hasn\u2019t felt as though I\u2019ve been really deprived. Going crazy on a diet is not the way to form long-term healthy eating habits.\n\nIf I binged like I do now, and still drank 2 sugars in my tea and fizzy drinks I\u2019m sure I would be a significantly larger person. \n\nSmall incremental gains are where it\u2019s at.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/euj0gy/six_pillars_of_self_esteem_breakthrough_and/ffpq1wc/"}
