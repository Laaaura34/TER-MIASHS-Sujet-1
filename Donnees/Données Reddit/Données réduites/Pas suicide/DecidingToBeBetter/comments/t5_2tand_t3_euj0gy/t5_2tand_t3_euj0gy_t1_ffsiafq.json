I started drawing using it and I was pretty crappy, and had to return it back to the library because my days were up. Something I'd definitely like to pick up again. \n\nIt taught me to continue drawing no matter what. When my mom came to visit me and we were touristing around, we'd sit at spots and draw certain scenes - a bridge, a kiosk, etc. Some of the best memories of the trip :) \n\nMy drawings are extremely basic and I know they look nothing like \"art\" but they are expressive and it's one of the best ways I had to enjoy the moment. \n\nThanks for the reminder, I'm gonna look into picking up drawing again as a hobby :) \n\nIf the book is tough, take a break from it and draw whatever's in front of you right now :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/euj0gy/six_pillars_of_self_esteem_breakthrough_and/ffsiafq/"}
