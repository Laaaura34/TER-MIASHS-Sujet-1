In particular, just watching the feeling, and especially looking at what pain I'm trying to avoid by eating, and trying to sit with and really observe that pain. It helps make it less painful, and the urges less intense. Then doing direct problem solving on the thing can help with reducing the pain further.\n\nI still struggle with it, but this helps me a ton.\n\n(Being on reddit is also one of these things for me. Sometimes I'll notice I'm binging reddit and just close my laptop long enough to see what I'm distracting myself from so I can unstick.
