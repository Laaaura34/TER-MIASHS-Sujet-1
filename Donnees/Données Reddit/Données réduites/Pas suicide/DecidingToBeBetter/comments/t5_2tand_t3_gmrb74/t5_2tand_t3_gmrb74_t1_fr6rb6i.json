You can't put that kind of pressure of \"failing\" your mom because that's not true nor fair to yourself. You are helping and saving so many people. MS is very complicated too! My adopted father has been able to limit the effects of his MS through a very strict dietary regimen. Maybe that will help your mom? While our treatment for MS is something I personally want to slingshot into production, the reality is that it will be at least a year from now until we can even consider it coming to market. Patience has been and continues to be one of the toughest challenges. Thank you again for all of your sacrifice as a nurse - the entire world needs more people like you now more than ever.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gmrb74/yesterday_i_resigned_from_my_job_to_fully_devote/fr6rb6i/"}
