My dad was my literal hero and an incredible athlete his whole life. We originally thought he had carpal tunnel because we were out playing catch one day and he literally couldn't toss the baseball more than 6-7 feet all of a sudden. A couple months later he was diagnosed with ALS, and died within 8 months of diagnosis. The way it strips away even your most basic motor functions and all of the smallest things we take for granted in daily life...its just awful. I wish you and your family the best during this unimaginably difficult time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gmrb74/yesterday_i_resigned_from_my_job_to_fully_devote/fr6s3rp/"}
