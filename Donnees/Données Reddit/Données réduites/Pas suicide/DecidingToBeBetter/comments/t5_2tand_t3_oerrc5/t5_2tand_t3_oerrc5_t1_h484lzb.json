You may be more enlightened but you aren\u2019t actually doing more. Try dipping your foot in the world of volunteerism, actually make things better, and meet people who walk the walk. Humility is a good cure for superiority. You will also see, again, that it is all relative and nobody is 100% pure. You could also try finding smarter friends because these aren\u2019t tough concepts. If you need to feel superior because you aren\u2019t doing much of significance with your life, volunteer to be a live organ donor. That way you will always have that in the bag. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oerrc5/how_do_i_lose_my_high_opinion_of_myself_it_only/h484lzb/"}
