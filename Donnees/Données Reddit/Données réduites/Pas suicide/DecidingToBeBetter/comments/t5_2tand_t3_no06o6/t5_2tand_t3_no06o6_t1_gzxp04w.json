Some of the greatest, kindest people have also been through some of the worst. It\u2019s what teaches us how others shouldn\u2019t be treated because we felt it ourself. I\u2019m really sorry to hear the things you had to go through and everyone deserves some love and acknowledging of their successes. Especially from the people so close to us. \n\nThe fact that you understand that even one teacher or adult that could\u2019ve helped embrace you and make a change is powerful, be that change for many kids in the future. You never know which mind you spark or which persons life you can change. Real life experiences are something that can be so sensitive and close to our core. I feel the cycle can be broken with powerful individuals like yourself. \n\nUsually people who are mean, hurtful and etc generally have had that happen to them secretly and continue the cycle. I\u2019m sorry to hear about your rough experiences but I\u2019m glad you are going to be the one to break the cycle. Proud of your success and wisdom, many blessings to you and your future. I see a lot of beauty come out of the worst situations, I believe in you! Continue to be great and be the amazing person, you once wished you had.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/no06o6/its_possible_for_people_to_change_if_you_show/gzxp04w/"}
