I have similar issues and recently stood down a habitual-line-stepping \u201cfriend\u201d after putting up with too much of their BS for years. Better late than never! And better to face the discomfort in the moment than trying to avoid (aka prolonging) it!\n\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with [Gabor Mat\u00e9](https://youtu.be/c6IL8WVyMMs) you should check out some of his lectures and/or books (especially \u201cWhen the Body Says No\u201d). Extremely relevant to this kind of thing. \n\nFor one thing, he explains why so many of us do the exact sort of thing you described in your relationship with your mom: our two most fundamental needs are attachment and authenticity, and when a child is forced to choose one, attachment always wins, because children instinctively know they can\u2019t possibly survive alone. He has tons of excellent insights, that\u2019s just the one your story reminded me of immediately. \n\nBest wishes, keep up the great work buddy!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfwbwr/get_comfortable_with_being_uncomfortable_its_the/fpyba5u/"}
