Acceptance, surrender, and letting go are fairly new concepts in my life (the past few years- before that didn\u2019t think it was possible!) and they have helped me so much. I\u2019ve also found so much strength in taking action towards my greater self even though it\u2019s not always the easiest path. \n\nThanks so much for your kind words and your response! Much appreciated. I wish you well on your journey, looks like we are aligned in our process even though we live different lives :)!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfwbwr/get_comfortable_with_being_uncomfortable_its_the/fpxdptl/"}
