Pushing through the discomfort and addressing my own needs has genuinely helped me grow. I\u2019m a very anxious person who used to look for partners who would constantly reassure me and make me feel comfortable (just like my mother). This has always felt very comfortable for me even though it made me feel desperate for external reassurance and unable to function on my own. However, my current boyfriend reassured me a healthy amount. He encourages me to be my own person and make my own decisions, and has set personal boundaries to how much reassurance he\u2019s willing to give me. \n\nIt was very uncomfortable when we first started dating, and it initially caused a lot of resistance and resentment on my end. But when I realized the unhealthy relationship patterns I was engaging in, I realized this relationship felt uncomfortable because he had healthy boundaries, which I wasn\u2019t used to. When I started reassuring myself, addressing my own needs, and putting myself first, I became much healthier and the relationship improved. I realized that my behaviors of constantly needing a partner to make me happy stemmed from my parents and their codependent behavior.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfwbwr/get_comfortable_with_being_uncomfortable_its_the/fpxpnqo/"}
