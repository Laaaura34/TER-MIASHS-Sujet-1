It\u2019s not easy! \n\nI have a lot of abandonment issues from early childhood stuff and it caused lots of codependency with my mom- so I totally understand the urges and needs for validation and assurance. \n\nPartners that help us grow are truly gems. I\u2019m lucky to have one now that really highlights where I have a lot of work to do in a loving way which is great. I always used to go for \u201ccomfort\u201d and would mold myself to fit into a certain image in previous relationships but being authentic in this one even though it\u2019s scary has been transformative. \n\nGreat job and thanks for sharing your insights!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfwbwr/get_comfortable_with_being_uncomfortable_its_the/fq01s3p/"}
