I\u2019ve definitely felt like, \u201cwell I am a nice person\u201d and prided myself on that but this isn\u2019t about being unkind to anyone else but being kindest to myself first and foremost. I am very non-confrontational in circumstances when it would serve me best to speak up. \n\nBeing kind and compassionate are wonderful things but when it\u2019s at our own expense there is obviously some exploration and shifts that need to occur. I struggle with this balance of course because it isn\u2019t always easy but practice makes progress it\u2019s a continuous journey that well never be done with. \n\nThanks for sharing how this struck a cord with your own experience and thanks for reading!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfwbwr/get_comfortable_with_being_uncomfortable_its_the/fpx3jgw/"}
