So proud of you for being able to realize it. Definitely not easy at times to act in your own best interest when we\u2019re taught martyrdom is to be valued and self-interest is sinful. (not remotely religious but those words came to mind immediately). \n\nI always associated being selfish with not taking others needs into account but now I realize I have to be self-centered in order to help anyone along the way. If my needs aren\u2019t met, how can I meet anyone else\u2019s?\n\nDefinitely have an issue with others perceptions of me but i am forever a work in progress and I know i am on a path towards letting go of needing to be loved or liked by everyone. \n\nThanks so much for sharing your insight and for reading. Much appreciated.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfwbwr/get_comfortable_with_being_uncomfortable_its_the/fpwpsh4/"}
