I resonate so much. I used to ask my parents constantly if they were mad at me and if they loved me , even in moments of peace. My mom was extremely anxious and volatile so I never knew what person I would get. Just ended a relationship with someone who was also... ding ding ding, volatile and anxious. Never knew what I was getting and every time he would get mad at me I had such a sick feeling in my stomach. Nothing helped until I \u201cfixed it\u201d. Having to sit with the break up and not make it \u201cbetter\u201d has been awful but I know that pain is merely a touchstone for change.
