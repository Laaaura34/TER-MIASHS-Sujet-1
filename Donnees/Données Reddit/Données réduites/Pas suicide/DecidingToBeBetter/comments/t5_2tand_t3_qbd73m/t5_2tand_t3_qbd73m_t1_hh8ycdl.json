Especially if you're fast person and you know well how to do your tasks. I know a person (developer) who do their tasks several hours and rest of the hours spends on gaming and doing their own project :) Maybe also you engage in your own project or join to others. \n\nBest regards!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbd73m/trouble_with_new_dream_job/hh8ycdl/"}
