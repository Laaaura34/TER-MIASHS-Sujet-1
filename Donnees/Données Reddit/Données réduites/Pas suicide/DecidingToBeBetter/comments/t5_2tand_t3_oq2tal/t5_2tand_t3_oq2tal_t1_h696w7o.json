I don't think I have ADHD or at least my understanding of it, but it probably comes in different shapes and forms. I believe I had depression about 8-9 years ago for maybe 2-3 years. I lost my grandfather and as an athiest I believe he was just gone and nothing religious based helped me have closure. And I lashed out at one person in particular a lot during that time period. It's possible I still have depression, of course I hope not haha, but I cannot rule it out. Or if it's from all the changes in my life post-graduation.\n\nYes we are bringing an end to the SO counseling. It wasn't so much of a formal session or anything. But there would be times where a problem arises and she would have the skills and charisma to know how to dig deeper and to get to the root of the problem (such as my stubbornness and fear of admitting that I am wrong). Then she would suggest ways to help the problem, which I often had trouble motivating myself to do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oq2tal/want_to_get_better_but_lack_of_motivation/h696w7o/"}
