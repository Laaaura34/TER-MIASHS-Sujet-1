There's a subreddit called maladaptive daydreaming with information and other people struggling with the same issues!\n\nThere's also raisedbynarcissists which blew my mind, cause once I had the words to everything that was going wrong at home, I could deal with it differently!\n\nThe daydreams are an escape and coping mechanism. They are the easy way. That means there's also a hard way, reflecting yourself, working on your issues and wrong beliefs. From what you are writing, I think you are on a good way to overcome it and get actually closer to the person you want to be in your dreams :))\n\nPm me if you want to talk some more!
