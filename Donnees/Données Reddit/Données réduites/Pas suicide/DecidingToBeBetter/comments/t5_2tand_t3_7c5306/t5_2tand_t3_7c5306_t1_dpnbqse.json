My father has always been something of a narcissist and a hypocrite, I think he too suffers from an inferiority complex. I'm terrified of turning out like him. He's a lot better now that I'm an adult, but it's left a lot of scars. I always saw him treat my mother poorly, and she always tolerated it and took it as a way of \"keeping the peace\" at home and it's affected my outlook on life and love. \n\nI was bullied in high school for being really skinny, for being different and for being awkward. I have been for therapy! I stopped because one of the exercises (TRE) would trigger panic attacks that would last for hours. Also because my therapist was 200 bucks an hour, and that bleeds you dry quick. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7c5306/struggling_with_an_inferiority_complex_and/dpnbqse/"}
