Thank you for taking the time and effort to type this all out! \n\nSo to each of your points: \n\n1. Thank you for validating this! It was a huge first step for me, and a very painful one. I spent many days randomly tearing up and crying realizing what a complete out-of-control asshole I was. \n\n2. Yes! This. I think meditation is great. I do yoga and try to meditate when I can, so no convincing needed. Breathing and mindfulness have changed my life. \n\n3. I kind of want to know how it's almost killed you 12 times. \n\n4. I'm eating macs as I'm typing this. But also I'm eating macs after coming from the gym. Balance is everything I guess? \n\n5. This is ace. It really makes sense. I think a lot of re-wiring of my brain is in order, because now it's used to pushing emotional buttons through my imagination rather than action, and it's probably because I'm scared to fail and look stupid. \n\n6. A hot body! Abs! Working on my art! Chocolate cake! A holiday in Rome! My ex boyfriend's head on a platter! More abs!\n\n7. /sniffs 2000 quid of coke \n\n8. Please remember to shower. Eventually. \n\n9. I once spent all my money on a claw machine in Japan\n\n10. Every day, new mistakes, new lessons I guess. Just gotta keep rolling with the punches. \n\nAnyway thank you again so much for your sobering words! Expletives aside (not that I mind) I appreciate the sincerity and kindness you've shown me. I'll remember this for sure (:  ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7c5306/struggling_with_an_inferiority_complex_and/dpnkeh2/"}
