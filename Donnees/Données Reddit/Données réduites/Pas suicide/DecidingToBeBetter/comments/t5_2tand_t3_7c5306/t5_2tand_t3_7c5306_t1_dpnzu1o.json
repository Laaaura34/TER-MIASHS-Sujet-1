I suppose the unfortunate thing is that my self worth has always stemmed from the validation of others- and it's only recently that I've realised that that is worth nothing until I see myself as beautiful and worthy. That is still a huge struggle for me. \n\nI think it's amazing that you've done all these things for yourself- and it's a beautiful act of kindness towards yourself and those around you. By actively working towards being better, you're telling yourself every day that you are loved and are worthy of love, and in doing so you become a gift to both others and yourself.\n\nI'm glad that you've also managed to sit with yourself and gather something good from this post. I made it out of sheer frustration toward myself, and everyone has been so kind and encouraging it's hard not to feel so heartened by all these people reaching out! I hope you continue in your journey, and that you never stop giving yourself a chance to grow (: ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7c5306/struggling_with_an_inferiority_complex_and/dpnzu1o/"}
