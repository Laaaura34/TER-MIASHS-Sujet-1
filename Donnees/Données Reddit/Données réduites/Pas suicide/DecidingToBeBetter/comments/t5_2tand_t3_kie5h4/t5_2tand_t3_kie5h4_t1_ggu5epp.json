It does help at times, but it is not an on-demand thing.  \n\nAnd you have already discovered that waiting for something to happen doesn\u2019t give the expected results.\n\nSo what, then?  \n\nFrom what I understand, what you do need is discipline.  \n\nPart of your problem, right now, is that you can\u2019t trust yourself to do what you know needs to be done. You don\u2019t trust yourself because you know that it is very probable that you won\u2019t do much.  \n\nYou can raise that trust by demonstrating, day by day, that you can achieve things.  \n\nFor this, you need to start a new habit. But for the new habit to stick, you have to be careful because your brain doesn\u2019t like sudden changes.  \n\nSo my recommendation is to be sneaky. Make small changes in your daily routine. These changes have to be small enough to don\u2019t matter.  \n\nStart with a goal. As an example, let\u2019s say studying.  \n\nStudy for five minutes a day. This won\u2019t achieve much knowledge-wise, but it will achieve the first step in believing in yourself. Five minutes is nothing. And that\u2019s the purpose: that it matters so little that you cannot not do it.  \n\nDo your best to keep your new daily habit. You will probably fail, but that\u2019s fine. When you fail, just keep on. Don\u2019t strive for perfection.  \n\nAfter two weeks or so, increase your daily task to ten minutes and keep at it for another two weeks.  \n\nThen fifteen minutes and so on.  \n\nThe objective of all this is to train yourself, little by little, to trust that you will act on your plan.  \n\nI hope this helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kie5h4/i_need_to_change_my_life_but_i_have_no_idea_where/ggu5epp/"}
