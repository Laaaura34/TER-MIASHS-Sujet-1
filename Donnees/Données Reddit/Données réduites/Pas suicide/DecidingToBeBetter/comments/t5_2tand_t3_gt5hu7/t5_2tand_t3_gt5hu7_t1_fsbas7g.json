I want to be stronger but I must be solid before I fight. That\u2019s the thing, I was angry. But that anger soon became ugly and that isn\u2019t the path I feel I need. Trust me that I know how it must sound to you. But this is MY journey that my soul is begging for me to do. Your journey is taking you to where YOU need to be. The world is a scary and violent place right now. I lay on to you peace of mind and love because everyone is so divided and hurt.
