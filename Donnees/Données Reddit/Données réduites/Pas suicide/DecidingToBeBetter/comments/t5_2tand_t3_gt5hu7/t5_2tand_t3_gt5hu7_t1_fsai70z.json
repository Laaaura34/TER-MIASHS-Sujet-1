It\u2019s gotten so negative to be on that it\u2019s actually changing how I feel people act in the real world and view me (because now I\u2019m interacting with people more online than I am IRL), and it\u2019s really not good for me since I have anxiety and paranoia. I rarely going on Facebook, Instagram, and snapchat just because I suck at/don\u2019t care too much about keeping up with those, and I\u2019ve been using twitter basically everyday for the last 2.5 years, but now I\u2019m finding that I need to stay off twitter because my timeline is full of negative events happening in my country and the world, racism, discrimination, hate, cancel culture, and not to mention this awful covid stuff. And I\u2019m a huge empath that gets distraught when I read about too many negative things, so having to constantly see that people are dying from covid, or dying from racism, or people\u2019s lives are getting ruined over a misunderstanding on the internet, can just be too much for me at times. I literally want to help everyone and fix everything and make people see how stupid they\u2019re being and I feel so helpless. And if I\u2019m being even more honest with myself, I noticed a huge decline in my productivity and motivation when I started using way more social media around 4 years ago, and I find my phone/social media being the default entertainer when I\u2019m bored when that\u2019s not how it should be at all. I don\u2019t even identify with my hobbies I used to love anymore because I\u2019m so used to just grabbing my phone and wasting countless HOURS on it. I think about drawing or painting, I dream about a story I could write, and I wonder about all the books on my shelf, yet I still grab my phone because it\u2019s more familiar and safe to me now (*blehhhhh*). I find myself obsessed with the fact that I\u2019m not happy in my life when everyone else I know seems to have it figured out. I want to have a nice picturesque life I can post on Instagram but I just don\u2019t and it makes me feel like I\u2019m missing out. I want to be a cool person that can easily gain followers or people that care about what I say, but I\u2019ve never been the type of girl people are drawn to like that. I want to \u201ccreate\u201d a personality for myself online to easily attract other people so I can have friends again because I\u2019m so lonely (long story short, I accidentally isolated myself for 2 years and now my only friend is my boyfriend and I\u2019m *struggling*). Just seeing myself type this stuff out that I\u2019ve never actually admitted, and the fact I did not have these specific wonderings about my self worth 5+ years ago, let\u2019s me know I have a problem and I need to limit my social media ASAP. Thanks for letting me rant on your post, it helped me realize things! I\u2019m glad you\u2019re also taking necessary steps for yourself!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gt5hu7/i_woke_up_a_week_ago_and_decided_to_suspend_all/fsai70z/"}
