Instead of making you quiet and fragile it should make you angry and loud. If you're black it should make you even angrier. Idk, these last couple of months I've heard that a lot from people. I think it's weak. I've heard white people (hispanic, caucasian, asian, etc) say that they need time to learn how to be anti-racist and I just think that's ridiculous. How do you need to be taught to treat people respectfully? Idk. I hear white people get frail on thie daily because it's too much for people to throw all of these deaths at your feet every morning when you wake up and check your social media. Black people have been dying all over the world. Black people die in America because they are black. Black fathers teaching their kids how to survive if they are ever choked out like that. All of this, all of this should put you on your feet. Instead you isolate, that to me seems wild. I understand self-healing, self-love, all that. I feel like now is not the time. I'm gonna send you a virtual hug because we are all tense as fuck at this time. I hope you feel better and I hope you seek change in your community too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gt5hu7/i_woke_up_a_week_ago_and_decided_to_suspend_all/fsba600/"}
