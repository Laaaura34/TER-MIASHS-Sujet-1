They are, at the end of the day, a business. All business exploit the tendencies of consumers to get more sales, exposure, etc. Any business is going to be concerned with money and I think a huge problem we face as humans is always looking to blame someone/thing else. It is not the platform creators or influencers fault that our society is geared towards these things. WE are at fault for allowing the state of the world to get this way. It is OUR tendencies they are exploiting for profit in the end. So maybe the change should be within us to value the right things instead of what we currently value. I believe that these social media platforms run like any other business and are based on what the people WANT.
