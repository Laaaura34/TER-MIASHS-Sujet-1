You aren't lazy, you aren't unmotivated, you aren't undisciplined. \n\nYou make straight As for years and then put yourself down because you didn't study \"enough\". If you were making As, what would studying more have done for you?\n\nYes, junk food is addictive. But you feeling bad about it is counter productive. You feel bad, so you get some junk food, and it activates the feel good parts of your brain for a little while. Then you feel bad about having ate junk food. Rinse & repeat. \n\nI think you are not giving yourself credit for the sheer amount of stress we have all been under the last couple years. There has been a global pandemic. You are going through a career change. You have had a life change with the new relationship, etc. Change, even good change, is stressful. \n\n Continue to eat good stuff. Continue to work out.
