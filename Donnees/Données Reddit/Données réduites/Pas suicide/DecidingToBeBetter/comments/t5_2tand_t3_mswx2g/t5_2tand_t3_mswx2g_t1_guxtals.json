I've been guilty of making such jokes myself and know how harmful they are. One thing I'd like to add is if you HAVE to make a joke, replace self deprecating jokes with ironically self aggrandizing jokes. Like if you created an art for fun that you're not 100% happy with, instead of saying 'my art is trash', say stuff like 'I think it's time we replaced Mona Lisa'. \n\nWhen you do this, you get to make a joke AND you're getting practice building your self confidence. You do it more and more, and eventually it'll become a reflex. You'll get so used to it that you can say nice things about yourself when you aren't even joking.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mswx2g/im_quitting_selfdeprecating_humour/guxtals/"}
