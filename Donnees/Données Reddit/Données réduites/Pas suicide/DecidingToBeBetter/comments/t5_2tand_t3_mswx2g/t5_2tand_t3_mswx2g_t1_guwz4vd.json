I HAD A LOT OF FUN DOING THE FIVE DISHES AND I MIGHT JUST WANNA HAVE MORE FUN TOMORROW SO STFU AND ENJOY YER FULL TUMMY, MEAN-BRAIN!!\\*  \n\n\nEventually, just learn to always compliment yourself, or be mindful of having good moments during a day......a bedtime journal is good for reminding yourself how great you are too", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mswx2g/im_quitting_selfdeprecating_humour/guwz4vd/"}
