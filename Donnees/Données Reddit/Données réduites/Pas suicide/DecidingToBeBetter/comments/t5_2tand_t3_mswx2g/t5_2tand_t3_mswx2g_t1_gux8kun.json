It\u2019s a HUGE deal. I had to do the same, but it was tuning out negative thoughts I had. It\u2019s a habit, and to take control over your words about yourself will make a world of difference for you. \n\nThe best example I can give is as a teacher, we always say things like \u201coh, it was nothing\u201d or \u201cyou did all the hard work\u201d and the message it sends to those who have congratulated us or thanked us is that we don\u2019t think it was really a big deal. But it is. There was so much work put in, and it\u2019s good to say \u201cthank you so much for noticing!\u201d Or \u201cyeah, I really put a lot of time into you and this because I believe in you\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s just the narrative which is your life.
