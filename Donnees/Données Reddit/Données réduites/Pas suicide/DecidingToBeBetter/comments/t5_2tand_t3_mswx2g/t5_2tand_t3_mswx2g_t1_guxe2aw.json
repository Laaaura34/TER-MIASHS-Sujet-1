I stopped doing this about a year ago. No more jokes. No more thoughts.\n\nIt doesn't seem like a huge deal at first, but for me, I have so much more clarity about myself. People respect me more.

Enjoy it!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mswx2g/im_quitting_selfdeprecating_humour/guxe2aw/"}
