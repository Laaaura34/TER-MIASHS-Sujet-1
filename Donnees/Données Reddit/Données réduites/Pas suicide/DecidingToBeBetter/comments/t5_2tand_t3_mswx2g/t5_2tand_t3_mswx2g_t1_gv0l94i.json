It makes situations uncomfortable for people you say the jokes to especially if they admire you as it shows insecurity and makes them think that you might be right but they\u2019re just not seeing it in the moment. They will believe what you say as truth and it will be negative for you since they think you know you better than anyone else.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mswx2g/im_quitting_selfdeprecating_humour/gv0l94i/"}
