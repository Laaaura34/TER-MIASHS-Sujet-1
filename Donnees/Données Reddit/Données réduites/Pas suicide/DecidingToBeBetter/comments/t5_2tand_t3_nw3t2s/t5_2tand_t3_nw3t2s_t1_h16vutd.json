I can\u2019t tell you how or when to take the first step, but what I can tell you is that if you walk into a store that exclusively sells the gear you\u2019re looking for? You don\u2019t have to know anything. You walk in and tell the sales associate that you\u2019re trying out a new hobby, that you\u2019re a novice and that you have no idea where to start in regards to what you need. \n\nThey will make sure you are informed and get you what you need to get started. The next step after getting your equipment is (atleast for the paddle board thing) scheduling a beginners class that will usually last a couple of hours and then you\u2019re good to head out on your own whenever you want to. \n\nAs for hiking? Start with a basic pair of boots and a good stick. A literal stick. Big thick one you can use as a walking stick. Strap on a water bottle and some snacks, pick a trail and start walking. Start small. A couple hours out, a couple hours back. If you start to feel blisters or pain, head back. Take note of when your feet or legs started hurting and where. Adjust gear as needed. \n\nI know it\u2019s scary, but you can do it and you will feel so much better once you take that leap.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nw3t2s/im_afraid_to_do_things_new_hobbies_or_buying/h16vutd/"}
