It's way easier to do all the research (surf the internet for gear, read articles, watch videos, etc.) than to actually DO it.

Dude, I don't care if it's the last day of summer, you still have the fall and maybe even the winter to go paddling in a wetsuit.  Go for it!   I just self taught myself long boarding on a skateboard after months of the skateboard and the gear in my car collecting dust.

On the second day, I even got encouragement from a lady walking that I was doing pretty good!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nw3t2s/im_afraid_to_do_things_new_hobbies_or_buying/h175yoj/"}
