Thank you so much for this comment! \n\nI\u2019m currently at university so it\u2019ll be really nice to be able to focus more of my energy onto that and do well in my studies and assignments\ud83d\ude0a social media for me was always just there for whenever i procastinate so i think it will definitely be beneficial in that light. I never really posted anything-i just stalked peoples accounts (and my exes) most the time and ended up comparing myself. \n\nHahhaa yeah. Me and my ex didn\u2019t stop contact (we wanted eachother in our lives still) till after a few months. It\u2019s been 9 days no contact and i\u2019ve had alot of realisations that i want to become the best version of myself now. And by getting rid of soc med, hopefully i can do so without comparing myself to others\u2019 achievements! + i agree..not blocking your ex on everything just adds onto your feelings of sadness so i plan on keeping them blocked for a very long time. \n\nSelf love is a really difficult thing to achieve. I plan on just doing things for myself from now on, from an objective point of view. I dont think it\u2019ll be an overnight thing. It may take years :\u201d) aha but i\u2019m happy to have that self awareness that i was lacking during my relationship. Now i know what to do and i dont feel so lost. You\u2019re doing really well <3 thank you for sharing your story! I did resonate with it alot. Its so reassuring to know that i\u2019m not the only one feeling this way or experiencing this. I\u2019m wishing the best for the both of us \ud83d\udc95", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qh07c0/i_have_deleted_twitter_and_instagram_from_my_phone/hiarsng/"}
