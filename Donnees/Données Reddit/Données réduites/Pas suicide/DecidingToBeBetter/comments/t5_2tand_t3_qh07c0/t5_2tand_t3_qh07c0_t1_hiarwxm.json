It honestly has gotten pretty easy since I don\u2019t have them downloaded. My biggest tip is to find healthy habits to replace it. Social media gives us so much stimulation and dopamine since being off of it my brain has tried to find the next best thing. For example, I\u2019m not a gambler. Sure I\u2019ve gone before and had a good time but It\u2019s not something I think about. One morning I woke up with a STRONG urge to gamble and no clue why. That\u2019s my brain craving that dopamine. It will take a while to heal but it\u2019s better than how I was before.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qh07c0/i_have_deleted_twitter_and_instagram_from_my_phone/hiarwxm/"}
