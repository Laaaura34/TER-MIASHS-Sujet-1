Took TikTok and Instagram off my phone. I don't have any other social media. I noticed how insecure and shitty I felt after using them. yet checking the apps had become a compulsion. it's started to make me somewhat paranoid, and causing problems in my relationships. I'm trying to focus on self care, learning, and doing things I enjoy. Being more present in my life, instead of trying to escape my thoughts and feelings all the time. \n\nGlad I'm not alone. Proud of you. We got this !", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qh07c0/i_have_deleted_twitter_and_instagram_from_my_phone/hicn4fz/"}
