I felt that way in my career and I considered changing over to be a military or prison chaplain to try to help people, but that felt wrong since I had gone through such a hardcore atheist phase--even though that had never really aligned with my true self. Since I couldn't honestly go back to any religion that was out there, I figured that I should just write down the beliefs that I do have, put it all out to the world and see who it resonates with. In the mean time, I like to reach out to people and encourage them to do great things and to make the world a better place.\n\nBy the way, your post talking about music really caught my attention because I have recently decided to learn to play the harmonica. I'm nearly tone deaf, but it's supposed to be very easy to learn.
