Funny coincidence since i knew my best friend for about the same amount of time.\n\nInteresting argument, why i shouldnt just stop the contact was : \"it would be a waste if we ended our long friendship\" . As if that was the only point, why we hang.\n\n\nAnd well at least you still have contact with good people. I have zero friends at the moment and nobody cared to pay me a visit, even though we live about 20 minutes apart.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kdim2e/severing_bonds_with_toxic_people/gfwqhtb/"}
