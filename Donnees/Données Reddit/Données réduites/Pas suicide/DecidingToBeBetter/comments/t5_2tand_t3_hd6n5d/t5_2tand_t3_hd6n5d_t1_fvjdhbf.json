And congrats on your sobriety! I am 2.5 years sober and it is so true that it is so much easier to open up and relax and just be yourself when you are genuinely enjoying what you are doing and the people you are surrounding yourself with. I think staying present is hard for a lot of people and can make social gatherings stressful or awkward. Try working on some mindfulness skills and seeing if those help. I wish you the best of luck!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hd6n5d/be_more_social_naturally_without_alcohol/fvjdhbf/"}
