Honestly, it\u2019s fine. Sit down with yourself and identify some goals, and small steps you can take to get there. I decided I wanted to go to law school next year, so I\u2019m finishing my Masters, seeking an internship, preparing for the LSAT, and looking for full time employment in the meantime. I ended up leaving my prior job at the end of August, it\u2019s scary but I need to refocus on my current goals. It all seems like a lot, but anything you want to do can be broken down into smaller manageable goals. You just have to identify what it is you want for your 25th year (: good luck! Don\u2019t stress too much, 25 is just a number and the only time table you need to worry about is your own.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pojeql/do_you_have_any_advice_for_someone_about_to_turn/hcymsmk/"}
