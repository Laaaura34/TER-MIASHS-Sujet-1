That can be a therapist or a coach. The difference USED to be that you go to a therapist to process and a coach to learn, but that isn't necessarily the case now.\n\nCheck out a company called MYGROW, they offer daily tasks and a instructional video to help you understand what is going on with your brain and how to rewire it. It's very cute, and really very powerful.\n\nI'd also suggest looking into Deep Work vs Deep Rest (How to Deep Rest effectively), your Limiting Beliefs, and your Assertive Rights. These are all terms you can google, I also teach these elements in sessions. I also teach The New Language of Happiness, which is great for unwiring depression.\n\nGood Luck, and remember, you are not a failure, it's your systems that failed you. Focus on rebuilding the systems to support you. It's a big thing to admit you need better systems.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ottimr/life_coach_vs_therapyst/h6y2esq/"}
