I always lean towards physical, because it disconnects me from the normal work mode I am in during the day. I took this new job in hopes of getting to learn emergency medicine...but with the workload I have these days, I want to find somewhere to work more physical than mental, to give my brain some rest. \nThanks for the advice !", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ottimr/life_coach_vs_therapyst/h74eorf/"}
