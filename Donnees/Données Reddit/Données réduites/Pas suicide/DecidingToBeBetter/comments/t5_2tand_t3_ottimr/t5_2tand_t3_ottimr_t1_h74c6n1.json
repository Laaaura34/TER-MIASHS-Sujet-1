The only problem is that in my domain (veterinary medicine), nobody wants to take you under their wing even if you volunteer to work and learn for free. Every job that offers Emergency and Critical Care wants you to work sole charge. I have thought about the switch as being the best shot, and somehow my new job offers that possibility. The trouble is, I have so much to work during the day that I don't know how to pull it off during the night. I have decided to sacrifice a night a week, just before a weekend starts (when that weekend is free). It's a huge sacrifice that I need to take.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ottimr/life_coach_vs_therapyst/h74c6n1/"}
