After eating McDonald's, I'd always fall into like this sort of sluggish, bloated stupor and I found it very hard to stay focused on any task (this was especially horrible since finals around the end of 2018 were not letting up).\n\nAs for weight loss/gain, I basically plateaued, I'm also only 22 so I feel my metabolism stopped being super effective around the middle of 2018, and yeah definitely started gaining but once I went off it the little amount gained disappeared. But no massive weight loss or anything (that's why I'm giving up soda haha)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eaiui5/almost_completed_365_no_mcdonalds_onto_the_next/faw24lz/"}
