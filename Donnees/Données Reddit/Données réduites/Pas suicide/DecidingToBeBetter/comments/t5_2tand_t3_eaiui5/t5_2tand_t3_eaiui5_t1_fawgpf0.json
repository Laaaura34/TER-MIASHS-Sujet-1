You're in for a shocker when you do attempt to eat McDonald's again. You'll wonder why you liked it to begin with!\n\nFor getting rid of soda, if you crave it for the bubble / carbonation feel, a healthier alternative is sparkling water (Sparkling ICE is a brand my husband uses. He's also type 2 diabetic and is a healthier substitute to soda then diet soda). In the states it's cheap, but grocery stores here also sell larger bottles of sparkling water for even cheaper. It'd be something to help you if you crave the bubbly / carbonation feel, and is like I said healthier than soda (still not the healthiest but it's still a step in the right direction).", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eaiui5/almost_completed_365_no_mcdonalds_onto_the_next/fawgpf0/"}
