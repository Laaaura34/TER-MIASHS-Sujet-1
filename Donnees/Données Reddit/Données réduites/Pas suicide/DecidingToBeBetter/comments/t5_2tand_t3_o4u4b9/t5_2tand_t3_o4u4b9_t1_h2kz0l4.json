We always say things to ourselves like \u201cI\u2019ll get better tomorrow, I\u2019ll do this differently tomorrow, I\u2019ll start on Monday,\u201d etc instead of focusing on doing it right now. \n\nI saw another comment say focus on one thing, it\u2019s great advice. Choose the one thing you most want to change and immediately start doing it. Don\u2019t wait until tomorrow. Even if it\u2019s a small thing, just do it. We procrastinate because we think about things and overthink it and let it hold us back. Want to know a secret? If you don\u2019t do something, it\u2019s tying you down. An example would be you playing the piano. You want to play the piano, but you procrastinate and play video games or scroll social media, with wanting to play piano at the back (or even forefront) of your mind the entire time, so even when you\u2019re doing other things, NOT playing the piano is affecting you, and at the end of doing the other things, you still haven\u2019t learned how to play the piano. Next time you think about wanting to play the piano, do it! Same with anything in your life, including and especially chores, because once they\u2019re out of the way then you\u2019re free of the guilt of not doing them and can focus freely on your time and what you want to do with it. \n\nAnother thing is that two months ago isn\u2019t recent. It\u2019s two months ago. It happened two months ago, and while it was sad two months ago, it isn\u2019t happening right now - it\u2019s sometimes difficult to grasp, but we let things from our past dictate and define us when really we don\u2019t need to, we can appreciate and understand that these things happened, but at the end of the day they\u2019re not happening RIGHT NOW. \n\nYou can do this, I believe in you, and I hope you believe in you too.
