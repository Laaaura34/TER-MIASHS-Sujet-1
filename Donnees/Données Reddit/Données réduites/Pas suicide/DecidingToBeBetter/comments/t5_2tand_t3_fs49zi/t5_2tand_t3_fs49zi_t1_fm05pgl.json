It's a huge problem and big pharma as well as governments all over the world took far too long to react and still don't react properly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am fully aware of how desastrous this pandemic is, but this changes not a thing. Still the pandemic will end sooner or later and still cilmate change will have a fa more devastating impact on the whole planet. What is quarantine and losing your job (though this can be horrible, especially in countries with no social assistance) compared to the devastating effects climate change will have in just a few years. We all know that it already has a big impact and it will become worse very quickly. There will be mass migrations far bigger than anything in history, wars for resources like water (!!) all over the world, even diseases that are now limited to tropic region will spread all over the world and kill more people than Corona does. It causes the biggest species extintion since the dinosaurs.\n\nAre you afraid that Corona could evlolve into something like the spanish flu? Climate change will be so much worse than that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fs49zi/corona_makes_us_forget_the_biggest_issue_of_our/fm05pgl/"}
