Dopamine is directly correlated with shit like motivation and creative thinking.  Makes sense that blocking it would reduce that function.\n\nIMO APs are designed to smash a manic/psychotic episode and serve no other function.  The fact that doctors keep us on them continuously is a travesty.  When I presented my case, my doctor couldn't help but agree there is no reason to keep me on the AP other than as a precaution against future episodes...he continued to admit that it would be safe for me to taper off the AP and restart when I feel my next episode coming on.\n\nThat said, I'm relatively self aware and I can spot my episodes coming from a month+ away.  My doctor knows this about me.  It may be less safe for someone who can't realize their episode until they're in full-blown mania.\n\nIf you wanna come off APs and are interested in tips on how to manage mania, lemme know...that's one of my favorite topics to discuss :-)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ffvs37/acute_writers_block_since_bipolar_diagnosis_all/fl0lxe9/"}
