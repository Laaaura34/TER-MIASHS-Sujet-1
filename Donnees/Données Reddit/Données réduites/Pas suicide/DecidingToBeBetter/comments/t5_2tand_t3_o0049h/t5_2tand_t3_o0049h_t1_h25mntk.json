I used to be a part of their subreddit but for some reason I unfollowed. I think ironically it was bc I was minimizing my Reddit feed to specific hobbies, haha. \n\nUnfortunately I don\u2019t think it would work on me! I use the screen time function pretty often and even when I\u2019d as my boyfriend to lock me out, I would begggg that I would need it for such and such. And I don\u2019t wanna put that strain in our relationship bc of my phone addiction LOL. Right now I just feel like anything with to do with my phone is too toxic. I would rather switch to an entirely different dumb phone and just be over with it! But I really enjoyed that read. Seems like a lot of us have this problem and it seems like different strokes float different boats\u2026 and hoes?
