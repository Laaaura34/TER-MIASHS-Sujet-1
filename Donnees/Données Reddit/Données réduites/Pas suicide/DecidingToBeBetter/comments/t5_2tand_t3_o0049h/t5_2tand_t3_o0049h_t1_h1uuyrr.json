I\u2019m sure you know quite a bit based on your personal experience but I always find it helpful when I read some stuff by someone like Tristan Harris who explains in more detail what is happening and why ( short circuit reward systems being hijacked etc etc). Anyways props to you for recognizing a issue and making a change! You know what they say, radical change requires radical change in physiology! And your doing that by changing how your brain gets it\u2019s rewards. Remember don\u2019t focus on not having the phone but rather doing other things instead and building those habits up! All this much easier said than done haha. Good luck!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0049h/ordered_a_19_dumb_phone_on_amazon_arriving/h1uuyrr/"}
