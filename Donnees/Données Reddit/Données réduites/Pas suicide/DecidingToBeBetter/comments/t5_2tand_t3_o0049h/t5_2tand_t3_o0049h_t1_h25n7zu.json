It\u2019s also 2G and most carriers are waning out on it so I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. I may even remove the link so people don\u2019t buy it. I got a Nokia 225 and it was great but I couldn\u2019t get it to read my SIM card.\n\nAnd during my journey of finding a good dumb phone, I came across r/LightPhone. Really cool concept and coming out with a GPS navigation which is all I could ask for in a dumb phone. I found a weekly posting where people sell used LPs and got one for a sweet deal B). It\u2019s arriving next week so my journey got a bit delayed, but no worries.\n\nHonestly I was kinda hitting myself over the head about spending money to get a dumber phone, but then I looked at my phone usage today and saw 4 hours. And I thought to myself 1) that\u2019s 4 hours of my life I\u2019m never getting back and 2) most of those hours were spent doing something completely unimportant.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0049h/ordered_a_19_dumb_phone_on_amazon_arriving/h25n7zu/"}
