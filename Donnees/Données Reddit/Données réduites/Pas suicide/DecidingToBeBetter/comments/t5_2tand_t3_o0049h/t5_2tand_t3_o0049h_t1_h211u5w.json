When I'm hanging around people now, I make it a habit to not be on my phone and already that feels a little strange when everyone around you is on their phones. I'm even more excited to work with a simple brick!\n\nThat's awesome. I came from sales where we had apps for all our work needs, so even at home we were being blasted with \"where are you guys???\" from corporate or complaints from customers. And it was very stressful. Can't wait to tell people \"if it's important, call me or text me. Otherwise send me an email and I'll check it when I get home.\"", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0049h/ordered_a_19_dumb_phone_on_amazon_arriving/h211u5w/"}
