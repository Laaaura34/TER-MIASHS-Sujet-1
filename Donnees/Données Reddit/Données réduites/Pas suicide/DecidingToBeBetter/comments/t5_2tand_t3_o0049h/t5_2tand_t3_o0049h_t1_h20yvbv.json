So I charge it for a little more than 24 hours and no luck - it never even turned on. I'm going to purchase a Nokia 225 instead which supports 4G like user below says, most networks won't support 2G anymore anyways.\n\nI've also recently found out about the \"Light Phone\" which is an indie company that produces \"dumb phones\" that are fully functional for everyday use. It looks super sleek and to be honest I was sooo close to getting it. Biggest problem is the price tag on it comes out to $325 with shipping and tax. In the future, it'll be coming out with step-by-step directions too. So maybe I'll save up for it. :)\n\nAlso through Light Phone users, I learned that there's a phone number you can text for directions. You can find it on their subreddit probably b/c I don't remember it from the top of my head, but I'll be using it with my Nokia when I need maps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0049h/ordered_a_19_dumb_phone_on_amazon_arriving/h20yvbv/"}
