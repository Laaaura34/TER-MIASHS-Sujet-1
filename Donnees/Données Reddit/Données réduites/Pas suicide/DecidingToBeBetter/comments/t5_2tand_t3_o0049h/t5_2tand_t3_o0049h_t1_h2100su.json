Coming out of a bad anxiety funk I gotta agree with this as well. Most of it was because of the pressure I was putting on myself. You end up just doing nothing and feel even worse for it.\n\nAnd I agree with the first part. It absolutely infuriates me how much time goes to my device. It infuriates me that these little screens were literally BUILT to be addictive. I don't say it lightly that I believe a lot of us are victims to unethical corporate greed. It also infuriates me that I don't have the self control to put it down and walk away once and for all.\n\nMy cheapie actually never turned on LOL. So I got a Nokia 225 instead. It supports 4G which was my main concern. The Nokia 3310 looks so fun! Wonder how come I never came across it in my search. I'll update on how my Nokia works once it arrives, and maybe if I remember I'll update on how the transition goes.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0049h/ordered_a_19_dumb_phone_on_amazon_arriving/h2100su/"}
