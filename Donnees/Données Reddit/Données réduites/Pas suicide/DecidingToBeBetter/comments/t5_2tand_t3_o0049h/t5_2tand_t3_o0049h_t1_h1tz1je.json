I removed all the social media apps from my phone and I STILL pick it up to check my bank balance, the weather, the news...anything that is there to open. It infuriates me, but at least removing the social media calmed my mind a bit. \n\nOne thing I would pay attention to is the list of \"I need to\" items. It may not apply to you at all, but I had a long list of \"I need to\" things and it was seriously causing depression, a sense of failure, and anxiety. I went from having a list of things to do from waking until work started, but whittled that down to three things which include coffee, eat a healthy breakfast, and clean up from breakfast. Relaxing, reading, exercising, walking the dog, meditating, used to be on the list, but simplifying the list really has helped my mental stated. Now, if I have time and want to exercise, great, I go exercise, if not, no big deal. Same with all the other items. Anyway, awesome choice on the phone and I will be interested to hear how it goes. I have a Nokia 3310 picked out, but haven't pulled the trigger on buying it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0049h/ordered_a_19_dumb_phone_on_amazon_arriving/h1tz1je/"}
