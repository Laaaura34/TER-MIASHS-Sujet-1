It\u2019s quite ineffective. I find it to be incredibly difficult to par down what you have, you always make exceptions such as \u201cOh no, I suppose the bank app is fine\u201d and \u201cThis weather app is simple\u201d and \u201cI might as well keep the Health and email app too\u201d and before you know it, you\u2019re back at full capacity. And even if you\u2019re not back at full capacity, I am astounded at home much I can do on a paired down phone! I\u2019ve spent hours scrolling through my photos app because there was almost nothing else available. Yikes.\n\nOther similar things that didn\u2019t work for me but may help you:\n- Adjust the color to be black and white only, it\u2019s less engaging (my issue is that I always turn this feature off to look at something, then never turn it back on)\n- Set time limits on apps and down time (I still do this periodically and I randomize the password, but my issue is within 2-3 weeks I\u2019ll have inevitably needed to make an \u201cexception\u201d and put in the pass code to extend my time, and my little demon brain memorizes it damn near instantly)\n- Another app blocker, I paid for some lifetime subscription that I used for like 3 months lol", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0049h/ordered_a_19_dumb_phone_on_amazon_arriving/h1vwitm/"}
