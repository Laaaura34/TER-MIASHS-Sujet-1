I do have a few old clunky phones I use at MP3s. Annoying because I\u2019d have to download the songs and I\u2019d only have like 20 songs to listen to. Downside is that bc your SIM card isn\u2019t in any other device, you don\u2019t have data. At the moment I don\u2019t really plan on listening to music often.\n\nI do not have a GPS, still figuring that part out but I\u2019m thinking of printing directions for now. I know my parents have a few GPSes stashed away so I\u2019ll ask if they still have them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0049h/ordered_a_19_dumb_phone_on_amazon_arriving/h1tnh6v/"}
