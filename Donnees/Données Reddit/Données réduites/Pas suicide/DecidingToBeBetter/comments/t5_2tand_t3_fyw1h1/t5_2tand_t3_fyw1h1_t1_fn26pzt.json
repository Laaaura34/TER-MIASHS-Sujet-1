Good on you for having the motivation to think of a plan and ask for help. Everybody has to start somewhere and when you can knock out 20 good push ups easily one day in a couple of months you will feel like an absolute CHAMPION.\n\nFor strength, stick to variations of the 4 major lifts: squat, deadlift, push ups, and pull ups. Being stuck at home, you will have to make some adjustments. You can fill a backpack or suitcase with books for squats, deadlifts, and rows. If you can do a body squat with good form then use the leg of a table or bed to assist you. For push ups you can put your knees on the ground so they\u2019re easier and you can do sets of ~10.\n\nYou can also do planks for your core, a few sets of ~30-60 seconds. Knees on the ground if normal is too difficult after the first set or two.\n\nI recommend adding an easy yoga routine or other mindful movement (tai chi, qigong, or somatics) to work on strength and mobility at the same time. It will also improve your posture, your breathing, and your ability to recover.\n\nIf you want me to explain any of this further, I\u2019m happy to, just let me know \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\n\nPS: Props for cooking your own food!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fyw1h1/advice_for_creating_a_daily_exercise_habit_for_a/fn26pzt/"}
