It\u2019s a really good way to safely and steadily gain back core strength as well as building up stabilizer muscles that will help u once you are more prepared for resistance training.\n\nThis will also benefit ur mind and ur flexibility, ur stress levels and ur self love (which can be really difficult if u\u2019ve been neglecting ur body).\n\nEven if u choose not to do yoga, make sure to take it slow to start ur work, this is the time when ur most likely to hurt urself, which can be a really convenient way to slip back into a sedentary life. \n\nI recommend just starting with sun salutations, but doing them at ur own pace (even watching a youtube video at .5 or .25 speed) just take ur time... even as a preworkout stretch if ur determined to do a more typical exercise routine.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fyw1h1/advice_for_creating_a_daily_exercise_habit_for_a/fn277y1/"}
