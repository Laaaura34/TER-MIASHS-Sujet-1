He pretended to be. Which is like, why? What do you get out of telling EVERYONE that? We only found out the truth because it slipped out in front of his dad and his Dad was like \u201cHe\u2019s not colorblind??\u201d He was a pathological liar. It was over 6 years ago.\n\nI texted him: \u201cHey, heads up you might not want this account linked to your Facebook cuz people are getting notified about it.\u201d\n\nAnd he was like \n\u201cI\u2019ve been hacked! Instagram is fixing it right away!\u201d\n\nAnd I sat and refreshed the page and watched the profile picture of his very unique chest (sunken in like cereal bowl?) disappeared. And then his bio about lacrosse and being colorblind was erased. And then went his name, Jameson, his favorite liquor, right before my eyes. \n\nLike I\u2019m a fucking idiot that Instagram is working that quickly and deleting it bit by bit.\n\nIt was following like HUNDREDS of profiles, had a following, he must have put some time and effort into this. \n\nDodged a bullet.
