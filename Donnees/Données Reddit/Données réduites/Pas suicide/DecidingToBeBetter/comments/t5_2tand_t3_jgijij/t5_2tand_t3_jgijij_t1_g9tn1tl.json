Unless you're doing it multiple times a day, casually scrolling porn even in inappropriate settings like work or school, or spending hundreds of dollars a month on it, you should not be obsessing about giving it up.

A lot of the no-fap community is comprised of raging misogynists who actually think the best reason to stop is that it's a woman's job to service them instead.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jgijij/unfollowed_all_hot_actresses_pornstars_etc/g9tn1tl/"}
