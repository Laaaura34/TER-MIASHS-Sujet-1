Word of advice, your priority should always be to stick to your goal of being better. The techniques or, as I call them, the vehicles you use to get there matter less than your desire, willingness and decision to try and get there.\n\nThe more you stick with it the faster you'll realise you'll outgrow certain trends, advices and 'techniques' and end up finding new ones. This is a natural process and is merely an indication of your progress.\n\nKeep at it. I don't really know what will eventually come of you after all of this, but it's definitely your best bet to make something extraordinary out of yourself. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jgijij/unfollowed_all_hot_actresses_pornstars_etc/g9rnoiy/"}
