You're doing great not succumbing to your unhealthy habits but just be weary of people in the nofap community trying to lead you down a path into some weird belief system about semen or religion. It's pretty malicious how they target vulnerable people and try to recruit them, it's an unfortunate side effect of the toxic incel community having a large presence in nofap.\n\nBe weary of anything you read that tries to lead you to hate/distrust women or to be ashamed of sexuality, it's poison for the mind and it's horrible seeing people go down that path.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jgijij/unfollowed_all_hot_actresses_pornstars_etc/g9rgn3d/"}
