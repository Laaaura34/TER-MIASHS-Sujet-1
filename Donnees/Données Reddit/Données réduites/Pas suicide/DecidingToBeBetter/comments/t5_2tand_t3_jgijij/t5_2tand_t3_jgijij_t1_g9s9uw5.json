For some people, it's once a day, for others it's once a month. You have to experiment to find out what works the best for you.\n\nFor me, I don't really have any set number of days between a session. But it's usually once every three days. That simply works for me, because that's when I build up tension that has to be released. But if you have a sexual partner, then I would suppose it's less than that.\n\nBut really, don't worry too much about it. Masturbation is healthy, and if it's not negatively impacting your life, then you shouldn't worry about it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jgijij/unfollowed_all_hot_actresses_pornstars_etc/g9s9uw5/"}
