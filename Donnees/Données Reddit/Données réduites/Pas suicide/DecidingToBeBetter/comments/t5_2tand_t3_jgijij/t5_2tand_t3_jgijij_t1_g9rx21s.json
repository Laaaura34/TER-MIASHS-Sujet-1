I also encourage OP to use r/pornfree instead of Nofap. While not as bad as semenretention, Nofap is still a pretty toxic place. If you're addicted to porn, pornfree is a much better sub, where people don't act like retards or obsess over becoming an \"alpha male\".\n\nBut like you said, masturbation is perfectly normal and healthy.
