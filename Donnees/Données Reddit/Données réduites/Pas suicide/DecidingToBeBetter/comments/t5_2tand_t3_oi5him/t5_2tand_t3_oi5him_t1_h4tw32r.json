Hell, I worked through grad school and did it. But work is always #2, even if it's a very, very close #2. If you're ferring to part time jobs, that doesn't count at all. That being said you're not done with undergrad. That is more time consuming than grad school. Unless you're going to a crappy online school, working full time and doing a BSc/BA aren't going to happen unless you are fine with graduating in 8 years.\n\nAs for the blackout comments, you're just seeing social media. These people are either on the verge of failing out, work hard as hell during the day and get their shit done, or just have majors that are total bullshit and will never result in a job anyway.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oi5him/motivation_for_college/h4tw32r/"}
