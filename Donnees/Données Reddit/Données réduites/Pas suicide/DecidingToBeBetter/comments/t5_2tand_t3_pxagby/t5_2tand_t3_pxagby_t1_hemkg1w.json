And I don't just mean in productivity, I'm creating negative feedback loops for myself. Not eating properly has lead to iron deficiency, which has lead to me feeling even more tired than I used to. Not working out has reduced my daily energy even farther, while also further reducing appetite, which has caused more weight loss, which has caused even further reduced energy and moral - watching muscle mass that took months to build up peel off you like layers to an onion sucks. There's other consequences to this as well. My confidence has tanked like a damn howitzer into the ground. Ive regressed to not being able to look people in the eye, something I'd worked through more than two years ago. I'm tired of watching myself dissolve. I don't care how slow the progress, or how boring, or how I feel. I'll feel better when I do better. I know that. But I have to start doing better to get there. I'm not trying to do this perfectly. I'm trying to do it at all. That's my issue. You can't suck at something you're not even doing. I know I can do it, I'm just not, and that's the issue. Sorry if it seems like I'm ranting or something, just wanted to clear it up a bit.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxagby/booked_a_doctors_appointment_booked_a_counseling/hemkg1w/"}
