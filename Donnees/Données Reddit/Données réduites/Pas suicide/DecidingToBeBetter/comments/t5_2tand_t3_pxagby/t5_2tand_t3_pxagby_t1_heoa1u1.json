It's good that you're expressing these things. You said this isn't about feeling better but, if you consider that feelings drive a lot of our behavior, they are crucial to the objective measures you're more focused on like muscle mass, eye contact, etc. I agree with you that you want to do it, you can do it, and you know what to do. And you're right that the issue on the surface is that you're \"just not\" doing it. I believe the reason why you're not (or were not - I consider this part of \"doing it\") is because you have deeper feelings that are driving your behavior. Counseling should help with that. I think it will be helpful to acknowledge that your improvement won't be linear. There will be ups and downs as your trend in the right direction.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxagby/booked_a_doctors_appointment_booked_a_counseling/heoa1u1/"}
