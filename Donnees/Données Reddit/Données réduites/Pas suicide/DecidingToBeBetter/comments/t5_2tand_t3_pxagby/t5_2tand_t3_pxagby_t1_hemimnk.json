I could be wrong, but I sensed some all or nothing thinking in your writing - working out everyday, early wakeup everyday, etc. I just want to caution you that as you improve, especially with deeper stuff like counseling, your progress will almost certainly not be linear. You won't feel better everyday or even every week/month. There will be ups and downs but the trend line will be positive over a longer period of time. All people, especially people who tend to think in black and white terms, are at risk of giving up when things look like they aren't improving day-to-day. They don't realize that, if you zoom out, you'll see a positive trend in the long term. You don't have to be perfect with working out, habits, etc. Just stick with it and do your best and you can't fail. Treat yourself like you would treat a good friend that you're supporting and encouraging.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxagby/booked_a_doctors_appointment_booked_a_counseling/hemimnk/"}
