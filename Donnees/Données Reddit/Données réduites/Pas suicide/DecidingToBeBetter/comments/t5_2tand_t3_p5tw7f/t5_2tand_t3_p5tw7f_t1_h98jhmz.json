You need your own system, but the biggest thing is sticking to it daily. Physical planners work for me because they're quick, cheap, easy to maintain, and minimalistic. I prefer physical over digital for several reasons, but if you're a digital person, try not to be all over the place and have backups. You could use OneNote. I try to have 1-3 priority tasks a day, rest are optional. It's easy to get overwhelmed with all you want/need to accomplish. Keep it in perspective with meditation. Some things are going to have to go on the backburner for now, but if you have it stored somewhere, you won't forget to do them later, even if it's weeks later. Schedule that free time and stick to it, no sneaking looks at your email. Often, you will have to compromise, but learning to let go of the \"small stuff\" is part of life. Breathe, you got this. You can do this. You have time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5tw7f/i_want_to_figure_out_how_to_find_a_balance/h98jhmz/"}
