This is based purely on my own observations and the fact that I made a choice to not pursue music. \n\nThe arts are a difficult field. The truth is most superstars don't come out of nowhere- they usually have connections in the field through family or friends. \n\nIf you're really intent on continuing in music as a career, I think you're on the right path in terms of branching out into all aspects of music and performance. That way you can stay in the industry while still being able to make money. \n\nAlternatively, there is no shame in accepting that you have physical limitations. There is this pervasive idea in our culture that you always have to go after every dream, but there is no shame in a stable, humble life lived on your own terms. Nothing prevents you from continuing to make music as a hobby. \n\nWhatever you choose, make sure it is your choice- not the opinion of some random person on Reddit who's probably commenting on something they probably have no business talking about (cough) or some stuffy art critics who care more about sounding profound than actually saying something.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nxmgl4/childhood_dream_doesnt_account_for_confines_of/h1jmkhc/"}
