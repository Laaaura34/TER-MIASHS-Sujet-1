By very dangerous I meant, the exposure of it can become very dangerous, not the phobia by itself. What I was thinking that if by mistake I advice this guy to expose himself to confrontational situation and stand up for himself, what if he over does it like goes and stands up to a bunch of goons and someting bad happens. I meant dangerous from that point of view, because I don't know you as a person. So I errored in writing it as a dangerous phobia instead of dangerous advice. \nHope that helps, I have also the same problem, as I am also non-confrontational sometimes. So I am also following the same thing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pf0830/i_fear_that_im_a_coward_i_want_to_change_but_i/hb13lco/"}
