I'm a very rash and impulsive person, and while I never directly attacked, physically or emotionally, the people close to me, my actions were still very toxic, self-centered and abusive. \n\n\nI also felt like when people got to know me, I pushed them away, and always wondered why and victimized myself. When I really reflected on my actions and myself, I realized how certian actions and things I did did norhing but hurt my friends and put stress on them.\n\n\nMy best advice is to reflect what you do when you start \"opening up\". For me it was a bad way of guilting, manipulating and even scaring my friends when I was at an emotional low or depressed, that I learned from a ton of my family, mainly my mother. For me it was very normal to do these things, but that doesn't mean it was healthy or good.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7jz8ue/stick_with_your_mediation_and_selfreflection_a/drcb1k1/"}
