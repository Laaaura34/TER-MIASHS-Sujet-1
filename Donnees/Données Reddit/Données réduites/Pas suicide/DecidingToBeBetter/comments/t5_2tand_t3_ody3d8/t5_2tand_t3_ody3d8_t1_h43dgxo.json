So over the past few months I\u2019ve been really working on my self confidence/self love. It\u2019s improving!\n\n1. Don\u2019t downgrade yourself. So don\u2019t call yourself ugly, fat, or anything like that. It\u2019s negative energy and if you keep telling yourself that you will really believe it then your mindset about yourself will be so negative.\n\n2. Negativity breeds Negativity. Surround yourself with positive ppl, be positive yourself even if at first it\u2019s just little things like my hair looks nice. Compliments are one way to help build you up.\n\n3.
