It's wild that you mentioned journaling. I starting journaling again the night before I made this post, after 4 months of leaving my journal on a bookshelf! I finally saw the benefit in keeping up with it. You just reinforced the value of that for me.\n\nI like the idea of listening to talks about being more assertive. I'll give it a go.\n\nYour bar moment sounds like a great breakthrough. I'm going to work to catch myself in those instances where I have a clear choice between speaking up & backing down. \n\nThanks again\ud83d\ude0c", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q6bazr/i_need_to_take_charge_of_my_life_i_need_to_be/hgdtnfb/"}
