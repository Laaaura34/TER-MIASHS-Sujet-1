I ask because just last night I was hanging out with one of my brother's friends (someone I consider a casual friend) & when he went in a for a hug he took a huge sniff of my hair and neck. \n\nI squirmed around the subject & hardly managed to say \"Dude...that's kinda weird.\" And he said, \"Why?\" ...knowing full well why. I, feeling panicked & not wanting to be direct again, said \"It's not like I have some shampoo scent or perfume on my neck.\" Stupid, stupid. He said, \"You don't need it. I just looove the smell of your body.\" \ud83d\ude37 This was after a long series of conversations (mostly over text, but also in person) in which I told him I'm not interested in anything romantic & just want to be friends (I was trying to be proactive & texted him this the moment I sensed he was trying to come onto me. He started acting different after my brother moved a few hours away).\n\nI am trying to work up the courage to tell him that (1) He lied to me & said he was never trying to be anything more than friends (2) He needs to stop pressuring me to hang out, only to make me insanely uncomfortable whenever we do hang out (I have a list of things like this he's done, which I've made worse by not being more aggressive in my resistance...& by giving him too many chances). (3) I would rather never see him again. \n\nAck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q6bazr/i_need_to_take_charge_of_my_life_i_need_to_be/hgfv175/"}
