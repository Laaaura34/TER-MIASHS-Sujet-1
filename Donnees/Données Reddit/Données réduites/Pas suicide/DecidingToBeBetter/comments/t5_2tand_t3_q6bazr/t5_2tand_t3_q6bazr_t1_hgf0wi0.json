I think part of it is having trouble establishing proper boundaries - for example letting the strange man smell my hair because he asked to and I felt like it was rude to say no. Now that the moment has passed I see how inappropriate he was and I would have been justified to tell him to leave me be. Maybe some of that is due to being female and having to judge if saying no means my life will be in danger. I'm sure my childhood and my family life play a large role as well. I saw codependency mentioned and needing validation from others - both things I can relate to as well. When I do speak my mind I get an overwhelming feeling of dread and so the experience is just negative overall. I do, however, after it's over feel like a weight is lifted. It just sucks that it feels so damn awful!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q6bazr/i_need_to_take_charge_of_my_life_i_need_to_be/hgf0wi0/"}
