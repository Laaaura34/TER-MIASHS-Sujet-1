One runs a company that supplies audio to events, the other is a teacher.\n\nJob prospects are few and far between and usually require a lot of travel (in my case relocating to London if I wanted a job.) With the advent of digital music, revenue has dropped massively since the 90s when CD was king. Even if you do study, you'll need to develop a wide range of skills, connections and experience to get anywhere, unless you start your own business within the industry, in which case you'd be better focusing on building the relevant skills for that manually instead of spending 4-5 years of an irrelevant course. Having Sound Engineering BSc on your CV will do very little to actually netting you a job, being mates with lots of audio professionals will go a long way - this is a vocational industry after all.\n\nI'm not saying don't do it, but it's not great for employment. MBA presumably is, so if 15 year old me could choose I know what it would be.\n\nYou can still enjoy and pursue music, especially as a singer songwriter, while studying something else.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q98cyk/i_am_25_and_im_about_to_do_mba_but_i_want_to_do/hgugwe5/"}
