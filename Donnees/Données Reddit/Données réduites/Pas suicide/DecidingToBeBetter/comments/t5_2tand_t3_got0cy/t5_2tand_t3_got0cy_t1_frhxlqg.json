But can't afford it. Insurance isn't an option either. So we gotta work with what we got. \n\nThanks for the callout re: my own pride. I definitely grasp for more control and authority than I should and I am working on this. Despite the validity of that comment, I have to say you lack a whole lotta context. I promise I don't go around imposing self-improvement on everyone. But on my family, who has asked me for help, you betcha (my dad needing help is part of the reason I've moved back). So he's already very aware he needs improvement. And has asked me for books himself.\n\nAbsolutely it's his choice to improve or not. And it has been established that he wants to.\n\nSo have you any good book recommendations?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/got0cy/book_recommendations_for_my_50yr_old_dad_whos/frhxlqg/"}
