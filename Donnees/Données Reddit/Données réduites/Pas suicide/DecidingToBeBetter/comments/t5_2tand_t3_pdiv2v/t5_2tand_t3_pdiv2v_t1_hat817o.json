I'm sure you'll feel much better once you've accomplished your goal.\n\nIf I could just give one piece of advice I would maybe say that you should set goals that are a little bit better defined. Like saying you want to self-teach yourself more and have better hygiene. I know it sounds simple enough to say \"have better hygeine\" but what would that actually look like for you? Is it remembering to shower every day and to brush your teeth twice a day? If so I think it's much better to have that as a goal because it means you have tangible evidence that you are making progress once you've accomplished that task. Likewise with trying to self-teach yourself, it might be better to instead say you want to study a specific subject for half an hour a day. Makes the task much less daunting when you break it down into smaller steps. \n\nGood luck and I hope this helps!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdiv2v/starting_september_1st_i_will_be_challenging/hat817o/"}
