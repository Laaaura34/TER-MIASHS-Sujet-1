Luckily self-determination is not the only reason people do things. Your motivation is also generated by the world around you. If you are not keeping clean its because you have no reason to. You have no intrinsic reward mechanism for cleaning. And clearly nobody is encouraging you to do it either. Without support and investment from others there is little hope for any task to be completed. You need to find enjoyment in doing it. Drink a pot of coffee blast the tunes and get it done one day, and then (most importantly) bask in the pleasures of its perfection. reward yourself by inviting others into your magnificent space. Throw stuff away you dont need it. Once you know you like it, and others like it too, youll be hooked.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdiv2v/starting_september_1st_i_will_be_challenging/havgpt9/"}
