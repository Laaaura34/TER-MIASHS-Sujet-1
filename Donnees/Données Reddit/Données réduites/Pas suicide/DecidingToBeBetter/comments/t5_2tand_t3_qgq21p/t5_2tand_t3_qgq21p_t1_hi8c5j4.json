I have severe jealousy issues. One thing for me was acknowledging that I was actually more envious of my partner than I was of the women. You seem to have touched on that above, and I think that\u2019s incredibly insightful. \n\nYou are jealous of HIM, that he has all these great attributes that you feel you lack. \n\nAnother thing you might want to read about is CBT therapy, and how you can work to reword your brain away from hyper vigilant ness. \n\nAnd remember this isn\u2019t your fault. Cheating is abandonment trauma. You have this to over come, your partner doesn\u2019t, and that\u2019s unfair, cue jealousy about that unfairness. It\u2019s a vicious cycle. \n\nBut behind surface relationship jealousy, is deep feelings of feel and pain.
