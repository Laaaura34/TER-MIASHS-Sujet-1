Unfortunately me and my boyfriend broke up because I just couldn't love myself and eliminate my insecurities - or at least be able to believe and accept the love he was giving me. Even though the break up was really tough (I'm still struggling to move forwards), it's taught me that self love is the most important love that you can't neglect and have to actively practice. Things that have helped me these days are journalling and just keeping myself fit and healthy by sleeping well and exercising every now and then. Plus, your boyfriend would not be with you if he didn't love you. He chose YOU out of everyone in his life and I think that is pretty darn special. Ultimately, make sure you take yourself out on dates and take care of yourself. And hopefully, that love for yourself will grow and you will be able to accept being his girlfriend wholeheartedly. Self love is a tricky journey and can seem pretty impossible to achieve. But being kind to yourself should help. \n\nMy apologies if this isn't what you wanted to hear. But I just wanted to share my perspective. It's been helping me so far. Best of luck with everything <3 I wish you the very best! You deserve it. Keep it up, you're doing amazing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgq21p/im_tired_of_being_an_envious_and_jealous_person/hi9i3tm/"}
