If you had more compassion for yourself it wouldn\u2019t be so difficult to realize that your boyfriend is with you because he CHOSE to. You\u2019re essentially in a relationship with your bf and the tiny voice in your head that keeps nagging about all your insecurities. \n\nI\u2019m on a quest for the same thing and I don\u2019t have any straightforward tips. But I do know that when I was in my worst place, my fear and anxiety came out as resentment towards other people. I was mad and bitter towards people who had done absolutely zero wrong. So my first step was to remind myself to be kind and compassionate - I am not the only one who\u2019s suffering, and then the love for myself has kinda started tagging along :-) As with a lot of posts in this sub, realizing that there is a problem is the first step, so congrats for making it here, and good luck \u2600\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgq21p/im_tired_of_being_an_envious_and_jealous_person/hi7u5cf/"}
