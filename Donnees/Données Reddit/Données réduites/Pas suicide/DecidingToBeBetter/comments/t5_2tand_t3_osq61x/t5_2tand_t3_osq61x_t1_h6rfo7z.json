I was depressed for more than a decade and I\u2019m still healing, I\u2019m 40 now.  What I learned along the way is that the results are a byproduct of the process which is just the sum total of each moment.  We are always living in the present as that\u2019s what we are tending to, but it\u2019s our minds that get disconnected by having thoughts.  By treating the present moment, our minds has a chance to rest and recover and not let our thoughts consume us.  The only thing that matters in stressful circumstances is to stay calm and composed.  Mindless reactions will inevitably escalate to chronic stress which will slowly deteriorate your health and wellbeing.  So whatever you do, try to prioritize relaxing in the present moment as much as possible.  Look at it as a glass and the water line being the stress marker.  You want to keep the glass empty as a filled one will inch closer to being overfilled which will eventually leave a mess.  The next time you interact with someone who you know will trigger you, be mindful of your reaction and just breathe.  Slow down the mind and don\u2019t let the moment rob you of your peace.\n\nI pray you figure it out.
