Because only been frustrated and sad won\u2019t solve it I think and if you did this then maybe you should try to write down what is in your head and really specifically write down what are the points which put you down and why that is and that way you can for sure get a better view on it for yourself and maybe this way can address some solution to your feelings. \nAlso from my personal perspective I hate when I have a person in front of me who isn\u2019t saying what he/she is really thinking because I can\u2019t look in their heads and see what they\u2019re going through so I can\u2019t fully grasp what the issue is. Wish you the best and I\u2019m sure you will find a way\u2600\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/osq61x/lost_and_confused/h6q5j7d/"}
