If you feel this way PLEASE be careful, because there\u2019s a huge risk here that you commit to your girlfriend, she lets her guard down in a big way, and then you end up hurting both of you when you end up in a situation you can\u2019t say no to. \n\nThere\u2019s absolutely no judgement here from me. I\u2019ve been a cheater, I\u2019ve been cheated on, I\u2019ve been in your position. Honestly not trying to bust your balls I just want to really stress that if you love this woman the most important thing is to be really honest with yourself about what you want. It is totally okay to want to be single, but staying in a relationship because it\u2019s what you WANT to want will only end up causing resentment and eventual worse pain. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, being with someone you love is 10x better than messing around, and messing around is definitely not the fantasy you think it is. But in life there are lessons we need to learn ourselves. \n\nYour feelings are human and valid <3", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/npxsfs/how_do_i_become_a_more_faithful_partner_and/h09avhf/"}
