Will power comes from no where else but with in. He has to be mentality strong enough to resist his urges. If a hot girl wanted to have sex with the dude and she made a move I guarantee he would fold and do her. If a heroine addict for many years can quit drugs and he can\u2019t resist his urges what does that say about him?! Does he want a heroine addict to have more self control and will power than him. I sure don\u2019t that\u2019s embarrassing. I\u2019m not here to lie and comfort this guy and tell him some lame ass excuse on how it\u2019s not his fault that won\u2019t be productive. If he wants some sympathy go to your loved ones for that this is the internet dude.
