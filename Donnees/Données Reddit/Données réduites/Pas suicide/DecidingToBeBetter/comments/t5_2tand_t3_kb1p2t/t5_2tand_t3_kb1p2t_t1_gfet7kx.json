So you need to create incentive to use the website.\n\nSame goes for games, especially those who charge monthly. People pay 60 bucks for a new addon and then 13 bucks monthly, so you need to make it appealing enough for people to want to buy into that.\n\nAnd some people, like me, dove into that pit like I wanted to win a medal.\n\n\n\nMy brother is my rock, we annoy eachother immensely but that's twins for you. I love him to bits.\n\n\nThank you for your comment, I appreciate you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kb1p2t/deleted_all_world_of_warcraft_characters_and/gfet7kx/"}
