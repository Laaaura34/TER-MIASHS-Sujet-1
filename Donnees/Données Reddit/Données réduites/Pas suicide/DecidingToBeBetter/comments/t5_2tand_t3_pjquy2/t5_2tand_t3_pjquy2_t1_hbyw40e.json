I\u2019ve heard it being referred to as toxic positivity. Blowing positivity onto the fire of depression, could just mask the underlying causes and put more pressure on yourself to feel better, and thus making it worse.\n\nI actually notice this in the fitness community. There's a positive mindset - \"you can fix something that's wrong with you.\" It develops into an unhealthy mindset - \"I must fix *everything* that's wrong with me.\"\n\nThis is how the incel looksmaxxing communities form. They become obsessed with \"fixing\" every minor \"flaw\" they find in themselves, never reaching a state of contentment and happiness with who they are. There is always another flaw.\n\nThere is definitely a dark side to the self-improvement mindset. It can be insidious.
