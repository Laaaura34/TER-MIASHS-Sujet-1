I can only speak from my own experience. In general, thinking positive is a good thing, and it is a good antidote to smaller issues or general malaise so to speak. One thing that I realised lately too is that it's better to try to feel positive rather than think positive. It's a little harder to do but involves putting yourself in a positive mind frame by feeling happy thoughts, gratitude etc. I used it recently to help combat post depression burnout. The thing that struck me, though, is that if I used this technique during my depression (which was mostly environmental) I would have just been burying my head even deeper in regard to what was happening in my life that I needed to change. Another example I can give is that during my depression I was regularly doing meditation, this is generally a good thing (like thinking positive), it did help in many ways, but it was never going to solve my main problem. A meditation teacher once said to me, \"If you're feeling depressed, maybe you've got a good reason...\" which is to say we have a tendency to blame our selves and think if I just tried harder I wouldn't feel this way. When in fact maybe we had something shitty happen to us, and we're just trying our best to deal with it.
