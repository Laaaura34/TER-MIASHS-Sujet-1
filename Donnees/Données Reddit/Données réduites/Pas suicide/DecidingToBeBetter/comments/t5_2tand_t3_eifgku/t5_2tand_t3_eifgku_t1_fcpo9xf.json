I felt like this at one point, I\u2019d spent a long time getting my life and behaviour together but I was still really sad. \n\nI found a counselor I could afford (made some sacrifices in the budget), and it really really helped me. \n\nEven though \u201cmy life\u201d was better I wasn\u2019t okay in myself because of stuff from my past. Counseling helped me pick that apart. I\u2019m much happier now than I have ever been.\n\nEdit: Sorry, somehow missed the fact you have a therapist lined up! Go to them and even when it is difficult, keep going. Talk about the stuff you push to the back of your mind. I hope it helps you as much as it helped me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eifgku/im_doing_everything_better_but_i_dont_feel_better/fcpo9xf/"}
