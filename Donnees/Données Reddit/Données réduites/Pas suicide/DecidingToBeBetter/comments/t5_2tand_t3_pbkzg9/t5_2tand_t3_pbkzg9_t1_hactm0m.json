I am sorry for what happened. \n\nI did something similar recently and through all the hard and hurt emotions, most importantly I noticed I feel like a heavy load had been lifted. I think it\u2019s cool all these things you have noticed.\n\nI am still whirling around and have anxiety about how things ended, how I let things go so long that way, cruel, the feeling of resentment I carried and how ai acted, and rude things said to me and so on and so on. \n\nAs each day passes, my grip has loosened on that. I wish I could just stop those thoughts. If anyone figures out a way, let me know. I think I will carry this anxiety for a while but I also now know what expectations I have for those I want in my life and that is powerful!!  You deserve the best.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pbkzg9/i_left_some_asshole_friends_for_good/hactm0m/"}
