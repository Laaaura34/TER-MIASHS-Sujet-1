So I wouldn't worry too much about these feelings, it's kind of natural in this period to feel down / anxious, and meeting new people or making new deep connections can remind you of what you feel you lost.\n\nTime is a great healer. I would focus on positive things you can do for yourself. Eat well, exercise, go out and be with nature. Just focus on you, and soon, I'm sure you will start to feel better and actually be happy and even excited to meet new people and make new deep connections.\n\nBe patient, be good to yourself, no pressure. Soon you will feel better I'm sure.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nihct9/the_thought_of_getting_close_to_someone_triggers/gz2go4k/"}
