I'm not looking for a new relationship, it just happened that I had some meaningful conversations with someone, and even though I don't feel anything towards them yet, my anxiety antennas went crazy, as if they were saying \"this is how it started out with the previous guy too\". I truly want to concentrate solely on myself for now.\n\nAgain, thank you for your kind words! I'll take your advice and not push myself in order to feel \"normal\" faster, I'll let time do the healing in its own tempo.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nihct9/the_thought_of_getting_close_to_someone_triggers/gz28awt/"}
