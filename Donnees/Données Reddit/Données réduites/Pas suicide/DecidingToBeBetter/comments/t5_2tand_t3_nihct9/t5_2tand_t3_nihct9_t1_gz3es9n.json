I did try therapy with different professionals, but none of them were really the one for me. It seems that this is just an anxiety-filled period of my life, and even now it's not 24/7 but comes in waves. I learned more or less how to deal with anxiety throughout the years and it rarely comes back, but when it does, it knocks me down hard. Thanks for the advice again, I actually walked around the block and meditated after I posted, and I felt a lot better. Having no school and no work really messes with my mental health, it seems, because I have way too much time to think. I'm hopeful about myself too though, and thanks for believing in me. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nihct9/the_thought_of_getting_close_to_someone_triggers/gz3es9n/"}
