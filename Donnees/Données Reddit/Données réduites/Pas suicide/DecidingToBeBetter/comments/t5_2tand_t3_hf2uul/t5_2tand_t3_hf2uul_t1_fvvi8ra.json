I would say meditation was the biggest since it helped me take a step back from my thoughts and realize I am separate from them. \n\nAnother is taking action even though I was really afraid. Letting myself be uncomfortable but still doing what\u2019s best for me in the end even if it scares the sh*t out of me. \n\nIt\u2019s taken a few years and I\u2019ve read many books, taken many classes and workshops along the way, so there\u2019s no \u201cone thing\u201d that helped me get here. \n\nMeditation was a great starting point and the one thing that\u2019s been consistent through all of this, although my life is radically different and i do many other things/use many other tools that help me each day.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hf2uul/stop_putting_mixed_signals_out_into_the_universe/fvvi8ra/"}
