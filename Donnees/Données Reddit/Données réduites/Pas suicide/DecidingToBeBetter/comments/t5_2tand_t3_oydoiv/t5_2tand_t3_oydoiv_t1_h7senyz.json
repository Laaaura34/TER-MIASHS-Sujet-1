The only exception is when your work involves unavoidable stress. Then it makes depression worse.\n\nBut as long as it isn't stressing you, I think work is a key part of recovery. I call it \"the therapy you get paid to do\".\n\nIf you would like support while job searching and on the job there are supported employment services that can help with this. Google supported employment services in your area.\n\nBy the way, I know how hard it is to do all you're doing and I really admire you. I think you're very much on the right track. Feel free to let me know how you get on", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oydoiv/what_helped_you_with_depression_and_anxiety_in/h7senyz/"}
