Please spare yourself some misery and get out of it before you get even more hurt. You\u2019re gonna regret that you wasted time in a relationship that caused you unnecessary grief, anxiety, and insecurity. Please don\u2019t think that there is something wrong with you. From an outside perspective, HE\u2019S the one with issues, NOT you. This doesn\u2019t sound normal at all. \n\nI absolutely understand the anxiety that you get when you hang out with your friend. I experienced the SAME feeling around other girls when I was still with my ex. To make matters worse, I felt like the girls that were mean to me would be the ones that he fantasized about. Yup, he was a weirdo. So don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re alone. If you ever need to talk to someone, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ltc1d0/my_long_term_boyfriend_told_me_two_months_ago/goynqtt/"}
