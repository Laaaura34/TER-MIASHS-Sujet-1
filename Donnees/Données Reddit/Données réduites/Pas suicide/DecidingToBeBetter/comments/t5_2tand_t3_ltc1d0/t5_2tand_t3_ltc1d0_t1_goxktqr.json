That guy sounds like he\u2019s trying to set up one of his fantasies to have two women be committed to him only. I think the gaslighting and lack of respect for you as an individual is going to hurt you and diminish who you are the longer you\u2019re with him. I know six years is not nothing but I\u2019ve had friends in similar situations and the one that stayed together ended up hurting her emotionally and psychologically that she became an empty shell of herself who could only feel better when her boyfriend complimented her. He would make her think that there is nothing wrong with how she looks but then would say \u2018it looks like you bought enough food for three but you\u2019re not into growing into a stronger couple with another person. Hey I\u2019m just kidding. You know I love you and how you cook too much food all the time.\u2019\n\nIt was the hardest thing to do just watching her go through that and she was very convinced that he loved her so much. \nI don\u2019t know you or any more of your situation.  But what I do know is that you deserve better and you\u2019ll realize how much better you feel when you separate from the negative energy he puts on you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ltc1d0/my_long_term_boyfriend_told_me_two_months_ago/goxktqr/"}
