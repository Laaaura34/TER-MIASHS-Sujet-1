It is one thing to develop a crush on someone, and I'm glad he brought it up with you instead of going behind your back, BUT the aftermath of you telling him you're not comfortable with it hit me a little sideways. I think you're being rational, and I'm sorry this has made you insecure. I think this deserves a long talk with your boyfriend about how you feel, and how he might be reacting a bit insensitively. Just remember, you're beautiful regardless of who is or isnt around you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ltc1d0/my_long_term_boyfriend_told_me_two_months_ago/gox5k25/"}
