Get into therapy for yourself so you can really realize how toxic, manipulative, and emotionally abusive his behavior is. You also need to realize it is not your responsibility to help him get better. It\u2019s your responsibility to make sure YOU get better, so you realize you deserve more. I know that\u2019s probably not what you want to hear, but it\u2019s the truth and I don\u2019t really think a relationship such as this is sustainable, especially if you ever want to become a more confident person. I know it\u2019s scary, I was in a long term live in relationship for 7 years. He did awful things and I forgave them every time because I, like you, had zero self esteem and I thought I NEEDED this relationship. I would simply not be able to go on without him. To my total surprise, he ended up moving out while I was at work one day....I was in so much pain I didn\u2019t think I was going to make it. That was 4 years ago & guess what! I made it! I\u2019m happier! I\u2019m in therapy, I live alone & take care of myself entirely (something I never thought I could do) and im so so thankful he ended up just ripping the bandaid off (albeit in a cruel ass way) because things are so much better now. They can improve for you too\u2014 so, so much. You just need to believe in yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ltc1d0/my_long_term_boyfriend_told_me_two_months_ago/gp2t3jn/"}
