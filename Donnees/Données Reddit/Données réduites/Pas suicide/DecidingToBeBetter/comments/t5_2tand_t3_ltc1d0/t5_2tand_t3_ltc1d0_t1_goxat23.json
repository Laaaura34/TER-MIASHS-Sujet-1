From what youve said in this piece the main problem seems to be that your boyfried is kinda dumb seeing as, he doesnt understand that being bi doesnt mean that you are poly in any way or would be intrested in another girl to join your realtionship, took literal weeks to accept a no from you about his \u2018idea\u2019 and that he clearly doesnt understand your mental state properly and isnt being supportive of it. These imo could show that he isnt that great a boyfriend, and he is very pushy which could be a sign for the worse (but this is only from what youve said in the post from your point of view). In terms of that I\u2019d probably sit down with your boyfriend and talk about what you think and feel, and explain to him how some of the things he has said are unacceptable, as well as talk to your friend about everything thats going on to get her opinion, and go from there, which might be realising that he isnt right for you. In terms of trying to be less insecure and being more confident the things I\u2019d recommend are having hobbies you find fufilling, recognising your strenghts (passively or by purposefully saying to yourself in the morning), and realising that these are being caused due to lack of support and understanding from your boyfriend, and attempting to remedy that. If an SO prioritises there own feelings in such a way with a complete lack of empathy, it is a red flag.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ltc1d0/my_long_term_boyfriend_told_me_two_months_ago/goxat23/"}
