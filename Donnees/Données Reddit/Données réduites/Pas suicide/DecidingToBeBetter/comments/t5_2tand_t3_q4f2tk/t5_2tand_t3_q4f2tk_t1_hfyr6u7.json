Didn't study very well, while wasting time for \"fun\" (nothing toxic, just friends, love, video games, and internet stuffs). I think I was happy then, but my career was shit. Low income, low living quality. So after having the first kid, I felt the urge to be better.\n\nThen few years ago, when I was \\~30, I started to learn computer science seriously, then got a pretty good job 2 years ago. I think I've found the balance point in life now.\n\nOP, if you need my 2 cents: have you tried to spice up your life? I had a \\~3 weeks trip to India, nothing fancy, just walked around (burned fat and gained muscle by walking \\~10km/day with 10kg backpack), saw things, talked to people, disconnected from daily stuffs. That trip gave me new perspective on life while \"detox\" the current one.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hfyr6u7/"}
