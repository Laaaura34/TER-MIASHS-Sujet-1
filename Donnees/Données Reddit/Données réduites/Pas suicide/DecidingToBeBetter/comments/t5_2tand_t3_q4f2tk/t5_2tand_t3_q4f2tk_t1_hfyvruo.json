I've never had a relationship, don't really have friends. I think I must have been around your age when I decided to get out and get some hobbies, and they entertain me. I really love my mom and having had a suicide in the family I know how much it would destroy her. So I know I gotta keep going, at least as long as she's around. I don't have much positive to say really, but just try and find some things to do. I started skiing when I was 29 and i actually enjoy that, and it gives me something to look forward to in life. It's not much, but it's all I can control really. I guess what I'm saying is try and figure out what you can do, what's in your control, maybe there's something that will entertain you and help pass the time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hfyvruo/"}
