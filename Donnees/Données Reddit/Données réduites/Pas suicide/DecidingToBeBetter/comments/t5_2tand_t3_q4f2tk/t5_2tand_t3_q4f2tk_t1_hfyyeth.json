Anyone can learn so much about themselves through doing it.\n\nI feel like many aspects of my 20s weren't ideal but they come to an end in 6 months or so. I could have arguably put aside a lot of money to buy a car or put down a deposit on a house, but instead I channeled a lot of money into my own personal development. It's certainly paid dividends and I feel a lot more ready to do things that I wish I had the confidence to do much earlier in life.\n\nProgress at your own rate, and try not to get too swayed by what others say you should have accomplished by a certain age.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hfyyeth/"}
