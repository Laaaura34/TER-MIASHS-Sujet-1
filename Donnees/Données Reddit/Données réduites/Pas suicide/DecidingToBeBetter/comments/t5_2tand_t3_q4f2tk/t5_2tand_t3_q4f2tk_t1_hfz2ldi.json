Own a thing? An amount saved up?\n\nDo you like your job? No? Do you have enough saved to quit? Now you have a goal.\n\nDo you like your city? No? Move! The number of jobs that allow developers to work remote these days are crazy. I hated the area I lived in. It was cold. The people were all asses. I told my wife, we're moving. It took two years, mainly because our house wouldn't sell, but we moved someplace warm with nice people. I got a remote job. I'm on my second remote job. You can do it too. \n\nHave some fun. What do you enjoy doing? Go do that with a group. There will be single ladies there. Go do that in groups in different cities. Don't have money for that? New goal. \n\nMeet new people. If I had to guess your friend group sucks. They may be holding you back. Get new friends. Do stuff without the old friends. \n\nI had a job that was great, paid well, super secure, I could have coasted to retirement. But I was miserable. I had been miserable for a couple of years. I needed a change. \n\nChange something. Add something. Remove something. DO something. Anything. You don't have to be miserable. Your life does not have to fit some prescribed theme. You don't have to measure up to anyone's expectations than yours. \n\nYou have at minimum another full life to live.
