Four months ago, I decided to completely change my life path at 34 because I was unhappy with a career I chased for most of my life. I quit my job and left for Europe for a month. I meet amazing people and had great experiences traveling alone for the first time in my life. \n\nYou are taking the first steps through reflection. Keep it up and take your own advice. You can have an amazing 30s and beyond. It is never too late to put yourself out there. This is just an intermission for you to launch into your 30s. 20s are overrated anyways. I like being able to afford nicer experiences in my 30s compared to my 20s.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hfznxhj/"}
