But everyone timeline is different, so is yours. You can start your life at any age, 5, 18, 25, 30, 50 even 60. Lets do it dude, we can enjoy life as we want it. \nIm 25, still no job, my major is computer science but since i was so focused on starting my own business, i forgot everything about programming. (My own dad fucked my business so it never actually start), now im struggling to learn everything again. I think im going to learn UI UX for my career, my knowledge is 0. Wish me luck.\nI wish you the best of luck with your life", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hfzegbo/"}
