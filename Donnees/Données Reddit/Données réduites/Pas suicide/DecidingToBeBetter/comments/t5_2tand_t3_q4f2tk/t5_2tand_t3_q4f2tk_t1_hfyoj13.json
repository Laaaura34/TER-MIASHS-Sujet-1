I'm in a similar position, though I've dated around a bit. I'm 29, turning 30 soon and feel as if everyone is passing me by. Like I'm being left behind in the rat race that we call \"life\". Also desperately lonely. I've decided over the past couple of days that I absolutely do not want my life to continue in this way -- sad and miserable and joyless existence. My current goal is to find the things that bring me joy and do more of them. That's it.\n\nLet me know if you want to chat. I'm sure we could both use a friend. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hfyoj13/"}
