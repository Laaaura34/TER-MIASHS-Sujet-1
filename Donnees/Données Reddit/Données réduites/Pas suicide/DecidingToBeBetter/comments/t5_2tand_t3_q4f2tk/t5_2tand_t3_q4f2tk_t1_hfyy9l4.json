I spent the last 10 years drinking and drugging my sorrows away cuz my parents divorced and I had my heart broken by one bad trout, and moved from Philly to The south at 16. Jesus do I wish I could go back and kick my own ass into shape, I was being a depressed bum for almost no reason at all, I let every excuse stop me from taking a relationship past a certain point, I let hangovers and drinking be a reason I couldn\u2019t accomplish my dreams, and I let myself get in my own way all day everyday. It ain\u2019t easy \u201cpulling yourself up by the boot straps\u201d but it\u2019s worth it. Have confidence in yourself my friend, change how you see yourself, is it a wasted youth? Or a period of preparing yourself, building yourself, to hit the ground running when your ready and your time comes? Whoever you are I love you, and I believe In you", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hfyy9l4/"}
