The only thing that's changed so far really is my attitude but I have plans and actions in place to change more.\n\nI suggest finding a therapist.  Find that inner confidence that you lacked like I did.  I won't say it's easy or going to change you in a day.  But your life isn't even half over statistically.  You care about your family so I imagine they care about you.  So aren't completely alone (but get the feeling that family may not count in these situations as again it's something I thought).\n\nI'm not going to say we're the same because I don't know you outside this post.  But it sounds similar to me but you have a better job.  So I have confidence you can find happiness if you start taking steps to do so.  Because sadly it's unlikely to fall into your lap and when it does it's easy to pass it up.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hfz2lsv/"}
