I recognised early on I was slower than my peers of the same age. I\u2019m currently in my early 20s and I\u2019m not planning on being in a relationship or having kids ANY time soon. I\u2019m saving it for my 30s, but maybe not even then. Like everyone else has already said, you still have plenty of time for life experiences.\n\nI have other problems in my life, but leading a dull one is definitely not one of them. I find it peaceful. You need to change your perspective on your situation. It\u2019s not wasted time, just going at your own pace and doing what you want to do, not what think you want to do.\n\nI hope you feel better and are able to pursue the life you want to live. But don\u2019t feel like you should be doing certain things to have \u201clived\u201d and definitely don\u2019t put a time limit on when you need to achieve these things by.
