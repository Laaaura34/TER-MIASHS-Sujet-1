I\u2019ve hurt a lot of people and cause mischief, I\u2019ve done a lot of things that I myself now would not wish to do. \nMaking bad choices for the sake of saying &$ck it why not?  Costs you. And I knew I was bored .. \nI personally.. have been going slow in life and I have even started on credit. And I can\u2019t move out of my moms without it. I am trying to finish school but some subjects are too hard. I am planning on double majoring in community college.. \nI have goals and dreams.\nBut most are met with expectations and infinite ends. I have a goal and dream in my life and I want to manifest it so badly. There\u2019s just always some sort of blockage. \nI have hobbies, and I\u2019m very creative. I can sing and love to learn to play guitar or any instrument really. \n\nBut it all doesn\u2019t matter when you feel passion is lost within you. \n\nI feel you OP for getting to that point your currently residing in. And of course it\u2019s a different perspective, but the loneliness and pain is all the same. \n\nFor anyone who comes at me with the seek help bs, yes I have a therapist. And sometimes venting gets you only so far. (Been working on DBT form of therapy) so far coping skills, are not really helping.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hg0lqlw/"}
