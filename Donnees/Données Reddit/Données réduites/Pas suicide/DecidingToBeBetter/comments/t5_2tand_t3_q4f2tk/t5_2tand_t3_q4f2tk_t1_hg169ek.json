I worry about it a lot, actually, but I often tell myself that as long as I focus on improving myself, I might eventually find love. Or love might find me. Dedication to improving yourself is attractive to women or so I often hope. Spend time developing a greater sense of self-respect with creative hobbies and healthy relationships. Don't make work your whole identity if you can help it. Yes-men are boys, not men. Seek out new experiences when you can. From weightlifting to reading, I commit to things I like doing to feel better about myself.\n\nHope by itself means little. You have to put the work in your efforts. I imagine less of us 20-somethings are having kids though, it's a big financial responsibility for many people in our generation right now given what's going on in the world with the pandemic and shortage of work opportunities.
