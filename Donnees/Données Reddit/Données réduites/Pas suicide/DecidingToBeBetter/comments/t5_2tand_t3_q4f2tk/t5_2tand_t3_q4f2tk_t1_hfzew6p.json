You are not alone. Don't get sold on the idea that the rest of us all had it figured out. Today is the day you start anew. What are your goals, dreams, passions? If you don't have any, do one thing differently today than you would normally do. Take a different route to the store. Stop for a cup of coffee. Go inside instead of the drive thru. Go for a walk. Consider volunteering in some capacity even if just for a day. People get lost in the idea that life is made meaningful through grand gestures when in reality it is smaller choices we make moment to moment. Sincerely, Sometime who change their life at a much older age than you are now.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hfzew6p/"}
