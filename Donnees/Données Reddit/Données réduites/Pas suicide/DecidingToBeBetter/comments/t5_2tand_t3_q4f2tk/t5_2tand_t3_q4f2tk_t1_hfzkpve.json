It's just a game\".\n\nGo make close friends. Go ask a lady out. Go get married. Go get a hobby.\n\nI rejoined school at 27. I made close friends at 28. I started going outdoors at 29. I started going to gym at 29. I started making music at 30. I got married at 32. I bought a PS5 last year and I enjoy gaming. I started to invest (with major losses and decent gains) at 34. I started doing things I felt like doing, and I am not mad at myself for not doing it any earlier, because I didn't have the capacity to do it earlier. I don't care what the society thinks if I sleep my weekends away.\n\nI'm alive. I'm thankful for that alone. I stopped drinking my life away two months ago, and stopped smoking weed along with it. I'm planning to rejoin school and learn things as knowledge really excites me in life.\n\nFind something as mundane as education to pursue your dreams and hobbies.\n\nDepression can be a fucking bitch (I struggle with it daily for a decade), however I know people who don't even have jobs to stand up on, and their depression makes me cry because they cannot keep themselves busy.

Utilize it wisely.\n\nYou can do this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hfzkpve/"}
