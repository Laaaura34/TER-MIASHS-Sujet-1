Partying, having fun, never holding down a real serious job. I didn't find my career until I stumbled upon it thanks to the suggestion of a friend at the age of 30. That led to me finding the sport of bicycling and eventually led to me doing an Ironman at the age of 40. Had my first child at the age of 46. Life is far from perfect. And that is okay. We are sold this idea that life has to be perfect. Real life is messy and unpredictable when you put yourself out there. It's only by putting yourself out there that you live life.\n\nIt doesn't seem like it right now because you're in the middle of it. However, if you don't like the direction in which your life is going now make a YOU-turn.  Therapy is a good start if you're not already doing that. I would imagine since you are on Reddit, you have things that interest you. Find other locals with the same interest. Focus on interests that are either athletic or crafty and avoid things that are controversial. You can find all the controversy you want here on Reddit.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hfzycd5/"}
