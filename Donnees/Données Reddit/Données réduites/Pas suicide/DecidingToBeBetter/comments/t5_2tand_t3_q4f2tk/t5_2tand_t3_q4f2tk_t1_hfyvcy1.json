I\u2019m finally growing up too\u2026.been through so much trauma\u2026like homeless when I graduated high school, had horrible abusive parents\nWho abandoned me\u2026faced addiction, and worse but hey, I\u2019m over that shit now. Some days are hard, but I think of all the things I\u2019m grateful for..and happiness\nIs created, not waited for\u2026life ain\u2019t over til it\u2019s over.  I saw a 80 something year old living his best life the other day with his wife he didn\u2019t marry til he was 65!  So maybe volunteer? Go grab a beer at the brewery, go to a concert, try a meet up, get help for depression. I\u2019m finally on a low dose of Zoloft and i don\u2019t think about killing myself anymore.  It\u2019s such a load off my back\u2026I am into meditation, yoga, Buddhism\u2026there\u2019s happy stuff out there, I promise you!  There is goodness in this world, we just have to go find it.  Opening up is scary as hell, but doing it in small pieces\u2026is where it\u2019s at.  Depression fucking sucks.  And I have to talk to myself and question my thoughts daily. That shit ain\u2019t real.  But it feels real\u2026good luck, I hope you find some joy!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hfyvcy1/"}
