Bro the best advice i can give anyone is DONT GET MARRIED IN YOUR TWENTIES. DO NOT GET MARRIED IN YOUR TWENTIES. DO NOT! \n\nYou don\u2019t know who the Fuck you are in your 20s and you sure dont know who your partner is. Life changes a lot. You are unstable. I knew exactly who I was my whole life\u2026. And then transitioned to a different gender at 26.
