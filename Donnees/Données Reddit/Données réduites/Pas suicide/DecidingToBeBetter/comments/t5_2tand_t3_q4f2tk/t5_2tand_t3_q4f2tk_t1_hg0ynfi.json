We all go at our own pace and have our own path. I just turned 30 this year and it feels like a big number. Aging is scary but one of my goals is to keep myself young at heart as I get older. It isn\u2019t easy with all the pressures of life and comparing to others. I try to say yes to new experiences so it doesn\u2019t feel like things are just stale and boring. It doesn\u2019t have to be anything big either.
