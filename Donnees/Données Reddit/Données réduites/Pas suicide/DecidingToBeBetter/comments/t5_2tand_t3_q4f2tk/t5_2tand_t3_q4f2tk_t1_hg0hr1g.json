However, your life just begins and you can still change at your own pace. Realisation is the first step towards the new you. However, try taking some time, diving deep and listing features you like the most about yourself as you are right now first. Whenever you feel down, just add up one more positive feature to the list to remind yourself that you are worth it and you could achieve something in the past.\nFinding motivation within yourself and being gentle during the process is key. Treat your 20s as a period of realistions and learning, while you can really dedicate your 30s as a period of personal growth on your terms (no one is capable of defining you).\nIt is never too late and it is ok to achieve more in your 40s or 50s or whenever you feel like it.\n\nP.S. I base this point of view on my personal experiences. While there is a lot of pushing to be this and that after hitting 30 by the outside forces, the realisation came that allowing them to define me is not the way to go. It is your life and you have a chance to make something good of it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/hg0hr1g/"}
