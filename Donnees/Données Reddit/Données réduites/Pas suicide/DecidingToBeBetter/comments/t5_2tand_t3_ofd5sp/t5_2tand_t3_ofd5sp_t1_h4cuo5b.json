I was a pack a day smoker for about 10 years, from ages 19-29. I quit daily smoking in 2017, with a few minor relapses here and there every 4-6 months or so (buy a pack, smoke five or so during an evening and throw away the rest, that sort of thing). You are correct, it does get easier, and I hope to completely cut out the \"cheat days\" from here on out.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ofd5sp/i_can_finally_call_myself_a_non_smoker/h4cuo5b/"}
