In the dead of canadian winter with a lockdown so no gym and really no going outside. It's fucking hard to quit smoking, and I had been trying for a few years, with a few different medications, but one worked and I haven't looked back. I mostly quit weed in '12(save for 5 occasions and now I don't look back), and now I'm just done drinking. I spent so many years pumping so many different poisons into my life that I just crave freedom from all of that.\n\nCongrats on your journey quitting smoking, and remember to never stop improving.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ofd5sp/i_can_finally_call_myself_a_non_smoker/h4cuz3c/"}
