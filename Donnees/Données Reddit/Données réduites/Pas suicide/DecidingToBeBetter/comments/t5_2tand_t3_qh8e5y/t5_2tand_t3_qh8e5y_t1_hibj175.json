I recently finished reading The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\\*ck and the final bit about the inevitability of death/time passing really stuck with me. Then the next day I was Skyping with my one good friend and he mentioned his girlfriends birthday was coming up soon. That got me thinking about my own birthdays and how things always felt the same for me. Randomly punched in dates on a website and saw it was 1020 or so days to my 30th birthday. Seemed like a nice symmetrical destination and duration so just started thinking along those lines.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qh8e5y/starting_my_1000_day_project/hibj175/"}
