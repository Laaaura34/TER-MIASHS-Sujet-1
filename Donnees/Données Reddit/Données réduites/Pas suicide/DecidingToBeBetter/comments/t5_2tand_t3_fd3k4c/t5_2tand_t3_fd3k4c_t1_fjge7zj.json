I also love to correct other people but most of the time I just desperately want to participate in the group conversation and tell a cooler story and get attention for my reactions (that I later regret)... I realized that I like to overshare and that sometimes the information is later used against me. \nEven though I already got better (back in highschool people would think of me as loud and annoying) I still want to do better, especially thinking before I speak.\nToday I was quite proud that I didn't join the conversation where my co-workers would talk bad about some people and were quite sarcastic. I would like to have kinder thoughts about other people and more love, rather than jumping at everything that is different from my opinion and making myself feel smarter/better than them. \n\nDo you have any tips that remind you of that, when you're in such situation?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fd3k4c/ive_noticed_myself_getting_a_little_too/fjge7zj/"}
