Most of the time I just feel like I know more stuff than others which isn't necessarily intelligence. This was especially true in like 7-8 grade. I was always good at history/politics and also languages. Whenever someone made just a tiny mistake I would sigh or laugh just loud enough so the one who made a mistake would feel bad. I was such an asshole and also pretty cynical its disgusting tbh. I still kept my kinda cynical humor but I stopped shaming others for not knowing something or making mistakes. I feel so much better since then. I never want to be like i was during that time again.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fd3k4c/ive_noticed_myself_getting_a_little_too/fjfglh9/"}
