I feel that I do. I also think that in parts of the U.S. we really are going downhill with education for our young people, and tv and phones continue the dumbing down and shortened attention spans. Perhaps more mental stimulation would satisfy a part of you that needs fulfillment. You could consider seeking out groups or areas with more educated people. I say \"more educated\" rather than \"smart\" because I believe there are all kinds of intelligence (knowledgeable of facts, street smarts, emotional intelligence, etc.), and I've know some very bright people who never went to college. I find reading groups tend to have very literate people who value learning. This doesn't address your question but perhaps it could be part of your solution.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fd3k4c/ive_noticed_myself_getting_a_little_too/fjfkohr/"}
