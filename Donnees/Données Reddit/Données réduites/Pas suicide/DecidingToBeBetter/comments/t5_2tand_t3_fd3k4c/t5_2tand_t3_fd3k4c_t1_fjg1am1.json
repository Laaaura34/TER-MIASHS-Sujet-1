But the reality is that you do, and not even a few. Every single person you encounter knows something you don\u2019t, is good at something you\u2019re not, is passionate about something, interested in something.\n\nI suggest two things. 1, that you shift your perspective to recognize reality, that not only are you not all-knowing, but also your knowledge could not possibly compare to the knowledge of a world full of others, and that\u2019s why knowledge thrives when pursued in collaboration and 2, that you approach people with the same curiosity that you approach amassing more information (I\u2019m assuming you actively learn about the stuff you talk about instead of just assuming you\u2019re smart and know about it without doing research).\n\nI am one of those calm cool intelligent people you talk about and it\u2019s precisely because I\u2019m just out here trying to learn from everybody. Like Erykah Badu said, \u201cThe man that knows something knows that he knows nothing at all.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the more I learn, the more I realize how much I *don\u2019t* know.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fd3k4c/ive_noticed_myself_getting_a_little_too/fjg1am1/"}
