I believe it stems from feelings of inferiority. We feel inferior to others, so we tell ourselves we are superior and loudly proclaim it to everyone within earshot, to force them to acknowledge us and give us the validation we crave. Then we get irritated when we don't get the acknowledgement we're craving. \n\nI've been meditating on how all of us on Earth are connected and on the same journey (I'm the same as, not better or worse) and practicing [The Inner Smile](https://www.laughteronlineuniversity.com/the-inner-smile-meditation/) (really just the first four steps). Along with deep relaxation while doing Tai Chi, I'm feeling much more comfortable in my skin and not feeling the need to spout off all the time. Best of luck to you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fd3k4c/ive_noticed_myself_getting_a_little_too/fjkc8zt/"}
