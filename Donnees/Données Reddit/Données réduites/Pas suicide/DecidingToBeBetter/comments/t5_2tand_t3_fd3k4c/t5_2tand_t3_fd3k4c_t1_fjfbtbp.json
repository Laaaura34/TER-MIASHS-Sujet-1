The issue with him (and likely you) is that while he was very intelligent, he was lacking in the social skills department. He spent so much time valuing facts and information he ended up skipping learning a lot of key social interactions (or just straight up didn't see or realize what was happening until something smacked him in the face.) \n\nAs an adult with this issue I'd start reading a lot of psychology and sociology books. Focus on relating to others. Instead of focusing so hard on what someone is saying (right or wrong) start trying to figure out what they're trying to accomplish. Are they sharing something because they are excited? Are they trying to relate to you? Why are *you* getting upset? Why is it so important for you to be right?\n\nPeople who are wise and calm can do so because they look at things from multiple angles. It's like knowing the difference between when someone just needs to vent to you and have you agree and sympathies with them, or when someone is coming to you with a problem they need help fixing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fd3k4c/ive_noticed_myself_getting_a_little_too/fjfbtbp/"}
