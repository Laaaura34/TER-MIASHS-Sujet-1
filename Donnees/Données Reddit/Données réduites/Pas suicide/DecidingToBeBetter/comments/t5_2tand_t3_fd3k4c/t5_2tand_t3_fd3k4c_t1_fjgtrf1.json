I\u2019m sure there are plenty of books and videos on the topic, but nothing\u2019s going to remind you you\u2019re human like trying something new and sticking with it long enough to not suck at it. Some things to try are new workout routines or sports, or a new hobby or class.\n\nFor me personally, starting to go to the gym regularly and writing down my lifts and whatnot in a notebook helped. Every few months I\u2019ll look back and see how far I\u2019ve come and it reminds me that I am not hot shit, I used to suck just as bad as the other new kids, and I just happened to stick around long enough to not suck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fd3k4c/ive_noticed_myself_getting_a_little_too/fjgtrf1/"}
