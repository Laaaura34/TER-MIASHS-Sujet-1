Second, my strategy is that I like to visualize that everyone I go I am the owner and I want everyone to have the best experience.  Gym, coffee shop, etc, pretend that you own the place and all you want is for the guests to enjoy themselves while they are there.  You want to look out for them, make sure that they are safe, enjoying themselves.  Eventually you just become someone that is happy when the community is thriving.\n\nThat is the coolest way to think about things, lol.
