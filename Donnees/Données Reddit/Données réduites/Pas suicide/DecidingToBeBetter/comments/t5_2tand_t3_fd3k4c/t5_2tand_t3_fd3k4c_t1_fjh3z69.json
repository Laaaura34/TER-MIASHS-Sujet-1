Often times, I find that the smartest people in the room like to keep quiet when someone else is sharing their ideas. That's likely how they became so smart to begin with, by learning the essential skill of listening quietly to others share their views or understanding of a particular topic and asking questions instead of offering corrections. There is always something to learn from everyone, even if it just learning about how they perceive the world around them. No one has all the answers, and the smartest people learn how to leverage the group's knowledge rather than relying mostly on their own.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fd3k4c/ive_noticed_myself_getting_a_little_too/fjh3z69/"}
