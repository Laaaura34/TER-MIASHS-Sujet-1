Many of us do care about teaching and our students quite a bit.  And many of us went into teaching at CCs specifically so that we could help make an excellent education available to people that might not otherwise be able to obtain one for all kinds of reasons.  We really appreciate the students who value what we do.\n\nOne thing that many people don't know is that CC instructors usually teach a 5/5 load or more.  That means 5 classes a semester, every semester.  At the university I graduated from, professors teach a 1/2 load or a 2/1 load.  That's one or two classes a semester.  The rest of they time is supposed to be devoted to research and service.  That can make them much better teachers or much worse teachers.  But we're expected to do service (serving on committees and other \"volunteer\" contributions to the school)  on top of our 5/5 load.  What that means for students is that if you have to write a 3 page paper and there are 20 students in your class, that means your instructor is probably grading something like 300 pages of papers.  So if we seem run down or we're having a bad day, or we take forever to return an assignment, we're just doing our best too!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pno9qm/i_think_i_actually_like_community_college/hcuq3yd/"}
