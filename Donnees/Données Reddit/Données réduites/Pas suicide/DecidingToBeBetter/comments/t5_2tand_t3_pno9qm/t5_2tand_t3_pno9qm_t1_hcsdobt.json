At a community college, people can take courses that are transferrable to 4yr institutions at a much smaller cost.  They will also offer trade programs like welding, or medical technician programs like dental hygienist or ultrasound tech, which many 4yr schools won't.  They're also a great place to start with a clean slate if a previous attempt at college didn't go so well, because often there are more robust support systems for the population served.\n\nEach kind of school really has a purpose.  CC stigma never made a whole lot of sense to me, but I like that part of my job is helping our students find success and make their desired futures more possible.  Education is a major key to upward mobility, especially for people from working class backgrounds, and low cost CCs help facilitate that like no other kind of college.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pno9qm/i_think_i_actually_like_community_college/hcsdobt/"}
