I am a graduated computer scientist and i wanted you to know that your post made me... Happy... Which is kinda strange isnt it?\nSome people already told you to get motivated by creating projects on your own. This can be kinda hard to think of a project you would like to do. My advice: think of repetitive or boring tasks you do. A programmer is someone who prefers to spend 6 hours of automating a task, instead of 6 minutes doing it manually.\n\n\nAnd something else: I have seen such terrible code, you couldnt imagine. But it was used in a 600 billion dollar company. So yeah, please dont worry about the quality of your code. You got this mate, keep up the good work", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mmt8v7/im_tired_of_quitting_due_to_self_doubt_help_pls/gtvhiyv/"}
