If you've enjoyed it so far I think you should stick with it. A lot of the work of programming is problem solving. Some days the problems will kick your ass, some days you'll do the kicking. \n\nOne thing that can help a lot is explaining the problem you're stuck on to someone. Half the time you'll figure it out while explaining. Another strategy, take a step back and list what you know and what you don't know about the issue. This can often point you in the right direction. And don't be afraid to fail sometimes, especially at the beginning. I've been doing this for 20 years and some problems still kick my ass. Luckily I work on a team and we all have our own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSo my advice - get comfortable with difficult problems and being stuck. Today's unsolvable problem is often tomorrow's easy victory. Or it might take a week of beating your head against the problem to solve it.\n\nWhat really stands out to me in your post is that you enjoyed what you've learned so far and you're motivated to overcome the issue you're running into. Enjoying programming is a pretty good predictor of success in this field, so the odds are in your favor!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mmt8v7/im_tired_of_quitting_due_to_self_doubt_help_pls/gtto7ff/"}
