For ex. new guy invites you over to his house. If you were naive you\u2019d be fine, but it\u2019s within your boundaries to say no. In this instance there is no positive or negative. It\u2019s just you and your boundaries.\n\nOr another example: I hope I will get into this med school, although the acceptance rate is very low. It may be unlikely. But good thing I have different options.\n\nAgain, nothing positive or negative here.\n\nKey is to remain neutral.\n\nLast example: the state of the world as it is is drastic. It\u2019s so sad to see how many people are without food and shelter and basic necessities. Life is very unfair to the even best of people. Although I can\u2019t fix everything, I can do what\u2019s within my power.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfqt69/how_can_i_be_positive_but_not_naive_and_realistic/hb7mczb/"}
