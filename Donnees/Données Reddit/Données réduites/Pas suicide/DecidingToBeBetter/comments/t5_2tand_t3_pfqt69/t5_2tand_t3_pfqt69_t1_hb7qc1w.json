Be skeptical. Be kind.\n\nBeing objective is to see the world or situation as it it and not what it should or could be. It's raining? Sounds bad because it ruins your plans? How about now you get to sleep in and catch up on reading or laundry. Rain helps plants grow so there will be more greenery and it helps makes things cooler. Your emotions will try to influence your perspective but your emotions can be based on old information.\n\nBeing skeptical allows you to enjoy things but when someone tells you something you'll be less likely to believe it and what proof or evidence that is the case. It's the difference between saying \"yes sounds good\" and \"yes but I want to look into it more\". It is used to reserve judgment and actions until you know or understand more.\n\nFinally and most importantly, being kind will help you forgive yourself for the mistakes made and allow you to learn from them. There will always be those who will get one up on ya and so be it. But being kind will allow you to move one and help when you see it happening to someone else.\n\nBest of luck. I hope for the best.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfqt69/how_can_i_be_positive_but_not_naive_and_realistic/hb7qc1w/"}
