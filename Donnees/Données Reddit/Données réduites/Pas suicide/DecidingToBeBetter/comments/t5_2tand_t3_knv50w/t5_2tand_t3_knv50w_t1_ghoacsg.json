Even years after quitting I do occasionally still want to smoke. I think it's more of a habit thing than an actual desire to start smoking again. I was a \"closet smoker\" so I only smoked alone in my car and still reminisce on long drives. I don't miss the taste or the smell or the cost so I remind myself of that.\n\nOP, keep up the good work in the new year! You've gotten through the worst of it, you can handle any surprise cravings you face in the future.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/knv50w/today_i_have_1_year_cigarettefree_i_had_many/ghoacsg/"}
