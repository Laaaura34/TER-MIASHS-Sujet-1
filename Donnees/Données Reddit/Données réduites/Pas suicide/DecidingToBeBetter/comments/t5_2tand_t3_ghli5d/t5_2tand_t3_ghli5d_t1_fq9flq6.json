There\u2019s a multitude of apps available for that too. \n\nMy personal meditation practice is just focusing on my breath, in, out, in, out, in, out. When a though enters my head, I try not to entertain it and switch back to my breath as quickly as I can.\n\nI don\u2019t have any meditation related podcasts that I can suggest but if you just want something interesting to listen to, I really enjoy Radiolab, Hidden Brain and Make Me Smart.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ghli5d/what_are_some_resourcesmethods_i_can_go_to_during/fq9flq6/"}
