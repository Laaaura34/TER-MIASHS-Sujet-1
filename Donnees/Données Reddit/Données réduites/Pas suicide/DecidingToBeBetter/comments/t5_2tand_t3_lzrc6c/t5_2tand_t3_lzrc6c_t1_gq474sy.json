It is better to put in the time to have something else lined up. \n\nOne new place I was moving to, I told them that I had to give the old place two weeks notice. On the Monday I went in, some shit went down where my crappy boss threw me under the bus to save herself. I sent emails proving she knew and quietly packed up my desk. I took my stuff to my car at lunch. I hung out for the afternoon to say goodbye to a few people. I left at end of day with a delayed email saying I quit that went out after I left the building.\n\nI had a very relaxing almost 2 weeks. I never told any coworkers about the new job until after I started it. \n\nAlways try to give yourself a 2 week break before starting a new job.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lzrc6c/i_quit_my_job_and_i_have_no_regrets/gq474sy/"}
