Maybe you can't see this yourself, but from where I'm sitting you have a ton of potential. The changes you're worried about (learning to get away from the house, finding a girlfriend, establishing your own life) could be done in a  matter of months if you're driven to do it. You have a home and savings and a stable income and nobody to else to support, so your life is structurally sound to allow you to make some great changes pretty rapidly.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/edz78u9/"}
