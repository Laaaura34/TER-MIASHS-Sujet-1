You finally did at the very end second to last paragraph. \n\nIf life doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going how you want it to, move and/or get a job in an entirely new country. Challenge yourself. I did it last year, just moved to Europe. It opens your eyes up in a way nothing else could.\n\nAs for not doing well with friends and relationships and MeetUps being a bust: you have to be interested in other people. That\u2019s the bottom line.
