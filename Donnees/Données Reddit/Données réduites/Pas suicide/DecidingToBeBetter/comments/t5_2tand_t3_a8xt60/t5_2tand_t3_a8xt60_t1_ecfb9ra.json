That can give you some real freedom in this situation. What if you took some time off from work to develop some other areas of your life? You could travel a bit, or develop a hobby, or some daily life skills like cooking, spend more time outside, maybe try online dating just for fun, perhaps work with a therapist or life coach. You could even do some kind of volunteer work that make use of your skills. You could experiment with new and different things until you find something that feels like a rewarding way to spend your free time and will hopefully help you meet some people you connect with. I think reading can also be a helpful way to realize some of the many different possible lives you could live if you wanted, and also realize that you're certainly not alone in feeling lost.
