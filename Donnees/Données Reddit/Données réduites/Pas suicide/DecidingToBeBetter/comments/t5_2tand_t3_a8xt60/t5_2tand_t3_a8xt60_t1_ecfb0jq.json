Think of things such as: never setting many rules or boundries, taking care of everything, never pushing you to strive or achieve things and being seen as the \"cool parents\" who are fine with everything? \n\nIf so it may be an explanation as to why you have difficulty with a few of the things that you have mentioned. Look up some articles about over-parenting and the detrimental effects it has on a childs development..\n\nMy recommendation is that you get your ass into therapy and figure out, together with your therapist, what the best course of action is for you. They should be able to help you with all of the things you are struggling with. They are a much better option than asking life advice from strangers.\n\n\n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecfb0jq/"}
