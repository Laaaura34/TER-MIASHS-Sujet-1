With therapists you often get what you pay for, and it sounds like you have enough money sitting around that you can afford a good one. They can help as a sort of life coach, help you notice patterns that you need to stop, break down \"changing your life\" into small manageable steps. \n\nIt is not too late for you! You've missed out on a chunk of time, but you've got a lot of years left. Don't let a sucky 10 years ruin the next 50 years. \n\nAnd I would also stop worrying about what is the \"right\" thing to do to change and find fulfillment. I think the more important thing is that you just do something, anything, out of your comfort zone. It sounds like you've stayed in the comfort zone for a while, and it hasn't done much for you. \n\nOne more thing - fulfillment happens slowly, so don't put pressure on yourself if you don't notice any change after you try something new.
