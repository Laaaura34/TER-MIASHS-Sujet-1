Um no. 30 is still very young and it\u2019s a different world today. All of my 30 year old friends are not even close to getting married. They are finishing up or staring masters programs, focusing on their career etc. I would say if you began dating in your 50\u2019s you\u2019re bound to find a lot of divorc\u00e9e\u2019s with kids, but NOT at 30... sure there will be some people already divorced because they got married too young, or for whatever reason, but 30 is not an old age pool!!! I\u2019d cut yourself a break and just start making small actionable steps to making the changes you want to make. Also, therapy, like now and for at least a few years. You\u2019re not alone whatsoever in your feelings but therapy would help with the depression and deciding exactly how to make changes to change your unhappiness.
