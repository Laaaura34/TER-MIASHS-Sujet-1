Sounds like a long term relationship is a part of that. \n\nYou seem like a smart guy, and I\u2019m sure you can work out a step-by-step plan for getting either or both of those. Start speaking to women, like all the time, no matter where you are. Go and do weird class/group based hobbies and make friends there. You know you can do it.\n\nI\u2019m also a long time atheist-turned-Christian, and I\u2019m not going to try and convert you or convince you to go to Church, but I think everyone needs the sort of grand meaning in their life that religion gives.\n\nMaybe you can find something that will give even the mundane parts of your life tremendous meaning.\n\nOtherwise you don\u2019t have a North Star to orient yourself by, and life just spins out from underneath you.
