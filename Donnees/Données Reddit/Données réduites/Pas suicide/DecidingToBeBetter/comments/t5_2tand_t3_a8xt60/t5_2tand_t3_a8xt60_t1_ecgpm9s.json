You're a human being. You are the answer to someone's prayer. Focus on breathing- inhale for 3 seconds hold for 3 then exhale for 3. Do you exercise? What do you enjoy doing, a hobby? What are you thankful for? If you have a negative thought, switch it to something you are thankful for. Living is not easy.
