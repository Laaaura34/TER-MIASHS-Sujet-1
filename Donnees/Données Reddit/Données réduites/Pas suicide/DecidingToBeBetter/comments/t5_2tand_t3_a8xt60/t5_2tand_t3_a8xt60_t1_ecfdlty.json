It doesn't matter if younger people have experienced more than you or not. Is never too late to start. You're seeing a pattern and you want to take action to change it, that's a huge positive. Don't stop doing things, keep working out and playing music. Don't be hard on yourself, you've worked hard, you've felt a problem and asked for help. Take some time to figure things out. Maybe try some things that take you out of your comfort zone. It's never too late for things to change. It will get better. You're already on the right path by speaking out. I hope this doesn't sound like bullshit, I've had dark times and know they seem never ending when you're there but they do end. Take some time to figure out what you do want. Take a vacation, you might realise you hate travelling or that you want to live in Paris. I hope you find something that helps in the comments.
