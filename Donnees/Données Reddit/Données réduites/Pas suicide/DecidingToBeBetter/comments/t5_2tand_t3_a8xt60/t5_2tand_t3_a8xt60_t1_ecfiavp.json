The isolation is definitely a thing, and can be such an apathetic existence. It seems like you have money though. What I've been doing to stave off life ending boredom is creating arbitrary goals. For example I carved my first stone statue last month, it was decently fun doing so. Another was drive to all the abandoned nuclear sites in WA state, took a week but discovered a few cool places, and was generally fun. So if you have time and money, want to see the grand canyon? Just go there, why not? Buy the person in front of you's lunch and put a smile on their face. Any random shit you can think of that interests you even minimally. I honestly believe me doing this type of stuff has given reason to my life, even if they're arbitrary. It was one of the main factors turning me off of the verge of suicide. \n\nI am 22 however and the lack of romance doesn't bother me very much personally. But human connection wise I've found DnD weekly has honestly been substantial, helps with creativity too. Finding people for it is also easy (almost every game store ive been to has groups)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecfiavp/"}
