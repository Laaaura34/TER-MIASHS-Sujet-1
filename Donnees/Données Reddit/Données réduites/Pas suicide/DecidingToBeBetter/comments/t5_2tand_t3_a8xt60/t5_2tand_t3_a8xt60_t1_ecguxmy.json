I second the idea that you can use this year to save up a bunch of money, but more importantly I would add this: use this year to make yourself the man the girl of your dreams is dreaming of. Focus on improving yourself, and as with everything in life, you do this with *practice.* Join groups or meetups or whatever, even a short conversation with someone at a coffee shop, just practice meeting and talking with people. If you don't click at first it's fine, that's just part of practicing. You'll get better with time, it's not an instant thing, its a process. It's never too late to start. \n\nRemember, you're not alone. There are plenty of people in your same boat.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecguxmy/"}
