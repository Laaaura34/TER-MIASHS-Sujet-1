Have you thought of trying to pursue that? Are you still into electronic music? Have you tried to participate in the electronic music scene and culture wherever you live? I\u2019m 26 and I year ago I decided to quit my job doing something I didn\u2019t like but provided financial stability and start my own production company catering to the electronic music scene that I love. Although money is tighter then before it brought me out of my depression. I wake up everyday doing something I enjoy and it doesn\u2019t feel like work anymore. I get to see the enjoyment my work provides to people and it helps give me purpose. I have never been happier. The company is now growing and I can see that I can make a decent living doing this and I can see my doing it for the rest of my life. By doing this I have also gotten the opportunity to make many new friends people that are all into the same thing I am. Maybe you should take a leap of faith and take a break from your job and pursue a career that you are into. If you have a good savings it should hold you over for a year or two to do what you want to. If it doesn\u2019t work out you can always go back . Now I\u2019m not saying to try and become a famous producer or anything. You should just try and do something that you enjoy and gives you purpose. Maybe develop a new vst plugin for music production or maybe make a sound pack or maybe try starting a company where you teach people to produce music. Just take a chance and try something that you like. Without risk there is no reward. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecg2cto/"}
