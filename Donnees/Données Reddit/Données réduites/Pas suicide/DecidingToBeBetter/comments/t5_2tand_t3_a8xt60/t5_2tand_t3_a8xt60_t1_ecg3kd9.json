This will give you structured time to spend away from your parents house and away from your own empty home. At the same time, it adds fulfillment that you really can\u2019t get anywhere else. Helping others, even in very simple ways, is beneficial for the giver and receiver. Also, you\u2019ll meet other people who may become friends. \n\nI also recommend getting a pet. If it\u2019s practical for your life, adopt a dog (probably not a puppy though). Commit to taking it on walks daily and take it to dog parks or group training classes. This puts you in places where you can make small talk with others who also have a dog. Again, an opportunity to make friends or meet someone you may be interested in. \n\nLast but not least, find a therapist. You\u2019ve done incredible things so far despite the great potential for you to just stay at home and not ever leave. Sometimes it\u2019s a mental check of reminding yourself you\u2019re a badass and thinking of new ways to set realistic goals that will continue to give you fulfillment. \n\nIt sounds a little like your inundated with the thought of being stuck. I have felt that way before too, but the reality is that you have power to change your circumstances. You can\u2019t control it, but you can strongly influence it. Wishing you the best of luck! You sound very capable and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll continue to expand your boundaries and become the person with the life that you want.
