No more judging yourself or your situation. Just because something feels bad doesn\u2019t mean it is bad. You are looking at the society around you (which is just a construct, it really bears no weight in terms of serving as a true reflection of what it means to be human) and saying \u201cthat is right and good and worthy\u201d and comparing yourself to that, seeing the opposite, and saying, \u201cI am wrong and bad and something is the matter with me.\u201d You are here. You are alive. And you are in control. We accept the love we think we deserve. We build the life we want. Sure, we might say, \u201cI don\u2019t want this! That\u2019s crazy!\u201d But it\u2019s so true. We have what we want to have, maybe because on some level we know that where we are is safe and so we keep choosing it again and again. To choose otherwise is terrifying. We say \u201cI tried,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d Well don\u2019t stop trying. If it doesn\u2019t work, make adjustments. Go back to the start and see what you can adjust. Don\u2019t ever, ever stop trying or believing. I can tell you I\u2019ve gotten to a place in my life where I have exactly most of the things I\u2019ve always dreamed of having, but when I started shooting for those things, I had absolutely NO FUCKING IDEA where to start. It was like just throwing rocks into a black hole and hoping one would hit something. I didn\u2019t stop throwing rocks. Don\u2019t stop throwing rocks. Don\u2019t judge yourself when a rock doesn\u2019t hit something: it\u2019s not good or bad. It\u2019s just a thing. It also helped me to remember that there are people all over the world who have the things I wanted, and they aren\u2019t special. They aren\u2019t. They really aren\u2019t. I would often remind myself that \u201cYou miss 100% of the shots you don\u2019t take\u201d and \u201cLuck is when preparation meets opportunity.\u201d You make that happen by not giving up. There are certainly things we cannot control but we can control what we *do.* We can control our actions. We can prepare. And if you just keep throwing those rocks, \u201cpreparing\u201d, \u201cdoing\u201d, you\u2019ll hit something. Maybe you feel like you\u2019ve tried everything to give yourself the life you want. So don\u2019t stop. And while you wait, while you\u2019re throwing those rocks, be sure to take time to do the things that make you happy: gaming, music. It can take a long time to hit something but you will. It\u2019s not that others are luckier than you. Maybe they had some kind of advantage. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still win.\n\n2.) Therapy. This is one thing you can do right now. Forget everything else. Let it go. Don\u2019t judge the state of your life. Just let it all go. And focus on this one thing: go to therapy. Use psychology today\u2019s therapist search engine to find one that works for you. Go on 2-3 or more therapist \u201cinterviews\u201d and go with the one you click with or that your instincts draw you to. Focus on that one thing: just making the appointments and going. Every week or more. Don\u2019t focus on trying to get more friends or a girlfriend or moving out. Let that go. That\u2019s not your job right now. Go to therapy and let that therapist help you. You do not have to go through this alone. \n\nSo many good vibes to you my friend.  There is no end game here. There will always be something more that you want, no matter what you accomplish, that is okay. That is normal and healthy. You\u2019ll find a house to move into and something will break or you\u2019ll want to be able to afford renovations. You\u2019ll get a girlfriend or maybe get married and then something in that relationship will change or break and you\u2019ll have to work on that. There will always be something, and that is beautiful and safe and okay. And so normal. There will be long stretches of amazing times with bumps that come and go and you\u2019ll overcome them and be better for them. You\u2019ll get the things you\u2019re wanting right now and you\u2019ll have the gift\u2014a gift so few people get to have\u2014of appreciating those things with a magic that makes them better and more amazing, a magic that inspires others and makes the world a better place for it.\n\nPeople like you and I, people who had to fight so fucking hard for the things they wanted and needed in life, usually without a roadmap, have something EXTRA special we get to give to this world. It\u2019s all packaged in that deep appreciation for accomplishing things.\n\nFinally, don\u2019t ever let someone tell you to \u201cnot look back.\u201d Look the fuck back so you can come back to the moment and see how you\u2019ve changed. You can start that today. \n\nBut please please find a therapist. And once you do, don\u2019t ever quit going. Commit to that hour or two every week. Commit to that. Even when you don\u2019t want to. Even when you feel too busy. That\u2019s your medicine. If you were told you needed to take a medicine every day for an indeterminate amount of time in order to save your life or cure a disease or heal something, you would take it. Even if it was an infusion of something every week for an hour at a hospital that sometimes was painful and sometimes just blah and nothing and sometimes felt really good, you\u2019d go. Therapy is your medicine. You can do this. \n\nIn fact, by making this post, you ARE doing it. You\u2019re throwing a rock. You are doing it. Look at yourself reading these comments. You\u2019re here and doing it right now. Maybe it feels bad, maybe it feels good. But regardless you are doing it and you can keep doing it. You wouldn\u2019t have spent the time making this post if you couldn\u2019t do it. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecgkdwk/"}
