I apologize if anything I say is a repeat of other comments. I\u2019m so glad that so many others are reaching out! I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019ve so many social and emotional struggles.  \nIt seems as though you may be in a good place financially to plan a trip. Not a vacation, but like a get out of the country and travel sort of thing. \nOr what about traveling the country in a car or wind stream? Could you work from anywhere or are you tied down? Could you save and find a job? It appears that maybe a change of scenery and some distance between yourself and  your family may do you some good. Adventure is there! Being a loner isn\u2019t a bad thing, if you traveled you could see so many things and meet people in passing but not feel the pressure to keep in touch and report so to speak. \nAt the end of the day you have to be comfortable with yourself and where you\u2019re going! Don\u2019t worry about your sister ( who\u2019s probably lashing out in love) and your parents thoughts. Make your opinion of yourself first priority  and then consider the rest of the world. \nIf you\u2019re open to the idea find a counselor with whom you mesh to work out the emotional side and the thought processes. \n30 is by no means the end of your life! It\u2019s still beginning!  Don\u2019t let your age define you. I did for awhile but finally stopped  and went back to school for nursing and am currently set to graduate in May! \nIt only takes one move bravely forward at a time, don\u2019t look backwards, just look at each next step. \nPeace and Love to you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecfwqis/"}
