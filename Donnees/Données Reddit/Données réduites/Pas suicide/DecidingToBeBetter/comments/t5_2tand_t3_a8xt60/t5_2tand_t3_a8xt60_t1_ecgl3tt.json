Actually becoming friends with some people has been absolutely monumental for me. Nothing worked better for my self esteem than being accepted by other people. Meetups can be difficult to make friends in. Most people go there to learn skills. Although if you continue going to similar meetups you'll start seeing same people and then it's easier to get to know each other. I met most of my closest friends through work. \n\nIt also sounds like you go over to your parents' place a lot out of boredom/loneliness.\n\nI'm from Chicago, too. Don't want to be creepy but I'm always down for having more friends! I'm a software developer too, although I actually really like my job. We could get a beer or some other beverage of your choice if you don't drink and explore what Chicago has to offer. Even small changes in your routine could be helpful.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecgl3tt/"}
