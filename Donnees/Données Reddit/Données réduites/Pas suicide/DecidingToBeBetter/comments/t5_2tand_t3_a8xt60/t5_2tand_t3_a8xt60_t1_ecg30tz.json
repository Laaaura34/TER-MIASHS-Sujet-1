That's it. You desperately need space and time away from them.\n\nMy recommendation: martial arts. Of any kind. You'll be extremely uncomfortable, intimidated, and embarrassed. Then, slowly, over time, you will gain competence, confidence, independence, and respect for yourself.\n\nBut, you just need to start doing *something* to break out of the habits and rut you're in, and get space from your dysfunctional family.\n\nYou'll hate it at first. And it will be super uncomfortable. That's what you need.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecg30tz/"}
