One personal thing that helped me with devolving friendships was joining local groups. Our local college had a few clubs I was interested in that I started attending regularly. I didn\u2019t make friends at first, but over time I ended up befriending a few great people there. Even before I made friends there, making myself go out and socialize did wonders for my mental health.\n\nLook for groups in your area about things you\u2019re interested in and MAKE yourself attend regularly.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecg31zy/"}
