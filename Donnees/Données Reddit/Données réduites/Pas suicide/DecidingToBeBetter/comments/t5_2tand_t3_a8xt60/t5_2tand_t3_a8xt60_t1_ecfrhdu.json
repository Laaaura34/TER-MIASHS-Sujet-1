You have nothing to lose. Your parents will still be there for you when you return (if YOU decide to). \n\nCan you speak any other languages? Buy a one way ticket to a country that intrigues you and bounce around, stay at a bunch of hostels. You'll meet some English speakers if you're concerned about language barriers and this will give you a new perspective on life. Look into central America, south east Asia or Europe and go. In the mean time while you research and sell your shit, volunteer in your town and stay healthy. Your situation can improve, don't do anything to harm yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecfrhdu/"}
