I got burned out from the career I took out of desperation straight out of college, after putting in four years and getting laid off. Financially I'm in a shitty situation, basically going to be starting at square one once I cash out what I can to pay off debts. I know money doesn't create happiness but you did make good decisions for yourself financially and you should be proud of that. I saw something about millenials who lived at home are coming into their spending power right about now. A lot of people aren't married, and frankly when it comes to women it's pretty attractive for a guy to be financially stable and secure. I second the suggestion of taking kind of an adventure for yourself, spend as many bucks as you feel comfortable pulling out of your savings but really get out and do those experiences that interest you. I've had some mixed experiences with that. If you do try it out be careful because some people on those apps can be weird/shady. You yourself don't sound like a weird guy, I think a lot of people our age feel kind of lost and purposeless. Just don't give up hope. You have a lot going for you, even though I know you don't feel like it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecfo4nw/"}
