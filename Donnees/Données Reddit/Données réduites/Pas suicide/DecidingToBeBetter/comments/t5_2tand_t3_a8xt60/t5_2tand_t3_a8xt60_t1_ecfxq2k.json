You're good at getting jobs, so there shouldn't be the fear of walking away from a career you've invested your life into. Go see things, meet people, experience life. Use Couchsurfing and hostels to supplement your savings. Hike, camp, wander, breathe, unplug. It will feel uncomfortable at first to be away from technology, but you can have a lifeline. I carry portable solar panels on my pack so that I can always get online if I really need to. The first week or so you'll reach for it every time you stop, but after a bit you'll lose interest. Play your guitar for dinner in a random country. Fix someone's computer in exchange for a bed to sleep in. Interact one on one.
