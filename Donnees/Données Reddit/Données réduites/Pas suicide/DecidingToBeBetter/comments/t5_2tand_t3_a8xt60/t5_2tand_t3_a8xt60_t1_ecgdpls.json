You have a kickass hobby that is a real skill, making music. You just need to be around people and make them listen to it. You are financially very secure and do not have to worry about it. Many people your age are still in the informal economy and in very low paying jobs, living paycheck to paycheck. You also go to the gym.\n\n\nI would suggest stop trying to socialise with people your own age (28 plus) and try to socialise with college aged people. You will have a real edge and trust me, you will build that social circle. You sound like a guy who can become crazy popular with some self belief and a few months of work. \n\nA girlfriend will follow soon enough once you start socializing enough. Because you are an inherently interesting person because of your music skills.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a8xt60/30_years_old_no_friends_never_had_a_relationship/ecgdpls/"}
