Because what your father said and told to you was totally not okay. And now that you had relationships that confirmed what your father told you made it reality, you have this idea of \"all men are the same\" and you hate them for it (i don't blame you for it).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Whenever I'm attracted to someone new, I try to take it slowly & see how they are as a person.\n\nWhat stikes me the most from your post is this line, it's sounds like you've done this more than once and saw that it is not working. So just take the line and adjust your approch a bit different. I'm sure you heard the saying from people with successful marriages \"it feels like being married to my best friend\". And I think that is what you need right now, find yourself a friend first see what happens. Expose yourself more to the things your love and enjoy and where you have to meet new people. Even if the \"one\" isn't there you might actually find new platonic male friends that show you there more different types of men out there.\n\nDon't try to force it by changing yourself to appeal to someones interest or changing it to expose yourself to more people. For now keep living yourself to fullest, that you actually enjoy and with people that can enjoy it with you: old & new, platonic or romantic.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fh707i/how_to_stop_resenting_men_because_of_abusive/fk9h757/"}
