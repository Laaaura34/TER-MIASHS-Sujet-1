My father was a sociopath. He cheated on my mom the entire time they were together, was physically abusive, domineering and emotionally absent. He ended up leaving our family to start a new one when he got too bored.\n\nI never resented men, but I feared them. I believed that they would all inevitably cheat on me or abandon me like my dad did. What changed is when I realized that my belief was less about men and more about me. I had developed a core beliefs that I was not good enough. I didn't believe that all men were cheaters, what I actually believed was that I did not deserve love, because if I wasn't good enough for my dad, why would I be good enough for anyone else?\n\nI'm sure you've heard the quote \"we accept the love we think we deserve\". Maybe that's why you're attracted to Playboy's and jerks?\n\nI've worked on myself ever since, I love myself. I have a boyfriend who is my best friend in the entire world and my soulmate. changing your core beliefs is hard. It takes a lot of persist and a strict \"mental diet\".
