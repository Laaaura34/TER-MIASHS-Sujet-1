And forgiveness is not saying what your Dad and exes did is ok, rather it is a final act of love and mercy even when undeserving. Forgiveness is a process, day in and day out. When you come upon that memory or similar feeling you previously encountered within those abusive relationships, choose forgiveness and recognize that this may not be the same scenario. I would also encourage you to cultivate a curiousity toward these thoughts and feelings rather rather than criticism of yourself. Continue this, and one day you will realize you have grown and if you can remember the past without it making you cry, then you know you have moved on.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fh707i/how_to_stop_resenting_men_because_of_abusive/fk9spe8/"}
