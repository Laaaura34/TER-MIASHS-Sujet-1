If you can talk about your boundaries w/ men you encounter, this is a way to find trust, IMO. Say you want to chat and go for a walk, fine, but you don't want him to come over to your house yet. Tell him so, however kindly but in no uncertain terms, and if he tries to get across the threshold, wish him a good night and never again. Set up your boundaries and you're giving yourself an opportunity to observe them at a safe distance, so to speak.    \n\nAnd if you do meet someone you maybe like, talk about non-consensual relationships. Explain how you feel about them seeing someone else without consulting you first (or vice-versa). For me, if someone is not up for this, it might not be wise to get too close to them. Cheaters can hurt you emotionally and they can also get you sick or put you in uncomfortable or dangerous social situations.    \n\nIDK, these are just my thoughts. I'm not a therapist. I'm a straight male presenting person, so take it with a grain of salt I guess.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fh707i/how_to_stop_resenting_men_because_of_abusive/fka42wj/"}
