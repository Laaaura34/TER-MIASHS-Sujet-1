Telling people they all have the same time in a day is not true. The person with a car who travels the same distance as someone who takes the bus can spend 15 minutes instead of one hour. Someone who has to work multiple jobs to support their children does not have the same as someone with 1. Someone who can order in food, have groceries delivered, have a house cleaner has more time than the chef, the shopper, the maid.\n\nTime = money. People with more money have more time and to say otherwise is classist. \n\nThanks!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/klfvfx/this_moment_now_76/gh90124/"}
