I allowed my family to talk me out of dropping out, and it was one of the worst mistakes in my life.  \n\nAll those things you mentioned that you want to avoid, were part of my life, because of my student debt.  \n\nCollege isn\u2019t worth it unless you know exactly what you\u2019re there for. Sounds like you do, and you\u2019ve worked as a normal human for a while.  \n\nI wish I had done what you\u2019re doing: graduated HS and just lived a normal life for a while, then started with community college, and done my education with a solid vision in place.  \n\nHS -> straight to -> college is one of the most dangerous paths a person can take, IMO.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o9y42t/after_dropping_out_twice_im_going_back_to_college/h3gdr6j/"}
