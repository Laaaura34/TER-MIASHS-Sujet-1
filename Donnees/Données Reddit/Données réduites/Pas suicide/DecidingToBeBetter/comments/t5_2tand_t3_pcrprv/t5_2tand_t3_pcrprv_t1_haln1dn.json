Knowing that you don't want to be like your dad is a HUGE first step, and if you're starting at 14 you have tons of time to practice.\n\nCan you take a second in an argument before you answer to consider if the response you were going to give is all around best?   Just do one slow breath?  That tends to help a lot.   \n\nCan you practice stress tolerance?  This one might be best with a professional, because it's important to keep it from being torturing yourself-that isn't the point.   The point is to learn that this thing that seemed so stressful and needing to be attacked won't kill you.\n\nIf you can now, or when you reach majority for sure, can you look at therapy?   That's the best long term solution, but I'm not sure about your situation.  \n\nI wouldn't take that one sentence to be the be all and end all proving that your future is written in stone-you've got plenty of time to change it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcrprv/i_am_scared_i_am_abusive_or_going_to_be_in_future/haln1dn/"}
