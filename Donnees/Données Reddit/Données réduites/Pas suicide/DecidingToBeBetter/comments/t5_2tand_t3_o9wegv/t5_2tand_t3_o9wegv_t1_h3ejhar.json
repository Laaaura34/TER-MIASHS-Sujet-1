I definitely need to work on this mindset mainly because I have always struggled with listening to others and taking their opinions and basically do what I am told. This restricted me from dressing the way I wanted to, thinking people might dislike me for weird reasons, and worry about the way I present myself.\n\n I want to change though. I am glad you brought this up because it made me think about myself and how I struggle with this.
