Though, just from what I read I could see that your girlfriend means a lot to you. You have the self awareness to put the pieces of your story and your reactions together. That\u2019s huge! There\u2019s so much power in being able to take a step back, reflect, and redirect your energy in trying to find a solution. YOU have the power to choose how you will react, how you will speak, and what you could do moving forward. I honestly really believe that because you have this self awareness, you\u2019ll be even more compassionate, calm, and kind. As you said, you had to survive throughout these experiences. It\u2019s really not easy going through life feeling like you\u2019re walking on eggshells. I think what has helped me as I also have had a sort of similar situation is recognizing when I feel discomfort, mainly in my nervous system. I get tense, anxiety ( a lot less now), and I want to react without being mindful as to how it would affect the receiver. If anything, let your girlfriend know how it makes you feel and that although youll slip up sometimes (because you\u2019re HUMAN), that you still care about her and that you\u2019re trying to be more mindful overall. \n\nBest of luck, OP. Props for going on that walk, thinking, and writing this post. You obviously really care. You should be really proud of how far you have come. Im just a stranger on the internet, but I am proud of you. Definitely seek therapy as it is best to get an external view and help you process. It\u2019s hard work, but good work.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfd7oj/insecurities_and_relationships/hi0195c/"}
