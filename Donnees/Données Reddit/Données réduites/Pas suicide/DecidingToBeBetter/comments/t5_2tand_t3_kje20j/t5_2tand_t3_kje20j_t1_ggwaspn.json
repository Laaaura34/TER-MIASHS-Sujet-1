I suffer from intense bouts of depression, anxiety and I believe I may also have ADHD (soon to be diagnosed) so it is incredibly difficult for me to stick to any routine or habit but I just have had enough of my own excuses. My self loathing is unimaginable and I find every possible way to hate myself and I knew that if I could stick to just ONE thing I would feel immensely better about myself. I think the only reason I stayed on this long is simply because I wanted a reason to feel good about myself. My only advice is that to keep going even if you stop. If you forget a week, it's alright, time to get it started again. Don't beat yourself up about it! Best of luck to you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kje20j/i_worked_out_every_single_day_for_3_weeks/ggwaspn/"}
