I didn't care if I only did 5 or 10 mins of walking or half an hour of jogging (with lots of breaks in between) as long as I did something rather than nothing. Those tiny habits in the beginning helped me a lot in gaining momentum. I believe starting super easy was the right choice for me. I knew I wouldn't enjoy squatting or lunges or planks when I first started because I had no strength and it would demotivate me immediately. \n\nOnce I started going for the walks, I began to do slow jogs on the treadmills then once I got the hang of that I made small goals like hitting a certain distance then after that I made another small goal which led me to wanting to do more harder things like bodyweight exercises but again, I gave myself small goals to focus on. 10 reps of wall push ups, 10 reps of curtsy lunges, 10 reps of whatever was next. I didn't really enjoy these since I don't like working out but I was determined to enjoy it so I push through every day. It's not easy I can tell you that but I guess I so badly wanted it hence why I made the change. If I didn't want it then I wouldn't have done anything at all. I hope this helps you somehow. Keep working on it, it'll be worthwhile.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kje20j/i_worked_out_every_single_day_for_3_weeks/ggwettm/"}
