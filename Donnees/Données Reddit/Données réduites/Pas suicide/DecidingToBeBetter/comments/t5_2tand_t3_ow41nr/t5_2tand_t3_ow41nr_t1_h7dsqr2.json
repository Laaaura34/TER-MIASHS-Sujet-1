That's not a bad thing. I was in the same boat about not knowing what to do and not wanting to be there, but my family was paying for it in advance so that I'd have to go. If I could start over I'd take a break and get to know what I wanted. I didn't realise what it was until I had already graduated. If I could go back I would wait until I knew myself a bit more. It also took a few shitty jobs to convince me I at least didn't want to do those for the rest of my life haha.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ow41nr/how_can_i_be_openminded_about_premed/h7dsqr2/"}
