You are so deserving of good things and you are definitely deserving of love (especially from yourself). It won't happen overnight. You have to put in the work, for yourself. You will have bad days but it's okay. It won't last unless you let it. Being vulnerable isn't a bad thing! At all. But I really do wish you the best on this journey! All this - everything you have to do - it's worth it. You are worth it, so put time and energy into yourself! You can get to a place you want to be and you will, as long as you don't give up on yourself. You got this!
