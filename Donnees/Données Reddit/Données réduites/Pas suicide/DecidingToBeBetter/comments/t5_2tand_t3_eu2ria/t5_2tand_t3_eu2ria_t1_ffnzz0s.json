[Swerve](https://swervesweet.com/) and [Anthony's](https://www.anthonysgoods.com/products/anthonys-erythritol-granules-crystalline?variant=1501585987) are both pretty great sugar substitutes made of erythritol. And you can then look up recipes for syrups which is great to add to carbonated water, especially great if you have a SodaStream. Or you could try finding no-calorie sugar-free syrups and mixes like MiO or crystal light and adding that to the carbonated water.\n\nBut I will say the longer you stay away from soda, the easier it gets.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eu2ria/2_days_without_soda_and_4_days_of_at_least_take/ffnzz0s/"}
