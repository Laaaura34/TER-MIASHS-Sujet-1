I think the anger that you feel is anger with yourself for not doing differently. Maybe it comes from low self-esteem (\"I'm not worthy of them, I better remove myself before I hurt them any more\", or maybe it's an avoidance tactic because you're afraid of rejection.) and in that way, you could hurt people again. For your relationship this is not really a good tactic, but understandable and changeable.\n\nI think (and this is for me as well) is that you should start with creating self-esteem by less criticism to yourself and more praise to yourself (check out Marisa Peer).  \nSecond, try to lean into your fear. Your fear is trying to tell you something. \"Take action\".  \nFear can mean two things, \"Forget Everything And Run or Face Everything And Rise\". I'd prefer the latter.\n\nThere's a lot information about these things on the internet, the main thing that you cannot download is courage. The courage to do what you heart tells you to do.\n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0dc9a/i_am_having_a_very_hard_time_setting_my_ego_aside/hf8pn7j/"}
