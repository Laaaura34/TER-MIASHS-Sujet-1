Some people practice saying positive things in front of a mirror but I tend to forget so just catching these negative one word descriptions of myself has helped a lot. If I have a thought that I am a failure, I usually take a step back and observe the full truth. \n\nSo I\u2019ll think, \u201cI\u2019m such a failure,\u201d and then reflect on that thought with \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to get a job offer after college and all of my friends have. I am feeling down because I am comparing my progress to others. I have proven that I have knowledge in my field and graduating college IS a big accomplishment in itself.\u201d Then I ask myself if I\u2019ve put in all my effort. If I have, my positive affirmation would be, \u201dI am doing my best\u201d or \u201cI am capable of obtaining a job because I\u2019ve done x, y, z.\u201d If there\u2019s more I can do, I can say, \u201cWhat I can do is seek advisors so that I can practice interviews and get feedback or have my resume reviewed.\u201d My positive affirmation would be, \u201cI seek help when I need it so I am always making progress toward my goals.\u201d \n\nBasically, I bring forth why my statement of being a failure isn\u2019t completely true, identify what more I can do, then come to a conclusion that is more accurate of my current situation (recognizing my efforts).  Some folks may have a different way of utilizing positive affirmations but this is my thought process. Most of the time, my positive affirmations are not the direct opposite of my negative thought. In my example, I guess someone could say, \u201cI am successful because of x, y, and z,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t address what\u2019s causing me to feel like a failure at the moment.
