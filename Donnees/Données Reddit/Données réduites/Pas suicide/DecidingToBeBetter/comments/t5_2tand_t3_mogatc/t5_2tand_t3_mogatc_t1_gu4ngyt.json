I began saying things that were more true and not so black and white. You used the word \u201clazy\u201d \u201closer\u201d and \u201cunreliable\u201d but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an accurate description of yourself. Youve obviously put in a ton of hours trying to better yourself so you are not lazy! Im sure you\u2019re exaggerating with the other words too. It\u2019s time to say things that are more accurate..maybe like, \u201cI am trying my best,\u201d \u201cI help those around me,\u201d \u201cI do a good job at work,\u201d or \u201cI have courage to ask for help.\u201d And don\u2019t force statements that you might not believe. I never use statements like \u201cI am perfect\u201d because I don\u2019t believe that. I don\u2019t know if this helps but if you were someone that I knew, I would be saddened to hear you call yourself these things.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mogatc/ive_been_trying_to_not_be_a_lazy_loser_for_years/gu4ngyt/"}
