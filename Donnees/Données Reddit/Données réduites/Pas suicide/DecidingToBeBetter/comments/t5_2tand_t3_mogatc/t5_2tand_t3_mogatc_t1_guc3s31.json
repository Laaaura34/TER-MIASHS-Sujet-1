Instead, find and watch a short Youtube video about the book - maybe a review or summary. Or read a short article about it. That way, you'll get to know the most important idea(s) inside the book. If it resonates with you, read a few more articles or just read the book. If it doesn't resonate with you, then that's fine too; it probably won't be very beneficial for you.\n\nI like this approach because like you, I also get book recommendations and put off reading them. When I just commit to watching a short video or reading a short article about the book first, I can very quickly get to know whether I think the book will be worth my time right now.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mogatc/ive_been_trying_to_not_be_a_lazy_loser_for_years/guc3s31/"}
