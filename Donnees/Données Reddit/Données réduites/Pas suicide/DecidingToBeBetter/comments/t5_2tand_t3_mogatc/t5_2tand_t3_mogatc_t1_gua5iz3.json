I've watched Matt D'Avella do his 30 days challenges on YouTube and always wondered how beneficial things like this could be. And those smaller 7-day challenges are brilliant, it breaks the day-to-day and promotes discovering new things while working towards improvement.\n\nAs for holding each other accountable, I've been looking at r/EruditeClub exactly for those reasons and because of their format (new self-improving practices every month) but I find the general lack of engagement a little disheartening and not very motivating. (Just realized they have a Discord though lol)\n\nAll this to say, I'm always open to people to share this journey with!\n\nThanks for sharing!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mogatc/ive_been_trying_to_not_be_a_lazy_loser_for_years/gua5iz3/"}
