Is it journaling? In front of the mirror? Silently/cognitively while commuting?\n\nAlso, do you have a way to make yourself diligent about this practice?\n\nA lot of sources seem to say it's very good psychological practice, just have a hard time implementing something like this that I'll stick to, especially considering how many options there are out there haha. My mind has a big tendency to go back to default.\n\nThanks for your insight!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mogatc/ive_been_trying_to_not_be_a_lazy_loser_for_years/gu9wx7b/"}
