But yeah, there's really something compelling about your story. I can see how something like finding a really compelling aspiration could happen.\n\nYou mentioning that lady walking through the Sahara touches my desire for adventure too lol; I saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAeZ-HSFdTw) of two guys hijacking a train through the most western part of the desert and I've been thinking about those images ever since. Hey, maybe I should go pay a visit to my Maghrebi relatives.\n\nThank you for your encouragements. And congrats on pursuing those challenges! Marathon people have always been insanely impressive to me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mogatc/ive_been_trying_to_not_be_a_lazy_loser_for_years/gua7482/"}
