I try to take full responsibility for my situation, so it's hard not to focus the blame on myself. It's really hard to find the middle-ground between self-indulgence and self-flagellation. \n\nI'm actually doing gen-ed. classes again to go into engineering some time next year, so your encouragements are most welcome! \n\nAs for therapy, it didn't do much for me. I took me too long to realize that talk therapy really wasn't doing it. I'll try and go back to find CBT for people with ADHD eventually once my finances are somewhat in order. Just looking for ways to cope until then.\n\nThank you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mogatc/ive_been_trying_to_not_be_a_lazy_loser_for_years/gu9rxpo/"}
