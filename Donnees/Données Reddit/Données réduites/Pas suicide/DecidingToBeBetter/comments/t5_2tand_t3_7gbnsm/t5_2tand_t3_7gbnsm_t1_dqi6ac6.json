Something that I have found can help a little bit to feel grateful is to practice it every day - saying out loud (or in your head, or writing down) what you have and what you are grateful for. Like shelter, food, life, knowledge, the opportunity to learn, freedom, the ability to travel, good memories, and other things like that. It's not that convincing the first time, but I bet if you do it every morning and every evening with whatever comes to mind, you'll feel a bit better. \n\nI have no good advice for what to do about your friends and family. I'm sure you're mostly aware of their reasons for distancing themselves. Hopefully you have some ideas about how you might change things in this area, which may take some time. I believe in you!\n\nAll the best to you. \n\nSome guy in England. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7gbnsm/anyone_else_screw_up_your_life_like_me/dqi6ac6/"}
