In my case, it was credit card debt. I'm still not out of it, but I'm getting there. I will tell you this: sure, things are tough, but the truth is, you're luckier than a helluva lot of people out there. Focus on that, don't dwell on the negative or the things you cannot change.\n\nI remember that when I lived in LA without a car, I would often encounter chatty working-class folk at bus and subway stops. They're real hard-luck cases, we got nothing on these guys. One Hispanic dude worked crazy long hours in a kitchen, getting drunk on his off hours, and barely making ends meet to support his family.\n\nYou're in a hole, but it's hardly an impossible situation. Focus on crawling your way out. Set your sights on the prize. Life sucks right now? Huh, well, you can take it. Coz it can get better, if you put your heart into it. Be a fighter. Be a champ. Failure is part of life. You don't let it get you down forever. You pick yourself up, you learn from the past, you move on and you get to work on fixing your life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7gbnsm/anyone_else_screw_up_your_life_like_me/dqhyeiv/"}
