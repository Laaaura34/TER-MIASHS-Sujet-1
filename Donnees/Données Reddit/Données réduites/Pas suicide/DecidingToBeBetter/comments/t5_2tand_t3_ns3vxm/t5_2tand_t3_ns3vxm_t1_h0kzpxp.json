Pick someone you admire who isn\u2019t a workaholic and is willing to have you nearby a lot.  \n\nYou have taught yourself to be miserable, and as Yoda said, you must unlearn what you have learned.\n\nWatch how that person interacts with others and how they give themselves joy.  Choose activities, pastimes, and occupations because you ENJOY them; not to \u201cachieve\u201d something.  \n\nThe sooner you find these new things that please You and You Only, the faster the misery will pass.  And you won\u2019t care what other people think.  And you will be fulfilled.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ns3vxm/i_want_to_feel_proud_of_myself/h0kzpxp/"}
