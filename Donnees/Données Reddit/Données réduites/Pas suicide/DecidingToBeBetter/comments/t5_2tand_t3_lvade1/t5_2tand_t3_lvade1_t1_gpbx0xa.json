As someone who\u2019s dealt with anxiety/depression for most of my life, that\u2019s obviously easier said than done, but reaffirming that I am a good person and I am not intentionally doing harm is a big help for me. Also, reframing your thoughts. Change \u201cI\u2019m failed\u201d to \u201cthis is good but I can do better\u201d \u201cI\u2019m such an asshole\u201d to \u201cI can work on being more pleasant\u201d things of that nature. Basically if you allow yourself negative thoughts you are falling into confirmation bias every time you meet that expectation of yourself, rather than allowing yourself to grow, you keep yourself weighed down by your doubts and thoughts. I can\u2019t say that I always get this right, but I try and catch myself when I don\u2019t act the way I would like to. Also, don\u2019t compare yourself to other good people. Like you\u2019re on social and see someone doing a good thing and you think you\u2019re not a good person because you\u2019re not doing the same thing. Comparisons are so toxic for your mental health, remember that people only show you what they want you to see on social media. You have to do the things that make you feel accomplished as an individual and as a good person. Do what you can, \u201cchange what you can\u2019t accept, and accept what you can\u2019t change\u201d. A good book that helped me focus on myself and my actions was \u201cThe Power of Now\u201d by Eckhart Tolle. He has a good method of getting you to focus on yourself and the present moment, and letting go of the tensions of the past and future. Highly recommend it. Hope this helps you on your journey and know that just making this post, reflecting on yourself and trying to be better are steps of a well-rounded, empathetic, mindful, good person.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lvade1/realizing_my_toxic_traits/gpbx0xa/"}
