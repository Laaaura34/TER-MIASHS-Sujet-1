My entire childhood I was doted after by my siblings, I was the cute little sister that they brought with them everywhere (mostly bc they had to as they were my babysitters lol). Now I am in my mid twenties and all of my friends are in the 30s-40s. I feel comfortable with them rather than people my own age as I was surrounded by older siblings my entire life and I am still putting myself in the situation as the \u2018youngest\u2019 one, the one who\u2019s still \u2018learning\u2019, the one who needs to be \u2018protected\u2019 even in my relationship as I am ten years younger than my partner. I also recently moved in with him and find myself doing exactly what you have described. I never even recognized that I did this until I began living with my partner. Thank you for posting this, I feel less alone in this struggle!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lvade1/realizing_my_toxic_traits/gpd1we6/"}
