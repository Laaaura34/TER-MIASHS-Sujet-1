It was so scary when I started realizing how flawed I was; for me too, the awareness started when I began dating and moved in with my current partner of 10 years. The most important thing I\u2019ve learned to do since gaining awareness of my flaws is to pause before speaking when I\u2019m feeling very emotional. This has helped me with my partner, my family of origin, at work. I empathize with being terrified by the gap between who you are and who you thought you were/who you want to be. I hope that you can channel that energy into growth, not unproductive self-deprecation. All the best in your journey.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lvade1/realizing_my_toxic_traits/gpd3yym/"}
