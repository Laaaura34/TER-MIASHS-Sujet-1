I love them, and it\u2019s how I\u2019ll learn to love myself and be less hard on myself. It\u2019s ok for them to splurge on a fancy pint of ice cream for themselves, in fact I\u2019d encourage it sometimes. But when I do it for myself I beat myself up about wasting money and eating unhealthy. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve once allowed myself that pleasure guilt-free, I don\u2019t think I deserve it. I find the more I restrict myself from certain behaviors, the more I think of them and want to do them. If I give myself room for that side of me (which is very real no matter how much I deny it and don\u2019t want it to be) it is showing myself love and grace. And in turn the love fills me with the desire to not even crave the ice cream. Hope that feedback loop makes sense.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lvade1/realizing_my_toxic_traits/gpf6aq9/"}
