It could be that or a matter of projection, not sure.\n\nThat being said, nothing is permanent and things can be unlearned. You can totally turn around your habits and get back into a routine. It's not easy being in a pandemic / lockdown in most places to form a routine that keeps you grounded and I find having all this down time can result in mentally beating yourself up or nitpicking yourself, because you're lacking focus or something that gives you a true sense of purpose that aligns with your values, goals and morals. \n\nI've been listening to lots of Russell Brand on Youtube, and reading memoirs such as Untamed, Becoming and Mark Manson's blog/books too. Those are uplifting materials and can inspire you to continue your personal growth journey.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lvade1/realizing_my_toxic_traits/gpchgta/"}
