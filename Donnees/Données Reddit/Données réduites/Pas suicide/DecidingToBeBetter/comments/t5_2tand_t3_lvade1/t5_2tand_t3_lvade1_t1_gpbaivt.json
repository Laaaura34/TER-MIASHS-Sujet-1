I was guilty of a lot of that in the past, I wonder how much being an only child contributed to it. One big problem for me was always my stubbornness and unwillingness to change so it\u2019s good that you\u2019re already identifying these patterns of behavior and wanting to change.\n\nOne book that I found to be really helpful is \u2018You Are Not Your Brain\u2019. Therapy is also an invaluable resource, I can\u2019t recommend finding a good therapist enough.\n\nGood luck and I hope things improve for you! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lvade1/realizing_my_toxic_traits/gpbaivt/"}
