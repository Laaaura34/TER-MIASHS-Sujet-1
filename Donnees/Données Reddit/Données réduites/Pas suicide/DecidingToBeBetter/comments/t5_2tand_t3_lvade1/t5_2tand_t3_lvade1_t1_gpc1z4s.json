I think a lot of how we are is based on how we were raised.  We didn't have to fight any siblings for attention; but at the same time, when we did something wrong (or when our parents thought we did something wrong), we didn't have the ability to spread any blame around (e.g., \"it was his idea,\" or \"she made me do it\").  We absorbed ALL of the blame.  In that same light, whenever we feel like anyone has wronged us, it's up to OURSELVES to right the wrong.  That's where the super-vengeful feelings come into play.  No siblings to tattle on, so we have to take care of it OURSELVES.  Also, quite often, only children are used to hanging out with their parents, grandparents, and their adult friends, so we feel like we have a preconceived notion of maturity.  That puts us in a different mindset that a lot of our peers, which leads to alienation, which leads to overcompensation.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lvade1/realizing_my_toxic_traits/gpc1z4s/"}
