(i feel like a narcissist by how many times im using myself as an example LOL i just dont want to like tell you what to do and be like \u201cyou need to do this this this blah blah\u201d haha) like negative thoughts have literally manifested those traits in me. so maybe we should try those thought replacement techniques, \u201cpositive self talk.\u201d like \u201ci AM smart\u201d or \u201ci AM loved\u201d or even \u201ci CAN figure out my problems\u201d whatever works for you, since a lot of these things are our perceptions it might just take a little bit of adjusting to our mindsets to get us to perceive things right and not so tinted by our own anxieties. anyways, feel free to tell me more, i relate to a lot of what youre going thru and best of luck", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lvade1/realizing_my_toxic_traits/gpax3yr/"}
