Same behaviors, extreme guilt/feeling selfish, questioning my worth and abilities, confused about my next steps career wise. It was awful! I was super confident before the relationship but found myself feeling incredibly insecure several months in. \n\nIf your situation is as similar to mine is as it sounds, then I believe it\u2019s an combination of attachment anxiety and losing yourself in your partner. Soon after my ex and I broke up (after being fucking rekt ofc) I started to reconnect with how I used to feel about myself & the brakes on my growth started lifting. \n\nI\u2019m not saying this to suggest you have to break up at all, just that it might be good to think about/look into those things & maybe curb it before too much resentment starts to build. Lmk if u have any questions!\n\nEdit: I am the youngest of three kids, so def doesn\u2019t only happen to only children. I\u2019m also an INFP so maybe it\u2019s partially due to our emotionality \ud83e\udd14", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lvade1/realizing_my_toxic_traits/gpc0izp/"}
