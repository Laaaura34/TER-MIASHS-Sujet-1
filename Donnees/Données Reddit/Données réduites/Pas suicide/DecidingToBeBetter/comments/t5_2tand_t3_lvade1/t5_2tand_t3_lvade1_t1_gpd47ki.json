In fact I get the feeling that you\u2019re quite the opposite. You seem sweet and compassionate. Ofc that doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t have flaws/be difficult. To me it Sounds like stress is making you act in ways that you don\u2019t recognize and you feel guilty. Or there is something going on in your life that just doesn\u2019t bring out the best in you. Spend time with people who make you love yourself. Not the opposite. \n\nAlso as an empath you\u2019re probably very sensitive to your surrounding. Your mind is giving you signals that something isn\u2019t going right. I know this is super vague but don\u2019t feel shameful and don\u2019t feel guilty!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lvade1/realizing_my_toxic_traits/gpd47ki/"}
