The condition of having a feeling of inferiority is a condition of feeling some sort of lack in oneself in the present situation. So then, the question is\u2014\n\n> YOUTH: How do you fill in the part that\u2019s missing, right?\n\n> PHILOSOPHER: Exactly. How to compensate for the part that is lacking. The healthiest way is to try to compensate through striving and growth. For instance, it could be by applying oneself to one\u2019s studies, engaging in constant training, or being diligent in one\u2019s work. However, people who aren\u2019t equipped with that courage end up stepping into an inferiority complex. Again, it\u2019s thinking, I\u2019m not well educated, so I can\u2019t succeed. And it\u2019s implying your capability by saying, \u201cIf only I were well educated, I could be really successful.\u201d That \u201cthe real me,\u201d which just happens to be obscured right now by the matter of education, is superior.\n\n> YOUTH: No, that doesn\u2019t make sense\u2014the second thing you\u2019re saying is beyond a feeling of inferiority. That\u2019s really more bravado than anything else, isn\u2019t it?\n\n> PHILOSOPHER: Indeed. The inferiority complex can also develop into another special mental state.\n\n> YOUTH: And what is that?\n\n> PHILOSOPHER: I doubt you have heard much about it. It\u2019s the \u201csuperiority complex.\u201d\n\n> YOUTH: Superiority complex?\n\n> PHILOSOPHER: One is suffering from strong feelings of inferiority, and, on top of that, one doesn\u2019t have the courage to compensate through healthy modes of striving and growth. That being said, one can\u2019t tolerate the inferiority complex of thinking, A is the situation, so B cannot be done. One can\u2019t accept \u201cone\u2019s incapable self.\u201d At that point, the person thinks of trying to compensate in some other fashion and looks for an easier way out.\n\n> YOUTH: What way is that?\n\n> PHILOSOPHER: It\u2019s to act as if one is indeed superior and to indulge in a fabricated feeling of superiority.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ejdzvs/finished_2nd_season_of_you_on_netflix/fczhnwf/"}
