In my loneliest moments, these rituals made me feel like I was part of a community. \n\nI enjoyed being a \u201cregular\u201d at a local restaurant where I would treat myself once a week and shooting the shit with the waitress who recognized me and knew my order without me having to say it.\n\nI enjoy going to my dentist 1-2x a year and the guy at the front desk always knew when I got a promotion or new job because my insurance would change! And he would congratulate me on my new job and ask me about it.\n\nPerhaps you have a coffee shop you go to every Saturday and that becomes your regular \u201critual\u201d.\n\nAdditionally, I started fostering dogs. It gives you some kind of regular schedule and it also automatically plugs you into a group of other volunteers who like chatting about what mischief their foster dog got into today.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lap494/how_to_deal_with_loneliness/gltkkxa/"}
