I am working on being comfortable on my own in terms of breakup recovery, but I often feel lonely because I don't have a lot of people to, lets say, message when I'm excited about something, or when I wind down in the evenings I'd like to ask someone about their day and/or talk about mine, ect. So I was curious if there were others who have been through similar experiences and how they've dealt with it, cope with it, or if there were any practices that helped them feel a bit less lonely. Hope that makes sense.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lap494/how_to_deal_with_loneliness/glphzfp/"}
