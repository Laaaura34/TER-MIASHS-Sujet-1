You are comprised of hundreds of billions of cells and all they care about is you.\nYou can't live for the world. You have to live for you.\n]BurnerBurnerBurnerBu 1 point 7 hours ago \nConsider for a moment (regardless of whether you are religious) that this life IS heaven or hell. There is no afterlife. There is only now. Your eyes open and consciousness exists for a very brief moment.\n\n\nDo not live for the world. Live for you. \nDo not live for the world. Live for you.\nI pray I never forget these words. \n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/39jlw5/how_can_you_enjoy_life_when_we_are_a_blip_in_the/cs4on4e/"}
