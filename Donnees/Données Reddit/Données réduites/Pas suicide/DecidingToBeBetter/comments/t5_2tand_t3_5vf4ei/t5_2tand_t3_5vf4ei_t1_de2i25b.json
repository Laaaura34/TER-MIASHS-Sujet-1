Like you described, I felt like I deserved my time to slack off, even though I had personal goals I wanted to achieve. For me, it was caused by depression and stress due to my job. I didn't have any work-life balance and so was going for short-term satisfactions, like blowing my money, to try and make myself feel better. Once I got a better grip on my work-life balance and so had more time for my hobbies and myself, I found my motivation 'to be better' came back and I've been achieving my goals again.\n\nAlso, when I was going through the slacking off stage, I found that berating myself about it made me feel worse. It was counter-productive for me. If you take time off, own it and enjoy it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/5vf4ei/i_need_some_help_i_am_becoming_lazy_unmotivated/de2i25b/"}
