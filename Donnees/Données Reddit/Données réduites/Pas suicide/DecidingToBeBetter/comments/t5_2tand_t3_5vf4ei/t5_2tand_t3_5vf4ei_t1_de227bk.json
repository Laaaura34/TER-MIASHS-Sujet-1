I was becoming unmotivated, spontaneous, and bitter until a few days ago when I realized I want more out of my life. I want to kick life's ass, not just sit around bullshitting then stressing because of my time wasted bullshitting. I'd rather kick ass and bask in the glory of it than worry over what I didn't accomplish because I made bad choices. The truth about life is, you're not going to have someone there in your ear telling you what you have to do next like when we were kids. We have to just make ourselves get up and do it and keep doing it, then soak up the rewards of being an awesome person who gets things done. Hope this helps friend, keep your head up.
