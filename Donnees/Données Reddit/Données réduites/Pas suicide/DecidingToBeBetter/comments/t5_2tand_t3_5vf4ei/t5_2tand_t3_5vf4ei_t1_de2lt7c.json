You dont have to do it all at once. Important thing is that you start. Usually motivation wakes up in you and you just keep going automaticly. Seven years with one person.. thats cool. Dont forget to do things that are for yourself only. Like going to a strip bar every now and then, why not? When you feel like your life is becoming monotonous and boring you become lazy. This is my life now. No. Spice it up with something that you've never done before, or that you're not allowed to do. Breaking the pattern you suddenly have energy to live the normal day to day life. And sometimes its ok to chill and waste your evening on the internet. I actually think you might be comparing your life to some others. Like, someone is out there like a duracell bunny getting shit done all the time. Not everyone is like that. Maybe you arent. Take a trip.
