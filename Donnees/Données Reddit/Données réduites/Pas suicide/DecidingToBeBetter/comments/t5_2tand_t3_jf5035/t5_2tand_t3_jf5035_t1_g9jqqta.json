Like you said, the biggest thing standing in your way is you and your perceived identity. Once you stop identifying with these stories/narratives you begin to pursue your interests which I have found much more fulfilling than living in fear.  \n\n\nI used to tell myself things like \"I'm not good at X\" or \"I could never do X\" or even \"I hate doing X\".. I tried to stop identifying with these thought processes and it has helped me to find new appreciation for things and maintain the ability/focus to keep pursuing my interests regardless of how good I am at them and whatnot.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jf5035/stories_we_tell_ourselves/g9jqqta/"}
