I grew up in a time when the internet wasn't like it was today, so it was hard to find resources & information on things like mental health, & even harder to find people to talk to about it.  \n\nOne of the main things that helped me get better was realizing that I was basically not living for myself, I was bending over backwards & being self-destructive in order to help others & get acceptance, & because my mother was a narcissist, I was raised thinking that was what was expected for me.\n\nTeenage years are terrible no matter what, I can promise that things will get better than what you're going through now; when I moved out from my parents house as an adult things improved a lot, but it wasn't until I confronted all the issues I had, & started doing research & talking to professionals that things really got better for me.  If I knew what I know now at that point, I wouldn't have had to wait so long for my life to actually begin", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m3gj7m/i_told_myself_that_if_my_life_didnt_improve_by/gro2pcz/"}
