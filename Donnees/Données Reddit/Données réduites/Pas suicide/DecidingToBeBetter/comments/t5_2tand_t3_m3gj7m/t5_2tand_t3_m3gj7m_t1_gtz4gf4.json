Sifting through things to make sense can be a difficult task. \n\nEverything that you've shared shows a lot of vulnerability, and also a lot of strength. Reading through this, I can feel everything you have been through as if I was there.\n\nThank you for sharing this with us, and for inspiring us to work through our struggles as well. I for one feel less alone, and From all the love and support being shown on this post, it is obvious you are not alone either. \n\nLife is a beautiful thing, and I am grateful to have seen this post today. <3", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m3gj7m/i_told_myself_that_if_my_life_didnt_improve_by/gtz4gf4/"}
