Except 10 years older. I'm 31. I have absolutely nothing going for me. Just \"casually\" looking up ways I could die. \n\nI got my security guard license!! Lol I was also very codependent on my ex who was a huge asshole to me but... I was codependent. We broke up and now I'm sleeping on an air mattress at my sisters place. Unemployed as well but looking currently. Things are really hard for me right now. Also resisting the hard urge to text my ex because he goes back and forth on being extremely nice to me and wanting me back to telling me to rudely telling me to come get the rest of my shit asap. \n\nYour story is inspiring!!!
