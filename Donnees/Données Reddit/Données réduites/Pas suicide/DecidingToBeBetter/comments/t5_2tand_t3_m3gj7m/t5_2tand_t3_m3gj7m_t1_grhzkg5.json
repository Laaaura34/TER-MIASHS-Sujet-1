Love seeing posts like this. Life is not preordained, we don\u2019t live in a deterministic world. Rather than taking their lives, people should do things to change things, which is exactly what people should do. We are free human beings. I think that everyone should know something about existentialism, even if it\u2019s just the Wikipedia article. We\u2019re not machines; we aren\u2019t rocks rolling down a hill. We can think and we can freely act. I am very aware of how alluring suicide can appear. Instead, see a doctor and fight to get better. Love and good wishes for all of us struggling in a world of suffering. Never surrender!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m3gj7m/i_told_myself_that_if_my_life_didnt_improve_by/grhzkg5/"}
