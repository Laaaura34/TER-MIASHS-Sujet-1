While I didn\u2019t go to a community college myself, I now work at one and understand how valuable they are. The professors that work there WANT to work there, it isn\u2019t just a step on the way to teaching at a university. The teaching at a CC compared to what I got at a 4 year (lecture) is so much better (hands-on, interactive, relevant, etc.). The smaller class sizes and cheaper tuition are also nice! Don\u2019t ever let somebody tell you that your education was somehow lesser because of came from a community college.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa5c2w/college_community_college_but_still/h3fuxs3/"}
