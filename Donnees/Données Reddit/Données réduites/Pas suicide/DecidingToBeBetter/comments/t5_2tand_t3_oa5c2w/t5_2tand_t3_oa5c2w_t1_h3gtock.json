The professors there really seemed to care and surprise, I had multiple professors at university that taught at my community college, only at cc class sizes were like 30 compared to 200. I never want to hear anyone say \"aw it's just community college\" :) don't downgrade your achievement!! Congratulations and feel proud!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa5c2w/college_community_college_but_still/h3gtock/"}
