Went through a terrible breakup and realized that I needed my friends, especially my girlfriends. I realized that I put so much energy into him that I lost myself. I spent the next 1.5 years focusing on me and what I needed. As my friend circle grew, my loneliness decreased. I started to enjoy my time alone because I wasn\u2019t lonely anymore. Focus on your friendships. They are a huge part of relationship building. My therapist told me that friends, both good and bad, help you develop boundaries that can be carried into your future relationship. I ended up meeting my boyfriend through my friends. Now it\u2019s great because I know that I\u2019m not just with him because I\u2019m lonely. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/azd84u/its_a_lonely_road/ei79kt3/"}
