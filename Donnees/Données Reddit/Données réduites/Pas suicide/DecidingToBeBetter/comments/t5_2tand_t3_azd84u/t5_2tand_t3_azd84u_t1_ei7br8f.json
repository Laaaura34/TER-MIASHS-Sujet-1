I did many of the improvements you did.  I didn't settle, I tried to out of wanting a partner but something was missing.  \nIm catholic and although many say I could be a better Christian that was what I was not willing to settle on.  I didn't know at the time that it was a deal breaker.  I put some women and myself through some bad breakups. So the meaning of my rambling is know what you want in a relationship,  not being lonely doesn't offer much for you or the other. Chances are your subconcious already knows, so talk with yourself and help by listening to your inner voice,  its usually right because it's not easily influenced. \nI always told myself im alone but never lonely. Being a catholic I have my holy family with me. Joseph,  Mary,  Jesus and my guardian angel. You can borrow my family anytime.  \nThis is where the haters come out. If you're overweight and uncomfortable change your diet and give it time. If you're happy where you're at then you will reflect that.  It's easy to get out of shape and have others and yourself convince you that you look fine.  You know what's best for you.  \nGood luck\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/azd84u/its_a_lonely_road/ei7br8f/"}
