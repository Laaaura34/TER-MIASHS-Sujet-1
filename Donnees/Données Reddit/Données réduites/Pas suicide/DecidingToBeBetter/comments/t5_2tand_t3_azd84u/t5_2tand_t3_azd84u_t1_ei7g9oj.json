I hope it helps you: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nVisualize the person you want to be: what you are doing, how it feels, how it sounds, how different you are from where you currently are. Spend time imagining. Write out the \"new\" you. Be able to imagine in as much rich detail as you can. Then, move your mind fully into that new position. Take steps from that position and reverse engineer exactly what you'll have to do to move your physical reality closer to that idealized state. If it helps, make lists or give yourself daily tasks to complete, all of which are solidifying the fact that you are now behaving like this new self. Take it slow, but also work at it on a daily basis. Over time, you'll learn that your reality has actually melded with your imagined ideal. Of course, it will be different in many ways, because there are so many uncertainties with reality, but you will be different.
