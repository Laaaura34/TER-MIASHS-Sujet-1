I wouldn\u2019t really call this advice, but one thing I can say is that it\u2019s part of the process. Getting to know, like, and love yourself is a very important part of what you\u2019re going through. Allow you to be yourself freely. Learn about what you like, want, and need. Work on the things you know you want to improve, and feel good about your progress. When you are becoming someone you would want to be with, you aren\u2019t alone, because you have you!
