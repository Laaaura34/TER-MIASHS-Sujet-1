This is a constant reminder i made for myself, I'm a couple years younger but having read your post OP i feel, although noticing I'm so lonely too, paradoxically less lonely. I see myself in you and i feel your loneliness, the one I know I'll have in a few years from now, when i move out, find my own place in this world, I too have not found my significant other (been through too many heartbreaks) but isn't there some sort of magic in that?. You can still reinvent yourself, find new paths, see love and romance in different ways, you have the opportunity to try new things regarding love, view perspectives regarding a partner \"the ideal\" partner. You're free in a way, or that's how i see my loneliness nowadays. Sadness comes, when we sit alone at home, at work, see a couple passing by, a friend getting married or engaged, responsibilities people with partners have. Its overwhelming i know, but keep building up that HAPPINESS, keep moving. There's love in loneliness, there's kindness in a person who's heart is so full of love, share it with the ones that are still around, one day there will come someone who'll take your love and give you back even more. Until then, keep moving, me and you. We can do this \u2764.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/azd84u/its_a_lonely_road/ei7kfzl/"}
