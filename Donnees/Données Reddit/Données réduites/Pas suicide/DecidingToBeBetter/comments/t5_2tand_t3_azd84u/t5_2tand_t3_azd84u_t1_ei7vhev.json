In my opinion, there are two kind of satisfaction in one\u2019s life. The first one is finding a soulmate that give support and be there for you when u need him/her. Another one is the satisfaction that doing what u enjoy or even excel in that field. For example, sports, reading or even travelling. Everyone feels lonely when they are pursuing their meaning of life because it\u2019s the task that can only be done by our own selves. However, Once u find the value and meaning in it, u won\u2019t feel as empty as u are right now. And then, be confident and get out of your comfort zone and start enlarge your social network. Try to embrace the difference and imperfections of each person. Eventually, u can find \u201cthe me and you against the world\u201d partner. Don\u2019t lose faith in yourself!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/azd84u/its_a_lonely_road/ei7vhev/"}
