Listen to podcasts. They can make even the most isolating activities feel like a communal event. I recommend listening to any podcasts that inspire self-care, productivity, and good leadership. Having someone cheering you on while trying to accomplish the same thing is very energizing. Just give those types of podcasts a google. \n\nAlso, I recommend reading or listening to some Zen Buddhism lectures. Particularly those by Alan Watts surrounding the concept of being alone. You must know that a period of isolation can be the best thing for you, or anyone. There are so many stories of people who isolate themselves from everything and garner a whole new perception of reality and life.\n\nBest of luck! :) you can do it. You\u2019re already there.
