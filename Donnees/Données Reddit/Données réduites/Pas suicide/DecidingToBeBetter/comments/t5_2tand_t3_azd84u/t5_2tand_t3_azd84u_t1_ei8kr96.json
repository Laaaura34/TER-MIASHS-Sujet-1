I relate to this a lot. It's surprisingly hard to find people who are willing to improve themselves. Some practical advice:\n\n1. Start writing a journal! I've been journaling every day for the last 2 years and it has changed my life. I use the Daylio app.\n2. Listen to inspiring self-improvement podcasts. Some of my favourites are the Tim Ferriss Show, the Jordan Harbinger Show, 10% Happier with Dan Harriss, and Optimal Living Daily.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/azd84u/its_a_lonely_road/ei8kr96/"}
