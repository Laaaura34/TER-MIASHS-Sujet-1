I'll be starting school again in summer most likely but for sure fall so that is helping me move forward. As far as the lonely feeling,  I found asking people about their hobbies or what they're watching helps because you can relate or get new ideas. Another thing is picking up new hobbies or interests. I was recently talking to a group of coworkers how I wanted to try skiing and snowshoes this year, and I found out many more people ski and snowshoe than I imagined. People I've never thought about hanging out with outside of work and now I've had offers to go out with me and do these things. Another is talking about your interests or hobbies and you might find out others share similar tastes. Running is a passion of mine, and I do it for fun. I sign up for races but just because I like training for them, not competitively. I found out a few of my coworkers run and we talk about upcoming races and I've even met up with some at the previous races. Sometimes you end up clicking with people who you previously would not think you would click with. To me, it is a challenge, but I seem to be growing. I hope you are able to get past this part in your life, because I know the loneliness sucks, I've been there.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/azd84u/its_a_lonely_road/ei8f3pv/"}
