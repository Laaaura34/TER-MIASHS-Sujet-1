I really admire your bravery! Its not an easy jump to take accountability for yourself. I started the same journey 2 years ago. Starting with the working hard and developing self-control and determination, then a skin care routine. Now its been half an year since I started dieting and exercising. The best tip that i can offer is to not compare yourself, just go about your own path and you will get to where you need to be. \n\nThe working hard one is a specially easy slope to fall down; working hard isnt about your results/how much you work. Its about your limits and reaching them. My limit today may be writing a 5 pages of a 80 page essay tomorrow it might be writing 30. In both days i'd've worked just as hard and that took me a long while and some health damage to understand. \n\nIts definitely worth the effort. People notice. My parents respect me more because of my academic results and outlook, I have more people around me. I have more guys actually taking the initiative to talk to me and being friendly. Physically, I only look a bit thinner and more fit. With clearer skin. But my whole demeanour changed. \n\nIt's definitely the best you can do for yourself. Take it slowly and don't do everything at once. Slowly add things into your \"habit book\" and things will be easier!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9u9wl/realization_the_start_of_a_journey/hgz8yjr/"}
