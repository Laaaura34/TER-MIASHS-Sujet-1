I am a straight A student and this is my last year, I will start college soon in a town I know nothing about and I realized that I need to get good results especially for my entrance exams and final exams. I also know that I need to try to understand basic human skills and chores I never got to do, hobbies I never got to try. I'm not the type of person who finds life beautiful, considering the nightmares i get daily due to self-homophobia (those arent nice <3) but, considering i will be living in this hell for quite some time, i should try to enjoy it a bit", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9u9wl/realization_the_start_of_a_journey/hgzg2se/"}
