But I had always only associated it with the physical aspect. And so had always told myself that I'd get around to doing it once 'everything else' was taken care of or when I get my own apartment in the future. However, this documentary opened me up to a new idea of mental clutter. More accurately the clutter of useless dreams and desires which are not even truly yours and are there only because of media or people.\n\nI am going to deeply examine what things are there in my work and personal life that I want which are truly mine. And to just what degree of accomplishment do I want them (ex. marks) according to myself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/642ga3/feels_like_i_am_stuck_in_a_loselose_situation/dg0yyuv/"}
