Leave laughter alone. Work on your empathy the hard way, not the dramatic way. \n\nGo take care of things, experience caring about others. Watch video's of people discussing their deeper feelings or experiences. Talk to people about these stories, or be more open about your own. Consider the empathy you are receiving. There's more to being caring than gasping when moe slaps curly. That why Oprah was so popular, she gave you all these tools in one place. She provided an outlet for empathy, a work out routine for compassion. You don't have to watch Oprah, just try thinking of media like hers in those terms. \n\nSpend more time with your pet, if you don't have a pet get one. Especially if compassion is a really concern for you. \nHell, get another one.\nYoull want a plant or two. Their presence and caring for them grows our capacity for love and empathy. You can read search it, the studies are out there,... Or you can just get a plant lol. \n\nThe most important bit is the thought exercise of caring about, and sympathizing with, other living things. \nIf that's what you want to do, then do that, don't perform, just do more of what you want to do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qby0xd/trying_to_get_rid_of_my_schadenfreude_reactions/hhcryqh/"}
