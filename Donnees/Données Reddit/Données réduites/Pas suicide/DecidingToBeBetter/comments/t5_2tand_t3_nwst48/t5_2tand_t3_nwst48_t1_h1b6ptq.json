It doesn't really matter what it is, the solution remains the same. And then I would suggest you start therapy, because you have some serious self worth issues.\n\nYou are just like everyone else, except for the fact that you've isolated yourself so much. You have the wrong idea about the people around you, they are all carrying all kinds of secrets around, low self esteem, insecurities, shit they regret from their past, the whole nine. You are making them out to be innocent \"normals\" when they truth is, most of them aren't. This is something you would learn if you dared communicate with them some more. Instead you are telling yourself a story that you made up, which isn't the truth, but a delusional view of reality.\n\nThat is why most people can't fix themselves, and why therapy works so well in general.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nwst48/i_want_to_move_forward_and_rebuild_human_contact/h1b6ptq/"}
