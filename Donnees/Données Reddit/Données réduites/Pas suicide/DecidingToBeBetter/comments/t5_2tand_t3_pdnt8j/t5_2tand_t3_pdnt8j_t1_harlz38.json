And said he would leave me if he ever felt our relationship was hurting me more than helping me.  He constantly pushes me to be better but I just fall into self destructive patterns or don't think about impacts of any of my actions till after the fact.  His whole thing is that he wants anyone he dates to reach the point where they are fine alone or with him so that we can grow together and right now he feels that I rely on him.  The codependence scares him and I can see it.  After a violent rape two years back I went from strong and independent person to basically a shell of who I was that I'm still rebuilding. It made me clingy and I rarely act or do anything without asking him first (which I thought was just what people who date are supposed to do since I mainly slutted around and never dated much) and he worries about me doing that.\n\nNone of this is on him.  He is trying and mostly we are civil.  He is texting me a bit about how the baseball game is going, but he has made it clear that he has feelings to work through about how he feels he does most of the \"adulting\" and I discovered the lovebombing definition on my own and realized how often I do that.  I don't think he knows that I've been emotionally abusive since even I didn't realize that", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdnt8j/please_help_me_be_a_better_partner_and_adult/harlz38/"}
