I know exactly what you mean about the gray areas. I\u2019m the same way, caring about others comes naturally. (Btw we are also more normal in that way than you might think. Despite what society tells us, as mammals we are wired for empathy and love just as much as, if not more than, we are wired for competition and aggression). It\u2019s often hard to tell when it\u2019s coming from my nature and when it\u2019s coming from the imprinting of my childhood. \n\nAfter learning about trauma and codependency and other dysfunctions for the past few years, I\u2019m starting to feel like I can tell them apart a lot better now. When I\u2019m unsure I ask myself \u201cdo I really *want* to do this for them or do I feel like I have to?\u201d Even then, circumstances can complicate things and make it hard to tell. But I find that question helps me make the distinction.\n\nAnyway best of luck to you friend, hope all that stuff helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i35wxi/i_want_to_stop_being_codependent/g1yfg0v/"}
