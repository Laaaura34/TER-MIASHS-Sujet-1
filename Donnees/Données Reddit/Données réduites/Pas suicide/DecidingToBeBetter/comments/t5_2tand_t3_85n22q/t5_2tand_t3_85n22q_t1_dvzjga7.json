Great work in doing the introspection to figure that out, it's not easy to do!\n\nIt's hard to give advice on this, but try to be invested in your potential friend's well-being, as if you had bet on them to have a happy life. Like, wish for them to have a great day, and be sorry when they have a shitty day at work. Encourage them to face a big obstacle they have to overcome. Try to make them feel better when they are in a bad place. If you don't know what to say, just express what you hope for them, or ask them questions, like \"Fuck, that's awful. How do you feel?\" or \"Wow, that's amazing, you must be so proud, right?\". Listen to them and make a habit out of caring for others. \n\nGet to know them, on a deep personal level. Google \"36 questions\" for inspirations, but just ask whatever seems interesting about the other person. Find out about their interests, their worries, their goals, fears, motivations. Ask them about things they are passionate about and let them talk to you about it. And share your own, of course!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/85n22q/i_cant_seem_to_make_any_sort_of_connection_with/dvzjga7/"}
