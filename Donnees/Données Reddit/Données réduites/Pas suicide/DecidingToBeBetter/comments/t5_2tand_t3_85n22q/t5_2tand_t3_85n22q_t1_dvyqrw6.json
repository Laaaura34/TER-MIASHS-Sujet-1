I think there are two possible truths:\n\n1.\tThere is actually something about us that makes us pleasant to have around but nobody misses us when we are away, or\n2.\tEverybody feels a little of this and we feel it more. Due to the emotional neglect we need a level of affirmation that is simply not reality. We want someone to absolutely adore and need us to prove to us that our parents lack of love isn\u2019t what we truly deserve. \n\nI think that the approach to either truth is to accept it. I lean a bit Buddhist, so forgive me if this isn\u2019t helpful. If there is something about us that prevents deep connection, then we should make the best life we can around that.  We can do a lot of good for others and society. Life isn\u2019t fair and some of us just have this path to follow. \n\nIf everyone feels this way, and we are sensitive, we need to accept that too. It makes us like addicts, that have this void we will always have to deal with or like people missing a limb. You have to make your life work around the handicap. In our case that is realizing we are craving something we won\u2019t get. The question then is \u201cso what do I do?\u201d We need self talk that reminds us that we have an egg shell skull. \n\nI\u2019m still struggling with this, so take this with a grain of salt. I\u2019m open to any thoughts you have. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/85n22q/i_cant_seem_to_make_any_sort_of_connection_with/dvyqrw6/"}
