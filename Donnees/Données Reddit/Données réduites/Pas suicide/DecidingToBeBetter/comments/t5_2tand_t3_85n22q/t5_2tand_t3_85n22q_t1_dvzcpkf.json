They are likely to pick up on the fact that you are uncomfortable and, because they don\u2019t understand why, it will make them uncomfortable as well, and they will be more likely to distance themselves from you. This can happen regardless of how easygoing you are, or how well you do with small talk and other superficial interactions. Deeper relationships are created by going to that vulnerable place you are showing by reaching out here. The key difference is that you are much more vulnerable and exposed when discussing these things in person, rather than over the Internet. \n\nIt\u2019s going to seem really scary at first, but if you can find someone in your personal life that you trust, the best first step I can think of is asking someone to help you learn how to love yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/85n22q/i_cant_seem_to_make_any_sort_of_connection_with/dvzcpkf/"}
