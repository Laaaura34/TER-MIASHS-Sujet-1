I protested counseling my whole life and finally after 2 years, at 31 I felt comfortable enough to address the root of my deficits with my Vet Center counselour. Do yourself a HUGE favor... take the initiative and set yourself up with a counselour, to try out...  know that their job is to help you and if it's not a good fit, try another one. Don't waste your time trying to force yourself to open up to someone you don't see potential for trust in. It's been life changing for me. \n\nFyi, I grew up neglected and abused. No parents and I am using my 30's to figure it all out. It's never too late to persue the life YOU DESERVE.
