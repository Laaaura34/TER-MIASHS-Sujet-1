It is definitely a lot more difficult making close friends as you get older. Most of mine were old coworkers, and I realized I needed to strengthen my social circles.\n\nHave you tried doing meetups for things you're interested in? I moved to a new area and literally knew no one. I joined a non competitive softball group, and slowly got to know people there. We go to bars sometimes after playing, we even had a small house party last night that I went to. It takes time to build friendships, but this has been working for me.\n\nAlso, have you ever been a part of a men's group? I was going through major adversity, and just needed to be around men to help guide me. This has single handedly been one of the greatest things I've done (found through meetup, but I'm sure they have them everywhere). It's modeled after the Mankind project, and has helped me develop as a person. Would also recommend to check it out.
