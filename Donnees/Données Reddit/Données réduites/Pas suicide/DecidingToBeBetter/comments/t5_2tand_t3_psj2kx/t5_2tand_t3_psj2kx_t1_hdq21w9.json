Description here:\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria\n\nAlso, they should be \"goldilocks\" goals. Not too easy, not too hard, just right. Motivation comes from purpose, mastery, challenge, and loving what you do.\n\nExample: sports, drawing, hobbies:\n\nYou draw because you enjoy it.\nYou keep doing it because it's fun.\nYou see improvements which make you feel great and drive you to do more.\n\nSo, success breeds success. Do ANYTHING you are good at, challenge yourself, get better at it, and the feeling of \"winning\" will make you better and better. Increasing happiness and motivation and self worth.\n\nBest of luck! You're a great person for being introspective and looking to make changes. I respect that, and if a complete stranger can give you respect, then i think you can give it to yourself. :D\n\nEdited to give credit to redditor", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/psj2kx/i_hit_rock_bottom_where_to_start/hdq21w9/"}
