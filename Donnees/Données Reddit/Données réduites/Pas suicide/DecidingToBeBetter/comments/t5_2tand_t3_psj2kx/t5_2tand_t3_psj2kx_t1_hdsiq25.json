I want to share what works for me. \n\nI very recently dealt with depression and I am back on the up and up. It took me a good two solid months. Here is what I did. I forced myself to get up earlier and take my dog for a jog. I let the sun hit my face and that to me is a great feeling. I would close my eyes and just smile. Sometimes I would have to force the smile but after a few moments, I would be in a better mood. I then kept telling myself affirmations of love. I also kept telling myself, \"I will get through this!\" I started to feel slightly better.\n\nI started meditating. Breathe in goodness. Breathe out stress. Breathe out the knot in my stomach. That made me feel slightly better.\n\nI joined a new gym. I started working out again. That started to make me feel slightly better.\n\nAfter a few weeks of that, I started going out and being social. Even though that was forced at the beginning. I started meeting new people. Regaining my confidence back. Remembering I was funny. I started getting invited to events and activities. Wasn't keen on going but I did. I ended up always having a great time. That made me feel slightly better.\n\nI started seeing a therapist. After sometime, I started to feel slightly better. \n\nI feel fairly good now. I have developed good habits. I am still on my journey but all of these things have added up in my feel good jar. I am much better now than before. All though still on my journey of this new me. I feel in a much better place than I have been in a long time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/psj2kx/i_hit_rock_bottom_where_to_start/hdsiq25/"}
