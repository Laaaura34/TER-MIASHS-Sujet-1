She\u2019s never had to be told to do her work and makes great grades on her own (whereas I was a procrastinator and made above average to average grades). She\u2019s currently working, therefore making more money than me, and I resigned after furlough due to personal life changes.. \n\nShe tells me she looks up to me but in my head I sort of scoff... and I\u2019m constantly catching myself put my self down for not being more of her provider (of money and initiative mainly). I agree, that no comparisons should be made...in ill-will. I feel very inspired by her strengths but also have accepted our paces differ and i\u2019m in a different part of my life than she. It\u2019s also made me more appreciative of my family and having a sister who loves and cares about me enough to put up with my pandrama bullshit.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hmrshk/i_think_something_finally_clicked_with_me/fx9es09/"}
