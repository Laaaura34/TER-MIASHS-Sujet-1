Seasonal of course\u2026 but one step at a time. In nature, with a small team and often solo.. tons of fresh air, exercise, independence. In the winter you could work at a greenhouse. I\u2019ve always thought when I walked through those greenhouses it would be a really chill place to work.\nI also liked another poster\u2019s idea for animal shelter. Just be prepared to see some sad stuff if you go that route (some animals needing shelters have been abused/neglected to the point where they don\u2019t survive), but I would imagine the success stories would bring an incredible feeling of purpose, accomplishment, and helping other beings", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pu6vqa/31_year_old_college_burnout_cant_figure_out_how/he1m85n/"}
