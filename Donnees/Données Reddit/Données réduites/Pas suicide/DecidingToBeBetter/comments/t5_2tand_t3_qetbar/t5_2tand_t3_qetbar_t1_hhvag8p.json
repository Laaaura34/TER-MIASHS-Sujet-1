I like product and communication design but right know I\u2019m doing an animation for a song (???) which makes me hella confused like what has this do to with my major? There isn\u2019t a general course like the one I\u2019m taking now where I live, just in a private college that I can\u2019t afford so I\u2019m kinda lost. I also think it would be weird for me to join a group since no one talks to me and I struggle a lot just with minimum interaction. I know I should be careful with my words but I just feel like I\u2019m falling into a a black hole.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qetbar/college_is_killing_me_and_idk_what_to_do/hhvag8p/"}
