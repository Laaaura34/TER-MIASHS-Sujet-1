Undergrad was hard work!  Making connections was difficult and I struggled with a variety of health problems.  There were great times and moments, but no one can choose which part of their life is 'best' and it can't be the same for everybody.\n\nI'm trying to have this perspective and maybe it'll help you too:  I'm working on building a life with more and more things to look forward to.  There are many things out of my hands, but if I plan ahead, rest consistently, and make time for little things that make the day better, and pay attention to what is going well, then I can ride out the hardest parts.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qetbar/college_is_killing_me_and_idk_what_to_do/hhxjny2/"}
