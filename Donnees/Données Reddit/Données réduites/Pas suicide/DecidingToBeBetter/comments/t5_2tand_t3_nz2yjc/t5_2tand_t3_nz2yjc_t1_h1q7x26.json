Knowing it\u2019s a problem is apparently only half the battle. Ty for your post. Definitely time for someone to talk to my friend. Again.. It\u2019s okay to be really focused on your work but it\u2019s never okay to be rude. I think my friend has a need to feel important bc they\u2019re in a job that\u2019s beneath them at the moment but still works with \u201cus\u201d on the side. With \u201cus\u201d they are an expert, with \u201cthem\u201d they are practically digging ditches-with a new PhD in plant molecular biology. I get it but friend needs to pay those dues & chill. Are you in a job that\u2019s beneath you? If so, kick it square in the butt & move up! But above all: Be kind & considerate of everyone along the way. Never know who you\u2019re talking to & you want that reputation anyway!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nz2yjc/i_lost_a_potential_management_position_because_of/h1q7x26/"}
