When you feel yourself starts getting irritated just stop. Stop & think about whether your reaction is helpful to the team or if it causes dysfunction instead. I have a really good friend who\u2019s young, talented & just starting their career. One on my best friends actually, but.. has that pushy, huffing & puffing around, my work is so important, how dare you get in my way attitude. It\u2019s already landed them in trouble. Myself & others have tried to mentor them. I was seeing a difference but now they\u2019re back to the same behavior. Oh well... A crappy attitude will kill the career of the smartest most talented ppl around. One must be able to work respectfully with others! Don\u2019t feel hopeless friend, be thoughtful of others needs too. I\u2019m sorry this caused such a problem for you. I feel like my good friend with the same tendencies will find themselves in the same situation one day. Again.. And they\u2019re really a great person. Good luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nz2yjc/i_lost_a_potential_management_position_because_of/h1oc4ly/"}
