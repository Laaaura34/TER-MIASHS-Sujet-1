The person who runs it is a tiktok person I follow but basically she teaches people that care tasks (e.g. cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc) are supposed to be functional and are morally neutral.

If you decide to do all the care tasks as soon as you get home and don\u2019t stop until they\u2019re done, you\u2019re never going to be able to rest", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jdfs9g/if_you_do_your_tasks_when_you_get_home/g99iz55/"}
