I try my best to do 3 things after work. Anything from chores to errands. 1 chore/errand that is medium sized and 2 chore/errands that I are simple. An example would be cleaning out and wiping clean the fridge shelves (medium), clean the guest bathroom toilet (simple), empty the dishwasher (simple). When I do this every day my cleaning on weekends is at most 2 hours total - which I tend to spread out through the weekend in half hour or so stints. I try not to make specific tasks for specific days, just what I feel needs to be done when it needs to be done. I also give myself 10 min in the morning to tidy. So if I left dishes on the coffee table or laundry in the dryer, I quickly tidy that up before I leave for work. \n\nAnything more than that is pretty overwhelming for me. I suffer from a high functioning depression and unfortunately my place seems to be my lowest priority. So if I miss a weekend of cleaning what\u2019s left, I get overwhelmed pretty quickly and then there\u2019s weeks of having my blinders on and ignoring the mess that continues to grow.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jdfs9g/if_you_do_your_tasks_when_you_get_home/g99s2vc/"}
