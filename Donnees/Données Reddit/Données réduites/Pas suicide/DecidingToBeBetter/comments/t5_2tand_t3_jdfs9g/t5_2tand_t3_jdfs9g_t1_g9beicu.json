It\u2019s more therapeutic to have a completely clean home, food to eat for work the next day & knowing my families laundry is taken care of. Yes it does burn me out but I really can\u2019t stop at this point. I try and wake up 2 hours before work instead of an hour & meditate in bed reminding myself that this life right now is worth it, one day I\u2019ll be even more successful. Self affirmations are really how I stay grounded.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jdfs9g/if_you_do_your_tasks_when_you_get_home/g9beicu/"}
