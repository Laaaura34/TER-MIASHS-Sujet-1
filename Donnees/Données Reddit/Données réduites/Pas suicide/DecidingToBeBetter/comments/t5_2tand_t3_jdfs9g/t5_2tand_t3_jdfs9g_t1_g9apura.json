I'm only 25f and I've veen struggling with the concept of the 40hr work week since working full time (some 3 years ago). It's exhausting and unsustainable and I genuinely hate it. I would give anything to have a 3-day weekend, I feel I would be much more productive than working 5 days with just 2 days off  It makes me sad to think that I have to do this for 40+ more years, I sometimes think I won't be able to, so I'm thinking of ways to break free from that but I'm bot sure yet on how to do it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jdfs9g/if_you_do_your_tasks_when_you_get_home/g9apura/"}
