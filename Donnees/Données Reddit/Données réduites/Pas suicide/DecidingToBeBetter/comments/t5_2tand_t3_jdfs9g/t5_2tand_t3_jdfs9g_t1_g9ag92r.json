Work, get through the traffic to get home. Cook dinner, clean up & pack lunch for the next day. Go change clothes, choose outfit & iron it if needed, for the next day. By now it\u2019s 8-830 pm. Finally sit down and watch something mindless & entertaining to \u201cescape\u201d for a short time. Go to bed & do it all over. 5 days in a row. Over the weekend, there\u2019s not really enough time to do something I want to do that\u2019s fun for me, bc of laundry, cleaning house & getting groceries so that I don\u2019t have to go during the week ~ which really screws up time. I grew to resent it. It\u2019s a messed up system of work 40 hours then only get 2 days off. That\u2019s not enough time to do anything for yourself. Anyway, I\u2019m disabled & no longer doing all that. \nSorry to be a downer ~ it just struck a nerve.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jdfs9g/if_you_do_your_tasks_when_you_get_home/g9ag92r/"}
