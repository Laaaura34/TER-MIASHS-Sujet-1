I believe it, and it is something I'm hoping to unpack with my therapist. It explains a lot about me. I've stopped browsing \"cringe\" sub-reddits and similar kind of spaces, because I think they were really messing with my perception of self and others.\n\nBut back to your point, I think you are right that the internet has made us feel like this, or at least really pushed this along. People are dragged through the mud for a single Tweet. I'm skeptical of there being a broader \"cancel culture\", but  I do think that spending too much time on any social media platform we start to perceive people as their posts, for good or bad, and we internalize it.\n\nHumans are such complex beasts.
