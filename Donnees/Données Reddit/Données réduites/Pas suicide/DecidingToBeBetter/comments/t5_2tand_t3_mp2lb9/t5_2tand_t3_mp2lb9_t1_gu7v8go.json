It's good to know that my experience isn't uncommon. Just taking the time to write about it was clarifying. I mean, back when I started I didn't imagine that only a few months later I'd be here complaining that listing all of the things I'm grateful for would have become too boring. That alone is worthy of gratitude. \n\nEither way, I don't intend on breaking it - it's only 5 minutes, puts me in a positive mindset and gives me a small feeling of accomplishment to start my day. My problem could be expecting it to be something it's not.  Maybe I'll try taking a bit more time with it and try to \"feel\" the sensation of gratitude. This week I did try moving it from a paper journal to my laptop (it kind of felt wasteful - and too personal to just have lying around), but I think writing it by hand \"feels\" more real.
