I applaud your willingness to open up so that others who have been through similar trauma will know that they are not alone.\n\nIt sounds to me like you cannot do this by yourself. Another poster mentioned finding a good therapist. I concur, and agree with the recommendation that if you don't click with the first one, try another until you find somewhat with whom you connect.\n\nYou are a beloved child of the Creator, you are worthy of love and of a happy life.\n\nI wish you all the best, and will keep you in my prayers that you will find peace and healing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kpz5de/how_to_regain_self_worth_after_getting_raped/gi1iv0x/"}
