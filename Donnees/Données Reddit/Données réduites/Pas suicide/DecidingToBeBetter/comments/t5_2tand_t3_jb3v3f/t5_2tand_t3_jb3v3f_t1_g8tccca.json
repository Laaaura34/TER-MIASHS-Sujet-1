However for me it was no eureka moment so to say it was pure will and studying my self and my failures at all times.\n\nWhat helped me a lot was finding my weakness and my triggers. After a dozen failures I have learned a lot about myself, I was defeated mentally quite badly after of course failing, I even had small successes but eventually I failed. However with my last try I had an immense motivator, I NEEDED this more than anything, I would say it got easier above 6+ months as my brain finally started to figure out that I was for real this time and I wasn\u00b4t gonna change back to my old self.\n\nI\u00b4m glad you\u00b4ve made change!
