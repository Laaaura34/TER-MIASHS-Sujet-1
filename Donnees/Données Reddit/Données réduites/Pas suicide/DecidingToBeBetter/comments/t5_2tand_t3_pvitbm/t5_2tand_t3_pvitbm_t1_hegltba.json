But you are also wrong - there are plenty of women who gives a flying f\\* who earns the most, just as long as they feel like their partner is economically bringing into the relationship as much as he is able to, and not slacking off.  \nI know, I'm that kind of woman myself.\n\nMy guess is that you live in the USA, and I live in Scandinavia where everything is much different when it comes to wages, workers rights and all that. So I can't really give you any advice for improving your situation job wise.\n\nBut just know that the right woman will see you and adore you for who you are, and appreciate your hard working nature and your commitment to improving your own situation.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvitbm/i_feel_like_such_a_man_child/hegltba/"}
