Keep going.  I\u2019ve had to move in with my parents a bunch of times (and, bonus trauma - my parents are hoarders).  I\u2019ve seen some really dark times.\n\nYou know what?  You\u2019re right about women not being gold diggers.  I\u2019m the breadwinner.  I make more than my husband.  It\u2019s totally fine, because he is a loving, caring, honest man - and he is a great partner.  \n\nFocus on making yourself happy.  Keep working hard, and build up your confidence.

It took a long ass time to be who I am today, but now that I\u2019m middle aged I feel like I\u2019ve finally made it.  You\u2019re in you\u2019re 20\u2019s.
