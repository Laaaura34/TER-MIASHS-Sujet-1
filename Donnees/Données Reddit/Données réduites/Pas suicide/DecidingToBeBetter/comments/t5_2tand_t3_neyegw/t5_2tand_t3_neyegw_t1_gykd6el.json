Part of it was just getting out of my 20s - in my 20s I had this constant sense that there was something better happening somewhere else, and that I should find it before I lost relevance.  It was an unfulfilling feeling but it's common to that age.  Eventually you realize - there's *always* something going on, always has been, always will be.  You're not special for finding it.  You're special for finding *yourself*.  Relationships, career, building a home for yourself, continuing to educate yourself, better yourself, finding new hobbies to grow into.  These are core focuses that will serve you long after you grow bored of running around trying to keep pace with young idiots (sorry to all young idiots, I was one too, it's just a phase).  \n\nSocial media just exacerbates the natural FOMO that we all tend to feel when we're young.  I wish I had a real solution but basically, just know you'll grow out of it as you find the things you're looking for in life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/neyegw/deleted_my_socials/gykd6el/"}
