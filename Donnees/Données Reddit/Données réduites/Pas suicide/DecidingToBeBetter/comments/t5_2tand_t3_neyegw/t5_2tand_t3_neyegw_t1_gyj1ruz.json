So many amazing points made here, especially when you mentioned \u201cnot enjoying things because I was doing them for my timeline, not myself.\u201d I fear that\u2019s the road I\u2019m heading down. Seeking validation and applauds from people who barely even know me. I also am guilty of stalking my ex, or people I don\u2019t associate with. It makes those people relevant in my mind, and I don\u2019t even speak to them, nor do I want to. It\u2019s a sad cycle. I will reread this and refer to this post to motivate me to stay on track. I\u2019m happy to hear your successes in making this step for yourself!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/neyegw/deleted_my_socials/gyj1ruz/"}
