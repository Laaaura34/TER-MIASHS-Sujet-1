Good on you for recognizing a problem in your life and taking steps to rectify the problem.\n\nAs a recovering alcoholic of 10 years now, I can tell you that addiction needs a pacifier. For all intents and purposes, you can't just quit drinking without replacing that facet of your life with something positive. Be it an all engrossing hobby, exercise, something. That whole ritual you developed around the consumption of alcohol needs a positive replacement. As nature abhors a vacuum, so our brains are wired so that in needs something to fill in the hole. \n\nI wish you nothing but the best of good fortune in your endeavor to lead a better life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/immiws/4_months_sober_today/g42k0qd/"}
