I thoroughly enjoy creating music as well as consuming it. I have quite a collection of guitars, some as old and older than I am. So instead of getting up in the morning and getting drunk, I'd get up singing and then play around with composing lyrics and melodies. I am, at best, a mediocre musician who plays by ear tho. But I can usually jump in with anyone else playing an instrument and make it sound at least half way decent.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/immiws/4_months_sober_today/g449kzw/"}
