If you can, it may change your life experience. I used to have battles raging in my head over pretty much everything but after months of daily meditation (been doing it for years now) I find all of that negative/angry/anxious/scared/worried/. inner chatter to be almost non existent and when it does show up I quickly recognize it and let it go.\n\nI think of meditation like this: if you manually dial in radio stations you\u2019ll get those stations where you can hear the music but there is a lot of static that kind of ruins it and makes you want to stop listening. But if you keep tuning you may find a few notches up that you can experience the music without static and enjoy it. Meditation for me has been like that, a great tool for getting rid of the mental static.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/afk1wv/how_to_be_kinder_to_yourself/ee1f2d3/"}
