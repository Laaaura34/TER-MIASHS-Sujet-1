Think of yourself as a separate family member. If you see he/she slacking in schoolwork, you'll reprimand. But if you see them trying and struggling, then even if they fail, you'll be kinder. \n\nEvaluate how your day was before going to bed, and not during the day. You want to encourage yourself to be the parent who balances freedom with discipline, and not be the helicopter parent. If you catch yourself slacking, just make a note of it. You can reflect on it later. If you feel it's going on for too long (more than 30 minutes), then you can pause and reconsider if you want to keep doing it.\n\nWhat I'm saying is: Live how you want to while keeping yourself accountable. Did something you're not happy with, reconsider doing it in future. People will try to resist your changes.
