Do you make them a tasty meal? Run them a bath? Treat them to a massage? Do something with them that they enjoy? Write them a note saying what you appreciate about them?\n\nIf you don't currently care about or like yourself, **try treating yourself as if you do.** Try doing the things you would do for someone you cared about, for yourself. I find its hard to force myself to think nice things about myself, but writing them changes that mental reluctance. \n\nEventually your brain will catch up, because it wants its needs met and it wants nice things.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/afk1wv/how_to_be_kinder_to_yourself/edzwc99/"}
