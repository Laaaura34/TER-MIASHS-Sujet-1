I recommend finding a therapist or psychiatrist you can trust and then be honest honest honest with them. Share your truths and then listen. Really listen and try what they might suggest. Medications, practices, daily routine stuff....just try it. What have you got lose? Feeling helpless and miserable? Also, if you don\u2019t have the money to afford treatment with a particular Dr or APN then just let them know and ask if there\u2019s anything they could do to help. I\u2019ve had two therapists drop their pricing for me because I truly needed and wanted the help. Show yourself some compassion because you are worthy of feeling better and becoming who you want.
