Gives me another view of things. I don\u2019t think he truly loved me, just my validation I gave him. What a sad life to lead tbh. I don\u2019t feel bad for me as much as I feel bad for him/you. You don\u2019t know how to love fully. You know how to act like you do. Hope you get help and I hope more people aren\u2019t hurt by your actions before that happens.
