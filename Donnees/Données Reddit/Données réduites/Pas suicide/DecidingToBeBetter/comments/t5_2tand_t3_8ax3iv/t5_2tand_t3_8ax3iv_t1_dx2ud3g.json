Ever considered imposter syndrome? One thing for certain about narcissism is that the person who\u2019s actually medically diagnosed a narcissist usually cannot admit to themselves or anyone else they are in fact a narcissist.\n\nRegardless of what I just said, this situation you\u2019re in sounds like it\u2019s haunting you. You may even feel you\u2019re subconsciously using this post as an attention seeking trick. I feel that if you go and see a mental health professional you\u2019d feel that what you\u2019re going thru isn\u2019t rare at all.\n\nI think you\u2019ll feel much better mate. Btw feeling as guilty as you do writing this post should count for something. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8ax3iv/im_honestly_just_not_a_good_person/dx2ud3g/"}
