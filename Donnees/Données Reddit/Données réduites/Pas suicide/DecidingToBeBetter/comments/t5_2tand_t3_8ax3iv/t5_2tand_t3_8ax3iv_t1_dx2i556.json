You are not comfortable with yourself, and you are not confident in your abilities. You need people to express love for you because you don't love yourself. You try to impress people because you don't believe that they can love you just the way you are. You tell yourself you're broken, so you will likely stay that way. You avoid failure because you think that if you don't try then you can't lose, but it's the exact opposite. By avoiding failure you lose out on everything. Failure is growth. You tell yourself that you can't change, that you're not a good person and that it's set in stone, because your own misery is more comfortable than the idea of growing and being better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8ax3iv/im_honestly_just_not_a_good_person/dx2i556/"}
