I didn\u2019t 100% realize the scope of it at the time, but this was me to a tee. Not sure why or how I got like that, but there I was.\n\nRealization truly is the first step. \n\nKeep at it.

If you perform the actions of the person you want to be, eventually it becomes habit.\n\nI don\u2019t lie to myself about who I am, or what I\u2019m feeling anymore. I let myself feel however I need to, tell myself it\u2019s okay, and then make sure those emotions aren\u2019t dictating my actions.\n\nPractice, repetition, time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8ax3iv/im_honestly_just_not_a_good_person/dx3jlzc/"}
