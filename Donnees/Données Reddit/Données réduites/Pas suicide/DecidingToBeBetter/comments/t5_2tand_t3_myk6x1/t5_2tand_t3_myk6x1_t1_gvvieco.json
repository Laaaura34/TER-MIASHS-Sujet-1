If joining a \"pre-existing activity group\" gives you anxiety (like \"they all know each other and I'm the stranger\") look for something that's more class-like or something like that. A lot of cities have community center style classes/activities that you can register for and learn to paint, or do yoga, or go on a nature hike. Generally the participants in there are all new to each other and maybe the subject matter and since it's a guided activity, you've got a helper when it comes to interactions.  And there's no pressure to worry about being \"invited back\" or anything because it's not a group based on some sort of social acceptance/friendships (initially) but you might be able to form those relationships with someone there. Who knows? Start with just one person, no need to try to assume you need to make friends with a whole group all at once.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/myk6x1/no_social_circles_no_clue_where_to_start/gvvieco/"}
