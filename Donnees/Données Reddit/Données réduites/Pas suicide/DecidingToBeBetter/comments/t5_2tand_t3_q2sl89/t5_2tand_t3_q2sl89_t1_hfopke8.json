It\u2019s weird because I have the opposite problem where I\u2019m too independent so learning to ask for help has been tough! Good to know there are people coming from the other side as well.\n\nRemember that people you date aren\u2019t going to like you, and it\u2019s not because you said or did something wrong, it\u2019s just because you aren\u2019t a good match, and they\u2019re just looking for something different. There are people out there looking for what you have to offer, and just keep going until you find them -  that\u2019s life!
