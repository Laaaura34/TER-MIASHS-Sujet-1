That\u2019s my struggle too so when they don\u2019t, I stress eat :( I want all things to work out well and I turn to eating for comfort. I recently bought a wholesale quantity of tea. I figured why not just drink a bunch of tea, and I went through 4 packs of those lol\n\nI have thought about dating and how it\u2019ll be comforting to have a supportive partner. But you\u2019re absolutely right, no need to add someone to the mix; in this state, that person will just become a \u201cvalidater\u201d for our self worth.\n\nI hope you\u2019ll have fun learning about yourself this week!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2sl89/im_not_going_to_ask_for_your_advice/hfqbv7j/"}
