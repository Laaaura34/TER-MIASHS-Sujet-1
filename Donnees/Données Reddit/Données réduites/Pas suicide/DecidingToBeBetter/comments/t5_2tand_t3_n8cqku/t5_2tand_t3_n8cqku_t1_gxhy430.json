The university provides a service and that is not to raise you. You are not a child anymore (yes I know some are 17 when they enter). My point is you are expecting university to coddle you every step of the way so that you don\u2019t have to be held responsible for your actions. If you chose to go drinking all weekend and got no work done that\u2019s on YOU!!! The university has zero responsibility to tell you not to do that. If you are intelligent enough to attend a university than you should also be able to observe simple cause and effect. When you make poor choices, your productivity, grades and learning suffers. \n\nHonestly, the next thing you\u2019re going to say is that it\u2019s up to your employers to tell you to have good habits and not procrastinate.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8cqku/dont_go_to_college_for_this/gxhy430/"}
