It is amazing to get some bites on applications.  I can't offer specific instructions on next steps, but I will offer this:\n\nHave you ever seen the move Rocky 4?  I bring that up not to be insensitive, because watching movies may the least of your worries right now, but if you have not (and even if you have), Rocky is fighting an seemingly-invincible Russian boxer named Ivan Drago.  Drago has already killed Rocky's friend and champion boxer, Apollo Creed, and Rocky is forced to face Drago against all odds in Moscow on Christmas day.  Around the third round or so, Rocky has been taking a beating, but then one thing happens that turns the tide:\n\nRocky lands a punch.\n\nDrago starts bleeding.  \n\nThis is all it takes.  He got traction.  He drew blood, proving that Drago was a man and not an invincible machine.  That was the first time Rocky truly believed that he could even consider victory over Drago as a possibility.  \n\nWhy do I bring this up?  Because you just drew blood.  You landed a punch through your application, and you've proven that you can gain traction.  So, that's all you need - traction.  \n\nNow you just keep doubling down.  Keep swinging.  Don't get tunnel vision, but also resist the urge to quit with every fiber of your being.  You are not dead.  Take a one-way bus, walk on crutches, hitchhike if you have to.  Just take action, because you never know when or if you will be able to draw blood again.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9mxxy/after_a_month_months_laying_in_a_state_of/g1g2nws/"}
