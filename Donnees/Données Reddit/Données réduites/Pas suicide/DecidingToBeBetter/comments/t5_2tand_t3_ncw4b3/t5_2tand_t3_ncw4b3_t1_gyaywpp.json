I stopped drinking coffee in general. I only give in to coffee after a long day like once a month but other than that I don't drink it at all. I just drink water, juice, coconut and almond milk.\n\nIf you brush your teeth, the smell and feel of toothpaste should be gone within 20-25 minutes so you should just drink coffee at work BUT coffee can make your mouth smell really bad so I would just recommend finding an alternative or if you have one of those fancy bamboo straws you can try consuming coffee through a straw haha.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ncw4b3/i_have_brushed_my_teeth_every_night_and_morning/gyaywpp/"}
