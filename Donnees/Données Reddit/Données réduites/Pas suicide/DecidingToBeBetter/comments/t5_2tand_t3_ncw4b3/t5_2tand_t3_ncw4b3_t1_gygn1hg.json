So, maybe OP finished dinner, chats at table sipping water for five more minutes, cleans up the kitchen and puts the kid\u2019s pj\u2019s on for 15 and then, oh look, it is 20 minutes after the meal and a good time to brush.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ncw4b3/i_have_brushed_my_teeth_every_night_and_morning/gygn1hg/"}
