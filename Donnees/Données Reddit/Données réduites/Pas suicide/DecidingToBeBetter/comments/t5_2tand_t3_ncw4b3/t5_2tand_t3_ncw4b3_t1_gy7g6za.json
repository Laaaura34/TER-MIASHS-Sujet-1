My mouth doesn't smell anymore unless I eat something like onions. I feel more clean in general. I also brush my tongue and use a tongue cleaner on it when brushing my teeth so that makes my mouth even more clean.\n\nI know how hard it is to make it a habit.  I have 2 tips on how to make this a daily habit:\n\n1. Drink A LOT of water 15 minutes before going to bed cause you will have to go pee. Place your toothbrush in a cup or a holder that is IN FRONT of you when you sit down to pee or IN FRONT of you when you stand up to pee (based on your gender or preference). This way you will see the toothbrush and it's just a couple of cm away so all you have to do is reach for it and start brushing.\n\n2. This one is a little weird but worked for me when I started. Put a photo or a poster of a celebrity you find attractive in your bathroom. When you go to the barhroom you have to ask yourself the question \"Would someone as beautiful as she/he would want to kiss/be with me if I don't brush my teeth and my mouth smells?\" This worked efficiently for me cause it made me think that I'm doing it for someone else, not me.\n\nI wish you good luck on your journey!!
