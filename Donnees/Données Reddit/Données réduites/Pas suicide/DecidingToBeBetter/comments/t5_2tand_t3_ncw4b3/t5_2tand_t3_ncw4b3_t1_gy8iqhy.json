Guard it like a treasure!\n\nI'm not much into brushing my teeth but I can relate to the flossing part.  I started flossing my teeth with a water pik about 20 years ago and I think it really paid off.  I'm in my 50's and I have not had any dental issues but my teeth are yellow because of all the tea and coffee I drink.  I go for a cleaning every 5 to 10 years.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ncw4b3/i_have_brushed_my_teeth_every_night_and_morning/gy8iqhy/"}
