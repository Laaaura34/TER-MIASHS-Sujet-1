I personally enjoy the one from humble, the black color makes things easy to see + the double thread does a better job than a single. Ive been brushing my teeth only once a day for my entire life, but I\u2019d like to start doing it in the morning too. Well done, thank you for the inspiration! Good and new habits take time and effort to integrate when they haven\u2019t been there before. Regardless of what others do, I think it\u2019s worth being proud of.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ncw4b3/i_have_brushed_my_teeth_every_night_and_morning/gy7jkx0/"}
