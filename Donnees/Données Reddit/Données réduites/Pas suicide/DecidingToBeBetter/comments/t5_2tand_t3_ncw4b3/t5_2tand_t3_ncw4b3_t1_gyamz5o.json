My front, visible teeth always survived so I was able to ignore the rest because I didn't have to worry about anyone seeing my issues. \n\nI WILL NEVER SKIP A DAY OR NIGHT OF BRUSHING AGAIN! \n\nNot only was it expensive and embarrassing to deal with but I was in so much pain at times that I considered suicide! Don't let it get to this. It's only 2mins in the morning and 2mins at night... don't pretend you don't have 4 extra mins in your day! It's soooooo worth it!
