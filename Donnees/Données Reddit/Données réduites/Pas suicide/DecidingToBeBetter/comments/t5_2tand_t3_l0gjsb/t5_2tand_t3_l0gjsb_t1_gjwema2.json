Thank you for your wisdom. As a 19 year old boy from Los Angeles, the goal to become \"famous\" is something you're surrounded by since birth. To hear that, you don't need to be famous to be loved and to make an impact on the world, really inspires me and I think will shape my future. I realized I don't want to be James Franco when I'm older, but I would rather be you (with about 35 more features ;)) Thanks again.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l0gjsb/35_things_i_wish_i_learned_years_earlier/gjwema2/"}
