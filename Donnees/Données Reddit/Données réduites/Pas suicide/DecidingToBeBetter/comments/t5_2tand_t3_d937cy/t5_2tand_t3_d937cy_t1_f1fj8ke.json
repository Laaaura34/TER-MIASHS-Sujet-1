The last few years have not been terribly kind to me...rather, I should say that between some mistakes I've made and the mistakes/flaws of others, I've been having a rough go, emotionally. Last year, I fucked up and got hurt again as a result, but decided to actually try doing the right things instead of self destructing for once.\n\nFirst, shocking nobody, taking care of myself (therapy, diet, exercise, sobriety) helped immensely. So much, in fact, that I was able to think on things clearly, and after 4 months of simply not having the emotional capacity to break down and cry, I had me one of them there 'cathartic epiphanies' you might hear about.\n\nIt didn't fix anything in and if itself, but it's given me something to work with. It relieved a pressure I didn't know I was feeling.\n\nI don't like crying. I did it a lot as a kid and it has connotations of shame and weakness attached to it. I don't think it truly serves any active purpose - or at least I didn't. I think, now, that allowing yourself to cry (still something I prefer to do in private, of course) shows strength, and also helps to alleviate some of the stress you may not even be aware of. Not crying for no reason, but just allowing yourself to feel genuine feelings. Holding all of it in takes a lot of energy, and it's gonna find its way out one way or another.
