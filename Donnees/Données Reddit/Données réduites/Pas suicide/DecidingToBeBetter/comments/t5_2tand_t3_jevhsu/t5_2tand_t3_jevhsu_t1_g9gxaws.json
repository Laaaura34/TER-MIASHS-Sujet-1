These things have a purpose to them, don't forget that. \n\nPeople are different, they receive different tests and challenges. It'll mess with your head when you start comparing yourself to others. Especially when you don't know their experiences deeply. You're not weak, everyone struggles. \n\nWe're living in an 'age of loneliness' so go easy on yourself. Loneliness has been correlated with things like early deaths or depression. Not to scare you or anything but to give you some awareness that you're not soft. This is a legitimate problem.\n\nTry to find some (non-toxic) people online as a temporary solution. Work on your family as well. Family is a lot more important than any friendship. Do you have any other relatives you may know of? You might also enjoy /r/getdisciplined and its Discord server. \n\nMost importantly, keep praying to God about all of this. Every little thing. May God grant you success and surround you with good company, ameen.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jevhsu/overcoming_loneliness/g9gxaws/"}
