Besides, we *need* to stop telling people that they need to put politeness above their safety in leaving relationships, *immediately*. Maybe it wasn't relevant in OP's situation, maybe it was, sometimes you don't find out until it's too late, but what this anti-ghosting dude doesn't get is that it's not always safe to tell a partner you're leaving them. Sometimes you just need to gtfo.\n\nAnd I *do not care* if that's considered a rude thing to do.\n\nAnd I think not dying and not getting the shit beat out of you and not getting gaslit or manipulated into staying is a great way to decide to be better. Sometimes ghosting is a perfectly acceptable, entirely necessary thing to do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2d978/i_left_a_toxic_relationship/hfnxd9n/"}
