I just started a full stack web dev program a month and a half ago, and I'm loving it. \n\nI just started running! I procrastinate working out because I feel like getting ready to work out, even though it's the same amount of tasks/work as running, is too much. My brain is just like \"nooooo, you don't wanna work out. lay down instead\" lol. \n\nI'm using the Zombies Run app for running, though, and it's a lot of fun. Mixes in a good story element to keep runs interesting.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2d978/i_left_a_toxic_relationship/hfnoagk/"}
