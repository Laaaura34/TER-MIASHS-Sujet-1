I don't have time to type more this weekend (doing a subathon on twitch where I'll be in VR for days), so for now I'd strongly recommend you get Tik-Tok if you don't already have it, and search it for ASD along with ADHD and your current interests. Sounds crazy, but the algorithm in that app will hold a mirror to your brain in a matter of days, and will help you understand what you want out of therapy. It should start serving you neural knowledge pretty quickly, and start unravelling some stuff for you.\n\nMy totally unprofessional, armchair psych nerd opinion is that you have autism. A lot of what you describe sounds like it feels like the world got a manual on how to Human, from the self-care to how conversations work, that you were never given. It also comes with a heaping side of trauma from growing up feeling like an outsider and constantly scared of doing something wrong.\n\nThe comorbidity rate between ADHD and Autism may be as high as 80%. So if you've done some ADHD tests and come out positive, statistically you are very likely to also be on the spectrum.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ptl5om/whenever_i_want_to_do_anything_i_get_paralyzed_by/he1e2ag/"}
