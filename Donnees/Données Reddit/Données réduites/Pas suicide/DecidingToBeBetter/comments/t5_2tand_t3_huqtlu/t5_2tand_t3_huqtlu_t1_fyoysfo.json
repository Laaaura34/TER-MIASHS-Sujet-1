Like I was so scared to look people in the eye but when you practice active listening and really hearing what someone is saying it can be helpful. I also went to this event where a lady taught me about soft stares and a hard stare. When you soft stare you look at both eyes but alternate between the two, a few seconds on one and a few on the other. A hard stare which appears angrier or more forced is when you just stare at one eye. This really helped me because I started focusing on noticing the details in peoples eyes which actually made it was less frightening.  A combination of these two has been so good for me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/huqtlu/eye_contact/fyoysfo/"}
