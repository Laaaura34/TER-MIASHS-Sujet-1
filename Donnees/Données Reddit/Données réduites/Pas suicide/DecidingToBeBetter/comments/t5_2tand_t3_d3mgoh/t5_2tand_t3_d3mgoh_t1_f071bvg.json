If I never complete this list when I get to the big 3 0, I will not feel as if I have failed. I have completed my degree. I will become a teacher by the end of my 6 years of owning my truck driving business and would have made a big enough amount of purchases in real estate to successfully retire with also being a teacher for the next 20 years. \n\nI made this list ,back in the dayy, of stuff I wanted to do and learn because once upon a time there were too many adults in my childhood (for reference im a black who if that gives MORE of a reference(i doubt it personally though)) who decided that I had to prove beyond a doubt that my work was mine. That I actually was *that* smart. \n\nIn comes all the free college and hobbies and whatever's that i slowly began hording like a dragon on a mountain of gold except all this gold is really just my own self defeat and anxiety caused by a fucked up childhood. \n\nSome of this stuff is an intellectual interest. Most of this is me trying to prove something.\n\nThe way I want to move on into an adult would be to take all that stuff, package it up, learn what i can, and relax into an adult hood that i properly earned. It's important to finish up my childhood with actually putting away all the shit i wanted to do and did. Take all that stuff, and package it into a fully grown-ass adult who's learned from his childhood and is willing to be grow where i am planted rather than wish i had blown my leaves and petals elsewhere.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/d3mgoh/3_years_to_real_adult_hood/f071bvg/"}
