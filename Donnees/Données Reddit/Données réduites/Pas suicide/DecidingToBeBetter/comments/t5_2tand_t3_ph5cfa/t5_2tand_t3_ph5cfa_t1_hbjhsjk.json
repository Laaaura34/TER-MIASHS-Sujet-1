I struggle with the same thing. These things you have to do, do you really want to do them? Is it perhaps your intuition telling you that you don't want this job or whatever it is? \n\nIf you truly want to do whatever it is, maybe try this. If I can't get myself to say, mow the lawn (which I hate) I will give myself a simple clear order. Go outside. Forget worrying about it or thinking about how much it'll suck. Just go outside. Usually if I can get myself to do the next single simple step when I am trying to get distracted I can get to the next task. Sometimes it is so bad that I have to manhandle myself through things step by step while my monkey brain tries to distract me the whole way.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ph5cfa/what_are_some_good_excercises_andor_meditations/hbjhsjk/"}
