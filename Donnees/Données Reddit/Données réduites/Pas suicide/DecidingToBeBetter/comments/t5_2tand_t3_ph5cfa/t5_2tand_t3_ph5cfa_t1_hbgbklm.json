Also the Headspace ones but those are only available on Netflix and on their app afaik. There are a lot of meditation/mindfulness apps which not only have meditating sessions but additional information, exercises, tips, etc. All the best for your journey!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ph5cfa/what_are_some_good_excercises_andor_meditations/hbgbklm/"}
