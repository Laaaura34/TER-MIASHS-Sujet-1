I love food, and I am adventurous when trying new things, there isn\u2019t anything I wouldn\u2019t try, (that is an actual dish). And I always loved the fine dining experience. The presentation, the atmosphere, the level of detail, the creativity, the elegance. It\u2019s a captivating and memorable experience for me. And I have always loved watching chefs in the kitchen. It started with watching Hell\u2019s Kitchen during my adolescence. I admired Gordon Ramsay, not so much for the funny outbursts, but for his pure dedication to his craft, his laser focused concentration to detail, and his supreme confidence. It\u2019s something I really respect, he is an expert in his field and that\u2019s something I crave. I was always intimidated because I wasn\u2019t confident enough, but now I\u2019m ready to throw myself with the wolves and prove myself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nadfr7/landed_a_job_as_a_line_cook_my_goal_is_to_become/gxwe4n3/"}
