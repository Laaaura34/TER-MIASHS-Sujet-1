I love that you brought up branding, in this day and age it\u2019s a free resource that would undoubtedly help to boost my career. My only reservation is that I feel like I\u2019m not qualified yet to talk about cooking or promoting that. But that goes back to me fearing the opinions of others. Why shouldn\u2019t I brand myself, and allow people to see my journey? I\u2019ll make a page tonight. \n\nFinancial irresponsibility has plagued me my entire life. Before I worked here I had a comfortable job and was making much more money and had a savings, but with covid I had to tap into it and I\u2019m starting over essentially. Which is fine. I follow pretty much every financial subreddit, I refuse to live paycheck to paycheck for the rest of my life.
