I would like to say to definitely make sure you are taking lots of your downtime to do self care because the chef lifestyle can take a toll on you, the long hours, the hot kitchens, in some places the lack of breaks because the orders can take priority over work breaks. Definitely pace yourself, and make sure you're eating and drinking healthily as well (that is what I wish I had done back in my restaurant days for sure, that would have reduced lots of stress.) \n\nKeep a balanced lifestyle between your job and your other commitments too. Best of luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nadfr7/landed_a_job_as_a_line_cook_my_goal_is_to_become/gxuzwse/"}
