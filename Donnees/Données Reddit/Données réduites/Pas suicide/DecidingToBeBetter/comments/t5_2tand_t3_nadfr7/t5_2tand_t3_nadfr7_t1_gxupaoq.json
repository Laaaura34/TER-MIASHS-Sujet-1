My biggest piece of advice is just don\u2019t get lost. KNOW what ticket you\u2019re on. If you can not do that while overwhelmed slow down and regain your footing. \n\nIt\u2019s better to have food go out a little later but correct than fast and incorrect so that you don\u2019t have to keep remaking the same ticket. \n\nI love my job in that it does push me to be a better me, however once you have a flow to follow it gets easier. Stick with it! Be patient with yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nadfr7/landed_a_job_as_a_line_cook_my_goal_is_to_become/gxupaoq/"}
