There will be a lot of ups and downs and that usually depends on who you are working with. My number one advice is do not let people push you around and know your worth. You seem very passionate which is great, since you are not as confident as you would like to be I would say start watching more cooking shows and videos and trying to learn on your own where there is no pressure. Sadly there will always be high pressure situations in kitchen jobs, but it is only your third week you got this! It takes time but eventually you will know where everything is and memorize all the menu items you need to and stuff will get easier. When I get overwhelmed and feel I am going to mess up, I close my eyes for a moment, breath, and tell myself that I can stop and think for a minute and clear my mind. There will come people who will treat you like garbage and act like they are above you in many ways, but don\u2019t let them tear you down, if they were a good chef they would be a team leader. As it goes for you moving up, it is usually very easy to move up in kitchen positions depending on the restaurant! You got this!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nadfr7/landed_a_job_as_a_line_cook_my_goal_is_to_become/gxtjnmg/"}
