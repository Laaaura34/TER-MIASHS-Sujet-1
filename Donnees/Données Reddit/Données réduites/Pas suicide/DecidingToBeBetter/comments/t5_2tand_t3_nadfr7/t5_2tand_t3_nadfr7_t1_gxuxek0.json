These people will help you out when you are looking to move up the ladder. Be selective though, no reason wasting your time bullshitting with a deadbeat, addict, poor money manager, etc. Look for people in the industry that you admire. \n\nBranding - Try to build up a social media presence. Doesnt need to be influencer level but join some local/regional pages, like them, ask for them to subscribe to you. Put your face with your name. When you are given the opportunity to have a special, take pictures/videos, and put YOUR NAME ON IT. \"Bob's Breakfast Biscuit\" or something. \n\nMoney - Most entry level cook jobs pay shit... dont let that stop you from putting a little bit of money away every week. Start saving now. Eventually a business venture will come along and you want to be in a healthy financial position. There are a bunch of subreddits that can help you budget, save, invest, plan, etc. A lot of Chefs drink their money away. A lot of restaurant owners drink their money away.

Chow chow? Do dinner clubs on your nights off? etc.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nadfr7/landed_a_job_as_a_line_cook_my_goal_is_to_become/gxuxek0/"}
