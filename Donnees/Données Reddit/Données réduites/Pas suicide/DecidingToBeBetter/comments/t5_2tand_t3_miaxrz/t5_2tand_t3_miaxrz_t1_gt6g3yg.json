Things may never be the same because of Covid.  But, prior to Covid you made it this far in life.  \n\nDon't get lost in the negativity.  It's challenging, and you're going to have to proactively catch yourself.  You may need to take a break from the things that are causing you to feel distressed.  \n\nFind something productive/positive to do for yourself.  Talk to people who want to do the same thing or already doing things to keep your mind balanced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFind a way to have fun and laugh a lot. Not at someone's expense, but rather the kind of laughter that makes you feel happy inside.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep pushing through.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/miaxrz/how_does_anyone_stay_optimistic_when_the_world_is/gt6g3yg/"}
