Random bouts of bawling and wanting it to be done surrounded by glorious moments of hope and perseverance. It's not been easy but, it's been a lot better getting rid of Facebook, not watching the news, unsubbing from negative communities have made a big difference aka how i survived. Live in your own world, you aren't gonna save us all, just handle your own struggle. If you have the opportunity to help someone else, do that, but you can't attach yourself to every social justice issue. There are SO many, and yes, they are all awful, but find a way to help one thing and do that. Other people will take care of the others, we've been dealing with these problems for many generations and they will continue on long after you.  I know its so disheartening, but dwelling will do nothing. Live your life, do good, be happy, help those in need and you've done so much more than many humans will ever do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/miaxrz/how_does_anyone_stay_optimistic_when_the_world_is/gt3w2b2/"}
