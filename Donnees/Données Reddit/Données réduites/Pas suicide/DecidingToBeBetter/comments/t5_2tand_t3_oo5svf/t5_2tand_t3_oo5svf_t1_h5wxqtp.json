That said, ease into it, because if you are currently on a different schedule, this is a tough transition to make, for a lot of reasons. \n\nIf you want to make it work, you really need to prioritize your bedtime and preparing yourself for sleep. But this also means accepting that you won't be up to hang out late, or go to concerts, or other evening events (at least not often). And it means you'll likely need to adjust the time that you eat during the day. And accepting that you'll probably be going to bed when the sun is still more or less up during the summer.\n\nMost importantly, if you want to succeed at this lifestyle, the way to do it is to love getting up at that time, not to do it because you've decided that it's somehow healthier or better to be up at that time for whatever reason you chose to tell yourself. At the end of my day, I can't wait for it to be 5AM so I can get up and meditate/read/workout. If I didn't feel that way, I absolutely would not keep doing it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oo5svf/major_life_decision_decided_to_wake_up_at_5am/h5wxqtp/"}
