It starts off the book by telling you to say \"I'm a game designer\". It's not \"I'm becoming...\" or \"I'm learning to be...\". It's \"I am\". Simply by doing it and or starting the process of it, you are now in that role. It applies to a lot of things in life in my opinion. Don't say \"I want to be an artist\" or \"I'm going to be an entrepreneur\". Say \"I am an artist/entrepreneur/etc\". That subtle distinction can make all the difference.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nyq4ee/never_use_this_word_to_describe_yourself_or_your/h1n2dxz/"}
