I was good at it; I understood my importance within the kitchen and enjoyed contributing my part to it. I heard this kind of talk that you got from your manager aaaalll the time. One guy went so hard on this vibe that it came off as more patronizing than saying I was \u201cjust\u201d a dishwasher. I don\u2019t need someone trying overly-hard to make me feel good about my job. Being a dishwasher sucks. You don\u2019t get paid much, you have to stay later than everyone, you get wet and smelly and dirty - I don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll get the job done, but let me be self-deprecating if I want to, dammit! It\u2019s a tiiiny way to vent out the negative feelings that can arise doing work like this, and a way to motivate myself to go beyond the position I\u2019m in -  I\u2019m \u201cjust\u201d this right now, so I will keep my sights on higher-level things.\n\nYour manager isn\u2019t wrong; it\u2019s good to know you\u2019re important and to feel as such. It just sounds very performative of him. I think you can still talk the \u201cjust\u201d way about your position while doing good work and be genuine about it -  you\u2019re \u201cjust\u201d being realistic and honest about how you perceive the position relative to what you /could/ do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nyq4ee/never_use_this_word_to_describe_yourself_or_your/h1pdegy/"}
