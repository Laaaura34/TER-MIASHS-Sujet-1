The above has value on this conversation, but ultimately I didn\u2019t think I was worthy of having self pride due to being at the bottom. I want everyone to know you can have self pride, no matter what. \n\nI never thought this would open such conversations, and I love you all for contributing what you have contributed. It\u2019s all amazing and valuable!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nyq4ee/never_use_this_word_to_describe_yourself_or_your/h1m830p/"}
