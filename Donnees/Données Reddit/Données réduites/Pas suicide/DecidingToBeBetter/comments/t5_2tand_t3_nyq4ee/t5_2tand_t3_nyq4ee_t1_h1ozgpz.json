This wasn\u2019t the only dealer on that road, and I was above minimum wage and I was completely transparent that it was only for the summer and they gave it to me anyway. All that said, from the mgmt side, why pay more when I\u2019ll only be there for three months. I\u2019ll be leaving regardless of the pay, so supply and demand works that way too. Also, I worked hard and developed new thing for the dealership that no one else did. So yeah, I worked hard. Got a great reference out of it when I went on to tutor calculus and again when I was a PM intern for the campus\u2019 construction office. Sometimes it\u2019s about more than just the dollars. Relationships can be worth 10x your wage. It was a stepping stone, not a career. I\u2019m sure of I went back (not now, but when I was still remembered by everyone) I\u2019m sure I would of gotten more. I was content with my pay, and the opportunity to work there and drive porsches all summer. \n\nDo the right thing for the right reason, the money will follow eventually.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nyq4ee/never_use_this_word_to_describe_yourself_or_your/h1ozgpz/"}
