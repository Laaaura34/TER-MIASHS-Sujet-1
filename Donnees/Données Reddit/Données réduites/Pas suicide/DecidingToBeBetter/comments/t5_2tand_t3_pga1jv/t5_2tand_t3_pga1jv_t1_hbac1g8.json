I would love to be in this situation and your age. I would just rent me a van and go exploring. Mobile internet is everywhere. Adventure, traveling and earning money the same time. Making friends on the way. finding/evaluating my goals on the way. Atm it is still warm enogh in europe to do that and autumn is on it's way. \n\nIm jealous XD I find that the things i did without plan were the best, most fun and most memorable i had in my life. bc i had to make decisions on the fly, i was in charge nobody else \n\nThe important is do what you want do not let someone dictate to you. Try out new things. Try to get out of your comfort zone just a little bit and see if you like it \\^\\^", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pga1jv/my_life_feels_directionless_and_i_dont_know_what/hbac1g8/"}
