If you\u2019re not comfortable returning to \u201cnormal life\u201d (I\u2019m certainly not there yet), it can feel quite isolating and just like every day is the same.\n\nBUT, with your salary and the opportunity to work from wherever, you can choose your own adventure. Pick a place you want to try living and go there! Find a hobby you enjoy and do it in your downtime. For me, that has been reading and watching movies, something I feel is worth my time and good for me. And make sure you have heathy routines for yourself \u2014 decent wake and sleep times, exercise, and all that. Remote work and lacking outside responsibilities can really mess you up.\n\nLife is definitely not super exciting at the moment and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re starting your life post-college like this, but there are definitely ways you can make the most of it for now.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pga1jv/my_life_feels_directionless_and_i_dont_know_what/hbctazj/"}
