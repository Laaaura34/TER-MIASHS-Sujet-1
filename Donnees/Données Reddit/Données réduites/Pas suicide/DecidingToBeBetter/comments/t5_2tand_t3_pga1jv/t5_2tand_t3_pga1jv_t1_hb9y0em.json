Life has no meaning. That's a bummer. But there is good news! We get to make our own meaning in this life.\n\nCovid is some shit and I'm sorry it's robbing you of a full experience. But you can still live your life! Don't think of your career as your life. Your career pays the bills and that's it.\n\nWhat else do you like? No wrong answers. What do you do when you're not working? Maybe focus on that! Start a twitch stream or buy comics or build a chair or fly a kite. You're a full grown adult with a full time job. You make your own rules now.\n\nWFH let's you go wherever you want. Do that! Some of us are shackled to a specific location. Not you. Go see the sights and be broke. Or stay home and enjoy some Hulu. If you're enjoying your time, it's not wasted.\n\nOnly you can give yourself a direction. Otherwise you would resent it as an obligation. Search deep inside and find what motivates you.
