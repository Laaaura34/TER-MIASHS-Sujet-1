Did you like any of those dates enough to pursue a relationship, and did you talk about that with them?\n\nEDIT: as a general rule you should avoid talking about \"feeling like a loser\" until you know that they really care about you.  Vulnerability is very important but maybe not the first side of you a stranger should see.  You also mentioned the \"ego boost\" from being in a relationship, Ill tell you, thats not always a lasting feeling.  Maybe youre in it for the wrong reasons?  I dont know you, so i cant make a judgement call based on your personality.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l0rmnv/how_can_i_stop_feeling_like_a_piece_of_garbage/gjytm49/"}
