Other times it was me because I saw that we're going to be VERY incompatible as a couple. I have my standards too. Not even standards, more like boundaries. \n\nI never mention or talk about that. It's a feeling I feel when I'm by myself and that's where it stays. No one except whoever read this post knows about this, or even my lack of success with women. On the contrary, people always think that I'm a total slayer because I'm funny, tall and look quite good but I keep quiet and smirk whenever sex are relationships are brought up.\n\nRegarding the ego boost - maybe it's the needed nudge that will kick me out this infinite loop of negative thought and in the right direction. I know that not all people who get laid are the epitome of happiness, but most of them (at least those that I know) tend to be a lot more confident about relationships and getting women in general. Success breeds success and all that.\n\nThanks for you comment.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l0rmnv/how_can_i_stop_feeling_like_a_piece_of_garbage/gjzjh9p/"}
