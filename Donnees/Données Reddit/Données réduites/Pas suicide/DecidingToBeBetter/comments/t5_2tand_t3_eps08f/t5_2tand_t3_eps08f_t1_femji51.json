But the part that hit home the most with me was when you said: \n\n\"I\u2019m going to smile for no reason. I\u2019m going to laugh at my mistakes. I\u2019m going to focus my energy and attention on the joy instead of the places where i believe it\u2019s lacking\" \n\nUgh... I don't believe in New Years Resolutions but I REALLY REALLY want to lighten up and just smile a lot more. It's so tough because a stone face is all I've known since my teenager years. But the message of your post is something I should remind myself EVERY SINGLE DAY if we want to truly embrace this mindset. \n\nDo you know who Aaron Clarey from assholeconsulting is? He has a YouTube channel with a GREAT video titled \"Do your best then forgive yourself\" and he delves into this topic. I highly suggest you watch it but be weary if you don't enjoy swear words :p \n\nThank you for this post Erin, I for one really connect with this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eps08f/its_time_to_lighten_up_and_not_take_everything_so/femji51/"}
