However I also live a life that is better than so many, and I recognize that. My dad died last year - that was a \u201creal\u201d problem. Losing a 2nd dad that\u2019s been in my life since I was 5 years old which was 5 days after my 1st dads anniversary of his death and 6 days before my 28th birthday. It\u2019s been a very difficult time. But life continues and as time passes - silly little things start to agitate you once again. \n\nJust showing examples of when the chatter gets so loud and I get overwhelmingly stressed about unimportant things, which I felt others could relate to.  Anxious thoughts about things that aren\u2019t important isn\u2019t something that I\u2019m alone in. But that noise can get deafening regardless of how insignificant it actually is.
