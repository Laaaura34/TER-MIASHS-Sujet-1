Be *very* proud that you take your development seriously. It's ok and healthy to take things seriously, we just don't always need to be serious in the process. \n\nWe really have not much control over how we grow up; it's a product of our environment after all. I think it's brave and commendable that you're trying to change yourself and pushing through the discomfort. It's not easy to do but the results will be worth it in the end.\n\nIt's great that you're making positive changes. Just remember, you don't suck and you have amazing things to offer this world. We all do.\n\nI'm publishing a blog soon and have just been gathering feedback from friends so it's not available to the general public at the moment, but if you feel like taking a look, it covers heaps of the topics you just mentioned. I'm guessing a couple additional eyeballs won't hurt. This article in particular is based around this perpetual anxiety.\n\n [https://www.onepercentaday.co/why-do-we-choose-anxiety](https://www.onepercentaday.co/why-do-we-choose-anxiety) \n\nKeep doing you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eps08f/its_time_to_lighten_up_and_not_take_everything_so/femjvyq/"}
