I hope you are proud of yourself for fighting out of that terrible spot you were in, I truly believe you deserve that recognition. \n\nI also believe you deserve praise for taking care of your family when most people(and likely myself included) would have left them for such terrible treatment after taking the steps you have. You\u2019re a strong person with a compassionate soul.\n\nThank you for your hard work, and I hope life only treats you better as you keep taking steps down your path.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pzzxzb/from_mid20s_unemployed_loser_to_successful_late/hf7omqw/"}
