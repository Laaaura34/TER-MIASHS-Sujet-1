It\u2019s becoming their expectation not privilege.\n\nAlso it\u2019s extremely fucked up for your brother to tell you to commit suicide, maybe you\u2019ve lived it so long so you \u201cknow\u201d it\u2019s wrong but it\u2019s been normalized. I cannot state in words exactly how abusive this is. Please get out and cut them off if you need to. Just because you are born family doesn\u2019t mean you need to stick with them no matter what.\n\nAlso I\u2019d recommend a therapist.
