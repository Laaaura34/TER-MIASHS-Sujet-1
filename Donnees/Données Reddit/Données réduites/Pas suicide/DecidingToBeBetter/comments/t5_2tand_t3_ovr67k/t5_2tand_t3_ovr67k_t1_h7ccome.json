Coffee shop, bookstore, gym, dog park, etc. This can open up many different opportunities for you! When people notice you at these spots frequently, you become a familiar face which makes it easier to possibly converse with you compared to striking up a conversation cold turkey. Depending on the place you're at, it can also be an easy topic to start a conversation because you'll have something in common to start off the conversation! From there, if things go smoothly, maybe invite them to go for drinks, or just some other activity outside of where you're at. Hiking, concert, studying if/when you're back in school, video games, etc. Being young is a great thing, but it's even better when you have ample opportunities! Try not to limit yourself and do some things a little outside of your comfort zone, it'll be even better with some friends/companions! Best of luck to you! It seems like you're on the right path of bettering yourself! =)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ovr67k/hello_everyone_im_24m_ive_been_reflecting_of_my/h7ccome/"}
