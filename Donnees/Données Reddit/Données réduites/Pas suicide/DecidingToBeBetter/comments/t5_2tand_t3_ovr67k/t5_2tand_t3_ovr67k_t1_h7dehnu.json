I applied to about 200 jobs during this time and if it's taught me anything, it's rejection only makes you stronger. after all this getting rejected by girls barely hurts anymore. live life to the fullest now!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ovr67k/hello_everyone_im_24m_ive_been_reflecting_of_my/h7dehnu/"}
