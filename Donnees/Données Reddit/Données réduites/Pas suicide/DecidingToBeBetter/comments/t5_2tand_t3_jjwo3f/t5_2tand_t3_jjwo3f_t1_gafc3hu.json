To truly be all of those things you need to do it for yourself, not so others think of you in a certain way because if you do it for others once the praise dies down (which it always does) you\u2019ll just be an empty shell. It needs to be genuine.\n\nSo now to do it for yourself I would say:\n\nMore open, succumb yourself to things that challenge your ideals and tell yourself it\u2019s okay for others to be different. Intelligent, read books/travel. Beautiful, workout, eat healthy, and take care of your skin. Helpful, go find people who need help and help them. Useful, learn lots of skills? Not sure what you mean by this one hahah. Social, go out and socialize. Interesting, once you do all of the above you\u2019ll have tons of interesting stories. Be the person anyone can trust? Do all of this for yourself. Those who seek crowds and praise from others are nothing alone.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jjwo3f/how_can_i_become_that_person_who_everyone/gafc3hu/"}
