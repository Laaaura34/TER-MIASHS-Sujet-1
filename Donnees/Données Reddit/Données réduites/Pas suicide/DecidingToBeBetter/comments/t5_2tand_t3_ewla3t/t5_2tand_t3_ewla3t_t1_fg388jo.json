Each external stimulus (new idea or insight) is a stone that hits water and causes waves and some splashes (your intentions and reactions). Those waves and splashes reach upwards (your actions influenced by desires to be better) - only to fall back to the previous level influenced by gravity - your mental inertia and status quo, ingrained habits, peer group pressures, existing responsibilities etc. etc.\n\nWhile staying with the metaphor - how do you change that? \n\n* add more water so that the whole level is higher than it was before\n* add some structures in the pool so that some of that water that reaches up stays up there even after the initial \"excitement\"\n* any other ideas?\n\nThis metaphorical challenge and possible solutions to it will give you much better view of your predicament", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ewla3t/i_get_really_focused_on_new_things_or_the_early/fg388jo/"}
