They have SO MUCH information that I bet could really help you out! Also, if you want personal accounts from those who have lived through sexual/porn betrayal, feel free to ask questions at r/loveafterporn \n\nAlso my other advice from when I worked for a blog, have a ton of articles lined up (like let\u2019s say one per day or week for the next several months) all set and ready to go, and then just schedule them for posting. So a ton of work up front, but then you just kind of sit back and watch them go! Or work on the upcoming months while the others are posting. Best of luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qetnm4/starting_a_blog/hhwbzjm/"}
