Like everyone's saying, just dive in! There's no \"right time\". One thing that could help is type up the first few posts or so in Word docs, and if you are able to do that than go ahead and setup the actual site.\n\nMy single biggest piece of advice, especially when you're just starting is don't aim for perfect. Get content written and get things out there first, and as you start building an audience, then move towards perfection. Of course, that doesn't mean do a half-done job with the writing, but aim more for \"good enough\" rather than perfect. Before I rebooted my blog, I was falling down that hole a lot.\n\nI would also second the other people here talking about the trolls- I think your idea is a great one but I also feel like you're going to get a lot of trolls. I haven't had this problem because I do a technology blog with some self-improvement stuff (its a fairly personal blog), but at the same time I've learned to build thick skin. If you're hesitant on this part, keep comments off and don't add a contact form (even if you do have a contact, I would spell out some rules).\n\nI don't know of this helps, but good luck!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qetnm4/starting_a_blog/hhw1d7j/"}
