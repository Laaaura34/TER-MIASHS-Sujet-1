Outgrowing your past, and letting positive change overwhelm the negatives. That is the first step you take. \n\nBut before you do, accept that you made mistakes. Accept that even you are human, and with self-improvement, a human that deserves to be forgiven, and loved. This takes work. With forgiveness, I mean that you forgive yourself. \n\nThe fact that you are aware of your mistakes, and willing to change is already a large step forward. Write every single thing that you did down. Just for yourself. Confront them head on. Ask yourself why you did the things you did, and what you can do to never be that person again.\n\nAnd then let go. It is then time to look forward, and not dwell in the past.\n\nI myself have made a big mistake a few years back. I was punished. I still get judged by those who know. And to this day still feel guilt, and shame. However, I have come to realise that I have changed. So day by day, it becomes less, and less of a negative feeling. Still a part of me, but a mere memory now.\n\nA trait to consider making your own, is to stop caring what people think of you. Easier said than done, I know. But it will aid the process.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jgwjuf/how_do_you_outshine_your_mistakes/g9th3h7/"}
