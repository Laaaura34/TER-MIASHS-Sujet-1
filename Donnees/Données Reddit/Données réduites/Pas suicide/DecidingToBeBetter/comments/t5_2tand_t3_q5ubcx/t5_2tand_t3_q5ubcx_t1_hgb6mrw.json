Perfect sample size. Style didn't matter. After 1st pregnancy, my foot grew to 6.5. After my 2nd pregnancy, my shoe size was a 7! Weird right? However about a decade later, my foot goes back down to a 6.5, but now I HAVE to try on the shoe. Because now style matters. For the most part, I'm 6.5. But there are some styles that I have to go up half size. Do you have any idea how many shoes I have given away over the years?!? It makes me wanna cry. I was a shoe whore and owned TONS of shoes.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ubcx/i_finally_went_up_to_a_womens_size_10_and_now_my/hgb6mrw/"}
