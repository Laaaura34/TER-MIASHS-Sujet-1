She has teammates ranging in age from 11 to 13. Some of these teenage girls wear the same size shoe that I do (I\u2019m a 10.5 in men\u2019s). My daughter just went to a size 7 wide cleat (8 in women\u2019s) and is now more comfortable and playing better. Making fun of someone for their shoe size is an odd thing to me because people can\u2019t control the size of their foot. Never even knew that was a thing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ubcx/i_finally_went_up_to_a_womens_size_10_and_now_my/hga3u6s/"}
