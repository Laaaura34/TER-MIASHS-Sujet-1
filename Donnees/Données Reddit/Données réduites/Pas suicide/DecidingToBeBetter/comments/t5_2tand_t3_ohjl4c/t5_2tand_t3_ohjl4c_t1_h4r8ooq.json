You have a solid foot in the door. \n\nAs far as my own coping mechanisms, mindfulness has played a big role for me. I try and meditate, take a long walk, or do yoga at least once per day. Honestly OCD is weird and unique because it almost sneaks up on you. Like you don\u2019t know it\u2019s an intrusive thought until you\u2019ve convinced yourself you simply ARE what you\u2019re afraid you are, and you\u2019re spiraling. \n\nMindfulness brings you back to the moment. It doesn\u2019t take OCD away necessarily, but it helps you make peace with the intrusive thoughts. Like yeah, maybe I am a sociopath, psychopath, narcissist, animal abuser, /insert other random \u201cbad thing\u201d here/. But right now, I\u2019m just breathing and that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to do. Or right now, I\u2019m just sitting in my chair and looking at my phone on Reddit. I\u2019ve been doing daily affirmations too, telling myself I am the things I want to be, reminding myself my choices are what make me who I am, not my thoughts. And right now, I\u2019m choosing to be here, and that\u2019s all.\n\nKeep doing what you\u2019re doing. Say 5 nice things about yourself to yourself everyday if you can. Take a few minutes to meditate, if it\u2019s your thing. Really get to know yourself. Ask your therapist about CBT if you feel comfortable, if they haven\u2019t already been practicing it with you. Stop and take time to reward yourself for being you. You\u2019re on the right sub, friend. You\u2019re deciding to be better. One step at a time. \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ohjl4c/decided_to_quit_consuming_porn_and_start_becoming/h4r8ooq/"}
