You say you\u2019re on antidepressants, so you\u2019re seeing a therapist I\u2019d assume. Why not ask them to help you with social anxiety and your eating habit? I\u2019d say once you have those sorted out, move out, get a fresh start, so you can show the world who you really are, you do need to work on yourself first, otherwise you\u2019ll end up in the same situation. Deleting social media really helped, I wasn\u2019t being bombarded with what my friends were doing, and it almost felt like I had moved, since I never saw anyone I knew. I could focus on myself and those around me, not people who I\u2019d never see if I deleted social media. I know you live in a small town, but still.\nEdit: try time restricted feeding, the timer starts when you ingest anything that isn\u2019t water btw. Eat within a 12 hour period, study\u2019s have showed that consuming the same amount of calories (and even when the diet is poor) but in a 12 hour period people have less body fat and are biologically healthier.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/os25f7/how_do_i_go_about_reinventing_and_changing_my/h6lt0qv/"}
