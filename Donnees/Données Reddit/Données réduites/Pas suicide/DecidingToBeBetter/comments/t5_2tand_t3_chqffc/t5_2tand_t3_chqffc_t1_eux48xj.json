A sport, a hobby, a craft, social skills. Working on something gives you confidence and can also help you tune into yourself, you learn more about yourself. Find a job. It will improve your social skills and give yourself more confidence even if not right away but in the long run. No girl or person is going to make you feel better about yourself. Even if they did, what happens if they leave you? Now you don\u2019t have that person to make you feel better about yourself anymore, and you\u2019re back at square one, except even worse because you\u2019re heart broken. So you have to learn to be enough for yourself. Have intention to accept yourself even if you don\u2019t know how right away. And then aim to become friends with yourself. And then if you don\u2019t like something about who you are, or rather maybe just the habits of your routine life, do something about it. Yea it\u2019s hard, yea it\u2019s easy to just give up and continue your usuals habits, but that\u2019s what makes it rewarding if you go through this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/chqffc/how_do_i_stop_being_a_loser_who_cant_talk_to/eux48xj/"}
