You need to step back fully and watch your thoughts first. Note them, let them go, breathe, note them, let them go etc.. (to simplify)\n\nWhat meditation strives to do is sit with your thoughts but to explore them as something different than yourself. It's very easy to get tangled up in them or walk the same paths to the same conclusions. A short daily practice I think would help everyone. If 15 minutes is too much to start I dare you to do 2 minutes of breathing (in through the tip of your nose / hot air out the mouth) focusing just on the air temp and lungs. This is something that will help but I'm sure you know that it takes time and practice for the real benefits to start showing up in your life.\n\nAlso a lot of what you're saying could perhaps be made clear by Carl Jung and his idea of the shadow self and shadow work, It seems like you really don't like parts of yourself, or have little faith in yourself. Like I said I can relate, I'm 34, and if I had to guess it seems like you're younger than me and if I could give advice to myself when I was younger it'd be this... you need to ease up on yourself, take some deep breaths and enjoy life exactly as it is - shitty subjectivity and all.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/madmt0/my_entire_life_ive_hated_that_so_much_is/gruuawt/"}
