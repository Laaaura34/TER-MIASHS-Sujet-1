It started making me believe something was wrong with me.\n\nI now regret how I lost my virginity hugely. I was so caught up in feeling left behind that I was blind to a lot of red flags that lead to a very traumatic relationship. I was so desperate to fit in that I ended up isolating myself. I ended up with a man who raped me multiple times throughout our relationship. A man who didn\u2019t respect me, who control and manipulated me, who made my life a living hell.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to say you\u2019ll fall into the same traps as I did, but I want to caution you, that it\u2019s probably not worth chasing. It doesn\u2019t matter when you lose your virginity or if you ever do, what matters is that you do it when you feel it\u2019s right, you do with someone you trust, you do it when you feel comfortable and safe and happy. It doesn\u2019t have to be with someone you want to spend the rest of your life with, just make sure it\u2019s someone you trust.\n\nOtherwise to address everything else, don\u2019t stress, your 20, there\u2019s so much more time, the pandemic will calm down eventually and we\u2019ll get to a new normal where we can live our lives again. You\u2019ll get the chance to do everything you want to do and more. Don\u2019t stress.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ox1d92/how_to_get_rid_of_the_feeling_that_time_is/h7joo7x/"}
