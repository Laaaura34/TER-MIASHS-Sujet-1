Regarding career tho, just let it go and be glad with your progress. I had that same feeling when I was 18, slugging through uni and work 3 jobs to pay for my tuition. All of my high school classmates went to better schools, some even went to ivy league schools. Now? I have only a small amount of student loans, a house, a car and im only 22. It's okay. You'll find your way, just put yourself out there and take every opportunity you can get, especially at your age.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ox1d92/how_to_get_rid_of_the_feeling_that_time_is/h7mvv35/"}
