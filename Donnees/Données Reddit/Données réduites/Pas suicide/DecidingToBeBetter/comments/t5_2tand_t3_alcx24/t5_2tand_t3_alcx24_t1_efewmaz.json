I have been in that shitty loop for quite a awhile now. Last week I deactivated my Facebook page. I quit smoking for a second time. I have 3 young boys that are looking up to me in this hard time in all of our lives(moving across the country and a divorce in the past 3 years) and I can\u2019t let my depression take over. It is a huge struggle, but posts like this keep me going. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your post. I hope this can get through to many more people in here.
