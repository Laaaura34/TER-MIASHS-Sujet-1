I woke up with the worst depression I\u2019ve had in years (Or at least I feel it now). It\u2019s because I have decided to go deeper, and feel my feelings rather than masking them. I accept that there is nothing wrong with me, I am depressed because of certain reasons and I am accountable for my life. I do not have a chemical inbalance. I feel unwell, and sometimes diseased, and so I pray for ease, peace and strength. I am not a religious person, but let me tell you I am praying today.\n\n I\u2019m going to rest for a couple of hours, then I\u2019m going to see a doctor, and then I\u2019m going to see another doctor right after. Today I was unable to take responsibility for the commitments that I have set up for myself. I will look at that. Tomorrow I will write. The next day I will see another doctor. I\u2019m going to try and reach out to all of the resources that I can to avoid disability. I\u2019m praying for strength. Please pray for me. Today is so much.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/alcx24/advice_improve_your_life_by_engaging_deeper_never/efdqa3l/"}
