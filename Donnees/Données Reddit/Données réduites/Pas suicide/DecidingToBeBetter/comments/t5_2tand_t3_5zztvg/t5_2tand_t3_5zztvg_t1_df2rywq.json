First you should really know that. People are utterly crushed by far less.\n\nBut it is not impossible. \n\nI agree that trying to psych yourself up into feeling beautiful by doing your nails and makeup is just surface. It probably helps a bit but what you really need is confidence in your worth.\n\nI think the best way to get that is by doing something for someone else. Volunteer with a community mental health center or find a way to directly impact the lives of people less fortunate than you. It will give you perspective on being valuable and no one can detract from your actions, regardless of your appearance.\n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/5zztvg/how_to_accept_myself_for_what_i_am/df2rywq/"}
