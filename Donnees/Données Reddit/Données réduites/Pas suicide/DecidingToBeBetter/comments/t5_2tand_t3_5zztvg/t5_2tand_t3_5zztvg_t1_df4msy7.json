When I left my ex about a year ago, I didn't take very much. Just what I could fit in my car. So I don't have a lot to clutter up with (despite the fact that my sister-in-law is begging me to go out and buy everything off the shelves of Bed, Bath and Beyond) but I do tend to get a little crazy(ier?) when my tiny kitchen is out of sorts or when I let the laundry pile up even more than it should considering it's just me. Maybe a usual ritual is right up my alley. \n\nI know the kind of activity I *want* to try but I'm terrified. All of my life (I thank my brother and father for this) I've been fascinated and felt a calling for the martial arts. Jeet Kun Do, Kung fu, BJJ, Wing Chun specifically, I am dying to take one I really am but I'm just scared that I'm going to get in there and the entire class stares the whole time or the sensei/sifu laughs in my face. I know it's a 5% chance that they will do that but it's there anyway. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/5zztvg/how_to_accept_myself_for_what_i_am/df4msy7/"}
