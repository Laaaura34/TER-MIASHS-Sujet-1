Every part of your post resonated with me. Thank you for the book recommendation.  I read Radical Acceptance and felt so great for like 2 weeks. When I tried to re-read it to get the feeling back, I couldn't get through it again so soon.\n\nLast night I ate gross junk food and stayed up until 3am watching TV. I responded with all 4 feelings you mention. I literally woke up in the night with guilt and reprimands. \n\nEven though I am 20 pounds overweight,  I feel like it's 100 extra pounds. Even though I lifted weights for 20 minutes yesterday,  I felt ashamed that I put forth such weak effort. \n\nI am so worn out of not meeting my own expectations.  I will check out that book right now.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5732u/punishing_yourself_does_not_get_you_closer_to/hg57lsy/"}
