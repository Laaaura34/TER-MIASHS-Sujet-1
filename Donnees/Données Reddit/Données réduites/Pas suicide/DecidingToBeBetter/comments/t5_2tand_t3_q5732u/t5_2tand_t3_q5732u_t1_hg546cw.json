YOU SOUND LIKE MY THERAPIST.  Also he told me that it is okay to change goals. If they are literally out of reach (I had to change careers because I can physically no longer do mine/my future), then you will always be depressed because you can't reach that goal. If you have a good, but doable one, even if VERY HARD, then you can be proud of yourself because you can make steps towards it. So I changed careers and now have a whole set of goals to make, like grant writing, and fluency in French.
