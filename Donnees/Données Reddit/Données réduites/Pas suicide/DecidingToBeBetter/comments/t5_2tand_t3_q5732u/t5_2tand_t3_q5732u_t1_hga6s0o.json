I have punished myself many times over the years, especially in the last year and a half, and I ended up doing it again today due to something minor. I feel like I'm switching between loving myself and hating myself. Years ago I thought that I would always be a nice and respectful person, now I'm only half of that and thank god it's to my family members and not to friends or strangers. I'm just sick of this and i would rather die than repeat the same mistakes over and over again.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5732u/punishing_yourself_does_not_get_you_closer_to/hga6s0o/"}
