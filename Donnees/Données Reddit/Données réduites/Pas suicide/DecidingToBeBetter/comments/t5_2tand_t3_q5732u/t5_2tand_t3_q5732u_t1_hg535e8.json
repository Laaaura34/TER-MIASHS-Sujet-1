It means that you know other people say you should value these things, but rather than choose new values you attack yourself for not *already* conforming with this perceived majority opinion.\n\nWhen you attack yourself, you actually reinforce your pre-existing belief that these things are horrible and can only be pursued under the lash of a whip. No person pursues something that they believe is horrible. Whilst you're doing this, you're also reinforcing your pre-existing belief that it's so important to conform to the perceived majority opinion that you should do so at the expense of your mental health.\n\nOf course, the outcome is that you don't pursue these things, but destroy your mental health anyway.\n\nThis doesn't mean you give up on those things - it is human nature to be invigorated by eating nutritious food, to feel better in a healthy, non-overweight body and to be nourished mentally by skilled activities rather than vegetation in front of screens. That said, if you do not currently believe in these things you cannot ignore the need to undergo a process of belief change first - this means that when you attack yourself, you drop the battle and say \"clearly, my task is not *executing* these things but learning to value them in the first place, so for now I'll cease my execution of these tasks an start working on my opinions about their value in my life\".", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5732u/punishing_yourself_does_not_get_you_closer_to/hg535e8/"}
