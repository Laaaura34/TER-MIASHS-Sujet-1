Percs are short for Percocet, a brand name, which contain acetaminophen.  The whole perc or perk 30 is just a misnomer.  Percocet only goes up to 10mg of oxycodone.  I assume that by 5g a day you are talking about the acetaminophen otherwise you would have been taking 500 Percocets a day which I seriously doubt...  Roxy is the brand name for oxycodone instant release and Oxycontin is the brand name for oxycodone extended release.  The Roxy's go up to 30mg and contain no other active ingredients besides oxycodone.  Oxycontin, which is short for Oxycodone Continues at one point went up to 120mg per pill but it was discontinued and now the max is 80mg a pill.\n\nSorry I am not trying to be a dick I just really hate the term \"perk 30\" because it is misleading and inaccurate.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g6vzsj/dropped_my_narcissist_bf_my_drug_habit/foshgit/"}
