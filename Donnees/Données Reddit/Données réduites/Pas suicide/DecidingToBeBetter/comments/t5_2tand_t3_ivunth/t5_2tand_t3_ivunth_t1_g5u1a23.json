There are a lot of scholarship and loan options out there. Its just tough when you don't have someone to cosign or have a low GPA. I really only screwed up one semester luckily so once I fix that I should be okay.\n\nMy goal right now is to go back to school super-part time (like taking 2 classes), hope I can get some help paying through programs at work until I get my GPA back up, and then go from there. But its definitely tough knowing I am going to be scrapping pennies just to pay for gas for the next sereval months.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivunth/i_went_from_no_hs_diploma_job_or_car_to_working/g5u1a23/"}
