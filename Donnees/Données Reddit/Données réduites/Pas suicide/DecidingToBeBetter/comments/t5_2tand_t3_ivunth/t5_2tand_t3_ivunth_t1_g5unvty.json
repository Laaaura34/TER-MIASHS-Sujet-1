I want you to know you need to be proud of getting a job. You didn't have to apply but you did. You didn't have to interview but you did. You showed up. That is a victory in itself. \n\nThere is no timeline on school. So if you have to do one class at a time, that is what you need to do. I would figure out the exact cost of one class. Make that phone call. And it might take a few calls to get the right person on the phone. Once you know the exact cost, you can now know the monster you need to slay. $300-600 sounds about right. So that is $50-$100 a paycheck for 6 months. That sounds like a lot of money but you can figure it out. See if there is a payment plan. See what else you can do. You are standing next to a brick wall but bricks isn't impossible to break, just harder. \n\nThen.. and this part is important... take school seriously. You can do it!!! Get that one class done and register for another at the end of the semester. Or two if your financial situation gets better or they offer you a grant. You are in a hole but you'll dig yourself out.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivunth/i_went_from_no_hs_diploma_job_or_car_to_working/g5unvty/"}
