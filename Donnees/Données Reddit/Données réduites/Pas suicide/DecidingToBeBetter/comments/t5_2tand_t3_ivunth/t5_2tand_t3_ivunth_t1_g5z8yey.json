Going out every so often is encouraged actually. Celebrate when crush a test! Allow yourself to blow off some steam. It is important. But do it responsibly and only when you\u2019ve earned it. \n\nBalancing work and school was tough. I made sure I chipped away at my classes every day instead of letting anything pile up at the last moment. Make relationships with your professors. This is key to good grades. If you need extra help, ask them for it. They make the tests after all... they know exactly what to study. \n\nMake lists and manage them. School is overwhelming because of all the dates and assignments and deadlines. \nI made a list of everything I needed to do for the week in school then broke it out into what I would do each day. I knew of I took it day by day, by the end of the week, it would all be good. \n\nHope that helped and thanks for reading!!\u2019", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivunth/i_went_from_no_hs_diploma_job_or_car_to_working/g5z8yey/"}
