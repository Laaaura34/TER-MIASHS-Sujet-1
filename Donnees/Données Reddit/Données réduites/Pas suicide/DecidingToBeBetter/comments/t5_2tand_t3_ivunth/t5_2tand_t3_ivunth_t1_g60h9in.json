This helps me reflect in my life too. A few years ago I managed to get everything I wanted and it was the happiest time of my life!! But then I broke out of my good habits, and I lost almost all of it. \nI was broke, I lost my friends, my reputation, my skills, my body, and most importantly my mental health. Confidence was the biggest thing to me and that turned into awkwardness. That whole year got worse and worse and the depression hit. And not to mention, but I started being really insecure and comparing myself to others. I thought about how bad my childhood was.\n Sometimes I would have a good grind but it never lasted and I kept failing. I want to be better than ever now. But Everytime I try, I just give up. But your story inspires me! I know I will win and be successful. Just small steps. Thanks for the hope!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivunth/i_went_from_no_hs_diploma_job_or_car_to_working/g60h9in/"}
