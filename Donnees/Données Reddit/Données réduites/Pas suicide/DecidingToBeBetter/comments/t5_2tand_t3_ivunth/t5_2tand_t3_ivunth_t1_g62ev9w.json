I've been unable to find employment in my field and it doesnt help my mental health at all seeing all my classmates job hopping and finding the job of their dreams when I've been to 7 interviews and none of em worked out. This year has been hard and your story is really what I needed to kick myself and just work harder and smarter. Gonna read your post whenever I need a motivation booster!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivunth/i_went_from_no_hs_diploma_job_or_car_to_working/g62ev9w/"}
