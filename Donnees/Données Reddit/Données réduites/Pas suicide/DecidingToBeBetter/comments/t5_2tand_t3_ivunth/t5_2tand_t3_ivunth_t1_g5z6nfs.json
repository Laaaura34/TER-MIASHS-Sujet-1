Most of my college career was spent worrying I was doing all this for nothing. Not being able to get a job. And part of me wonders if the internship didn\u2019t land on my door step, where I\u2019d be. So I totally get where you\u2019re coming from. \n\nBut that is everyone who goes to college. No one has a job lined up the day they enroll for school. That part is about taking a chance on yourself. \n\nI always felt the stuff I \u201clearned\u201d in school wasn\u2019t nearly as important as the life skills I learned and the way I learned to think. And those things are what makes you a valuable employee, regardless of what you studied. I went from taking intermediate algebra (the class BEFORE college algebra) and worked way up to linear algebra. And on the first day of both classes I had a thought \u201chow am I ever going to learn this?\u201d But I did. And it taught me that no matter what is in front of you, you will learn it. I know how to learn quickly because of college. I know how to be independent and find the answers. I know how to work in groups. I know how to ask for help. And most importantly, college taught me for the juggle lots of tasks and meet deadlines. Sure I learned economics theory and how to run regressions and build models... but I don\u2019t do any of that in my job. I use excel and a calculator to balance budgets. \n\nIf a job is what you\u2019re worried about, choose a degree that isn\u2019t entirely useless and you\u2019ll do fine.
