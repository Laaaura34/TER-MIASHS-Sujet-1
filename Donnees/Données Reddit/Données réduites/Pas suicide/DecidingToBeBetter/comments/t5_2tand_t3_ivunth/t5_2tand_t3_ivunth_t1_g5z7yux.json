And a lot of the studying was during class. Paying attention and sitting the front is literally the same as studying but the person who made the test is giving you the answers (the professor). I didn\u2019t have much of a social life throughout my college career but I didn\u2019t have much of one before either so it wasn\u2019t a big deal. \n\nOne of the most important things is learn how you learn. It might sound like extra work but be introspective after each study session and ask yourself \u201cam I absorbing the material?\u201d And if you feel like you aren\u2019t, try a different technique. The internet is full of ways to study. I found my best way was the ask questions in class, find a study group, and each of us teach each other a portion of the lectures/lessons. This was key and took me 2 years to finally figure out. I wish I did it sooner. \n\nHope that helps and good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivunth/i_went_from_no_hs_diploma_job_or_car_to_working/g5z7yux/"}
