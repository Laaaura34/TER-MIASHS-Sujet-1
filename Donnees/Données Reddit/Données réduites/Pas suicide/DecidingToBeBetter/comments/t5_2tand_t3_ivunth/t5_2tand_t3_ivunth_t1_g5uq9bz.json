I didn't want to be TOOOOO wordy in my original post but YES. I needed to teach myself how to do stuff I didn't want to do. \"Grit\" is the word I used. I realized that aspects of your life in one area carry over to others. \n\nI ran/biked/worked out. I honestly hate it. Even now. But working out is actually a lot easier to break that \"JUST DO IT\" barrier than sitting down to study. Convincing yourself to do stuff you don't want to do is a skill that takes practice. So I practiced by running when I didn't want to. I also listened to a LOT of motivational speeches. I felt really corny at first and most of them had to do with working out and being buff, which totally wasnt me. But it became very applicable to studying and school. I suggest starting with Les Brown and go down the rabbit hole from there. I can still repeat word for word some of those speeches and they still get be through tough days. \n\nTowards the end of my senior year I was really burnt out. Economics, by no means, is the hardest undergrad degree but it wasn't easy either. I had been in school for so long at that point... I really started not caring as much. My grades went from straight A's to B's and a C in Financial Business Management. I had my eyes set on my aerospace job more than school as well and those last few classes felt like chore. But I never gave up.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivunth/i_went_from_no_hs_diploma_job_or_car_to_working/g5uq9bz/"}
