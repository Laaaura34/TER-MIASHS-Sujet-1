It was hard to organize my thoughts and there is plenty I left out as to condense it the way I did. One thing I didn't mention was that I applied for the job I'm currently in FOUR times. My foot in the door to the company I'm in was in a department I didn't like. But I knew eventually I could get to the place I am in now if I kept at it. I applied four times and every time, someone more qualified than me got the job. But the fifth time, they gave it to me. 10 \"No's\" and a \"Yes\" is a \"Yes\".", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivunth/i_went_from_no_hs_diploma_job_or_car_to_working/g5uo9m1/"}
