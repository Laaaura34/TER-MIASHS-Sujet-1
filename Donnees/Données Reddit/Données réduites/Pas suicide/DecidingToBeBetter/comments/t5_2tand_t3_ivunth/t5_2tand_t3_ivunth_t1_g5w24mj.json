I\u2019ve kind of been struggling during the pandemic in a number of ways, but tbh Ive been struggling before the pandemic as well. I\u2019ve kind of lost a lot of the people I used to rely on, and I feel as though I have no one to turn to (besides my family). I recently graduated earlier this year( bachelors) and have been looking for a job ever since. It\u2019s been hard, because I don\u2019t really have a network of people anymore, and I have a lot of regrets about not keeping in touch with enough people I met in college. In the meantime I\u2019m about to start a part time job to save up a little money, and I\u2019m applying to a large number of jobs everyday. Not a lot of them are responding but I\u2019m getting some replies. I have an interview next week with a pretty good company that seems out of my league experience wise. But I\u2019m gonna go in hoping for the best. And if it doesn\u2019t work out, I\u2019ll of course keep pushing forward applying for jobs until I get something. This story definitely reminded me there\u2019s a light at the end of the tunnel.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivunth/i_went_from_no_hs_diploma_job_or_car_to_working/g5w24mj/"}
