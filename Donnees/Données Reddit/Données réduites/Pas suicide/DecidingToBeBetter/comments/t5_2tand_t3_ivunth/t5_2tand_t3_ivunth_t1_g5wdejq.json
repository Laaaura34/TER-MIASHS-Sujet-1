I went from a higher paying tech job that I got with an AS degree, which I thought I\u2019d just cruise into retirement on. \nThat didn\u2019t happen. When I was 52, I was surplused, my office closed, tech job went away.\n\nI\u2019ve always been interested in finance but now personal financial investing can be done, very well I\u2019ve heard, by subscribing to an app that advises you and might have some human support available.\nI\u2019ve always been interested in economics because it\u2019s a lot of theory and not just portfolios and crunching numbers. \nIn short, after many personal setbacks, like filing for bankruptcy for the 3rd time, I\u2019m going to pursue my goal of getting a ba in economics. \n\nI really like your side notes condensing what you did yourself, in your struggle, to achieve your goals. People tell me I should \u201cjournal\u201d and write down my feelings and show my progress, I don\u2019t have time for that! I like your idea of making a simple list, which prioritizes the progress you\u2019ve made and shows it by crossing off your accomplishments. It\u2019s so simple but yet so damn powerful enough and effective. \nI have to be going now but I would like to hear more of your philosophies and goals for the future.\nThanks.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivunth/i_went_from_no_hs_diploma_job_or_car_to_working/g5wdejq/"}
