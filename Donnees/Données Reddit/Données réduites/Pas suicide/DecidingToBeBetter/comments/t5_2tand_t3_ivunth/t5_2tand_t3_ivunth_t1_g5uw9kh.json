Going to school is a HUGE sacrifice when employment is an uncertainty. It was one my biggest fears entering the bigger university. But when I originally entered community college, I wanted to be a sociologist. I took a bunch of classes in that field and it actually ended up being my minor. I chose economics because it it was in the same field as sociology but yielded much higher job options. But my dream was to be a city planner or work on a school board. I never thought in a million years my education would put me in the aerospace industry. You career or path might change. But being open to opportunities and making real connections with professionals will lead you to a path you'll be happy with.
