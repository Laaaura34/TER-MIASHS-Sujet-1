Thank you so much. Multiple points in your story almost had me tearing up but I kept it together, haha! This hit me hard.\n\nMy story has some parallels to yours & I haven't reached the pinnacle you have, yet, but I've made gigantic strides. Reading this is such a push to keep going. \n\nHonestly dude, I'm so proud of you. What a fucking awesome example of the power behind taking responsibility for your own life & believing in no limits. \n\nDon't stop there. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivunth/i_went_from_no_hs_diploma_job_or_car_to_working/g5vdqiv/"}
