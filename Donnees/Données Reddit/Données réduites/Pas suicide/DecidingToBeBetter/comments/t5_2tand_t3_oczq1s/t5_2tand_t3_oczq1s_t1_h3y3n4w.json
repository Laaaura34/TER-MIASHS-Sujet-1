Let it all out. I repressed so much after I moved out. At 27 I still hold onto the past a lot. It's PTSD I'm guessing. But, crying is part of accepting and understanding the pain. \n\nNo one should make you feel bad for feeling upset or sad about something. Anyone who does is saying a lot more about themselves. \n\nI know it sounds easier said than done, but please move. You are stronger than you think you are and you deserve to live a happier life. \n\nIf your parents make you feel bad for feeling sad, they're the ones with problems not you. \n\nAny sensible, kind human being would understand that life has its ups and downs and crying is not weak or bad, no matter what age you are. \n\n*hugs* You are strong and I believe you want a better life. Take a leap of faith, and move. You deserve more.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oczq1s/as_an_adult_with_problems_im_just_wondering_if/h3y3n4w/"}
