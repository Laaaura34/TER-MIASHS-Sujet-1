My partner also has parents that would scream and yell and hit him and the like. He blamed himself for a lot of it but in reality a parent should never treat their child that way (even if their child is an adult). \n\nI don't know if you have access to mental health resources nearby but I encourage you to try therapy if you can. Google is your friend and you can use incognito mode on mobile and PC if you're worried about search history being seen. I would also try to move out asap, if you are financially struggling and cannot afford to there may be nonprofits nearby or abuse aid organizations that you can contact and ask for help or info. Things may be kind of slow but keep in mind that slow progress is better than no progress.\n\nYou are not a freak and what you're feeling is more normal than you may realize - it's ok to feel unwell when you don't feel safe or loved. The best thing you can do is get whatever help you can, which you've already started just by posting here.
