Our brains produces chemicals when we have emotions, and you can cry from anything, happiness, sadness, frustration and anger. This is because your brain made so much of that chemical it needs to get some of it out *instead* of absorbing it. To put it simply, you don't feel so intensely that thing for as long. Your brain got some of it out for you.\n\nIt can ease your stress and tension to cry. If anything helps, and it isn't harmful, do it.\n\nSide note. I'm 30, an I have a stuffed beagle I got when I was 13 I still cuddle and sleep with when I'm stressed, sad or scared.\nMy partner DGAF, and even got me a pikachu from Build-a-bear that is giving the old boy a break. Somethings will always be ok, do what you need to to find your center. Best permission I ever gave myself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oczq1s/as_an_adult_with_problems_im_just_wondering_if/h3z0axl/"}
