You need to try to find your own place. I got a divorce when I was 24 and moved in with my dad for a couple months. It's really hard for two males to live in the same house. Kind of like when lions chase the males out of the pride when they get old enough. I don't know what your story is man, but it's good to feel your emotions. It's not good however to not do anything to help the situation if it is causing these emotions over and over. We can't feel sorry for ourselves, but we can feel upset. There is a big difference. If you are feeling sorry for yourself, then do something about it. Have the strength to stand up and do what it takes so you don't feel that way again and again. If your upset because of something that happened, then understand it's something you can't do anything about and it's okay to be upset. And don't let anger take you over. We feel we need to do that to stop what ever is making us sad, use your words and keep calm ever if you are upset. Don't let your emotions get out of control. Good luck man.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oczq1s/as_an_adult_with_problems_im_just_wondering_if/h3xujfb/"}
