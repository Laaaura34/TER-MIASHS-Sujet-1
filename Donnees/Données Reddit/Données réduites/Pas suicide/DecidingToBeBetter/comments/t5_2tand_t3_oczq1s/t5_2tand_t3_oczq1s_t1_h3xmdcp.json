Also your parents sound awful, and I recommend you check out [the raised by narcissists subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/) because your parents sound like a lot of other parents people write about. Parents shouldn't abuse/yell/kick/punch/berate their children. I'm sorry they are abusing you. You did nothing wrong for them to be so awful to you. I suggest trying to find a therapist if you are able to. They can help you to unpack a lot of the baggage from your family WHEN YOU ARE READY. I also suggest getting a weighted blanket to help comfort you when you feel sad or want to cry. You are an adult, you can cry about your situation but ultimately you are the one to advocate for yourself and make it better. Getting out of their house would be a great thing for you (in my opinion) but I know that is not always an option people have. \n\nIf you ever want to talk please message me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oczq1s/as_an_adult_with_problems_im_just_wondering_if/h3xmdcp/"}
