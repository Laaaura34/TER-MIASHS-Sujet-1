You definitely need to move out. Not only is that bad for your health in general, that situation is probably only going to make it worse. You'd probably have to find a friend's place to crash for a few weeks while you get a job, or some sort of other way to get a place for your own figured out. I'm sure social services could figure something out, but I'm not sure if your social anxiety would allow you to go through them. (As a mostly normal adult, even I have trouble calling people and asking for help.) \n\n\nTo be honest, do you have autism? I have several friends who react similarly and have autism. If you are not diagnosed, you may want to get tested for it. Adult housing and budgets are available for those who have mental problems. Get a case worker. The ARC is probably the easiest method to go through (thearc.org) . \n\nIt'll be really stressful for a few weeks, but know that once you've gotten through it, your life will be absolutely better. \n\nFinally, ask for help. If you are having trouble getting these things done, ask your friends and acquaintances to help. I do think you should hide that you are trying to.move out from your parents. They are abusing you. And once you get a case worker, be sure to report any abuse you receive to them. That is what they are there for: to help you.\n\nEdit: to answer your main question, do whatever you want. Societal norms are just what's normal. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, has something they do not fit in with. It's just how obvious it is. Most people don't care, or if they care it is empathy and not disdain.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oczq1s/as_an_adult_with_problems_im_just_wondering_if/h3y54rf/"}
