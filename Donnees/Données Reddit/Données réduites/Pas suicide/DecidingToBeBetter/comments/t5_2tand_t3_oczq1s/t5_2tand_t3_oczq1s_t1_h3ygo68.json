Your post made me so sad for you and my heart goes out to you. It sounds like you have been in a very, very abusive situation and I hope you can find the strength to talk to someone who can help you sort everything out. Might I point you to online support groups and  meetings for people who've been abused, or seeking some out in your community (your library or Health & Human Services office could point you to some local free resources). I hope you are able to find some support. \u2764", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oczq1s/as_an_adult_with_problems_im_just_wondering_if/h3ygo68/"}
