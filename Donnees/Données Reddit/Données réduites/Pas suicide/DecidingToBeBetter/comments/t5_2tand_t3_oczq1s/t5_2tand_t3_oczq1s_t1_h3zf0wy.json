It\u2019s also ok to choose safe times and places to express emotions, and maybe that\u2019s only in private.  \n\nMasking for longer than a day straight can have downsides.  (If you never let the stiff upper lip rest, it might give out at an unexpected time.)\n\nI would suggest working on a list of other people  you can talk to in person.  Having at least one friendly and safe relationship is a big deal and can make a huge difference in your health.  If no one is coming to mind, starting to have quick conversations with the friendliest local librarian is a good starting point. \n\nI\u2019d also suggest calling 211, you may be able to get free or affordable vocational training and group therapy.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oczq1s/as_an_adult_with_problems_im_just_wondering_if/h3zf0wy/"}
