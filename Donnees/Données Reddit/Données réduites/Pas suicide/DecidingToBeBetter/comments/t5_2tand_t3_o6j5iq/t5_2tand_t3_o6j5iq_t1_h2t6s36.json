Because if you are, that's great!\n\nNo one can really tell you how to developed empathy. Maybe a trained councillor if that's a financial option for you. \n\nSo when you say women, I'm assuming that you are referring to women that you find sexually attractive? You aren't obligated to feel romantic feelings toward an attractive lady. So you may be aromantic. No big woop. As long as you are lying to potential sexual partners and pretending to feel things that you don't feel, that's not a huge deal. \n\nAnyway, when it comes to treating people like NPCs, That's hard to do when you know their story. But you would have to talk to people. The way I deepened my own empathy was listening to people. It's not easy to do so without judgement, but it gets easier. Do you know how your housemates feel when you disturb their sleep? Do you know how it impacts them the next day? Do you know how it affects the way that they see you? You should find out these things if you don't know. It's very important information to consider when you are deciding how to behave while they are trying to sleep. If you do know, and just don't care... You need a professional probably.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o6j5iq/everyone_is_telling_me_that_im_an_egoist_and_not/h2t6s36/"}
