I'm not selfish but I was really self-centered. What has helped me and might help you is this.\n\nI used to think that I was the only person in the world with problems, feeling depressed/anxious and that no one understood me. But I would use others as an emotional dumping ground. Like overshare everything in my life, the good and the bad.\n\nWhat I started doing is looking at other people and have empathy for them. Think how it would be to be in their shoes. Their thoughts, feelings and experiences. I started being more curious and interested in others and what they're doing with their lifes. Listen just as much as you talk. I decided to not dump my feelings on others but save that for my therapy sessions. \n\nI started with my family. I thought \"Hey! My dad has feelings, thoughts and dreams just like I do. He matters just as much as I do.\" And so on with my mom, my sister and the rest of the family. I also did that with my friends. The thing with selfishness is the ego, you could try dissolving that. Meditation helps. Having empathy helps. Looking at other people as just as valuable, equal and important as you are.\n\nThis is all I can think of right now. Hope it helps!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hov3gt/i_want_to_be_less_self_centeredselfish/fxkp71s/"}
