You can start off by openly and honestly asking for your close friend's forgiveness and thank them for their candour. Above all, make it clear that you're trying to change and you'll still need the people you have around you to give you a chance.\n\nYour friend can't be a perfect measure of explaining how everyone you know must feel. Yes it is helpful however that she opened you up to a perspective you hadn't noticed before. It is possible that while people may feel the way she said, they could feel that way to a varying degree. If people really didn't like you that much they would have distanced themselves much sooner. Now, your willingness to consider empathy as a factor before you speak will be an asset as you decide to change your ways.\n\nSecondly, simply because you feel others see you a certain way shouldn't be the reason for you to cut yourself off completely. If you begin to talk to people first with the intention that you realize how you've acted, not only will you let them know that you're trying to change, but you'll also be teaching yourself and giving yourself a reason to think of Person X in a different light the next time around you feel making a potentially insensitive comment around them.\n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/26fsna/yesterday_i_received_the_worst_feedback_ive_ever/chqwj1u/"}
