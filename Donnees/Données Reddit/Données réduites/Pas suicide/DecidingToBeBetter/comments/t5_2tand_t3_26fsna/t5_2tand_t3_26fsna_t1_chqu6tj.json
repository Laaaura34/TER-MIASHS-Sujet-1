Hell, I was raised by a guy like you. All I can say is I wish more guys like you would have moments of realization like this. And NOT just for the sake of people around them but for their own sake. \n\nMy Dad doesn't have an inkling how off putting his domineering, too funny, too charming personality is. Three months ago he lost his wife, my mom, who was both a saint and a bit of a doormat for him to walk all over. With her gone he's in a lot of pain because he's 65 years old and while his life is full of people he has no close friends -- and the one close friend he has actually just kind of pities him.\n\nHe's the kind of guy everyone says is \"great!\" And so \"so funny,\" but then adds \"but I can only take him in small doses\". And that includes his adult children. \n\nSo I hope for your sake you learn to build true friendships! Don't be like my dad!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/26fsna/yesterday_i_received_the_worst_feedback_ive_ever/chqu6tj/"}
