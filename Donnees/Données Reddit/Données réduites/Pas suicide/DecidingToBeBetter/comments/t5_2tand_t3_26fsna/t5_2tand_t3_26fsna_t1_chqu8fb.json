So, rather than simply shutting up, which as you've noted is pretty hard, think through what you want to say thoroughly, with the goal of generally improving their mood. \n\nSecond most important thing is how you listen. In conversation, were you always considering your next funny comment, or were you actually listening? The deepest connections I've made with my friends have often been moments where I was simply silent and listening.\n\nThat's how you win trust back. \n\nAfter you have trust, it's okay to make some jokes. But be careful about mixing those back in. Perhaps ask your friends what they are and are not okay with. And what about some self-depreciating jokes? That might help it be clear that it's not about making fun of them, but about joking around. Just a thought.\n\nBest wishes.
