Most people in this situation would take the passive approach of cutting someone out of their life that didn't make them feel good. She obviously values you enough as a person to give you this information and let you try to make some changes.\n\nI suspect it won't even be too difficult to make adjustments now that you're aware that your behavior can be isolating and hurtful. You may even find that you're become a bit hyper-aware of it as you continue interacting with others. Let yourself be a little upset/shocked about this for a bit, then let it pass and enjoy your new-found motivation to create more positive interactions with others.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/26fsna/yesterday_i_received_the_worst_feedback_ive_ever/chqt24q/"}
