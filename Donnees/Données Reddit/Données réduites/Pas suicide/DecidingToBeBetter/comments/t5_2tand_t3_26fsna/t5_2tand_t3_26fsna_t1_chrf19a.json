I used to just have to say that snarky comment, but now I try to say that really encouraging comment. \n\nThe world really opens up. People respond with greater kindness to you. The world starts to look kinder to you as well. I could be wrong and one really really lucky person, but after my change of heart, when I came across really bad times, I was blown away by how kind everyone was to me and how many people tried helping me out. It was amazing and I still think of that time fondly to this day. \n\nKeep it up. I wish for everyone to feel the same warmth I feel from my fellow humans. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/26fsna/yesterday_i_received_the_worst_feedback_ive_ever/chrf19a/"}
