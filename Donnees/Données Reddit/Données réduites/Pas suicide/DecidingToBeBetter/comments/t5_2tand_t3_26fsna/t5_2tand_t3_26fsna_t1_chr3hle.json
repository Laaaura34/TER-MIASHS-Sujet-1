Do yourself a favor and only tease people who you know for certain can take it. I dont mind when my best friend rips into me because I know hes just joking but I know that I take these kinds of jokes a little personally if I dont know them that well. I know some people who dont know when to draw the line and they seriously annoy me as well.\n\nI remember doing this kind of thing back when I first started university. Trust me, it doesnt go down well. Ever. So its not like ive got moral highground or anything, im just saying that from having done it and having it done to me its a pretty dumb thing to do.\n\nThat being said I think youre being a bit dramatic. Im sure youre a cool guy, dont worry too much. People forget these kinds of things. Its not like youve actually done anything horrible like murder somebody or whatever.\n\nI think you have a good friend if he is able to be that honest with you. I think that hearing it has done you some good and you've realized how people really react to these kinds of jokes. Its fine, just knock that shit off and get back to it. As for your friend, hold on to him because its good to have people who tell you how people really think of you. Sometimes its good to know.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/26fsna/yesterday_i_received_the_worst_feedback_ive_ever/chr3hle/"}
