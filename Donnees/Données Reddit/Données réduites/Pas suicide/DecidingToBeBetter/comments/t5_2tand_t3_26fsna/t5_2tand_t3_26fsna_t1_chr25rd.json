I thought I was an amazing drummer.  I identified myself as a drummer...and then I played with someone who was *considerably* more skilled.  I felt like my entire world had been rocked.  My ego was bruised and I had been outshone.\n\nAfterwards he said something to me that I will never forget:  \"Sometimes when you're learning to do something, it helps to get your ass kicked.\"\n\nI think it would be wise to look at this as a learning experience and recognize that your failure to accurately read those around you just means that you have a skill to improve upon.  Nothing more.  Don't let this devastate your identity.  Dust off your bruised ego and recognize that you have a life skill to improve upon.\n\nGood luck and thanks for sharing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/26fsna/yesterday_i_received_the_worst_feedback_ive_ever/chr25rd/"}
