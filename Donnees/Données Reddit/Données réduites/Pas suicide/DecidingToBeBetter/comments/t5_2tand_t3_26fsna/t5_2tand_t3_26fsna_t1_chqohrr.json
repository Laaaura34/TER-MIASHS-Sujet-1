Just like /u/caphesua said, you may have just made some offhanded comments about a sensitive subject (like someone's weight, ethnicity, looks, etc.) that triggered them.

Actively work towards checking and bettering yourself.  That is really all you can do.  If your friends have put up with your comments for this long, it couldn't have been that bad.
