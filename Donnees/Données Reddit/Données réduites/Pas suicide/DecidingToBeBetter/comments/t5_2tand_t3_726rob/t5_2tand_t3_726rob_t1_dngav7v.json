Cleaning a room and moving a few pieces of furniture around.  Usually all I need to do on a slow or busy day is make my bed or clean a small part of my room.  I especially do this before a vacation because it is very nice to come home to.\n\nIf you feel like you want to eat healthier maybe find a recipe that is easy to do rather than heat up food.  I made a quiche and it made me feel a sense of accomplishment... so I eventually made other things like curry and rice.  When I am feeling not really energetic, I would do something really easy... like make peanut butter and jelly but find different things to add to it.  I've added pomegranate to one and that was amazing.  Just taking something simple and adding something new to it.  Or making salads!  Healthy, very yummy, and it can be simple to make.\n\nDon't try to make super big goals or force yourself to think of them right now.  Doing small goals can lead you to wanting to achieve slightly bigger goals.  In my case... it was cooking.  I'm not great of course, but it makes me want to learn more about it and perfecting what I've already made in the past.  I watch a lot of cooking channels on youtube and try to copy them lol  ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/726rob/i_need_help_reddit_im_not_an_happy_person_and_ive/dngav7v/"}
