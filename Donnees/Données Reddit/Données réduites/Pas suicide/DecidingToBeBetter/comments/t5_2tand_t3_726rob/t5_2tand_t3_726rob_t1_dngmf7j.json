Education + good job + gf/wife is not a cure all to make one happy.  I see this a lot.  People are in a rush to check off this list and then find themselves unhappy despite \"doing everything right\" according to their parents and culture. Don't beat yourself up about not being satisfied with that. \n\nMy completely non-professional advice is to see a professional and deal with the depression first. Then find something that interests you, and follow it where it takes you. Repeat as often as necessary.
