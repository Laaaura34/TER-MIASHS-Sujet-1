I take a prescription ADHD med that is in the amphetamine class. I need to get off of it because after a year if I don't take if for a single day I feel like I have the flu, after two I can hardly walk because everything is so overwhelmingly uncomfortable so I spend the time until I get more alternating between crying because everything is terrible and laying there still as death because moving makes me feel the sensation equivalent to nails on a chalkboard and the crying makes it worse. They told me not to worry about it because it was so purified and whatnot that the worse I would get is a headache when stopping. \n\nAll of that is to say I cannot imagine having to quit something even more physically addictive like meth. You're a frigging superhero for being that strong, even if its just to yourself right now.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ft4uzz/10_days_clean_from_crystal_meth/fm6klbg/"}
