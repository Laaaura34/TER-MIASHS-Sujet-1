My main piece of advice: make mindfulness and meditation your best friend. I've basically devoted all of my free time for the past couple years to finding the most effective way to achieve peace and happiness. By far the best thing you can do for your well-being is to meditate regularly. All I do is 10 minutes a day (I recommend starting with 2-5 minutes and working up) and that makes more of a difference in my mental health and general well-being than eating healthy, exercising, sleeping regularly and all that stuff combined. Meditation is unbelievably powerful for treating addiction. \n\nAlso, if you wanna take your meditation to another level, check out The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle. It may seem strange at first, but trust me, that book will transform your entire life if you really listen to what he has to say and apply it to your life. Good luck on your journey forward friend. You just started a new chapter of your life, and you're going to start loving your life like you never knew was possible. I'm really excited for you! There will be struggle and hardship, but I promise it's all worth it if you just keep pushing forward. Keep it up homie. You've got this!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ft4uzz/10_days_clean_from_crystal_meth/fm6b7ir/"}
