I\u2019m sure it is a horrible experience to watch from the outside. I am so grateful every day that I have been able to get my family back after treating them like garbage for too long. \nThey are warriors. They did what they had to do and I know now that when they turned their backs on me, it was their way of fighting the beast that was my addiction. At least I had the drugs to placate me at the time. \nThank you for offering support and not judgement to this brave person that has made it 10 days! \nAll the best to everyone out there fighting to be better. It\u2019s not easy, but it is definitely worth it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ft4uzz/10_days_clean_from_crystal_meth/fm5l4hm/"}
