A small microdose, done semi- to regularly, is normal to the person doing it. Tell me your normal meth dose. \n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry, Dr. Gorillaxrabbit, was it? Can you also tell me how to fix my \u201cvague but arguably significant issue\u201d with your all knowing algorithm?  I\u2019d love to finally get my life together like \u201cpeople who dedicate their life to a goal\u201d.  You seem to regurgitate nothing else but MeTh Is BaD aNd AdDiCtIng. Do YoU hEaR yOuRsElF?! ...yeah it\u2019s easy as fuck to jump on the bad meth man that you know nothing about. Yeah, we all know, don\u2019t do meth. But if meth comes up in some kind of conversation (ahem), maybe instead of attacking and sounding like an insecure asshole, actually take a minute to attempt to at least acknowledge that plight that others may have to work through, or some of the ways people have made their choices. \u201cU are lazy\u201d says the asshat that can\u2019t be bothered to type two additional letters. Realize there may be some shit you don\u2019t even have the capacity to comprehend if you tried, I\u2019m not saying you don\u2019t-I don\u2019t know you- but I\u2019m willing to take my chances here. And that\u2019s ok. To be unaware isn\u2019t bad in itself, but fuck, man. At least try.  Bring some useful contribution to this or fuck off. Educate yourself, and either offer support or facts, which brings awareness. Maybe both. Not encouraging anyone at all, but there have been studies done on this shit now so people can try to better understand why other people may be willing to learn or even try shit. And unless you personally know this man that you\u2019ve describe specific human characteristics about, his life and choices affect you none. Stay in your lane if you can\u2019t keep up with knowledge and progression (progression being in science, not in everyone is doing it now). I get I\u2019m insulting you for being ignorant, but I\u2019m also bringing in facts so that you can read while you sit the fuck down. I\u2019m considerate like that. \n\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4939399/\n\nhttps://psmag.com/.amp/social-justice/the-many-surprising-health-benefits-of-meth\n \n\nhttps://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/national-helpline\n\n\n\nOP, that\u2019s awesome as fuck, and it\u2019ll be hard. Some days will be easier than others, and expect to stumble along the way. Stumbles don\u2019t have to negate progress. \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ft4uzz/10_days_clean_from_crystal_meth/fm7v5d8/"}
