I know I'm a complete stranger but I've been through this and I had to do it alone so I know how truly difficult it is. Once your in recovery the journey never stops but it is a road if endless and far more beautiful roads and outcomes. It has been around 3 years of sobriety for me and it gets easier but the cravings will hit you out of no where at times. The first two I would wake up and see someone completly different in the mirror and it took along time to find myself. I still struggle with this at times but nothing like I used to. What helped me the most is not only going back to college to keep my mind pre-occupied and give me a reason to stay sober so i  could build a better future for myself but the key to my sobriety was working out and physically becoming who I am meant to be. I got into mens physique body building after about a year and a half of working out and learning about how to diet. I got a trainer and he taught me to meal prep and I started actually eating super healthy and know this addiction had replaced my old one. I want you to know and NEVER forget this step of wanting and trying to be clean makes you stronger than you may ever know. God speed (or which ever Diety/Elder/etc you believe in and if you dont believe in any know that I am wishing the best) and I know I an a stranger but I love you and you can do this and I am here if you need me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ft4uzz/10_days_clean_from_crystal_meth/fm831g4/"}
