Please be patient with yourself and kind to yourself. Also make a routine for yourself for wake/sleep cycles- lay there and be still and quiet even if cant sleep during sleep times. I used earplugs to keep the jumpyness and startling sounds out while resting, maybe even ocean or storm sounds through good headphones. You are doing great, and will continue to improve. Much MUCH love and good juju be unto you", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ft4uzz/10_days_clean_from_crystal_meth/fm5ycrt/"}
