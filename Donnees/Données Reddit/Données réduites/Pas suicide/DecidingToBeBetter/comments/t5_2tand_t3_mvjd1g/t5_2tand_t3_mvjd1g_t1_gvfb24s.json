That\u2019s growth baby! \n\nA lot of people are raised to be racist, and conservative. It can be difficult to actively disagree with your family and loved ones and make that decision to become a better person. \n\nBut learning, watching documentaries or movies about such subjects, reading news from sources that aren\u2019t  far-right propaganda (good sources: Reuters and BBC), talking to people who are different, who don\u2019t look like you, who have different opinions is the way to do it! \n\nCongrats!
