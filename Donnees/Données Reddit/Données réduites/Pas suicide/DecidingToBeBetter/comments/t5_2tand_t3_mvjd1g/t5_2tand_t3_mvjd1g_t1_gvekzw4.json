It's like dominoes. One person has the ability to change their world. And once their world is changed,  they can help others that may be on the same journey.  \n\nI really like your point about education and change & eradicating hate.  I try to teach my students that they have a voice & their voice matters! \n\nBut,  we've got to change education to be successful. I teach high school,  so by the time kids get to me, it's a lot of work to \"undo\" their mindsets & have them believe they can change things. I think kids should be taught that their voice matters at an earlier age so that by the time they get to high school,  they are confident in their ability to change things because they'll already know they're valued.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mvjd1g/got_rid_of_the_last_of_my_confederate_stuff/gvekzw4/"}
