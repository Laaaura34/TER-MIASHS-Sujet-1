Thank you for sharing. I identify with a lot of your experience and reasons for leaving. I've built my whole life around my spouse and I worry if I leave her, then I'll be super alone and fall even farther into depression. Honestly the only reason I haven't left is bc I'm pretty sure I would kill myself if I were alone in a crappy apartment somewhere trying to rebuild my life. So my question for you is how did you get through that period? Do you have kids with this person? If so, how have they been affected by this decision?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ik2d85/i_decided_to_stop_giving_my_husband_chances_to/g3lrdjo/"}
