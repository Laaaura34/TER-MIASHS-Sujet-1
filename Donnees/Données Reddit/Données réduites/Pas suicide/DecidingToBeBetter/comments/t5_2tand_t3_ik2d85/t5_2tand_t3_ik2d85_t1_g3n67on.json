The boxes I would check are gaming and housework - I could do a lot less of one and a lot more of the other.  \n\nThank you for sharing your wisdom.  You have helped this troubled soul, and my spouse, if nothing else.  I wish you luck and fortune along your journey in life :)\n\nEdit: just wanted to also say how haunting one particular part of your post was.  The bit about him just sitting in silence during an argument...  I've been there, but never long enough to walk away...  The silence was because of shame - I have never had a good excuse for my laziness, nor will I, and I've never been one for lying (plus I'm super bad at it).  I hope that helps bring you some peace, to find out you aren't the crazy one - just the one with bottomless patience <3", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ik2d85/i_decided_to_stop_giving_my_husband_chances_to/g3n67on/"}
