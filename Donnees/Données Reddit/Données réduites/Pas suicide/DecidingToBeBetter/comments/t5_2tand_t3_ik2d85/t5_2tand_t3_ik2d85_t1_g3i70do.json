On the way, the girlfriend gets injured and they decide to go inside to find supplies for her injury. She doesn't like the idea of breaking in but he's being compassionate so she goes along with it.\n\nThe building is actually filled with magical creatures protecting a sort of elixir of life. They attack the couple and keep them from leaving so the boyfriend decides they have to fight they're way through.\n\nDuring a fight where she's sure they're about to die, a vial falls from his pocket and she realizes from clues along the way that it's the elixir that he stole when she wasn't looking, and he put her in danger to get it.\n\nLeaving him to die, (which becomes suddenly easy when she realizes that he led her there on purpose in the name of greed and let her get hurt and risked her life without telling her so that she would help him) allows her the chance to escape and to return the elixir so the creatures and herself can have peace again.\n\nI started planning it when I found out he'd been cheating and how deep his manipulation went, but the ending came when I decided to divorce him.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ik2d85/i_decided_to_stop_giving_my_husband_chances_to/g3i70do/"}
