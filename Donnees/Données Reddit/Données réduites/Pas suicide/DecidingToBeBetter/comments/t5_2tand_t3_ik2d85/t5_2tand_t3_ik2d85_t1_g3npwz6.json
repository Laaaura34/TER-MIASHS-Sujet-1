I can't help him with that. But I appreciate you saying this so much. I did feel crazy, and totally powerless. Having some closure really does help.\n\nI'm not going to belittle your struggle but I'm going to say that you're doing pretty well compared to a lot of people I know with this problem. Most don't care. You seem like you really do and that's a huge difference.\n\nI love video games but you have to have the self-discipline to put them down when it's time to be a responsible adult. But you can make it easy by giving yourself some treats of game time after spending x time on x chore.\n\nToday's my day off work and I'm itching to play some games today but I have another load of laundry and some dishes.
