Like when I needed a new job, or when I moved somewhere and didn't have a connect yet.\n\nSo I decided it was time to quit of my own volition. I've smoked maybe 4 times this whole year and it's the best decision I ever made. The last couple times I smoked I didn't even enjoy it. I just felt stupid, cloudy, and anxious. It was almost like getting stuck in a thought-loop on shrooms if you can relate to that. Like an anxiety treadmill, running and running but going nowhere.\n\nIt's not scary to be sober. It's liberating. I really think you should just toss all of your stuff and go for it. Trust me it's better on the other side.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrz014/doctor_recommended_i_quit_smoking_weed_for/fy9qeez/"}
