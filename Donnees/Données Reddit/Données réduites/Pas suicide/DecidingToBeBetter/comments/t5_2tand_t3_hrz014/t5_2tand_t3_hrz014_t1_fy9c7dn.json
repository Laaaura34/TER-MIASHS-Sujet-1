Do I still get panic attacks? Yes, but they aren\u2019t as bad or frequent. I think that smoking for anxiety puts you in a cycle of needing it to cope so when your off of it you need it to feel better but you won\u2019t get better until you stop it. Weed is a depressant despite it making you high. Thankfully weed isn\u2019t a physical addiction and your body isn\u2019t craving it, it\u2019s your mind and the sensation your craving. So try to occupy yourself with other things so you don\u2019t linger on  the fact that you are not high.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrz014/doctor_recommended_i_quit_smoking_weed_for/fy9c7dn/"}
