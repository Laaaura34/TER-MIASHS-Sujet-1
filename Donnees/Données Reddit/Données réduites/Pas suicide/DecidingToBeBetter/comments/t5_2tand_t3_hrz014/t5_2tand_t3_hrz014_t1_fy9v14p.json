My comment was a response to someone saying weed can destroy lives, which is a stretch. If someone's life is destroyed by weed, it's not because of smoking pot. Its because something else going on inside them and they happen to smoke a lot of weed. For a lot of people smoking helps regulate their endocannabinoid system in a healthier way. \n\nPeople casually comparing the destruction of opiates or meth to smoking weed is not a fair comparison, not even in the same ballpark. That was where my comment was directed.\n\nSome people abuse weed, some people abuse pizza. In OPs case I just was sharing how I know several people who have been prescribed cannabis oil high in CBD and lower THC to actually manage their anxiety, and how every body is different. One of those people no longer takes lorazepam. If OP wants to stop or feels he should that's perfectly fine and I wish him all the best. It's good to take a break from time to time and reevaluate where you're at.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrz014/doctor_recommended_i_quit_smoking_weed_for/fy9v14p/"}
