CBD doesn't have any psychoactive properties and also helps with anxiety and insomnia (two of the withdrawal symptoms). It won't completely help with the withdrawal, but it will soften it's edge.\n\nQuitting cold turkey isn't a good idea either since it's essentially throwing yourself into the deep end while your brain is already weak and anxious. \n\nWhat helped me was gradually tapering myself off. While I used to smoke constantly through the day, I took it upon myself to restrict myself to smoking at night. After a few days of that, I only smoked enough to help me sleep but not enough to get *stoned*. Eventually, I got to the point where I didn't need it anymore and I'm currently on day 77 of sobriety.\n\nI do miss it, and I understand why you wouldn't want to quit completely. However, for me, my relationship with weed is like a fairy tale romance that ended up turning toxic. At a certain point of constant use, what was once so magical starts doing more harm than good. Eventually, you gotta do what's right for you and cut MaryJane out.\n\nIf you can change your relationship with it, more power to you. However, that generally takes some time away from it to grow as a person and deal with that shit that is making you turn to weed like a crutch.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrz014/doctor_recommended_i_quit_smoking_weed_for/fy8k25e/"}
