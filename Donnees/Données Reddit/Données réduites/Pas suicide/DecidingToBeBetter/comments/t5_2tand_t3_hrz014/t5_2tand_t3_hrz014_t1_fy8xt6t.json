Loved weed pre-quarantine to unwind and feel good, but then during quarantine I was using it all day every day. It got to the point where I was really worried about myself and how I would be able to stop. It took so much to get high. But nothing felt worth doing without being high. \n\nI was having a lot of panic attacks when I smoked all day. I still have them, but I can control them better. My husband actually had a full-blown panic episode when he smoked one night. Actually just a shotgun from me. He hasn\u2019t touched it since. I really think the particular circumstances of the world right now might not play nicely with weed. \n\nWhat helped me was pushing back my \u201cstart time\u201d a little each day over about a week. Wait till noon, wait till 3:00, wait till 7:00, wait till bed, etc. This helped me quit gradually so I didn\u2019t have the cold turkey symptoms I\u2019ve had previously (night sweats, insomnia). I did still have dramatically reduced appetite for a while, but I\u2019m dieting anyway so I just made sure I was eating enough each day so i wouldn\u2019t lose weight in an unhealthy way. \n\nNo matter what method I\u2019ve used to take a break (cold turkey, gradual decrease), I\u2019ve always found that quitting is not nearly as hard as I think it\u2019ll be before I try. Weed is 100% addicting. But I think it is more forgiving than many drugs when we choose to walk away.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrz014/doctor_recommended_i_quit_smoking_weed_for/fy8xt6t/"}
