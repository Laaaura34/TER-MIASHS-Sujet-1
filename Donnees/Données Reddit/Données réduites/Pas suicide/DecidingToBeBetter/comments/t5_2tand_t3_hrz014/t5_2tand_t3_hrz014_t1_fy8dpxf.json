When I started smoking regular weed (not CBD) I was able to enjoy it. Eventually over time, I started getting anxiety, and it worsened over time. I started using CBD and it helped. It helped calmed me down, I started using the CBD vape juice. I highly recommend using tinctures as it tends to be more potent than smoking CBD or vaping it. Try to look for some 18:1 ratios which is CBD dominant. Do some more research on it, I\u2019m no expert but this was my take. CBD helped a lot with my anxiety but there are different strengths", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrz014/doctor_recommended_i_quit_smoking_weed_for/fy8dpxf/"}
