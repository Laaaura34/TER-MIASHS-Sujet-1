You\u2019ll either be able to transition to healthier, sustainable coping mechanisms or enter the ugly, dark headspace known as \u201choly fuck, I tried to quit and I couldn\u2019t\u201d floating over you while you smoke your bowl. It just RUINS the high. \n\nI\u2019m 12 years sober myself, that was how I knew I\u2019d crossed into never never land - I told myself it was clearly fucking with my mental health and I needed to stop for at least 30 days and I couldn\u2019t for even 48 hours. I was miserable and shaky and found a convenient excuse to relieve me of the insanity of white knuckle sobriety.\n\nI sincerely hope you\u2019re not addicted in the way that I am and that this all passes quickly for you, like a bad dream.
