I would smoke every so often with my housemates initially, and then just by myself most days. I was using it as a coping mechanism and it worked. When I came back home from Uni though I went through a really low time and was really sensitive all the time. I completely understand your feelings but would say if you can get through the first couple weeks, the weird emotional rollercoaster vibes will go away. Never say never and do go back to it occasionally because it can really help after a shitty day - but you and I both need to learn that smoking everyday to forget about your anxiety isn't okay. \n\nDM me if you want to chat more. It was nice reading your post and knowing someone else is going through this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrz014/doctor_recommended_i_quit_smoking_weed_for/fy8l759/"}
