Like a lot. I used to have no motivation, I would feel anxious if I didn\u2019t have weed or couldn\u2019t get high. One day I decided to quit and it took several months of feeling kind of crappy. At the time too it was tough, I was in my early 20s and my whole friend group was on my case about quitting smoking, but I stuck to it and it was one of the best things I\u2019ve ever done. My lungs started to feel better, I had more energy, my anxiety and mild depression were gone. And I actually would look foreword to the day. I didn\u2019t realize the impact it was having on my brain. It gets easier the more time you go without it and eventually I stopped craving it and even thinking about it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrz014/doctor_recommended_i_quit_smoking_weed_for/fy8uv8x/"}
