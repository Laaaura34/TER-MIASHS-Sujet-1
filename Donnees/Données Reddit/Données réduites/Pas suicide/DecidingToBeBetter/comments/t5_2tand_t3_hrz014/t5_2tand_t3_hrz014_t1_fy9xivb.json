How did it destroy their lives? I'm not being facetious or anything, I'm genuinely curious as I've never seen anything I would describe as a \"destroyed life\" from smoking too much weed only.

It can certainly amplify issues within individuals and be a crutch though, and I'm not disparaging anyone who feels they need to stop or it's becoming a hindrance.
