I have bad anxiety and with everything going on in the world and a pandemic forcing quarantine, I was using weed to numb myself and provide the serotonin I wasn\u2019t getting from my usual sources. As my pillars began to collapse I kept using weed as a placeholder until it was pretty much doing most of the heavy lifting to keep me from collapsing.\nI was smoking 2-3 joints a day and I\u2019ve cut back to only smoking on Fridays or Saturdays. Even that seems like a bit much right now and like I should just stop for a bit all together. Especially while we\u2019re still in quarantine. \nFocus on finding other sources for happiness and relaxation right now. Use this break from the \u201creal world\u201d to heal and develop healthy habits. Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself either I think a lot of people are going through this right now and it\u2019s tough. \nI will say that I feel a lot better not smoking every day. I just ended up feeling numb and would have to smoke loads to get high and it made me worry about my lung health. Anything can be overused, and weed isn\u2019t an exception to that. Try meditation videos on YouTube or some sort of physical activity. Visit r/leaves (although sometimes they have a harsh view on weed that I don\u2019t totally agree with it has been helpful for me). L-thyanine is a supplement you can pick up at a pharmacy that could help with anxiety too. Or cognitive behavioral therapy or just researching methods to help with anxiety.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrz014/doctor_recommended_i_quit_smoking_weed_for/fy83w9b/"}
