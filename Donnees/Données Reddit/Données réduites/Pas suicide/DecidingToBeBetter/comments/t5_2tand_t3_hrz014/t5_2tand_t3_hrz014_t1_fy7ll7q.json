I honest to god don\u2019t understand how everyone came to believe otherwise. It might not be as addictive as crack, and you might not die from withdrawal symptoms like with alcohol, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not addictive and there aren\u2019t withdrawal symptoms. \n\nWhen I quit, I could never fall asleep, had no appetite, and my anxiety was increased for almost two weeks. Not to mention the constant cravings. But after a little while you\u2019ll be fine, and wonder how you let it have such a stranglehold on you in the first place. And in the long run the benefits are definitely worth quitting: less anxiety/depression, better cognitive function, being less socially inept, etc etc etc. \n\nLike others said, /r/leaves is helpful in keeping you on track, but after a week of not smoking you\u2019ll probably not need to think about it so hard, so if you can just find a way to distract yourself for a little while you should be good.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrz014/doctor_recommended_i_quit_smoking_weed_for/fy7ll7q/"}
