It wasn't a decision I wanted to make, just *knew* I had to. I weaned myself slowly down by putting less and less in over a period of weeks until i was only putting tobacco in. As i never became addicted to tobacco and could take or leave it this method worked for me. \nThe ritual of rolling the joint was as comforting as the effect of the weed. I gave up the tobacco once my brain had processed that I had been ok without the weed. I loved hash but it really did fuck my head up. Best thing I ever did... clear head is amazing. \nFind your own rhythm, everyone does things differently. Keep trying until you get it. Good luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrz014/doctor_recommended_i_quit_smoking_weed_for/fy8fmj2/"}
