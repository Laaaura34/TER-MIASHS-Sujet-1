I'm going to print it out.\n\nReminds me of chapter 22 from the Tao Te Ching. I hope you don't mind me sharing it.\n\n\\---\n\nIf you want to become whole,  \n let yourself be partial.  \n If you want to become straight,  \n let yourself be crooked.  \n If you want to become full,  \n let yourself be empty.  \n If you want to be reborn,  \n let yourself die.  \n If you want to be given everything,  \n give everything up.  \n \n\nThe Master, by residing in the Tao,  \n sets an example for all beings.  \n Because he doesn't display himself,  \n people can see his light.  \n Because he has nothing to prove,  \n people can trust his words.  \n Because he doesn't know who he is,  \n people recognize themselves in him.  \n Because he has no goal in mind,  \n everything he does succeeds.  \n \n\nWhen the ancient Masters said,  \n \"If you want to be given everything,  \n give everything up,\"  \n they weren't using empty phrases.  \n Only in being lived by the Tao can you be truly yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dav78m/im_giving_up/f1vabj6/"}
