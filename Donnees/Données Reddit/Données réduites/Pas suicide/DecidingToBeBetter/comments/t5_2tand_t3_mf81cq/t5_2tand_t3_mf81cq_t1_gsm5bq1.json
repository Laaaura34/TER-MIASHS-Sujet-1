Every petty thought, emotion, train of thought, and ridiculous outcome that your mind invents.  Write out nasty dialogue, vitriol, insults, fantasies on what you would like to do.  Give your negativity form, to both release your mind of it and to observe/analyse it.  When youre in a better state of mind go back and read what you've written, the cringe will be overwhelming.  You'll start to recognize patterns in your thought process, with the idea being that in the future you'll recognize those thoughts before theyve had a chance to take hold of your emotional state.\n\nA little jealousy isnt a bad thing, it could mean that you really like this person, or that your ego really likes being important to other people.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mf81cq/any_advice_for_someone_whos_well_aware_that_they/gsm5bq1/"}
