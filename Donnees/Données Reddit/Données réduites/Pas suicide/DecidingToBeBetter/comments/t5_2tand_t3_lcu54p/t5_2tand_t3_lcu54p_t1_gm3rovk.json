SO still encourages me to seek therapy but it's just not worth the time/money to me. I've been growing exponentially on my own with practices and mindfulness I already implement. I also receive Theraboxes (that are literally subscription kits put together by certified therapists) that help sustain healthy (mind, emotional, and spiritual) exercises with self-love and healing. Is a therapist still even truly necessary??", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lcu54p/tomorrow_is_my_first_day_of_therapy_ever/gm3rovk/"}
