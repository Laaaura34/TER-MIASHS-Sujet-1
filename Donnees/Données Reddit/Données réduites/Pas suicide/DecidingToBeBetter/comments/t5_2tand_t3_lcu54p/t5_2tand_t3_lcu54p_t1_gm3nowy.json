On the back of your insurance card there\u2019s typically a number for \u201cmental health\u201d or \u201cbehavioral health\u201d services. Call that number and you\u2019ll most like be asked to give your zip and sometimes a brief description of the issue you\u2019re seeking counseling for (but not always and don\u2019t let this be an intimidating step). Otherwise call the main number on your insurance card. I\u2019m stressing insurance because whoever they refer you to is someone that\u2019s going to be the most affordable for you. But once you talk to the therapist initially (usually via phone) PLEASE confirm they\u2019re still in that network. I get calls weekly from clients in networks I asked insurance companies to remove me from years ago.\n\nEdit- someone below me mentioned online and that works well most of the time too. Things like psychologytoday.com allow you to narrow it down by insurances or sliding scale. Depending on your copays, you\u2019re out of pocket might be better than what a therapist is asking for with their sliding scale. Something to consider in these challenging financial times.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lcu54p/tomorrow_is_my_first_day_of_therapy_ever/gm3nowy/"}
