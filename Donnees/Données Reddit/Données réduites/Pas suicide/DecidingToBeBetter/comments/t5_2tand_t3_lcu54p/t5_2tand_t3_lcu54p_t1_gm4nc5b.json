I have the same issues and avoided therapy for most of my life.  I was cautious and overwhelmed but knew I needed help.\n\nMy therapist is wonderful.  She has really let me go at my own pace.  At first, I would meet with her then cry the rest of the night.  I shared that with her and now she goes slow and my pace and has become someone that I really couldn\u2019t imagine living without at this point.  We have a plan so that I won\u2019t be there forever.  \n\nDon\u2019t give up though; sometimes it\u2019s not a great fit - my first one wasn\u2019t.  When stuff gets really hard, don\u2019t give up.  It will get easier.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lcu54p/tomorrow_is_my_first_day_of_therapy_ever/gm4nc5b/"}
