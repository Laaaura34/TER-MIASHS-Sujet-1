The junk that we consume everyday for the past 4-5 years. It has became a habit. We can start to act on it. If you have deleted apps like insta, fb, tiktok. Then that a first step. \n\nNow you should limit the content that you consume. For yt, add an app reminder for half hour or 1 hour. And act on it. If your YouTube for you page is flooded with unnecessary videos (lile vlogs, gamers, cringe content that you think is toxic coz you aren't gaining any knowledge out of it and it has been affecting you.)\n\n Remember good things can be toxic too! I suggest create a new Google account, start from there. Use that new account on YouTube and don't open the original one. You'll see the difference. Limit your subscriptions.\n\nAnd replace things! The time you used to waste either scrolling through any app and in general doing nothing. Use your source in gaining knowledge. You know theres alott you don't know about our world. I can say that by confidence!! ___\n\n Start learning on topics outside of your field! Learn about how psychology works, how emotions are nothing but just oxytoxin, how adrenaline rush works, etc.\n\nReplace music with with audio books. I don't regret one bit of it!!\nI started this back in July and trust me, tho I've been through a rollercoaster of life's shitty show, i am doing greater than i ever did!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1stiy/deleted_instagram_facebook_and_tiktok/hfkcfsa/"}
