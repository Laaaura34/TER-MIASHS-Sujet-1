I'm very impressed and proud of you. You're taking the tough road, but in the long run, you will look back with admiration at the hard work you're doing right now.\n\nI suspected at some point someone in similar circumstances will share their story with you and hopefully they will draw inspiration from your hard work.\n\nThank you for not taking the easy way out.
