If you don't have an appetite, try to go for a sugar free protein shake. Bonus points for waking up at the same time everyday. Just doing those two things has greatly reduced my anxiety and depression.\n\nEdit: start small with your portions and slowly increase them. Your body will get used to eating in the morning. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mdptl8/exercise_is_always_suggested_to_help_with/gsaqfib/"}
