It feels like doing just that is taking all of my energy at first but when I'm done I feel like I have more energy than before. I start with light stretches across the whole body until I feel like skipping around, then I move onto harder exercises. I have a list of exercises but I don't worry too much about following it too strictly so it doesn't stress me out. Also I don't allow myself to lay down on my bed even for a moment in the middle of the day anymore because it's so hard to get back up if I do that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ndak7q/regular_exercise_has_had_a_more_profound_impact/gya0k2d/"}
