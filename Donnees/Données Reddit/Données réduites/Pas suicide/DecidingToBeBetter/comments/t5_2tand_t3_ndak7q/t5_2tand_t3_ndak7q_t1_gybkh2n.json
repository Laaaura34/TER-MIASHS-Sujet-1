I struggle with social anxiety and have some specific issues around going to the gym, as well. It helps me by creating at-home work outs that are effective with whatever equipment you have available. Something else might work better for your specific needs - but you can also tell it your goals and it will adapt to them.\n\nI also picked up skateboarding - I find if I can do activity I like or is new I stick with it longer. Getting a friend to pick up an activity with you is the best way.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ndak7q/regular_exercise_has_had_a_more_profound_impact/gybkh2n/"}
