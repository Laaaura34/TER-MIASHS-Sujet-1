No wonder you feel like you're losing your mind. Stress can cause memory problems and you might be burning out.\nKeep trying to get therapy.\nIn the meantime, mindfulness meditation may help. (Calm and headspace are great apps.)\nTry to enforce some boundaries. Sounds like you are taking responsibility for everyone around you. I wonder if they're pressuring you to do it (emotional manipulation, guilt, etc. might not even be intentional) Try to tell them and most importantly yourself that while it's great if you can help, it is not your responsibility by default. You have to put on your own oxygen mask first or you'll suffocate and won't be able to help others. Sounds like your oxygen mask isn't on. You deserve to be looked after. You deserve peace. You are only responsible for you and no one else. Carve out some space for you.\nHope you get support. Ask for it! I know it's hard.\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2kh4v/im_losing_my_mind_please_let_me_know_what_help_i/hfmoevg/"}
