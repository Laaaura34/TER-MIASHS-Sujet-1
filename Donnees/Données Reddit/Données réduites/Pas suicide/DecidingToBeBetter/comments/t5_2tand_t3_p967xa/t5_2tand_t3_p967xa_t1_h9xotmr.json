Hopefully you won't see this until 8 PM.\n\nI'm quite a few steps behind you on getting rid of vices, but I've been thinking the same thing about Reddit. There's a thing called \"doomscrolling\" where people will basically binge on negative news content and get a false sense that they're somehow helping things.\n\nEven uplifting or humorous content can be compulsive. The rate at which new content is added to Reddit means that refreshing is always an option.\n\nIf you really need Reddit as a support system, there are apps that let you restrict internet use by time or by the number of launches. They're easy to get around, though, so you'd need to exercise willpower.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p967xa/theres_one_more_vice_to_get_rid_of_reddit/h9xotmr/"}
