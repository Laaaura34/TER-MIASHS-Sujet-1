Quit smoking a few years ago, drink very little these days, lost a lot of weight, exercise 4 to 7 days a week. \n\nI even make a big effort to only watch positive shows/programs. \n\nReddit is most probably the most toxic thing left in my life. And it\u2019s not entirely reddits fault. I like the toxic subreddits. I have tried sticking to positive ones but that\u2019s boring. I love the relationship drama and crazy shit people do and say. It\u2019s entertaining but it gets me worked up and upset about stuff that I don\u2019t need in my life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p967xa/theres_one_more_vice_to_get_rid_of_reddit/h9wazbs/"}
