You gave him an ultimatum: support me in X or we break up. Those aren't options that give him freedom to choose his behavior and responses. There was no room for him to give a side because you already determined only one behavior or option was available for the relationship to continue. \n\nGood for him breaking up instead of letting someone manipulate. \n\nThe time to hear his \"perspective\" would be before an ultimatum. Or better yet, give no ultimatum and just break up if he's not right for you. If he's right for you, you all should have found ways to come to a truce or resolution.  \n\nYou can't make anyone support you. If you want to do something, do it. If he gives his support, great,. Otherwise let him support you in the future on something else.  Now, if he NEVER supports you, that's one thing. That's bad. But if he chooses not to support something specific, that's his right and privilege. \n\nI don't know what kind of \"support\" you needed. Did you need him to perform an action or simple agree and cheerlead? Anyway, we should not take away our partners' freedom of thought and action.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdv9hm/i_want_to_get_healthier_at_conflict/hhpm59l/"}
