Please don't impart a moral judgement of manipulation on me though. I'm definitely still learning how to do conflict well, so that is hurtful. I appreciate you letting me know that it seems manipulative. That is helpful. But acting like you know my intentions is unfair. \n\nHe didn't like hearing about my medical issues. When he asked me how I was doing, I would be honest and let him know if I was feeling bad or if I had a symptom that day. He complained a few times about not wanting to hear about this. The last thing he did to upset me was ask me how my day was, I replied, he asked a question like he wanted to know more, I answered, and then he snapped at me saying he was tired of hearing about my medical issues that week. If he didn't want to hear about them, he shouldn't have asked for more information. I later asked him about this and he said he felt like he had to ask questions as a good boyfriend. But it isn't fair to ask a question and then get mad at me for answering. I needed him to support me by listening when I share and to be honest with me when he didn't have the mental space to deal with it in that moment.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdv9hm/i_want_to_get_healthier_at_conflict/hhsdzob/"}
