Use a throwaway account if you aren't comfortable doing it on your main. They often give extremely practical advice to make yourself look more attractive. I believe most of unattractiveness (in terms of looks) is a conscious choice. \n\nAs far as your confidence and believing in yourself, I'd suggest you research about self love. Get in touch with your feminine side and learn to be kind yo yourself. Read up and research but most importantly, take proactive steps to implement them. \n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jgpk3a/how_do_you_get_over_being_ugly/g9roden/"}
