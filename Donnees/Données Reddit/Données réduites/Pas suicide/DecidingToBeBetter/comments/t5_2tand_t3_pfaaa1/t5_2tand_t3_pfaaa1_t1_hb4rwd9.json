Yes, any mental health professional is technically licensed to deal with them. But the reality is, few actually have the correct training and experience to truly deal with intense disorders such as BPD and NPD. Your best bet is to look for a therapist or psychologist that focuses in things like borderline personality disorder or narcissistic personality disorder as they will be the most equipped to deal with what is going on. I also highly recommend your SO see a therapist individually as well ( if they aren't already doing so) as going through this with you will be taxing on them and they need to take care of themselves too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfaaa1/im_a_self_diagnosed_narcissist_and_i_want_to_be/hb4rwd9/"}
