I know I like to make any situation about myself, and I don\u2019t really care about other people. That and I don\u2019t understand how to read other people, and I have a lot of the \u201csymptoms\u201d of one. \n\nI told my therapist at the time when we (my fianc\u00e9 has been helping me with overcoming it, and recognizing certain behaviors that aren\u2019t normal) discovered it. He didn\u2019t really do much and more of just listened which is nice of him to do and cool n all, but didn\u2019t really help me long term \ud83d\ude02 \n\nI\u2019ve been slowly working on that and making connections with people. I have a really hard time doing so, and usually seem to upset people somehow. I overthink and over talk a lot, and usually I have the mindset of \u201cwhat I say is more important and these people are stupid\u201d. Even if that\u2019s true, I want to change having the mindset of being the superior and looking down on others. What kind of person would you recommend me talking to? I\u2019m not huge into psychiatrists or anything that has to do with medication, and I\u2019m planning to switch to a different therapist as well in hopes over getting a fresh perspective", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfaaa1/im_a_self_diagnosed_narcissist_and_i_want_to_be/hb389rj/"}
