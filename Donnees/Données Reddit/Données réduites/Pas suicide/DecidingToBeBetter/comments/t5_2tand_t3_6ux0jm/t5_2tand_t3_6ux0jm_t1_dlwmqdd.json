I work in retail while I'm studying, the other day I was working with my assistant state manager we were doing some tidying up and she asked me to hang a string of balloons up quite high. \n\nI just told her I would respectfully do anything else asked of me but they were too high and I wasn't comfortable doing it. She got somebody else to do it. We worked a couple more days together and my my manager received a glowing report once he was back. \n\nSaying no is like farting in the grocery aisle. Do it quickly, respectfully and sparingly and you wont offend anybody. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/6ux0jm/how_do_i_become_bold_so_that_others_will_not_take/dlwmqdd/"}
