Reading your post it almost seems like you either consciously or unconsciously think of yourself, alone, and you, with someone else (a partner) as two separate 'lives'. What part of life or, in a way, your identity do you feel as if changes when you're alone or with someone? Because you mention sex, but what about emotional intimacy? Trusting someone, comfort, or mutual recognition because that can exist without a partner. So, what are you looking for? Because if you can identify that then you'll be able to figure out where to look for it, and sometimes when we keep chasing other people for these things, we might feel betrayed and lost when they leave us but also start to internalize the lack of this \"thing\" we crave as a reflection of our own (lacking) character.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o6n51e/how_to_stop_being_perpetually_heartbroken/h2trwlf/"}
