I will look into the Call to Courage. Boundary setting has been a lifelong issue for me. I\u2019ve gotten better gradually over the years.. even read up on it and talked to my therapist. Part of it, I realize, is knowing what your boundaries are. I\u2019ve learned the hard way. It\u2019s not something that came naturally. Guess I\u2019ll just have to keep practicing. I have a lot of hobbies and interests to keep me occupied.. and I\u2019m appreciative of the great people I have in my life. I never get bored because there\u2019s always something I want to create. I\u2019ll never run out of ideas. And it\u2019s what keeps me going, and it\u2019s how I always have something to look forward to. But I\u2019m still not there emotionally, even when I try to invest my time in the right things and better myself..  I\u2019ve always struggled with my mood though.
