And I'm so sorry this happened to you too. I 100% agree with you on calling out the bullshit of \"you deserve better.\" It's actually a jerk move IMO! Because Isn\u2019t it up to me to decide whats best for me or what I feel I deserve? This is the way I see it; If my heart is all-in, everything else are just details that we need to work through. Unfortunately I seem to be the only one willing to do the work. Yet, he tells me he wants to be better. His words and actions are confusing to me. Everyone knows that \"If nothing changes, nothing changes.\" \nWhen you're heart is ready to trust love again, I hope you cross paths with your \"person\" and live out the rest of your lives together in happiness!\ud83d\udc9a", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o6n51e/how_to_stop_being_perpetually_heartbroken/h30hmui/"}
