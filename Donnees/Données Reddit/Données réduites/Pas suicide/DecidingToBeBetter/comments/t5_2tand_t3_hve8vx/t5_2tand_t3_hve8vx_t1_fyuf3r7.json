I\u2019ve been using dating apps for over 6 years. Tinder, bumble, hinge, FB dating, adult friend finder, badoo to name a few.  The last 7 girls from OLD have all stood me up on the day of our First date. Don\u2019t get me wrong I\u2019ve had more success than most. I\u2019ve had probably 20 dates in those 6 years of which about 12 led to sex and 1 relationship but I did not find a single one of them attractive. 12 fat girls in 6 years from thousand of hours of work.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hve8vx/365_days_without_casual_sex_helped_me_to_beat_my/fyuf3r7/"}
