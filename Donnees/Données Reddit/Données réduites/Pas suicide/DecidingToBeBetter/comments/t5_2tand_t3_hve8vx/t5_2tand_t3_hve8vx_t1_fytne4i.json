I can relate so much to this. I\u2019ve been celibate since January and decided not to do anything until I am in a committed relationship from now on. I had way too much casual sex throughout my 20\u2019s and honestly it was just like a drug. Every once in a while I could be like \u201cok that was mutually fun\u201d but mostly it just leaves you feeling empty. It\u2019s honestly so much better when it\u2019s someone you truly care about! Good luck and keep it up \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hve8vx/365_days_without_casual_sex_helped_me_to_beat_my/fytne4i/"}
