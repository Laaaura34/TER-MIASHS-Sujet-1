They're very often extremely overweight and unhealthy, and are often shitty to people who don't exhibit these traits.\n\nThey whine, moan and complain, and if they are exposed to the idea that they create their problems, either indirectly or directly through a person, they'll often make that person their new \"satan\" and do literally everything within their power to psychologically and perhaps even physically harm them.\n\nThese people are the curse of the modern world.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/owccpi/self_pity_constant_crying_and_blaming_the_world/h7g9p0x/"}
