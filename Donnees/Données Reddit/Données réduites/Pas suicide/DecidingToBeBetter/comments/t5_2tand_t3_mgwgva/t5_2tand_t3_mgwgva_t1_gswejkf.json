You know what that means.  That means that u are allowed mistakes and doing dishes or not doing them does not classify as a mistake.   What happens I believe is that we have a perception of how life\u2019s supposed to be and if it don\u2019t fit the bill we get down on ourselves and we start to criticize are self\u2019s.  I keep analyzing everything I said to this person I once knew.  I can\u2019t remember my phone number but I remembered the first lie I ever told her.     I\u2019ve been beating myself up for it for a week now.   My son. I wasn\u2019t very good father and he passed away.   I can\u2019t seem to forgive myself for any of these things.   Some small some huge.   That lie I told her.    That was over two years ago and I just remembered it.   About a week ago.     All I\u2019m saying is be good to yourself.  Love love love.    That\u2019s what I\u2019m here in this thread.    To be a better person. And to do that I got to start within myself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mgwgva/why_is_it_so_easy_to_forgive_others_but_not_myself/gswejkf/"}
