The advice and \"tips\" you are seeking are way beyond the skills of \"kind strangers\" on the internet. \n\nYou have so much going on in your life and yet you have come so far. \n\nThere is one other piece of advice I can give you...one thing at a time. Just one little thing. Then your tasks won't be so overwhelming. Complete one thing then it will be easier to do the next. \n\nAlso, not to be harsh or rude, but you do need to get your p**n addiction under control. I think you know that because you wouldn't have mentioned it. I am not one to judge, not by any means,  but there are so many valid studies which show how detrimental that addiction can be to one's life. Again,  a mental health professional can help with that. \n\nThe good news about mental health is it sounds like you are a college student. There will be services that are available to you for free, or at the very least a greatly reduced rate, for students. Seek them out...ASAP! \n\nYou owe this to yourself for the best possible life you  can have. \n\nThe truth is, no one else can do this, but you. The secret? I know you can do this and I know you **want** to do this! How do I **know**? Because you reached out. So, it is time. \n\nSending you internet hugs and wishing you success,  peace, and happiness.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pttvjp/need_urgent_helpintervention/hdymepl/"}
