Be real and say your true feelings, no matter how \u201cwrong\u201d or \u201cpathetic\u201d it makes you feel. People really respect someone who sees themselves and can talk about the bad things. Hiding that you aren\u2019t perfect doesn\u2019t help anyone. We all like to relate. \n\nI\u2019ll also recommend checking out r/stopdrinking for support. It should help you see what I am talking about. It\u2019s really wonderful.
