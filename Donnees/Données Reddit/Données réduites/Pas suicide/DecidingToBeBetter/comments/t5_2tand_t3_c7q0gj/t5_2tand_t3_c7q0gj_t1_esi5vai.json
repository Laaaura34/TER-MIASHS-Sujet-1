I always feel like I am old but when you\u2019re 28 and have four years sober you\u2019ll be se glad you did.\n\nCouple of things: AA didn\u2019t really resonate with me, I tried different meetings within AA but it never really felt right. ACA (Adult Children of Alcoholics) and Al-Anon (Alcoholics Anonymous) clicked way more for me in that I was able to talk about dysfunction in my family growing up and learned that many people with alcoholic parents often become alcoholics themselves. I also learned about codependent relationships and really started to dive deep into psychology and how people work. It\u2019s been an awesome journey and I\u2019m excited for yours to just be getting started. Feel free to pm me if you\u2019d like more information or just need support!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/c7q0gj/im_going_to_my_first_aa_meeting_tomorrow/esi5vai/"}
