It takes so much courage to make that choice and go! I was really involved in AA in my area for several years and here's a few suggestions I'd offer: \n\n\\- Go to at least 5 meetings before making a judgment on whether or not it's right for you. The meetings are all different and there are indeed some good and some bad, but try and reserve judgement until you've gone to at least 5 different ones.\n\n\\- If they ask if this is anyone's first meeting or if there is anyone new there, raise your hand and introduce yourself even if it is the most uncomfortable thing to do. I also have anxiety and am sort of shy, but that's why most meetings will usually have some sort of \"Does anyone have 30 days or less?\" variation, so people can know who's new and introduce themselves after. \n\n\\- Remember that everyone at that meeting also had a first meeting and they were also anxious and uneasy at some point. \n\nGoing to AA was one of the best things I ever did for myself and it taught me so much. I was 19 the first time I went to an AA meeting and I wrote it off as a joke, only to end up back in a meeting at 21. I was able to find some really amazing young people (and older people) in those rooms and have the most fun I've ever had while sober. I'm 27 now and I don't regret making the choice to go. Best of luck to you! Just dive right in, you have nothing to lose by trying it out.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/c7q0gj/im_going_to_my_first_aa_meeting_tomorrow/eshdnf7/"}
