AA was the only thing that worked for him. Before he went to AA he was never openly affectionate towards his family, he would never go to any events. He would rather stay at home and drink after work or on the weekend. I remember vividly about a year after starting AA when he told us he loved us before we went to school...and its been like that every day for the last 24 years. Even after all these years, he is still consistent with his meetings and at the drop of a  hat will help any of his AA buddies when they call seeking help fighting temptation. its a difficult road at first but if you stay consistent and seek help when needed, one day I hope you or one of your family members will be able to write the same message I did. Good Luck, I believe in you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/c7q0gj/im_going_to_my_first_aa_meeting_tomorrow/eshied1/"}
