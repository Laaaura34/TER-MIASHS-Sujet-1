My last relationship was with an alcoholic, and AA was so, so good for her. I attended Al-Anon meetings (support for family and friends of alcoholics: based on the 12 steps of AA, very similar structure from what I gather) and it was so important for my mental and emotional well-being throughout that relationship. In fact, I still go even though my ex-gf and I are no longer together because it continues to be incredibly helpful to me.\n\nAll that is to say, you might consider encouraging your SO to try it out...he'll need support throughout this process too! Al-Anon peels away the shame and offers a safe place for those of us affected by an alcoholic's drinking to share our exeperience, strength, and hope with each other--without judgment.\n\nAgain, congrats to you and I wish you all the best! You can do it!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/c7q0gj/im_going_to_my_first_aa_meeting_tomorrow/eshqt9q/"}
