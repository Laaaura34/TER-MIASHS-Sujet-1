When you find the right group it makes a big difference. I went to several different ones in the area until I found one I was comfortable with. I have really bad social anxiety, too so I know how difficult it can be. I quit going due to scheduling conflicts and the only one close to me that I could go to was one I didn\u2019t like. I think everyone has a different way of going about getting clean. For me it was rehab, therapy, IOP, having a strong support system and avoiding being near alcohol at all costs. I would try to go out to eat with a friend and would have a panic attack due to fear that I would cave. AA is a good tool but some people need more than just meetings. I would try out a few different meetings in your area and see what you like. I had to force myself to go in to meetings initially but just remember: you\u2019re there to get help. Everyone is there for a reason. I hope this helped a little and I wish you the best!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/c7q0gj/im_going_to_my_first_aa_meeting_tomorrow/esj6d3o/"}
