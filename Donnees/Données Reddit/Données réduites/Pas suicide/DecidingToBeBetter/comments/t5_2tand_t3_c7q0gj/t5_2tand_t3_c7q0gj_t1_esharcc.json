The people in the room may seem like strangers at first, but once you hear their stories you will realize that you are not alone. \n\nOther people who have gone through what you have are living a very happy life in sobriety and recovery. As long as you are willing to seek help and apply it, you will be very successful in program. \n\nEnjoy your first meeting and let me know how it goes! I wish you the best.\n\nOh yes I forgot to read the last word of your post\u2019s title; \u201ctomorrow\u201d. If you really want to get help, why wait until tomorrow to get it? Why not go to a meeting TONIGHT and start living the life you truly want to live?
