They\u2019re faith based. If you\u2019re a religious person or have strong faith in \u201cgod\u201d there\u2019s a higher chance it may work. Otherwise it has about a 5-10% long term success rate. You may also want to check out SMART recovery meetings as well and then see which one works for you. There are not nearly as many SMART meetings as there are AA / 12-steps but you can find online meetings if you live in a small city.
