It turns out that the idea of total and permanent abstinence is too much for may people. It stresses them out so much that they end up relapsing with a \u201cwhat the hell\u201d resignation. Furthermore, the idea of counting sober days and starting over again in a relapse has been shown to be counterproductive for many. The idea of identifying as an addict and powerless is also disempowering for many people. It works for some and not for others. I\u2019m not saying AA and 12-steps doesn\u2019t have its place. It does for some people. 12-steps is also far more rigid than other forms of recovery. Unfortunately it has become the default recommendation as it has been around the longest. But in more recent times we have more evidence / scientific based programs such as SMART and REBT style recovery / therapy that are more effective for people who don\u2019t gel with the 12-step approach.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/c7q0gj/im_going_to_my_first_aa_meeting_tomorrow/esjil8l/"}
