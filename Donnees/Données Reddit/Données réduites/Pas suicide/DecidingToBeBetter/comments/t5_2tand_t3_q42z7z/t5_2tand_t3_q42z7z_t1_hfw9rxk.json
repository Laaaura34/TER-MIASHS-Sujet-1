First I'd start with a job. Find something with benefits. Then once you have benefits start seeing a doctor. You need an entire health checkup, bloodwork, and all. They'll be able to help with the ED issues and see if there's any other underlying conditions. You said you're working out for an hour a day now? That's great!! Keep it up. Even light exercise every now and then like a quick walk to check the mail, or walk around the neighborhood will help you get healthier over time. Being active is super important but also eating the right things is crucial. You need to eliminate access to junk food. Stock up on healthy foods and then you can look into healthy alternatives to your favorite snacks or practice portioning out your favorite snacks occasionally. Obsessed with hot cheetohs? Look at the calories on the bag. 21 pieces are 170 calories. That's really not too bad. Give yourself 21 pieces and stop. Start tracking your calories. I use mynetdiary and I pay for the yearly subscription which is so worth it. For the porn thing, I think you should consider therapy and finding new hobbies. There's so much more to do in life than watch other people have sex. It's pretty lame to do when you think of it that way. Find other nonsexual ways to enjoy yourself and when you get urges to masturbate or whatever, it's fine to act on it. But don't watch porn just to watch porn. It's time wasting and clearly has caused you more harm than good over the years.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q42z7z/please_help_me_to_be_better_and_recover_from_this/hfw9rxk/"}
