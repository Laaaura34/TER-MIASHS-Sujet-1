Your emotions start with an action, a thought then turn into a feeling. \n\nJumping to anger without allow logical thought to interrupt it will turn toxic for you as it has in the past. \n\nYou must decide within yourself what is the MOST angry I would ever want my dearest loved one to be with me? And choose that as a starting place to never exceed. It is not that you couldn\u2019t easily see red and create a path of destruction it is you are CHOOSING TO HOLD BACK, still allowing yourself to be angry but never more than a certain amount.\n\nIf you can learn to love and respect yourself this way it will slowly bring positive change to you, and your relationships.\n\n\nI used to wake up every morning angry at nothing! Mad at the world. Mad at the wind, at a stranger, mad at a young man helping an old woman crossing the street\u2014 this left me lonely and single. I did some talk therapy but mostly I had to put work into myself and figure out WHY was I so mad at myself. And learn to let go of my idea that everyone had to be perfect to be acceptable for me to allow into my life. I\u2019ve made my fair share of mistakes, please take care. I wish you peace and happiness.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k08981/im_scared_im_going_to_lash_out_and_end_my_next/gdidycu/"}
