I work in crisis and emergency management - getting an organisation ready for when shite hits the fan across all levels. From basic first aid, wardens for evacuation, coordinators to manage areas or entire site and then execs to manage strategic response, media, and recovery. I develop relationship between organisation to relevant local emergency services prior to an emergency. I do post incident review and then update all documents and training. It's a niche field but starting to develop outside government agencies. It used to be a set and forget activity, but it's being recognised as an ongoing essential business function that needs to happen behind the scenes to develop and improve resilience. \n\nI'm always happy to give advise to anyone that wants to get into this area.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q7tlgw/update_applied_for_my_dream_job_and_i_got_it/hgq00th/"}
