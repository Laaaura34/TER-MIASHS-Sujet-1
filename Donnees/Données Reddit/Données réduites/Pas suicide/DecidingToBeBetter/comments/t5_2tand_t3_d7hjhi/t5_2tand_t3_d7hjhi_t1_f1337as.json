I too have PCOS and I\u2019m doing all the diets and medication I can since it became a pot worse since 2016 (I was diagnosed since 2013) I went to the gym and I only lost a pound. Luckily, now, I\u2019m doing a low carb diet and I think I lost 4kgs in a month. But last week I had my check up  and ultrasounds and  I found out that my right ovary (that was polycystic free 6 months ago) is polycystic again. My left ovary became worse, cos it grew and it\u2019s now under observation. They might have to do an operation if the cyst grows more within the 3 months. Also my left breast developed a cyst too 6 months ago, and now it\u2019s 2 but luckily it\u2019s probably benign too. I\u2019m just lucky to have a supportive family and a patient boyfriend. \n\n I\u2019m still in the process to becoming better too. \nTrying to believe in myself that everything will be okay.  Feels good but when people around you treats you like shit, it\u2019s hard cos your emotions are all over the place and people think that you\u2019re such a drama queen. \n\nAnyway THANK YOU FOR POSTING THIS! my boyfriend sent me this sub, maybe cos I was a shit last night.  \nCHEERS TO BECOMING BETTER!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/d7hjhi/a_couple_of_weeks_ago_i_woke_up_and_i_decided_i/f1337as/"}
