It\u2019s such an ingrained habit. I had convinced myself that I was ugly, disgusting, and without worth. I call myself so many names it\u2019s actually really sad. I started listening to these subliminal rain sounds on YouTube when I go to sleep. I use Thomas Hall\u2019s channel frequently. Now I can actively catch myself saying awful things about me and I take a step back, take a deep breath, and just tell myself I\u2019m wrong. For example, I\u2019ll look in the mirror and I\u2019ll just feel so defeated and just repeat \u201cfucking disgusting\u201d over and over and then I shake my head and remind myself how far I\u2019ve come. It\u2019s taken a lot of conscious effort and I\u2019m nowhere near being good at it, but as long as I keep trying, I\u2019m happy. Another thing that helped me was the explore page on Instagram. I get all these recommended pages of inspirational self care quotes and posts. Some are cheesy, but some really stop and make you think.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/d7hjhi/a_couple_of_weeks_ago_i_woke_up_and_i_decided_i/f12yye3/"}
