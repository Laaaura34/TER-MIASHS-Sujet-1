I too suffer from PCOS. People who don't have it or know it exists have no idea the absolute hell that we have to go through. Keto is the only thing that works for me, so getting back into it has been difficult, especially with work stresses. I also have to count everything. Log everything. Work out hard and often, even when I just really don't feel like it. \n\n I'm so glad you're getting it together. As you know, life will come and slap you in the face after a while. I hope that you have the strength to combat it, deal with the sting and carry on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do you manage to talk to yourself positively though? I've been calling myself a worthless piece of shit for so long, even saying the words \"I am worthwhile\" seem so wrong and fake.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/d7hjhi/a_couple_of_weeks_ago_i_woke_up_and_i_decided_i/f125dzk/"}
