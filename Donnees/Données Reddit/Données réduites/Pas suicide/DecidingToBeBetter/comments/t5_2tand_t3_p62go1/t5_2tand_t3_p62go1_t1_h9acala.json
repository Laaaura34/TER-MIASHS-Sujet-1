It changed the way i think about relationships because it makes a lot of sense. Now i\u2019m no psychologist nor do i know you, but from what you\u2019ve described you sound like you have dismissive-avoidant attachment, which is how a lot of the women i\u2019ve been involved with are. It\u2019s not an inherently bad thing, it\u2019s just how things are. I have anxious-preoccupied attachment and I tend to chase people who are dismissive-avoidant, which always ends unsuccessfully for the reasons you\u2019ve described. I am not sure how to help you, but i think that attachment theory is a good thing to research, and see how you feel about it. Attachment types can be overcome, and i think your mindfulness is a good start.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p62go1/i_fall_out_of_love_every_time_i_know_the_boy/h9acala/"}
