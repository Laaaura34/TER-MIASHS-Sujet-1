What is unique about you? What is great about you? What makes you different and unique from anyone else? Challenge yourself, learn, heal, forgive (especially yourself), be great... Aspire to be your best possible self and walk that journey a step at a time...  Soon you will find that you may want a relationship, but you don't need it.\n\nYou will be fulfilled and alive and yourself whether you are in a relationship or not. You will pick a relationship because you want it, not because you need it. You only need yourself. Not anyone else. That is a myth that life will teach us over and over again until we learn.\n\nYou will pick a partner because he/she is an equal to you, because it works, because your relationship brings you joy and fulfillment, nothing else... It may be short term or will last forever. It has to serve you. If in any way you cannot be yourself, let go so you can be your great, awesome you. Make such a decision in a moment of calmness and reflection, not during any form of upset in any way. I think you have it in you to be a GREAT partner, if you so choose, and can find the time for it while being your great, awesome self... ;-) Best of luck to you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p62go1/i_fall_out_of_love_every_time_i_know_the_boy/h9ffyq6/"}
