The truth is, I wasn\u2019t clear what I was searching for. And I was scared that someone that love me would end up finding out the true me. It was much easier for me to hide behind a fa\u00e7ade of self confidence than to let anyone see who was hiding behind this. It is hard to let someone love you when you don\u2019t love yourself. Seducing someone give you a short validation that you are worthy without showing much. You get the reward without taking any risk. It took me for ever to learn this about myself. I\u2019ve spent years hiding behind a mountain of insecurities while convincing myself I was a self confident man. \nThe second issue was that I never truly defined what type of person I wanted to share my life with. I was more worried about what others would think of my partner than how they actually made me feel. I went for looks instead of depth. Anyway good luck on your journey. The simple fact that you are asking this question is a sign that you are working on overcoming this. I am confident you will get through this phase.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p62go1/i_fall_out_of_love_every_time_i_know_the_boy/h9bpxck/"}
