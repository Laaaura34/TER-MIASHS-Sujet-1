Maybe your happy place will be a cuddle puddle of asexual platonic poly love.\n\nYou don't have to validate yourself. You're not bus fare. You don't get a stamp that will make everything that happens in your brain suddenly click into head and make sense. Emotions and relationships are complicated; you are who you are, some things can be changed with time and effort or at least sanded so you can fit your corners into someone else's life. Some things can't.\n\nYou can enjoy the chase. You don't have to have a relationship of committed monogamy.
