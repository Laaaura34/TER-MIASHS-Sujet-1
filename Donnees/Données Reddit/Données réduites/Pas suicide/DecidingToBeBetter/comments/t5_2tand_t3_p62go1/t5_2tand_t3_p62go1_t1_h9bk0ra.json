It doesn't sound like you do.\" That was a turning point for me, because it turned out the answer was no.\n\nIt sounds like, for one reason or another, you may like the idea of dating someone more than the reality of it. For me, it was because I thought I wanted to settle down and marry young like most people in our town. When I really thought about it, though, I realized what I truly wanted was the freedom to travel and explore, something that wouldn't happen if I tied myself down when I was young. As soon I actually started dating someone, I could feel the walls closing in and had to back out.\n\nThis may or may not be your issue, but I think it's worth considering whether or not you truly want to be dating right now.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p62go1/i_fall_out_of_love_every_time_i_know_the_boy/h9bk0ra/"}
