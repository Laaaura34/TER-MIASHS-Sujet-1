That's awesome!  That shows amazing responsibility. \n\nAnd everyone makes mistakes.  Like at my church, the priest talks to the acolytes (who range in age from 3rd to 12th grade) ahead of time and says things like, \"Hey, we all flub up sometimes.  It happens.  We'll figure it out.\"  Recently, the bishop was leading the service, and he left out a whole section!  No biggie.  The service went on, and it was great. \n\nYou're doing a wonderful thing in the service of God and your church community, and you should be proud of yourself.  The congregation appreciates it, and so does your pastor, I'm sure.  <3", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qaugu6/how_do_i_get_over_embarrassment/hh5ln1o/"}
