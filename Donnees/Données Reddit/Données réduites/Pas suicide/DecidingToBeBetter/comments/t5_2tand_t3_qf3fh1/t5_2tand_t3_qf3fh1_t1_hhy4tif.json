I also have Wiccan friends and people that don't really believe at all. I grew up in church, a baptist even, but I don't think that church in this day and age is a very positive thing. You get more than 50 people in attendance and it starts to get a little click-ish. Read the bible for yourself. Under no circumstance should you just take what anyone tells you at face value. Jesus said to study it for yourself. Do that. Meditation and Prayer are synonymous and that voice you hear to do good and to build up is Him speaking to you. I think that buddhism and native american belief and anything we use to get through a damn day is all the same. Be respectful of whatever anyone believes. And if they don't, be equally respectful. They usually want to say that it's silly to believe and you're a moron forr believing in such nonsense and they will let you know about three and a half minutes into any conversation about it. The only way anyone will ever want to look for a higher power is by example. So just do your thing. Read your book. Think on it. Talk to God like He's listening. Cause he is.
