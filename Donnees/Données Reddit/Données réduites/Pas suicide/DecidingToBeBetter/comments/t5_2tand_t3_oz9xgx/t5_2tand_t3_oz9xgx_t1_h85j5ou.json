Had been studying and doing exams for close to a decade to get into this one particular career choice which I finally achieved. It definitely has its good moments and I still can't see myself doing anything else, but you're also training for a long time, and it can get draining, so after a couple of years of actually working I started getting burnout by the end of it. Going into work became a struggle everyday, travelling which uses to excite me no longer had the same effect, and my emotions just felt dampened. I was also getting up early in the mornings and the sleep deprivation didn't help. \n\nBut then one of the good things about my career is that there are certain periods where you can take a break without it negatively impacting you. So I took a year out of training and became self-employed, still did some shifts but how many, where and which shifts were decided completely by me. Did a diploma purely because it was interesting rather than because of any career need or expectations. But mainly I managed to rest, sleep, improve my social life, go travelling without dreading the return. And it definitely helped. So all I can say for burnout is if there is any way you can take a break from the source of your burnout and regain a sense of autonomy and freedom, where there is no obligation to do or achieve something for the sake of it then I'd take it. If this is something which has been developing over several years then a few weeks probably won't be enough.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oz9xgx/how_did_you_overcome_burnout/h85j5ou/"}
