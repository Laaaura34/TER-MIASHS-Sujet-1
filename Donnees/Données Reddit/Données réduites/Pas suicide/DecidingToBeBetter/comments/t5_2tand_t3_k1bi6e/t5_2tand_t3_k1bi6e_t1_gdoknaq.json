I\u2019ll proud of you!! It gets easier and easier as long as you stick to it and eventually you\u2019ll be like \u201cI smoked?\u201d\n\nI smoked for seven years and one day quit cold turkey. It\u2019s been eight years now and I can\u2019t believe I had a habit like that. My life is so much less stressful. I always thought I was a bit of a bitch and needed it to relax but it was the constant state of withdrawal doing it. \n\nMy biggest tip, NEVER have \u201cjust one more puff.\u201d It\u2019s your brain tricking you and will undo all the work you did. Once an addict, always an addict unfortunately... your body legit thinks it needs it like water at this point so it\u2019ll fight you. It takes three days away to remove the nicotine from your body and then your body starts to rebuild the pathways in your brain to function normally which can take months. Those old \u201cpathways\u201d are always sorta there though so you have to be careful.  But once your brain realizes it doesn\u2019t need nicotine to function, you\u2019re golden. :) I only was able to quit by getting mad at my brain but I still curled on the floor in a ball thinking I\u2019d miss my outside time. \ud83d\ude02 It\u2019s also why patches/gum/vapes have low success rates. You sorta are just drawing on the torture way longer than needed and it\u2019s impossible for most people to fight through.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k1bi6e/today_marks_one_day_without_a_cigarette_the_first/gdoknaq/"}
