Those first days can be challenge and applaud how far you\u2019ve come. I quit smoking with the help of medication a few years ago. Someone told me they quit and learned they were using cigarettes as a \u201cfriend/buddy\u201d it really stuck with me as I\u2019m an introverted person and that\u2019s how I viewed my relationship with smoking. It really helped me. Good luck on your journey to better mental, emotional, and physical health. And if you slip up, don\u2019t be hard on yourself just keep moving forward. Im rooting for you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k1bi6e/today_marks_one_day_without_a_cigarette_the_first/gdnjso7/"}
