My husband and I used Pez. Like the candy........doesn\u2019t put weight on, we ate like 30 pack each that first weeks but surprisingly they worked. We didn\u2019t eat to curb the craving and now can\u2019t stand them. \n\nBut they are cheap. Not fattening. And have tons of flavors, they may seem like a silly tool but they worked for us. \n\nGood luck to you and Positive vibes that you stick with  it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k1bi6e/today_marks_one_day_without_a_cigarette_the_first/gdor0cl/"}
