To know what it means to love yourself, you have to first have an understanding of who YOU are, and what it means to LOVE someone. Because love and care are one and the same. When you love someone, you want what's best for them, for them to be happy. It's an entirely selfless emotion. Too many people love others selfishly - and that's a problem. When you love yourself, you want what's best for yourself, you care about yourself, your happiness, your well-being. And who are you? Well.. that's an entirely other can of worms that take will take some introspection.\n\nIt's okay not to like who you are right now. But it's important to love yourself. To take care of yourself. And once you have that, you'll be able to start taking steps towards becoming someone you like.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ilwt2a/i_need_advice_on_how_to_respect_myself/g3y0ie3/"}
