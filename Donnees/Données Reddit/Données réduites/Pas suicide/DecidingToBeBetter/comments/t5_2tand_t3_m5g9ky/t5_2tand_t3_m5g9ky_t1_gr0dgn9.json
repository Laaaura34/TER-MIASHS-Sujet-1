That is so awesome!! Freeing yourself from those restraints must feel liberating! Years ago I used to smoke weed and cigarettes and towards the end when I began tapering off (along with coming to the realization that I am an alcoholic and also cannot, and now, don\u2019t, drink) my mind cleared up. Not living in that fog and haze anymore from any mind altering substances has allowed me to fill that time with goals and work towards them. Even though I still have rough days sometimes, I choose healthy alternatives to coping like running and going to AA meetings. So proud of you on your huge accomplishment, and may it continue forevermore! \ud83d\udc9a", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m5g9ky/today_marks_one_month_without_nicotine_or_weed/gr0dgn9/"}
