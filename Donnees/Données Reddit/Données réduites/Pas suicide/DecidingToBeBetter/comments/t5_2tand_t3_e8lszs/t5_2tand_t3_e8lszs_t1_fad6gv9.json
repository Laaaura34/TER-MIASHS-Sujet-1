It would be one thing if he just wasn\u2019t able to be there for you, financially, but you\u2019re his kid. It sounds like he just used the money as an excuse to abandon you, emotionally. College is expensive and it would be understandable that he can\u2019t afford even a part of it without suffering serious financial consequences, but that\u2019s no excuse for essentially ending his relationship with you and your sister. I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t want to be a bad father, but you have to let him know that the way he\u2019s acting is making him seem like one. More importantly, you have to be there to help him get better at that stuff. I would work on rebuilding that relationship first before asking him to contribute financially, since that seems like what drove him to act the way he is acting. It\u2019s gonna be hard, but no amount of money is worth you and your sister\u2019s relationship with your dad. Best of luck!
