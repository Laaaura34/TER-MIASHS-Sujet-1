Relying on my own medical advice is wrong and irrational, as you said, just like the emetophobia I have. And my phobia of antidepressants because my previous experiences/research is also an irrational fear, and I have to face my anxieties to grow as a person; that is the hard truth. Which is why it makes me feel so angry and sad; I can\u2019t face my fears. I can\u2019t do the hard work. My hands just don\u2019t go near the medicine box, I just can\u2019t bring myself to start it. And as I said, I\u2019ve tried the whole list; SSRIs, SNRIs, several atypicals, SMSs, NaSSas, sometimes they don\u2019t work, sometimes they give me side effects and I stop taking them, sometimes they make things worse.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is; if I\u2019m not taking the medicine I was prescribed, there is no point in seeing a psychiatrist. I am just wasting everybody\u2019s time. And it also means that I\u2019m not ready to grow, to face my fears, to do the hard work, to put in the effort. That\u2019s what bothers me so much.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nrmgoh/it_feels_like_i_have_failed_again/h0k9ojt/"}
