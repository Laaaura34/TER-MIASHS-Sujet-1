In the same way, my abilities grow too.  The last long trail I did required a lot more route-finding and navigation than the PCT, so I had to face new challenges and push myself.\n\nI'm a sucker for a good vista, too.  Long hikes in the woods don't do a ton for me (I don't think I have the patience for the Appalachian Trail), but I never get tired of big western mountain views.  Especially when they're the sort of places it takes a lot of work to access.\n\nFor me, the biggest things I love about long trails are the sense of absolute freedom and the goal-setting.  There's something really satisfying about setting a distance goal for the day, and then for the section that gets you to the next town, on and on.  \n\nThat's not to say there aren't parts that are scary.  My last thruhike involved some tough creek crossings, a snowstorm in August that trapped me in place for a day, and a few scrambles that were nerve-wracking.  But, in hindsight, overcoming those difficulties makes the journey feel even better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/plvd5m/whats_the_most_enjoyable_most_fun_thing_you_did/hcgf5o5/"}
