I\u2019m now 37 (female), and I haven\u2019t done any of that kind of stuff in ages! Heavy into my career and academia now. It\u2019s not for me anymore, but I\u2019m so glad I experienced it. I think many people jump into heavy responsibilities after college and end up having mid life or late 30s crises because of it!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/plvd5m/whats_the_most_enjoyable_most_fun_thing_you_did/hce2816/"}
