Chicago House music was at it's zenith and I had so much fun and so many friends.  I also never gained weight no matter what I ate. These clubs had the newest music and videos. Most of my friends were on X, but I never needed it because I had so much fun. Note: I wasn't a stripper, I was a nightclub patron.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/plvd5m/whats_the_most_enjoyable_most_fun_thing_you_did/hcebb69/"}
