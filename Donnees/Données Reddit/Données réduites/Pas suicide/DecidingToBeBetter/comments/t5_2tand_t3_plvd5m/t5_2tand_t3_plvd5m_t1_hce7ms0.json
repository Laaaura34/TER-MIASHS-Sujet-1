Trying to make a key lime pie for the first time and *failing miserably*.  Sneaking screwdrivers into the library while pulling wrapping up a major project. Getting ordained with a friend one night on a whim.  Driving to a bunch of different restaurants in town to see who made the best soup. Pulling an all nighter with my roommate trying to create a new language for fun. Deciding to get a piercing for the hell of it with my friends after a lecture only for the piercer to use the the totally wrong gauge (that was fun). Book swaps, show exchanges, etc. etc.\n\nFor me, a lot of my best memories were filled doing things that I had never done before with good company.  I'm still in my early 20's and I know that a lot of the people in my life that I've made memories with now probably won't be in my life when I reach my 30's, but I'll always remember the sounds of their laughter and the way they made me feel. \n\nThat's the point of life, at least in my opinion.  Be kind, find solace in the mundane, and do what you can to find peace and happiness in a day no matter how big or small it may be.  You haven't wasted any time; you've just been experiencing twenty six years of life in a different way and on a different timeline than those around you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/plvd5m/whats_the_most_enjoyable_most_fun_thing_you_did/hce7ms0/"}
