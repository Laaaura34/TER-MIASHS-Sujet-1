I\u2019m not much of a backpacker. \n\nI invested a lot of my 20\u2019s into a handful of deeply rewarding friendships. I\u2019m still friends with them today and life is sweeter because they are in my life. \n\nI learned to cook and taste wine. I went to so many amazing restaurants and cafes and wine bars and had so many memorable meals. When you are young, genuinely interested, humble, and curious about something, the doors open for you. People love being the expert and letting them be the expert is such a good way to connect and learn things you might not otherwise learn and be invited to participate in experiences you may not otherwise get. \n\nI went to Fashion week a bunch. That was a blast until it wasn\u2019t :). I exited at the right time. But such good parties and friends and dinners. It really informed my sense of self and style and meeting all sorts of fashionable, creative people taught me a lot.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/plvd5m/whats_the_most_enjoyable_most_fun_thing_you_did/hce7dep/"}
