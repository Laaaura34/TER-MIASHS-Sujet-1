You're free to meet so many new people when you solo travel. You're more approachable in hostels and on group adventures. I went to a city somewhat nearby to test the waters when I first started traveling. Somewhere I'd never been before, but looked like it had some fun things to do and wasn't somewhere with much of a different culture/way of doing things. It made me realize that I could easily do this all over the world if I wanted to (and I since have!). If you're nervous about the idea I'd recommend doing the same. Start with something just outside of your comfort zone to get your feet wet.
