When I was twenty-four I went WOOFing in the UK and in Europe, working on farms for room and board.  I had a ton of fun and met lots of great people, partied very hard, milked cows, weeded gardens, and bottle-fed some orphan baby sheep.\n\nWhen I was twenty-eight, I hiked the Pacific Crest Trail from Mexico to Canada.  It was probably the most life-changing five months I could have asked for, and I was basically perpetually sore, hungry, and incandescently happy.  I've since hiked another long trail in my thirties, because there's nothing I enjoy more.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/plvd5m/whats_the_most_enjoyable_most_fun_thing_you_did/hcduvel/"}
