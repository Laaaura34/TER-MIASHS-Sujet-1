I started mapping out what I wanted in my life and the relationships that I want to have. It's helped me visualize my values and aid me in living more authentically. Don't agree because you think it will get people to like you, people will like you for being yourself and sticking to your morals and values (with constructive conversation about differing topics) and if they don't then they simply aren't your tribe. As far as boosting your confidence to live authentically, I've been working on making excuses for things that I know I should be doing, going to the gym to feel more confident in my body, and finding a strong community of people who share similar interests as yourself, or things you've always wanted to try. I know finding a community could be tough with COVID, but there's always groups and forums online. Feel free to PM me if you are looking for any support/someone to share your journey with.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lknyar/im_struggling_with_being_comfortable_in_my_own/gnkvqia/"}
