You're right that words cant undo anything, but it can help lead to healing for all involved. The fact that she's tweeting about it is an indicator that it's affected her negatively. OP realized that and feels remorse, more than that is trying to fix it (good for you OP). It doesnt sound like he's trying to change her opinion, which he shouldn't because he can't change how she feels about him. What he can do is show her that he is remorseful. They don't ever have to talk again after that, but it will help her enormously to know that he knows he was wrong at the time and that could at least help her with moving past it. The goal of an apology like this can't be to change the opinion of the other person, only to let them know that you know you've done wrong, have learned, and won't make the mistake again. Forgiveness is far second to the apology itself. Forgiveness shouldn't be asked for, it can only be given. \n\ni think this was called out in another comment, but i'll reiterate; don't expect anything to come of the apology, OP. Don't make it about you because you're trying to feel better about your fuck up. Make it about you trying to right your wrong, not for your sake, but hers.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hxsnpq/tw_i_sexually_assaulted_someone_and_i_dont_know/fz9oezb/"}
