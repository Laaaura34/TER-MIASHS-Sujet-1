Cause I cope with the same situations from time to time because of that. Things just get too much at those moments and I want to beat something or yell at people. I was diagnosed with adhd 7 years ago and alot of pieces fell in place. You have to work your way around those things and draw lines on how far you go with things such as work and appointments, cause adhd isn't only about being hyperactive or funny. It's also about forgetting things, failure, not being able to see things the way they are, overwhelming others with behaviour such as talking too much.\nI argue with people cause I can't take criticism, which is an adhd thingy (in my case).\nThink about it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m04wzo/im_sensitive_and_i_have_a_temper/gq7ygpe/"}
