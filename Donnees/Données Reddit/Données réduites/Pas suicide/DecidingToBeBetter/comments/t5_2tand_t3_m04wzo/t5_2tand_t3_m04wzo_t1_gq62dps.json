It may be something bothering you deep down. \n\nYou don\u2019t do this at work to your boss, or if you\u2019re a student you don\u2019t do it to your teachers. Then you know already you can control yourself. You are in charge of your actions because you only act the worst to family and boyfriend. You have self control.\n \nYour problem is you are choosing to control others. When in a disagreement about something, you try to take control of the other person\u2019s feelings, thoughts, opinions. You need to step back. There are very few disagreements worth \u201cdying on that hill\u201d do you want your loved ones to be afraid of you and resentful of you? Or do you want a healthy give and take with them, where they are unafraid to raise their opinions and you are two and you can work as a team agent the problem. \n\nIf you continue to act this way your loved ones may all leave you completely and with good reason. No one likes the abuse or deserves it. They are people to treat with compassion and kindness. Do you want to build bridges and be known as the one who uses her power for the greater good?
