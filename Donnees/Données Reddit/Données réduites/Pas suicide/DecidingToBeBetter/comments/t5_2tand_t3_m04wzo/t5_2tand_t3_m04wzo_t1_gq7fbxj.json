Get to know all of the parts of you. \n\nWhen you feel angry or upset take some time alone with yourself before you react. Don\u2019t shut down your negative feelings, they will just fester, get to know the feelings and what they are trying to tell you. Express the feelings through writing or art. Learn ways to calm yourself and don\u2019t look to other people to calm you down. If you still need to talk it out with the other person then wait till you are calm and you understand you\u2019re feelings. \n\nCut out any substances which may be exacerbating the problem, for example I had to cut out alcohol because it made me very angry and reactive. \n\nYou might be naturally a highly sensitive person which is totally okay! Just being aware of these things is super helpful.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m04wzo/im_sensitive_and_i_have_a_temper/gq7fbxj/"}
