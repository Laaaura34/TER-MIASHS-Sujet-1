Sometimes we set goals not because we really want something, but because it is fashionable. Or because everybody does it. For example, a lot of men of my age have recently decided to get \u201cIron Man\u201d sign. Not because they are sportsmen, but because the are aging. All of them are over 40, or even 50. And this Iron Man story is just to prove that they are still young and powerful. And because a lot of men over 40 do so. Why do you want to run? Just because you love it? Then go ahead. If you just want to prove something to somebody, it makes sense to think twice.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cmmxy6/life_goal_is_not_a_dot_or_a_slave_of_a_goal/ew6aohq/"}
