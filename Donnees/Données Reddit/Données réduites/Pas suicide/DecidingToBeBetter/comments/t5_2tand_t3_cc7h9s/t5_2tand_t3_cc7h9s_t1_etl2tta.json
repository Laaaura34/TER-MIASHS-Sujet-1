I mean he's a good writer, but that's it. He isn't rich, he isn't mentally happy, he doesn't have great relationships. The only thing Mark is good at is writing, charming people and attracting attention. Charm is NOT the same as having good relationships. Charm works with strangers and acquaintances great. And attracting attention, well Kim Kardashian has heaps of attention but you don't take advice from her about life do you? I've seen Mark had an ex who hated him and he's claimed to have several crazy ex's what does that say about him and his choices? People idiolise him too much, I honestly have a low tolerance for that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cc7h9s/the_subtle_art_of_not_giving_a_fuk/etl2tta/"}
