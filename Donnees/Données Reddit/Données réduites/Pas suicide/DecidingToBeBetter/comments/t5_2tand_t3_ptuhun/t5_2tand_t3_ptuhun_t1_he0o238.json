I came across their information and posts in the zenbuddhism sub-reddit and their meetings are via the \"meetup\" app.\n\nhttps://www.meetup.com/Charlotte-Zen-Meditation-Society/messages/boards/thread/7462290\n\nI try to avoid too much over exposure and aimlessly bouncing around groups. I prefer to settle in and spend some quality time getting to know each group before deciding to stay or leave. These are the two I'm currently exploring and enjoying. \n\nI hope you or anyone else finds these helpful, sorry that they're limited to Zen.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ptuhun/150_days_without_social_media_7_things_i_noticed/he0o238/"}
