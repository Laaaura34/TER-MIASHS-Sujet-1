For me, moving to a new town in my 30s, it was instrumental is expanding my social circle and getting out of the house.    Plus maybe it's an age thing, but once you're in your 40s and people have families, and almost all of your time is accounted for by work or family, you're not doing as much calling to chat, or doing a lot of 1-on-1 hangouts.   Facebook is great as organizing group activities.\n\nAlso, facebook groups are key.   They help you get involved in hobbies, volunteer stuff, with real people locally.   I'm a part of a few dog rescue groups and in a moment's notice I could be transporting a dog from a vet to a foster home, and that's all done through Facebook.\n\nI hear a lot about toxic posts, politics, hate, etc.., you don't have to follow any of that.   I had a couple of right-wing extended family members, they're off my feed.   But I do want to know how other people are doing, even those I don't talk to 1-on-1 a lot.  I care about their kids, their jobs, their pets, where they're moving, etc.\n\nIf you're younger, and you have more natural social outlets, then I can see how Facebook can be redundant.   But for me, it's still a pretty important tool that enriches my life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ptuhun/150_days_without_social_media_7_things_i_noticed/hdzbe17/"}
