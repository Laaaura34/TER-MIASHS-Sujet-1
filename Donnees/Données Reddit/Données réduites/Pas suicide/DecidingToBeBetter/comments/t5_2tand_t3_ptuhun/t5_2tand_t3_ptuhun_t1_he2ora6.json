Sometimes this would happen in seconds.\n\nImagine being a grown up, having a conversation with another grownup. This other adult does not agree with something you said or something you didn't want to partake in..and they say \"ok\" to you and then post some vague cryptic shit about how everyone else sucks but they are gold .\n\nI don't miss that shit at all", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ptuhun/150_days_without_social_media_7_things_i_noticed/he2ora6/"}
