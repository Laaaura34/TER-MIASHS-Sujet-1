Seconds before typing this, I deleted my Instagram and Facebook once again. Your post really made me remember how simpler life was when I deleted them the last time. My mind can once again rest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd, let me tell you, I totally relate to the real friend thing. After I deleted snapchat, my phone became a ghost town. No one wished me happy birthday, not many people checked in on me, and it felt like I was erased from their memories. And good! I'd rather live an authentic life than live a lie. Social media may open a lot of doors to many people, but it has brought nothing except toxicity to my life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ptuhun/150_days_without_social_media_7_things_i_noticed/he0p0a0/"}
