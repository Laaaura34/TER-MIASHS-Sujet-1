I know exactly what it's like to have no motivation and feel so exhausted and beaten down by anxiety. I've had GAD on and off in waves most of my adult life. I developed a random spell of tinnitus last year that drove me absolutely insane and sent my anxiety to its absolute peak. My doctor put me on \"antidepressants\" for stress and anxiety that I ultimately determined just made things worse. I tried probably 3 or 4 different meds and finally decided to cut them out completely. Tinnitus went away and so did the heightened anxiety, depression and destructive thought patterns.\n\nI'd imagine if you're feeling this low then you are likely on meds. If they're not working then try something else, a different med or weaning off of them. Most importantly you HAVE to stay active. You HAVE to show yourself that you are better than it. If you don't have any hobbies then work on finding some. Don't pressure yourself but do try to enjoy and be appreciative of what you do have. We will always want more and pressure ourselves to get to that next point of happiness. Happiness is not a destination. Try not to beat yourself up. One step at a time. Start working on small improvements to better yourself. Drink X cups of water today. Go for a walk. Take some pictures of nice things or your walk and at the end of the day reflect on the beauty you have captured instead of feeding all of your energy worrying about what could've been or what should be. One day it'll all click and you'll be so proud of how far you've come. Chin up friend!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mmp90c/i_was_actually_able_to_wash_my_teeth_everyday/gttk2ye/"}
