And that mentality of \"the reason why this motivational self-help book didn't help you is because you aren't trying hard enough! you don't want it bad enough!\" is so dangerous and toxic.  For example, meditation is NOT for everyone - people who have unresolved past trauma or cPTSD and don't have strong mental health support should be very careful when starting to meditate on their own.  So of course not everyone will feel like they're \"hacking\" their brain or \"thriving\".  And I agree, it is so important to destigmatize, but that is only the first step.  It's just as dangerous to say \"oh, we all have anxiety\" or \"we're all a little depressed\", which only diminishes the experience of those of us really struggling.  I'm happy my post resonated with you!  Wishing you the best!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mefwb9/why_motivational_selfhelp_content_might_be_making/gsoypsa/"}
