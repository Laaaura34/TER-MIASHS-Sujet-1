Add a caveat tho: self-improvement/edutainment content can also get addicting\u2013very subtle but strong. \n\nI've struggled with this tug-of-war for a while: feel anxious about not being productive, watch a video with some advice, BAM feel a bit better and motivated. But, then I feel a little better, so I put off the task again. When what I really needed was to just...do the damn thing!! Lol\n\nBy all means, enjoy your educational adventures (knowledge), but most importantly remember to apply it (wisdom). Confronting your difficult but necessary tasks will give you an  even greater sense of wellbeing, energy and relief.\n\nAnd yes, I'm preaching to the choir here too ;) Good luck friend!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iejfr2/ive_changed_my_daily_youtube_time_into_watching/g2ianhy/"}
