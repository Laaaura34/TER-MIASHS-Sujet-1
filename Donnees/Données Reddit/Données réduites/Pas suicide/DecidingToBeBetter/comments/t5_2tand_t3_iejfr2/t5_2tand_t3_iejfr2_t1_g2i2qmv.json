I have been trying to do the same thing to some extent, particularly focusing on videos talking about math, physics, and philosophy.  While I don't have a strong background in these subjects, I feel much more familiar with the history behind some of these subjects now, making it easier to follow along when I read about them at the library or online.  I am trying to think of my education as a life-long process, whereas before I sort of felt dismayed that it was 'too late' and that reaching a certain age would result in me becoming unable to learn new things.  Somehow I got it in my head that reaching 30 would result in a sudden decline in the ability to learn, and I'm honestly not sure how I developed this mindset.  The reality is that I've never felt more excited to learn new things!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iejfr2/ive_changed_my_daily_youtube_time_into_watching/g2i2qmv/"}
