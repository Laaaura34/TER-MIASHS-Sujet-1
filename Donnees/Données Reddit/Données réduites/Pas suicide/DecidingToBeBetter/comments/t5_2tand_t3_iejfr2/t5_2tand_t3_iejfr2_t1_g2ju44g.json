He is the former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), now teaching at NYU Law School. He offers insight on common practice and norms within federal offices and government, especially his own experiences when he led SDNY. He personally follows the works and reads the books of guests he interviews, which makes for an even fascinating podcast. Given that he was fired by Trump, his political leanings in the podcast are quiet obvious.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iejfr2/ive_changed_my_daily_youtube_time_into_watching/g2ju44g/"}
