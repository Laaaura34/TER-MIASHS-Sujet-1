Now, I'm not a doctor, I'm not saying you're a narcissist, but the feelings you're expressing sound like you're having difficulty coming to terms with your own humility. Difficulty in accepting your humility may be rooted in being afraid of being considered *not good enough* by society. Parents/society instill unreasonable expectations, then one doesn't follow the imaginary life road map, so one's self-esteem comes crashing down. You can build your self-esteem on many different things, endless things, but the more stable of a thing you build your esteem on, the less likely it's going to crash down around you when something goes wrong. For example, building your self-esteem on society's road map, it's going to tumble the second a hair falls out of place. Building your self-esteem on your looks, they will be gone one day. Building your self-esteem on a relationship, many relationships end. So on and so forth. In my opinion, the best thing to build your self-esteem on is the very fact that you exist as a flawed yet incredibly intricate human being.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvi9kj/how_do_i_deal_with_my_envy_issues/heay1v7/"}
