Do children get to negotiate or disagree? Nope. They get told what to do because it's for their own good. I may even tantrum at myself like a child when I force myself to sit with my study materials. I tell myself I have to sit there whether I do the work or not and eventually I do the work. I've gotten better at it. \n\nA lot of my procrastination related to fears of not doing well. I have had to work through my own expectations and the realities of what I will achieve. Letting go the expectations that I must do perfectly or I have failed and instead turning the thought to \"I want to see how well I can do\" or \"I need to do this to make it acceptable, anything else is a bonus\". \n\nI don't get perfect grades but I now study like an adult.
