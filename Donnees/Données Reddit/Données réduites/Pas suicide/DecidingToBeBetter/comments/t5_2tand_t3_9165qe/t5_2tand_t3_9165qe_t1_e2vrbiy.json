I can say without flinching that my current awesome job is mine partly because I was able to focus more at my last job, because I treated myself as if I had minor ADHD and learned to manage it well.\n\nI suggest you look in to that as well.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/9165qe/i_reached_the_advanced_level_of_procrastination/e2vrbiy/"}
