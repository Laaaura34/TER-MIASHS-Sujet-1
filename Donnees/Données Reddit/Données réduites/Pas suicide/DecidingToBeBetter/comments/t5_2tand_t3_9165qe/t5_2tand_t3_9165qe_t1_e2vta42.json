So stop beating on yourself and calling yourself lazy (if you are). It's the opposite, procrastination is no fun, yet we do it out of anxiety of doing a less than perfect job. You have to face your emotions without running away from them. Journalling helps. Feel the anxiety, let it pass. Mindfulness helps. Vague tasks are a big problem. Break down the workload into 30 min bits of really clear work like \"Read Chapter 3 of Physics\", \"Attempt Q1 of assignment\". Then set a timer (I use Be Focused on Mac) and do it. You'll see if you break down your work into small enough bits that you can see yourself doing, your brain will be automatically motivated to just complete it and then the next one and next one. When you're doing shit you're not anxious. And after a while you'll build confidence that maybe you don't have now about following through on your plans.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/9165qe/i_reached_the_advanced_level_of_procrastination/e2vta42/"}
