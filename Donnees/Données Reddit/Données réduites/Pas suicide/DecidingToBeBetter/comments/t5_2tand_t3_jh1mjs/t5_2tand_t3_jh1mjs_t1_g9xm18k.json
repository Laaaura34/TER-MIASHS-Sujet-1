Try to have an advocate with you and 2. Take the approach that they appreciate that you saved the company from a possible liability and a colleague from injury or worse: \u201cI\u2019m sure we agree that this situation required urgent decisive action.\u201d \u201c Thank goodness I was there and no one was hurt.\u201d  \u201cOf course the safety of the team is everyone\u2019s first priority.\u201d  \n\nThis gives them an opportunity to align with you as opposed to being on the defensive.  \n\nIf they go on the offensive, have a few go-to points you can reiterate without being defensive. They may try to imply that you over-reacted. Revert to something like: \u201cI\u2019m sure we agree that when it comes to health and safety, it\u2019s always better to err on the side of caution.\u201c \u201cNone of us want what could have happened on our conscience.\u201d\n\nYou can come out strong and say something at the beginning like: \u201cI think a good outcome of this meeting would be for us to be on the same page with regard to the safety issues I\u2019ve shared. Let\u2019s discuss the best way for us to get there.\u201d This gives you an opportunity to provide feedback on the format of the meeting they\u2019re planning.  For example, you may want your own question period to understand what they\u2019ll do with the info you\u2019re giving them, what their internal investigation approach will be, the timeline, etc., perhaps after each point you raise. Take notes, circulate a sign in sheet, or at least list who was present. If they have someone taking notes, request a copy. \n\nYou should not feel interrogated, belittled, or made to be on defensive. You are a hero and they should take this approach. You are free to leave at any time. They may employ you, but you still have some leverage. Even if you\u2019re not represented by a collective bargaining unit, it\u2019s likely that your on-the-ground colleagues who are directly impacted by these safety issues are. Utilize that union if necessary. \n\nBest of luck to you. Please keep us posted.\n\nEdit spelling\n\nEdit2: any chance your company has an ombudsperson? If so, request that they attend.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jh1mjs/reporting_hazardous_osha_violations_even_though_i/g9xm18k/"}
