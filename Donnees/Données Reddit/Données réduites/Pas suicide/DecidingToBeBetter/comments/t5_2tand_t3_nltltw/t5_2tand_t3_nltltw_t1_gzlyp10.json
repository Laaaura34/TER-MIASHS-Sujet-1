Upon returning home I would most likely have to take up a job in which I'm not exactly passionate about, since my current job isn't offered in my home country. I've done other non-related jobs before and to others it might seem like it's beneath me, or that I deserve more, but honestly, I've never felt unhappy doing other jobs. But maybe I just haven't found a job I really hate yet. What are your thoughts though, should I return doing something I may not necessarily love?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nltltw/if_you_feel_miserable_since_your_life_isnt_really/gzlyp10/"}
