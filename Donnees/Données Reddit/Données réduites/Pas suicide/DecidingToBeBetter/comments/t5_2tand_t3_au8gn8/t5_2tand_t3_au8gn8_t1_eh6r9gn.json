Unable to explain to anyone how I feel. And almost evryday now, I come across a post that describes how I feel and how I have been feeling for years.\n\nI am older than you, and I found my therapist last year. I took a break last week and finally stopped feeling guilty.\n\nLots of love stranger. What a long way you have come, defeating dragons along the way! Your peace now is well earned. May your journey to whoever you are becoming, be filled with feelings other than anxiety, guilt, or an impending sense of doom.
