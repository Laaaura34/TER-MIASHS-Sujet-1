I made a comment about a cute drawing on a name badge today. Rhe clerk at the store stopped what they were doing. Stopped and looked at me. Touched their badge and gave me a genuine smile. Then they cheerfully gave me a quick story about the drawing while I waited.

Their sudden smile - made my day.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pupcph/this_post_by_a_random_internet_stranger_has_been/he5z401/"}
