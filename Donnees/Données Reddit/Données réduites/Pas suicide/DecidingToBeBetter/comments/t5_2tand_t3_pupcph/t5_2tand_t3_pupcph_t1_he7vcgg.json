Survived a suicide attempt in July after losing a baby earlier in the year, and subsequently lost my relationship, home, job, everything. I was nothing but pain and I felt it actively every day for so, so long... then,, I figured if I was ready to die then what was I afraid of about trying? Nothing in this life could be worse, so I had literally nothing to lose. Started going to therapy twice a week and committing to it. Stayed in and forced myself to wake up, shower, eat, and do one thing whether it be therapy that day or just doing a puzzle or braiding my hair. Just anything... and its helping. I can go in public now and see young children without spinning into a ptsd attack, I found a job that keeps my mind busy and started last week, I've practiced counting negative self talks with a wrist counter and went from tagging 250 thoughts of suicide or despair in a day to 15 or 20. I still am living at home, still very lonely and feeling lost. Still drinking too much. But I'm trying, and looking at the progress I have made gives me hope for the things I have yet to accomplish. Like I know now that even though I'm in a bad place, Im a little better than before, so where could I be in another 6 months?? You just have to try... if you truly hit rock bottom then the only possible movement is up.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pupcph/this_post_by_a_random_internet_stranger_has_been/he7vcgg/"}
