Love this. \n\nIn the spirit of this post I\u2019ll add something that kickstarted my life. I\u2019ll leave in the spellibg/grammar mistakes, so you\u2019ll get the same experience:\n\nJust trying to be positive is the only working method I've found that even works. \nYou don't have to be happy go lucky positive. \nJust either embrace the suck, or consider taking the brighter path from time to time. \n\nNo one is ever really worth anything. \n\nMaybe you do deserve to have good friends or a crush or a damn ice cream cone. \nIf it's getting hard embrace the difficulties. Answer life's challenges with some old fashioned backbone. \n\nI cannot just lay down. \nEverything will come to an end (probably not a glorious one at that) but I can not, I will not, keep me from smiling. \nIt gets easier the more you practice.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pupcph/this_post_by_a_random_internet_stranger_has_been/he8i2oo/"}
