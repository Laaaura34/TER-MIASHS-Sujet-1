Unless you have a very mild case, or are misdiagnosed and don\u2019t actually have ADHD. Any advice that amounts to, \u201cjust do the thing,\u201d is fundamentally useless to someone with a neurological condition that literally destroys their ability to choose the things with the lower dopamine reward. The vast majority of people with ADHD need professional help, like medication and therapy, to hope to manage their disorder. It\u2019s ridiculous to act like they can outthink it, and that kind of attitude often leads to developing depression and anxiety when they inevitably fail to manage their disorder on their own. \n\nCongrats on apparently being able to work around your ADHD with inspirational quotes, but that\u2019s just really not how it works for pretty much anyone else with ADHD. For many of us, this is a life-ruining, job-destroying, fucked up, crippling disorder. I\u2019m happy you\u2019re doing ok with it, but please don\u2019t use your lone experience as the standard for others.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pupcph/this_post_by_a_random_internet_stranger_has_been/he8cnv4/"}
