There are so many suggestions! And you\u2019ll get so much support and advice if you reach out and ask for it. \nYou\u2019re on Reddit so, first off, I\u2019ll suggest the StopDrinking Reddit because it\u2019s awesome and I\u2019m familiar with it. \nAfter that, I\u2019ll suggest one step at a time - you\u2019re at 13 days so you just need to break it down and get through one day at a time, one hour at a time, one minute at a time. There are bigger things to tackle but those can wait until you\u2019ve got the worst of the cravings behind you.\nKeep busy, distract yourself, practice radical self love, do absolutely anything and everything that makes you feel even the slightest bit good and healthy and positive. Get or be as healthy and strong as you possibly can; you know deep inside yourself what you need to do, just break it down into small, manageable chunks right now. You are important and worthwhile and valuable and special and you deserve to be healthy and happy and you can do this. You have everything you need inside of you \ud83c\udf08", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/io2rtf/i_am_13_days_without_cigarettes_weed_or_alcohol/g4c7k7y/"}
