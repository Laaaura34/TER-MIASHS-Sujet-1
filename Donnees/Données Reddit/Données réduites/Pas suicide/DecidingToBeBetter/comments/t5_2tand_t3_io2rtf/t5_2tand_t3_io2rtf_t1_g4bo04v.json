If we don't take care of our bodies our minds (and spirits) don't stand a chance of being able to surf the internal chaos.\n\nI'm not talking about the whole, neurotic 'my body is a temple' nonsense which is a whole other form of dysfunction.\n\nJust basic, sensible stuff: good sleep hygiene, hydration, nutrition and a reasonable amount of physical activity (enough to keep any excess weight off and build strength and flexibility over time).\n\nWith that as a base, I did some professional therapy and it helped somewhat but mainly worked with peers (12-Step and Neuro-Linguistic Programming).\n\n*Your* journey will follow *your* paths. As long as you are honest with yourself and others about what is going on you have a shot at success.\n\nEssentially, self-improvement and development have to be the most important thing we do. Everything else will fall into place around that.\n\nThe journey continues for me 29 years later. Hopefully you will need able to say the same thing one day.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/io2rtf/i_am_13_days_without_cigarettes_weed_or_alcohol/g4bo04v/"}
