Your start to try it moderately and u will end at you biggest fuck ups again.\nRemember that you happy atm.\nAnd always remember it's not hard to stay sober during calm times, it's hard to do it when you get a big rejection or when you're confronted with a big emotional disappointment.\nIf you then start with any substance again, only one exception, because of the small trauma, only to calm yourself down temporarily , you won't stop there, you will continue and end at the moments you felt the worst and that were your biggest fuck ups.\nAnd remember getting through trouble and still managing to stay sober will feel like the best feeling ever afterwards. And in addition you're gonna be aware of how much you're a capable of.\nIt will give you a huge confidence boost.\nBut touch that stuff again, just once, it won't stay once, you will again end at one of your biggest fuck ups.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/io2rtf/i_am_13_days_without_cigarettes_weed_or_alcohol/g4bojfy/"}
