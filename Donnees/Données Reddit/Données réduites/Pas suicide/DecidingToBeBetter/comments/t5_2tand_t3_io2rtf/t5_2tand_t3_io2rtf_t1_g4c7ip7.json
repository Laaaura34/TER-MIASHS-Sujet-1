When you remove an addiction, you have to fill it with something positive. Be it an all engrossing hobby, exercise, or anything else you thoroughly love doing. That whole routine you built up around drinking alcohol, needs replacing. To leave the void just invites your addiction back in at a later time while under duress or other situations, as you have reserved that space your addiction occupied in your life. Just as nature abhors a vacuum, our brains are wired that way too.\n\nAnd if you 'slip' that means you are indeed human. Dust yourself off and get back to leading a better and productive life. Never stop starting. It's hard work, it's tedious, and it can be very challenging at times. I don't have the same problem with cannabis, but I concede that some may become psychologically addicted.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/io2rtf/i_am_13_days_without_cigarettes_weed_or_alcohol/g4c7ip7/"}
