Personally, cold turkey worked best. You\u2019ll always have a craving in the back of your mind, but keeping busy and sleeping off the craving worked best for me. If you had to relapse, I\u2019d argue weed would be the least detrimental to your health but yeah, keeping busy. Picked up some side hustles that interested me and that took up free time (Redbubble, Shopify), or I just remember why I stopped;\n\n-Cigs gave me headaches and upset my stomach. Also active addicting chemicals kept thoughts of smoking in my mind \n\n-Weed was wonderful but I did get much less done and I began smoking more and more frequently, avoiding the pressure of existence rather than confronting it and making it easier\n\nI don\u2019t have much experience drinking because of a weak stomach but this is what worked for me. Cravings are v real but the first 6 months will always be the hardest. Stay strong and best of luck! I do have much less problems/anxiety since moving on.
