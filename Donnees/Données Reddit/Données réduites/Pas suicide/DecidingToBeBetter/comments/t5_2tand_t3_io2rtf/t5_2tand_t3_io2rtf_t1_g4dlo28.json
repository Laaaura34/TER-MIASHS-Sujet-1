It was the hardest thing I ever did trying to quit it but now I don\u2019t even think about it or want it. It took a few weeks for me to feel normal again but I got there and you will too! Maybe get therapy or see a doctor if you are really struggling but I found keeping busy helped me a load! Hope you stay strong! You will be proud of yourself when you can look back and be happy you quit, it will make you stronger!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/io2rtf/i_am_13_days_without_cigarettes_weed_or_alcohol/g4dlo28/"}
