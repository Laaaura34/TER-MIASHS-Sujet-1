We all have things we have to overcome in life. \n\nYou\u2019re doing great so far. \nRemember that the disappointment of relapse likely won\u2019t feel nearly as good as success feels right now, even when it\u2019s difficult. \n\nTry finding something to replace those urges with. Something like every time you want a cigarette you chew gum instead. Any time you want to smoke weed do 5 push-ups, etc. find what works for you but one of the big parts of addiction is the habit.
