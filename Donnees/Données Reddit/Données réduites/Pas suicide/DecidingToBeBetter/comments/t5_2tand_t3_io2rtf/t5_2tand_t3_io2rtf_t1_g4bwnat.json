It will take your mind off it, get that dopamine going, reduce stress and your self image will improve all at the same time.\n\nI quit as well (already a long time ago now) and honestly, nothing works like putting on some music you love and doing whatever kind of exercise you like. Running works very well for me, but i imagine sports like tennis etc will do the trick as well. \n\nWhenever I have a bad day and can\u2019t get myself in the mood for going outside, i just dance in the living room until i\u2019m tired. Always end up having so much fun with it and works 100% of the time to improve my mood. So if you don\u2019t generally like sports, dancing would definitely be my advice \ud83d\ude01", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/io2rtf/i_am_13_days_without_cigarettes_weed_or_alcohol/g4bwnat/"}
