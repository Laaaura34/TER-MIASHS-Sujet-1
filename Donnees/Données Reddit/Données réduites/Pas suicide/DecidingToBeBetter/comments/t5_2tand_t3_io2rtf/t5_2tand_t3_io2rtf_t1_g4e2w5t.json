I think there is an NA meeting that runs 24/7 on zoom. I have been almost 80 days free of weed and this definitely helped me a lot, especially in the beginning. I didn't go full on like get a sponsor or anything but just hearing other people speak and having a place I could go if I felt like I wanted to use was really really helpful. I am happy to private message you a link to the meetings if you would like, just let me know.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/io2rtf/i_am_13_days_without_cigarettes_weed_or_alcohol/g4e2w5t/"}
