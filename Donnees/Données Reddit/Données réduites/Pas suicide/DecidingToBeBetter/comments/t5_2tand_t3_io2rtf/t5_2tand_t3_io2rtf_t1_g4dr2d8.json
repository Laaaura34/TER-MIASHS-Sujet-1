That word gives them power. You used to do something but you no longer do. I used to use them all as well but one day i said tobacco is just unnecessary, alcohol is bad for my stomach, and weed is beautiful but it started to take a toll on me. And i dont need to stay in a situation where im not okay. And i quit. Whenever i wanted to use any of them i tell myself that it's unnecessary and i would feel worse after. Im sorry if this is no help but this is how i did it. Congrats on 13 days as well.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/io2rtf/i_am_13_days_without_cigarettes_weed_or_alcohol/g4dr2d8/"}
