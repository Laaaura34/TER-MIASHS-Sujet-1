Take on so many healthy hobbies and productive tasks that there just isn't time in your day for your negative things and at the end of the day you're so exhausted you just fall asleep and don't spend any 'dead time' kinda laying awake feeling more and more tempted to relapse. \n\nDon't worry you won't have to keep this up for too long and can still do things to relax but i recommend doing things that heavily occupy your mind and body like playing a competitive sport or even just a video game that you need to focus on. Hanging out with friends who don't drink or smoke can help a lot too. \n\nDo this for a few weeks and you can easy off on yourself a bit, the temptations will still be there but they will be much less intense say a month from now. And if you feel yourself having to fight temptations a lot then get back to being overly busy for another few weeks.\n\nAlso get all your temptations out of your face.give/throw away all your booze, weed, and tobacco. it's a lot easier to resist if you don't have any you could just grab at any time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/io2rtf/i_am_13_days_without_cigarettes_weed_or_alcohol/g4covtr/"}
