For weed, I now use CBD weed instead. Helps scratch that craving itch without returning to my old ways.\n\nI also used fast food as a tool during those first weeks. Better to binge on some shitty food than to get drunk/stoned again. \n\nFinally, daily NAC supplements helped reduce my cravings and apparently helps with liver health. Got a blood test done last week. Compared to the one I had a year ago, liver function has normalised and testosterone has more than doubled. \n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/io2rtf/i_am_13_days_without_cigarettes_weed_or_alcohol/g4dqunx/"}
