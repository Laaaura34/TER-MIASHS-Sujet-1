I struggle with this too, these are the tipps that worked for me.\n\n-Start small, but START! \n-Do 25min studying and 5min pauses or 45/10. Pauses are paramount. (Best not using phone during pauses).\n-Try minimizing or neutralizing your distractions. Try turning smartphone off, go to a library (maybe not possible now) etc. \n-Make a Plan how long you are going to study and what you have to do afterwards so that you realise you can't do it later and procrastinate.\n-Realising how much I have to study pushes me to be more productive.\n-Having the mentality that, if you study right now or do anything else, will have an impact on you/your grades. \n\nGreat post. I hope I 'll learn something new in the comments. Wish you the best!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mpicko/i_cant_study_cus_i_keep_getting_distracted_any/guab2i0/"}
