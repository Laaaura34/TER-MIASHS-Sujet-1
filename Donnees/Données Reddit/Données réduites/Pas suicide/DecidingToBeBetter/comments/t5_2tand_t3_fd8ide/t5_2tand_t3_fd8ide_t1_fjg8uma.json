That's some major strength, right there. \n\nPlease bear in mind that people who are abusive tend to want to isolate their partners from their external support networks. They want you alone and lonely so that they can swoop in and become essential to your life. It also helps them to control you because, if they are the only person you can rely on, they can take away their support and affection for you when it suits them. \n\nIn your life, you need more than just your best friend. It's hard to rely on just one person because, when they can't be around, it can feel like you have no one. Humans are social creatures and, no matter how introverted they are, they still need people in their life. \n\nIf you want to find close friends, you need to meet people. Friendship is about compatibility just as much as relationships are, so it's rare to find a person who you really click with. That's why it's so important not to give up or isolate yourself. \n\nSeek people out who want the same things as you or who are interested in things you are interested in. Keep working on it. Don't give up. \n\nAlso, if you need someone to talk to, you can message me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fd8ide/im_sorry_if_this_doesnt_belong_but_i_feel_proud/fjg8uma/"}
