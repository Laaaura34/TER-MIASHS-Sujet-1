This puts you well ahead of many people including those who are passing as \"normal\". Maybe you tend to overthink and then your anxiety keeps you in that groove. Do you read philosophy? Self help? Thought about yoga or meditation? I've been listening to podcasts of smart people and then going down the reading rabbit hole based on recommendations from who I'm listening to, etc. (I use online library & prefer audiobooks). I've found a bit of enlightenment through this. Also, self-study may help address your statement about not getting enough time with a therapist. \nWhere are you located? Try joining some MeetUp groups. Maybe something like hiking or walking where you don't have too much pressure to talk and when you do talk there's a ready subject in the activity you are doing. I haven't met a romantic interest yet but have made some  acquaintances and friends who have shared interests.
