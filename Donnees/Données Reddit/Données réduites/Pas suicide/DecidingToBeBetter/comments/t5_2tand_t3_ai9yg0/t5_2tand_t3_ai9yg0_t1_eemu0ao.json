Due to my Asperger, I can't really \"feel other people's emotions\" so to speak, so I need to analyze them rationally. But fortunately, I'm not unintelligent so I can perceive matters decently well in this regard. It's just software rendered and not hardware rendered so to speak. I would say I'm pretty anxious about social aspects, but normal anxiety I can keep reasonably in check.\n\nI'm doing meditation, going to the gym and eating healthy. The problem lies that when I get hit with a streak of bad times these are the first things I stop doing because I feel bad, and subsequently feel worse because I stopped doing the things that make me feel less bad.\n\nThank you for your advice. It's greatly appreciated. =)\n\nI'll update my post with the additional info from this comment.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ai9yg0/problems_with_being_unloved_depression_asperger/eemu0ao/"}
