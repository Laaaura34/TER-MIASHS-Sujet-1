And as someone else said, people are more likely worried about themselves and their own lives than someone who was uncomfortable at a party (if they even noticed your discomfort).

Get comfortable with it, and then it won't be such an unknown when it happens for real.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdczxs/how_do_i_get_over_embarrassment_in_the_past/hhmejy3/"}
