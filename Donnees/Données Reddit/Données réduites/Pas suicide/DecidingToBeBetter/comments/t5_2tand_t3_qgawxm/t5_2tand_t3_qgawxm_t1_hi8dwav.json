Even if you're not the majority that doesn't mean you're not normal, and it definitely doesn't mean you're a loser. Honestly if you don't care too much about dating don't do it. If you care a lot, use a dating app. I work with 30 y/o's, and a bunch of them aren't in relationships anyway. I'd suggest making friends, don't worry about groups though, in my experience groups of more than 3 have always failed anyway. Just find friends through your classes and whatever you enjoy doing in your free time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi8dwav/"}
