F That. I cant think of anything worse than a relationship at this age. I am 22 M also and I just work hard in my life, on the things I love, with purpose and discipline. This in turn attracts others as I start to gain attention for achievements/upbeat personality (where I do not care what others think of me!). Do not fall into the trap of negative self talk. Ok so you're 5'6 and \"brown\" (i dont think thats a bad thing), nothing you can do about that. Let it go. Out of your control. You're fat? Cool. Workout. Consistently. For at least 6 months. Don't expect short term gains and don't give up when they don't come. Some days you will feel like giving up and not doing anything. Those are the days where if you push through you will gain real momentum on the good days. On the days when you just feel like crap and unmotivated, try just something small. Half a workout. Go for a brisk walk. Just exert yourself rather than do nothing. Work hard on your class work, be disciplined. With time this will put you around the right people and chances are you will meet a woman - when you do you will be in shape and loving life because THAT is what women find attractive.   \nOne last thing bro - love yourself. There is a tough journey ahead, and bringing yourself down is only going to make it twice as hard. I've been there, it's not attractive. Be optimistic and be positive about yourself, trust me it will change your life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi57syx/"}
