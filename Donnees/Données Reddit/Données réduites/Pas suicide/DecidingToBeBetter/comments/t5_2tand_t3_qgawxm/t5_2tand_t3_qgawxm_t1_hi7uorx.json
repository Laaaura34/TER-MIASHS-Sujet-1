Fuck relationships. Fuck Social expectations. Fuck what the world thinks of you. For even a single second of your life, don't ever think you're supposed to do or require to do a particular thing because \"age\" or \"social expectations\". If you don't wanna chase around girls and people to form relationships, that's completely fine man. That's okay. Do what you actually want to do. Workout, be fit, groom yourself. Read books, play games if you want. Do anything you want to do. Don't let any motherf*cker tell you that you're supposed to do any particular thing. Do whatever you feel like doing. Comfort should always come first for good mental and physical being. There will always be time for all that relationship bullshit but now is the time to make a better person of yourself. Do whatever you want however you want. Hope I helped.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi7uorx/"}
