I'm 22 as well, and I'm similar, I'm not in shape and like doing things by myself - I was tired of chasing and disappointing women so I just stopped, because I didn't want to do it anymore.\n\nOne thing about being an adult is that not as many people judge you for your choices - if anyone judges you for not trying to get a gf, well then they're doing you a favour and showing you that they're an asshole. You're in sole control of how you use your time in life, don't use it doing something you only think you have to do, use it doing the things you want to do, and I think you'll feel much more comfortable in who you are as a person.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi6jin9/"}
