Also will say as a woman I don\u2019t really care enough height and have dated short guys \u2014 my ex was 5\u20196 funny enough. The weight you can always lose and is in your control. Plenty of beautiful brown men out there, ignore the racists that have an issue with it. Plus sometimes it takes awhile to find a good therapist or psychiatrist. You gotta shop around. Just keep trying different things and you\u2019ll eventually find what works for you.  Anything that brings a little bit of joy that\u2019s not harming yourself you grab on to it and hold it close. Even a few minutes a day can be built on. Imo happiness is fleeting and with decades of dealing with mental illness, I aim for contentment tbh. Peace and simply being able to adult somewhat functionally is good enough lol.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi6r4gc/"}
