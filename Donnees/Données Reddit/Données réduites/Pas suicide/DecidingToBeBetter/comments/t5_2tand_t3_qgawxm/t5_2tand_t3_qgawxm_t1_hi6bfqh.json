And you might even realize everyone you had seen up until that person might not have been \"qualified\" for your situation.\n\nSeriously though, don't underestimate the power of a good therapist. I'm really sorry about your awful experience with one. Let him be a reminder that every walk of life has bad people, or people who don't care enough.\n\nYou'll find them eventually though, just keep looking.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi6bfqh/"}
