A gym is just a facility the way a therapist's office is just a facility. But you need to find a trainer who you can trust, who is knowledgeable to teach you, and who treats you right. If a trainer doesn't really give you the feedback you need to improve your technique, or if they're insulting, or just don't know the kind of exercises you need to help your situation; you need to move on and find a new one. The same goes for a therapist. \n\nTherapy isn't about showing up and being cured just like training isn't just about showing up and automatically getting fit. It's about learning techniques, learning about your body (in the case of a gym) or mind (with a therapist), having a safe place to be vulnerable and make mistakes as you explore a healthier lifestyle or mindset. Someone who can point out flaws you may not even be aware of without making you feel bad. And as you learn techniques you need to do the work to apply them on your own when you're not with the trainer/therapist. \n\nThere are bad trainers. There are bad therapists. They're all human too. They have different skills and weaknesses and insecurities and strengths and experiences to draw from. There are good trainers and therapists who also may just not be right for you. None of that is a flaw on your end. \n\nDoes that help maybe?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi7nlxb/"}
