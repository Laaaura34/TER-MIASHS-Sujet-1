You can't change your skin color. If people have a problem with that they are THE PROBLEM and they are EVIL, run away from those people. If you think you have a lot of extra fat, you CAN change that, so go for it. It's gonna be hard, as any other change you try to make in your life, but it IS possible. Don't put pressure on finding a partner right now, you need to feel okay with yourself first. You only look for a partner when you want more company and when you want to satisfy your sexual needs. A partner is not responsible for your happiness: YOU ARE. If you are unhappy with yourself right now, forget about looking for company. You need to be happy with your own company first. Implement a healthier routine, and think about YOUR goals, forget about others.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi96gxv/"}
