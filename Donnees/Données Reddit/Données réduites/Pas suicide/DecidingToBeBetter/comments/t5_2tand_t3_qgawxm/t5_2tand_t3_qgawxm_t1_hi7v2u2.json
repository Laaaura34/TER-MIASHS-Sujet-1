They have mental health counselors to help you find people who can help. Or, your insurance card might have a number or website for finding therapists they will cover. And if you're uninsured and not in college, you might want to visit a private clinic that does not turn away patients due to being unable to pay. Calling clinics and asking if they cover self-pay patients going through financial difficulty is a good way to start.\n\nI wish you the best of luck, and feel free to dm me any time \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi7v2u2/"}
