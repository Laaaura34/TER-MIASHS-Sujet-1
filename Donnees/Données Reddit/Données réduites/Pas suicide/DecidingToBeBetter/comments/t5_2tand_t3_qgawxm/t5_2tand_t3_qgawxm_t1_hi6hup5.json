I\u2019m 22 right now and was in your boat for a few years. It sucks, and I don\u2019t envy you lol. You have these things you want to do, but seemingly can\u2019t. The reality is that you have limiting beliefs that you\u2019re convince are true. You just have to accept first that not all your thoughts are rational. Especially from a third person perspective.\n\nNow actually things you can do? You need to take care of your health. You\u2019re not going to change it all in a day, week, or even month. Slowly build habits and know it\u2019s okay if you slip up. Don\u2019t try to become your best self overnight. It\u2019s a process. Meditation also works wonders. For however long you\u2019re able to, sit down and focus on your breathing. You can even do it laying down to be honest. Watch your thoughts. Don\u2019t engage or judge them. Just watch it and think \u201chuh, interesting.\u201d Then return your focus back to the sensation of breathing. Through your nostrils, stomach rising up and down, whatever. This slowly strengthens your frontal lobes which in turn helps your cognitive function when it comes to focus and mental clarity.\n\nThere\u2019s no textbook way to do it. I suggest starting a meditation routine for 5 minutes each morning. I\u2019m currently at 20 minutes in the morning and 10 at night. You can slowly scale up. This\u2019ll make it much easier to form other habits like studying, exercising and eating better. You can\u2019t get back the time you \u201clost\u201d but think of it as necessary time for a learning experience. \n\nKeep in mind you\u2019re still YOUNG. If you were saying this at 35 or 40 I\u2019d be more worried. Still the same advice applies if you want to take control of the rest of your life. Practice gratitude. Realize you already have everything you need even if it may not feel like it. If you\u2019re not in a state of constant desire and want to be something other than yourself, it\u2019ll be easier to actually work on your general goals. Like I said, I had the same issues for long time. It wasn\u2019t until I was patient and kind to myself where things started turning around. It\u2019s still an ongoing process, but I look back with fondness rather than sadness. You\u2019ll get there too man. Good luck!\n\nAlso change your relationship with what it means to \u201cchase\u201d women. If you vibe with someone and want to spend more time with them, potentially romantically, ask them out. If they don\u2019t reciprocate, move on. Accepting rejection is key. Not everyone will reciprocate and that\u2019s okay. Hell maybe a lot of people won\u2019t. Don\u2019t be concerned with that. Be concerned with those who do. I know some dudes out here pulling straight 10\u2019s and they\u2019re not 10s. Sorry for being a bit reductive with ratings. But it goes to show there\u2019s more than just physical attraction. A lot more.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi6hup5/"}
