Why did God put you on this Earth, EVERYONE has a purpose. \n\nLook into semen retention, one drop of semen is equal to 40 drops of blood. Semen retention changed my lives in ways I can\u2019t comprehend, you become attractive to women to the point the stares you get are annoying, and confidence is amazing, you literally and figuratively fear no one but God. And best of all you\u2019ll be forced to find your purpose. \n\nOn your journey you will have excess energy, so I recommend working out if you haven\u2019t already, twice as hard because you want to earn your sleep. \n\nYou WILL prosper financially because semen retention reveals your GREATEST possible version of YOURSELF, spiritually, intellectually, physically, and socially. \n\nAnd last but not least STRUGGLE is necessary it is not WHAT HAPPENS but HOW YOU REACT. \n\nI\u2019ve been on semen retention for 619 days and been taking only cold showers for roughly 560 days. You must FORCE yourself to take cold showers early in the morning or before you sleep so you can humble yourself and not many occurrences can compare to the pain of a cold shower. YOU will become unstoppable, I PROMISE YOU. \n\nSR was practiced by Mike Tyson, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Muhammad Ali, Nikola Tesla, Da Vinci, Beethoven, Sir Issac Newton, Blaise Pascal, Pythagoras, Socrates, Stephen Hawking, Friedrich Nietzsche, Mark Twain, 50 Cent, Sigmund Freud, Gandhi, Plato\u2026\u2026 the list goes on and on.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi7fhtn/"}
