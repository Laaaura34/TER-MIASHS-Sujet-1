Make the gym a habit, regular and effective use is better than going every day till you burn out. Study and read with the aim of pursuing knowledge and you'll be a more interesting person to be around in a few months. Go and do stuff you enjoy and don't think about finding someone. Eventually, someone will just happen to be there and you'll have common interests.\n\nIt's crappy feeling sad, or feeling like socialising is an effort, or nothing works out, but it really, really will pass.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgawxm/i_22mdont_know_why_but_im_not_like_other_guys_my/hi8vepp/"}
