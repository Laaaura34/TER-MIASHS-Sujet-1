I doubt that anyone likes themselves 100% of the time. You can become your own leader. \n\nI encourage you to talk to a therapist about healing your childhood wounds, and learning to love yourself as an adult. The depth of self awareness needed to heal child wounds is hard to come by on ones\u2019s own; proceeding past the wounds is more complicated than it seems. A good therapist can help. \n\nBest wishes in beating Covid. Take care of yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kh4dq4/ive_wasted_the_last_10_years_of_my_life_chasing/ggl3psw/"}
