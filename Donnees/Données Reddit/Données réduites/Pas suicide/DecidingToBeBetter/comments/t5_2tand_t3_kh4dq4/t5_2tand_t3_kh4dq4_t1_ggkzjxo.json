There exists starter kits for pretty much everything so you can try out different stuff. Check an arts supply store for kits. \n\nThose kits are great because you have everything you need for a project. If you had fun you can build from there and get better and more supplies.\n\nA new year is starting soon, maybe try something new every month and see what sticks.
