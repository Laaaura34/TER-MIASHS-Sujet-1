You haven\u2019t lost anything. Don\u2019t feel like the last years have been wasted. If anything, they pushed you to this \u201cwakening\u201d point. I know that childhood has a huge impact on who we turn out to be as adults, but at some point in life we will have been adults longer than we were kids, so I think it\u2019s healthy to stop looking for justifications of why things turned out as they did for you, and start drawing the lines of what is it that you want from your life and GO and get it. You want a hobby but you don\u2019t know what u could like: try a lot of different things! You don\u2019t have to become the best at anything, you can just do things to enjoy them. Social media and validation are so empty that you are better off without them. My advice: find a few friends that actually care about you being yourself and enable you to grow, and keep those closer, spend time with them. It\u2019s a big world out there but it can get really lonely. My experience is that you don\u2019t need a lot of people, you just need a few right people. \nMost importantly, you are not alone! I know it\u2019s not of any consolation, but that also means that there are a lot of other people out there looking for a decent friend, someone to share a passion with, someone to fall in love with...so don\u2019t give up! Life is hard, but it\u2019s also so damn beautiful!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kh4dq4/ive_wasted_the_last_10_years_of_my_life_chasing/ggke44u/"}
