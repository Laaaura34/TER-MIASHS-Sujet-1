Thank you for sharing. Your future sounds bright! Keep your head up and realize how young you still are. \n\nThere are many people in your same position at the age 40 or 50 realizing what you are realizing and still find success and happiness in life. You can look up online how many successful people made it later in life after going through really tough circumstances feeling like they wasted their lives but pick life back up with the wisdom they obtained in the process and find passion, success and happiness.\n\nThat wisdom and hope can drive your success and happiness.
