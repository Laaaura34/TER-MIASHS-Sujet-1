I started practicing this by putting sticky notes about things I needed to be honest myself about onto a mirror that I would stare into for hours a day. I don\u2019t recommend everyone to do this because it can get very heavy and depressing but I\u2019d say I felt like all of those self affirmations and goals I set i understood in the back of my mind over time. Thinking about the problems and processing the thoughts and feelings are important but if you can\u2019t name the problems or actively become self aware of how those problems effect you you can become blind and angry at the world around you because you sense no real control in life. It\u2019s very hard, again I still struggle with it. All I know is how to be serious about my problem, overtime I realized this was a new problem.
