Also took out a loan for car, which I was planning on dealing with in under a year, but realized it was significantly lower interest than wife's student loans.\n\nSo switched to five year loan before it was finalized, put auto-payment from a savings I kept three or four months in, and started over throwing all extra at her highest interest loan.\n\nOnce those were gone, paid off car, and switched back to savings.\n\nIt's 1.5% APY, which has net hundreds of dollars over a few years. Also partitioned a bit of it ton a CD for a bit at a higher rate, but should be done by the time we need it for a house.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g72zds/ive_just_paid_off_my_last_bit_of_debt/fofbord/"}
