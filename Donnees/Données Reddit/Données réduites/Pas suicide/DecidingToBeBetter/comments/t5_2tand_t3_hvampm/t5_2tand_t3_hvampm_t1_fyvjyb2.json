I do Postmates for 12 hours a day and was surprised to find that I was getting \"good\" to \"excellent sleep\" after working 14 hour days. During those days, I would only get 6-6.5 hours. I thought this was interesting cause I was never able to get these numbers when I used to work a 9-5 and would go to the gym for two hours a day (before COVID). My take home from this is that I sleep better at night as long as I keep myself very busy during the day. (ironic right). I think it has to do with something with exhausting my mind more from all the driving I do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hvampm/ive_decided_to_take_a_break_from_marijuana_for_a/fyvjyb2/"}
