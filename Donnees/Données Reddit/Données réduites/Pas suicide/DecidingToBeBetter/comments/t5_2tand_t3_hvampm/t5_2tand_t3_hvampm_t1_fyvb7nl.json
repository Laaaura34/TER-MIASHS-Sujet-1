I\u2019ve been having very intense nightmares and I wake up in the morning feeling super anxious, but well rested. Smoking nightly has really messed with my REM, so now that I\u2019ve stopped, my REM sleep cycles are off whack and it\u2019s gonna take a while to get back to normal dreaming. For me, I didn\u2019t have any problem going to sleep last night as I\u2019ve been working out daily, so I\u2019m already exhausted. I listen to Micheal Sealey on YouTube, he\u2019s really good at talking to you to help calm your mind and sleep, so I suggest watching that to help!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hvampm/ive_decided_to_take_a_break_from_marijuana_for_a/fyvb7nl/"}
