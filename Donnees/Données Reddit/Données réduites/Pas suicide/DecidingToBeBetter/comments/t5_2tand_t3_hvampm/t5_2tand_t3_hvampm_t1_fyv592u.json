I only started using MJ as often to treat my digestive & sleep issues. How ever, once the addiction started, my symptoms actually started to worsen. By that point I just HAD to smoke. My teeth are badly damaged from years of randomly vomiting it's happened so much.\n\nIt was rough quitting that first week,but I haven't vomited since. I'm eating pretty regularly. And.. last night I went to sleep perfectly fine on my own.\n\n Some things are so obvious and just involve taking that first step towards change. Glad we're getting there & thanks for that article.
