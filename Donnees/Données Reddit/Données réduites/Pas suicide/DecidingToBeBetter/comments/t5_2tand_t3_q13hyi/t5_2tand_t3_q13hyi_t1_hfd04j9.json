As someone who struggles with a nicotine addiction myself I\u2019d like to share with you that nicotine is nearly impossible to cut down because of the way it acts on receptors. You can read about it for yourself of course. You might need to use an alternative like nicotine gum, lozenges, pouches, or patches. I like the pouches myself. I know you didn\u2019t ask for advice but it\u2019s pertaining to a fact about nicotine. I wish you all the success! (Remember you define success, my idea of a successful day is me eating cantaloupe fully upside down) It\u2019s brought me joy and hope to read about you improving your life, thank you sharing!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q13hyi/been_trying_to_get_better_for_5_months_now/hfd04j9/"}
