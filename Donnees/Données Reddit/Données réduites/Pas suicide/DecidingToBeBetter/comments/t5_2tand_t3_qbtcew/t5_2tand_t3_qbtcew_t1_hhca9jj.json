You want to have KPOP to yourself, because it holds a very special place in your heart. Your sister only likes KPOP as a hobby/feeble interest, but to you it\u2019s *much* more than that \u2014 it quite literally saved your life. I completely understand why you\u2019d be annoyed and uncomfortable. \n\nTry not to blame your sister, she doesn\u2019t know any better. She doesn\u2019t know how KPOP stopped you from dying. Sometimes siblings are cringe, and they\u2019ll try to mock your hobbies as a way of bonding. Normal sibling stuff.\n\nI think with time you will become more and comfortable with the idea of her liking KPOP; it\u2019s probably just a phase for her anyway", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbtcew/how_do_i_stop_gatekeeping_what_i_like_kpop/hhca9jj/"}
