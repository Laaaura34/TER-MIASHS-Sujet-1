This will happen a couple of times in life. And no matter what age, you can always start a new life. \n\nMaybe you will have to stay at a friends place or a cheap place for a while so you can save up some money. Because that is the very first thing you'd want to do.\nGet a job asap, even if that means you have to do something you don't necessarily like. You are doing it for YOU. So you can get your life back on track.\nYou might also like looking into minimalism. That literally saves money on so many costs. Because you really dont need much. \n\nStay strong and most importantly: stay connected. Because when you stop surrounding yourself with other people you also stop the opportunities.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nm725z/i_need_to_get_my_life_back_on_track_i_dropped_out/gznhbcq/"}
