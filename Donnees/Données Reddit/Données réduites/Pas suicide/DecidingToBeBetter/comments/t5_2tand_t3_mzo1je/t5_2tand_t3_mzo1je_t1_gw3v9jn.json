She agrees that it seems like a situation with no way out.\n\nMother is good, but \"pull yourself up and out\" type and dismissive.\n\nAll in all, I just don't feel human at all.\n\nWhat other people think is reality. Trying to get their thoughts to match what you are inside is... Well, I think every human wants to be seen. But it's an impossible task, cause I secretly judge others the same way as myself.\n\nSorry. Don't mean to be a bummer. Thank you for everything. You don't have to be a trans expert of gender science to help out in a human way. Unfortunately, as I said, mental health stuff isn't so forward.
