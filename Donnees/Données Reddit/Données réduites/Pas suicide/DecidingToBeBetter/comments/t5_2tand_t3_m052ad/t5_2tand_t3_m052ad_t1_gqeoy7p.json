The two careers that  I see myself in are labor and delivery or Pediatric or NICU nurse- this path will take some time and a hefty loan since an accelerated program is technically a post-bac degree. The second is working as a social worker- which is something that would take both less time and money as well as something I am passionate about. However, the latter choice doesn't pay very well in the long run. I definitely need more than just brainstorming, but made this post on the off chance anyone listed a path I hadn't already thought of.
