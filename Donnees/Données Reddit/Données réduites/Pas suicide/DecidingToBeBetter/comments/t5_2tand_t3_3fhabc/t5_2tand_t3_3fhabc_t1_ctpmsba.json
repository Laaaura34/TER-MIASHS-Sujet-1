What's that, exactly?  Probably not going to be a problem as I don't have a huge sex drive, and my sex life is decent.\nI don't really get into TV, but I could limit the livestreams and such that I watch instead.  I'd be cutting off a good bit of my daily social interactions by doing so.\nSugar is no problem.  I did keto for about a year a while back.  While I lost a good amount of weight, I didn't notice any of the crazy life-changing effects its proponents preach like more energy, better sleep, etc.  That said, I started back on it last week to trim back down.\nInternet usage is a dicey subject as I work in IT for a living.  I spend a good chunk of my work day on the internet (even Reddit).\nMaybe I'm being too cynical, but I think that if I did all of these (mainly focusing on the no vidya, no \"TV\", and no internet) I'd just wind up sleeping a lot more.
