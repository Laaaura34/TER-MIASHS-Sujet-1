Although you feel like she is all you have in life, maybe you need to break free of her in order to actually have a life you want and deserve. If she isn't even interested in what you have to say, what is the point of being together? I found myself in a similar situation with my last girlfriend - not much in common, and only sexual attraction keeping us together. After breaking up with her, I felt free to do what I wanted and desired to do. For you, that could be reaching the summit of a mountain as you mentioned, or finding someone who you mesh with on a deeper level. I'm sorry to hear you aren't entirely happy with your career. If you don't want to seriously consider a career change (which I understand), then you have to find a way to be happy with your life as a whole despite a job which bogs you down. I know this is easier said than done, but if you pursue hobbies and interests outside of work, perhaps it will be easier. I have and continue to struggle with many of the same things you have mentioned, and it sucks. I just really hope you can find a way to make life enjoyable for yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3fhabc/how_to_handle_a_lack_of_interest_in_life/ctow8fo/"}
