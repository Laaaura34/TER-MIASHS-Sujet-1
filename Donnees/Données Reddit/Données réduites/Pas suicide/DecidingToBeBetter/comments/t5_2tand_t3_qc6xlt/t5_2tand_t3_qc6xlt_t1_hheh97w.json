The act of going to college is similar to getting the portfolio done.  In school, do you only think about the end goal of the degree or do you do the process of going to classes?  The dread and pressure of the end goal can be alleviated by focusing on the process.  EG for the portfolio, set aside some small amount of time each day, 10-30 min, to make any progress on the portfolio.   Perhaps create a list of small steps that are easy to cross off.  Doing even one small thing towards it is forward progress and allows you to feel something positive about the progress.   Then, as you are able, you can add a bit more.  If it makes you happy rather than feeling of dread, you\u2019ll likely spend more time on it.  If you miss a day, give yourself forgiveness rather than beating yourself up.  Start small, build on the positivity of success.    You can do this.   Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qc6xlt/i_have_a_terrible_time_management_and_i_want_to/hheh97w/"}
