I am very proud of you to take this step. We will make it out alive. One tip I can give you: if you can't do it for yourself at some times, do it for your daughter. This will activate unknown resources of strenght. I recently had to start over my fight and my newborn nephew activated my strenght to turn around this time.\n\nFor the part of killing yourself: I hate the internet and people. Nobody knows how much they can destroy with a simple message. I personally have an anti suicide contract with a clinic I was at. This \"meaningless\" piece of paper is my bible in dark times and I would never ever see this as a valid option anymore.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gqpwuu/update_one_upvote_and_ill_admit_myself_to_the/frulg6v/"}
