I came here today looking for you and I'm extremely happy that you talked to your doctor and are now on anti depressants. \n\nWe're living in a really crappy time. No wonder your depression-brain took over and started feeding you these lies. \n\nAnti depressants are great, but sometimes it takes a few trials to find the right ones. So don't be discouraged if they don't work too well or if they make you sick. There are a ton out there, and sometimes it will take time to find the right med and dosage. I think I tried about 7 different kinds before I found the ones that really work without making me feel like crap. \n\nKeep fighting for yourself. Remember that it does not define you. It's an illness that you have and you need to deal with, just like any other illness. I'm here if you need to talk. I'm on the same path.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gqpwuu/update_one_upvote_and_ill_admit_myself_to_the/frutbvy/"}
