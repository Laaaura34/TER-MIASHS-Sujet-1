The best insight I can give you when you go on anti-depressants is that there are many different types of anti-depressants and some will not help you. When I went in I figured they would all be the same, but learned that that is not true at all. The first type of anti-depressant I tried did nothing to make me feel better and only ended up killing my sex-drive. After a month or two on them I decided to try something else. I was lucky because the 2nd ones I tried were really helpful. \n\nIt may take a long time of frustration and the wrong drugs before you find something that works for you. Don't give up, eventually you will find a cocktail that is just right for you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gqpwuu/update_one_upvote_and_ill_admit_myself_to_the/frur7fu/"}
