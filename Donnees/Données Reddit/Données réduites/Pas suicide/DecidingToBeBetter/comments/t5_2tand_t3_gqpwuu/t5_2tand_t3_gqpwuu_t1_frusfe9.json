You\u2019re doing absolutely the right thing and we are all SO proud of you! As for the people that thought it was okay to send such horrific messages, I\u2019m so sorry that you were the target of that. You absolutely did not deserve it. You deserve help, and good things in your life. \n\nI\u2019m glad that it sounds like you\u2019re keeping your head up, though. The medication should start helping within a week, two at most to notice a difference, so just try to hold on until then.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gqpwuu/update_one_upvote_and_ill_admit_myself_to_the/frusfe9/"}
