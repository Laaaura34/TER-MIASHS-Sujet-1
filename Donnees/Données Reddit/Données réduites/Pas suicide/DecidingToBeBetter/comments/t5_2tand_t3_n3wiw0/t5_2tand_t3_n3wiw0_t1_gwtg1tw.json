My husband had lost a daughter before we'd met and I couldn't comprehend what that must be like for him and after we had our son, it became completely unthinkable to me how anyone could go on after such a loss. \n\nI'm glad you were able to enact a great change for yourself, its truly phenomenal that not only are you still on your feet but actually improving an aspect of your life as well.
