Where? Show me? Show anyone. Just a bunch of garbage in your screwed up head. You've got some kind of  bogeymen in your life. This isn't the first time you've attacked people who are positive and constructive over shit that doesn't exist except in your triggered, damaged, delusional little brain. You want to be a judgemental, righteous bitch? Get a grip and a good shrink and unpack *your* shit. Better yet, just pack it in. No one needs to be subjected to your disease. Hang your shit somewhere else. The OP thanked the commenter for their sincere, well meaning, supportive comment and sent them a heart. That's more than good enough for me. So what's  your problem? And she had to ask you to stop fighting. The other commenter apologized. Of course you didn't. The one who started the shit in the first place. You fucked up a good post about someone celebrating overcoming hardship. Congrats again. Try to be a normal human being for a change. I'm sick of the cuntish way you respond to good and kind thoughts and people.
