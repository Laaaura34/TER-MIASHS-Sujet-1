Having those commitments and making the affirmations you're making for yourself is a perfect way to start! I might add, make a hand written list and keep it by your bed. Read it every morning and every night after waking up/before going to bed (even if it means waking up 5 minutes earlier). \n\n\nIf you want to be a step ahead, record yourself saying those affirmations and play that memo when you're laying in bed. I recommend leaving enough time in between affirmations so you can really FEEL the things that you're saying. Your brain is a simulator of reality, you can definitely trick it into agreeing to your affirmations over time. The recording isn't going to be perfect the first time around, and it's definitely weird hearing your own voice, but I find that it helps a lot! \n\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have any questions/want a buddy to track your commitment during this major positive change in your life :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/brthrj/done_with_excuses_and_avoidance/eohmm0t/"}
