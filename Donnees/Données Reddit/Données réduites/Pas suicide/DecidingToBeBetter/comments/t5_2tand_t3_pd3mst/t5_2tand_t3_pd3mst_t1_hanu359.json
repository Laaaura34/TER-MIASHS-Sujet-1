It seems too hard to engage with the world. It is easier to be distracted and avoid rather than doing things that are mundane but will improve my life.\n\nI know to break useless old habits I must start new better habits. Riding my bike is like you going to the gym, a good thing. But I want to take steps to increase and enrich in more ways.\n\nI will do self talk and visualize doing good stuff. I will see myself taking care of business, like paper work, or new hobbies/skills. I will use self talk to tell myself to give nice gifts to my future self, by using time and energy now. I will sacrifice my phone now to benefit the future me. Then when the future me reaps the benefits, I will thank and appreciate me, profusely, for the work and preparation that has been done.\n\nI am talking to myself now. Thank you for helping me start the conversation.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pd3mst/struggling_to_stay_off_my_phone/hanu359/"}
