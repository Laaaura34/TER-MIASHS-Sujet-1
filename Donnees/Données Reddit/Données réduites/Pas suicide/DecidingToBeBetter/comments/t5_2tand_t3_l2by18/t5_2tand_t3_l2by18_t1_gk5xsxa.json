I live in a legal country, and yet, I have been refused mental help for smoking weed. At a certain point I was suicidal and refused help for smoking.\n\nI have since quit and gotten help. Smoking didn't make me feel any better, but I don't think it was valid to deny me help for it.\n\nI don't really think I went through withdrawals, but I was horribly depressed at the time so I'm not sure...\n\nAnyway, good luvk, it's good you stopped. Now make sure to go out there and get the help you deserve", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l2by18/threw_out_my_weed_scheduled_a_psych_appointment/gk5xsxa/"}
