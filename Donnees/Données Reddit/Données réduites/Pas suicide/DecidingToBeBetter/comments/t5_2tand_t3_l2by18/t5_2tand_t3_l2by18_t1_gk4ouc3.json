Kinda why I don't like r/leaves because it's everyone blaming weed for their problems when really I'm the source of my problems and weed has been a crutch. Now that I've told myself that I want to accomplish certain things after work and have a designated time for smoking I feel more in control. I'm also journaling about when I feel the need to smoke since it's been so built into my routine. \n\nMy therapist says there is a strong link psychologically between dependency and weed. But it is physically (get it) impossible to be addicted to weed.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l2by18/threw_out_my_weed_scheduled_a_psych_appointment/gk4ouc3/"}
