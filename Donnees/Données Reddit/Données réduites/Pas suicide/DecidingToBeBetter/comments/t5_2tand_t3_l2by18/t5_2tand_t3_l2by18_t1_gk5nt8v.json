Probably less than that.  I was a chronic pot smoker for nearly a decade.  I found that if it was in the house, I'd smoke it.  I couldn't say no, until it was gone.\n\nOnce I made the commitment not to reup, I found success.  Replacing the activity with more healthy activities is also huge.  \n\nA few things about coming off it:\n\n-Your memory comes back, and you feel like you have super powers.\n\n-I had a few bouts of lucid dreaming, which was fun.\n\n-It was regulating my appetite, which I hadn't realized. I'd go all day without eating, and not notice, until 6pm when my stomach started growling like crazy.\n\n\nIt seems daunting, but it's not that difficult.  It becomes much harder, especially in a pandemic, if someone else in the house is still smoking.\n\nI've found that the only way to quit is to consciously abstain for awhile.  It takes willpower, which you can manifest if you truly want something.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l2by18/threw_out_my_weed_scheduled_a_psych_appointment/gk5nt8v/"}
