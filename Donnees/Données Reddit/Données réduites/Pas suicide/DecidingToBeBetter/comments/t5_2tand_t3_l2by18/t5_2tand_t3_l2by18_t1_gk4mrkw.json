Realizing you want to stop is the first step. Now you can work on it. I quit smoking cigs regularly about 2 years ago after smoking multiple cigarettes everyday for about 5-6 years (on and off). Now, I do go back when I\u2019m under unusual amounts of stress, but it only lasts about a few weeks before I stop again. I see that as better than doing it all the time. Good luck on your journey and remember to be nice but disciplined with yourself while you\u2019re on it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l2by18/threw_out_my_weed_scheduled_a_psych_appointment/gk4mrkw/"}
