Terence McKenna thought of it as an intellectual catalyst and would read, study, and lecture for hours on end while high due to the way he perceived of it. The way we contextualize and preconceive its use certainly effects what we feel on it. Weed can be a very psychological drug in itself, and I think the reason many feel lazy or bad on it is due to either their preconceived notions, subconscious or otherwise instilled, or just what they naturally are at that point in their life. Weeds one of those things where your mindset certainly helps create the experience you have while on it. I don\u2019t think it should be demonized, and I don\u2019t think drugs should be demonized generally, to be clear. Someone could use ketamine therapeutically to lift them out of depression, while another user can become depressed due to being addicted to it\u2014or psychologically dependent, whatever someone wants to compartmentalize it as. Almost all drugs can be used therapeutically and positively, imo, if used responsibly. True personal responsibility is a skill and muscle, and I won\u2019t claim to have that fully. \ud83d\ude42", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l2by18/threw_out_my_weed_scheduled_a_psych_appointment/gk4pqtx/"}
