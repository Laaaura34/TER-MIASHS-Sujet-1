It gets the ball rolling for more positive thinking. After the cup of coffee or whatever it is I\u2019m looking forward to then it isn\u2019t necessarily about the next thing but just looking for the good things in my day. A couple years ago I did a thought journal where I would basically just write down my thoughts and then look back at them like a month later. Looking back made me realize how negative, self-loathing, and simple my thoughts were. So I just started twisting my thoughts to be more positive. Some examples of actual thoughts and feelings I had 2 years ago and the ones I\u2019ve been thinking since forming a positive habit: 1) \u201cI have to go to work\u201d < \u201cMy job has the best free coffee.\u201d 2) \u201cI only get paid $13/hr\u201d < \u201cI have a low-stress job in an air conditioned building where I\u2019m basically allowed to do whatever I want\u201d 3) \u201cI must be trash if Michael stopped texting and calling me after the 3rd date\u201d < \u201cBeing single means I get to go on many more dates with other fun and interesting men\u201d 4) \u201cbullshit spectrum keeps cutting out my Internet\u201d < \u201cSince the Internet is out again, I have time to get into that book I\u2019ve been wanting to read\u201d 5) \u201cKarlie looks terrible in that black turtleneck\u201d < \u201cYou do you girl\u201d 6) \u201cFml, everything in my life sucks\u201d < \u201cMy dog is the cutest little shit I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d It\u2019s taken awhile but I feel I\u2019m emotionally and mentally in a much better place since I started to critique my thoughts.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bt3ay3/something_ive_noticed_that_has_truly_increased/eovktm3/"}
