I used to drink a lot of diet soda (which is terrible for you anyway) so I have carbonated water as a way to satisfy my taste sensation. Add with a slice of lime and some ice it\u2019s amazing, and I can feel the physical benefits of feeling better and healthier in almost every way.\n\nI\u2019ve also got into a regular sleeping pattern and wake up early enough where I have a spare 30-40 minutes to sit and relax before starting my day at work. I don\u2019t even have to do anything constructive, it\u2019s just lovely not to have to rush my day first thing when my brain was previously probably still waking up.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/htt0si/i_got_out_of_my_benzo_addiction_during_lockdown/fyl1c14/"}
