I work in an office and when people give me their name and number on the phone I struggle to keep up and recite information just given me. Unfortunately I fear that the benzo abuse has had a negative long term effect on my brain and memory.\n\nCongratulations on giving up after such a long time. I really, really hope that you can continue being strong.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/htt0si/i_got_out_of_my_benzo_addiction_during_lockdown/fykjcmp/"}
