I came off Valium and tramadol during the lockdown. I needed support to help me taper for 3 months, I had 2 seizures, I fractured my spine but I\u2019m off them now and I feel like hell. I can\u2019t speak to anyone, I am rediscovering myself and my mind; my focus and memory are coming back. I got chills reading your post, it\u2019s the reason why meetings and these subreddit groups work, I don\u2019t feel so alone now!! Thank you and congrats on your recovery!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/htt0si/i_got_out_of_my_benzo_addiction_during_lockdown/fyjdeg6/"}
