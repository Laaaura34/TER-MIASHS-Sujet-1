I know a man who started smoking cigarettes at the age of of 9, became addicted in his teens, swore he could always kick the habit, in his 50s got into three packs a day which led to humongous really scary nosebleeds, tried a few times to quit afterwards after he had lost his teeth (his gums had stopped bleeding due to the constant exposure to the hot gasses and nicotine in the smoke) so he didn\u2019t know he had gum disease, and then somehow finally beat it cold turkey at age 70.
