I quit weed and nicotine. Been off them for around 2 weeks or more. I\u2019m having trouble quitting porn though. \n\nI feel nasty and I\u2019m tired of chasing that erotic high. Been hooked since I was like in high school. I\u2019m 22 now. Been a daily thing for me, minus some occasions. \n\nI was trying to quit porn too but quitting all 3 habits at once were just so hard for me. Not even just porn, social media influences my neuroticism with all these girls showing their \u201cpackages\u201d off. Contemplating on deleting instagram for that reason and mental health reasons. I even fell into my addiction once again after trying to quit and bought a fleshlight when I threw my first one away. It\u2019s just been really hard since I\u2019ve never been in a relationship and am a virgin. I\u2019m not really saving sex for marriage but it would be nice to. Just trying to find the right person. \n\nI\u2019ll eventually get there :) \n\nAs you mentioned for spirituality too, I just feel so guilty. Also I can\u2019t see women as just women anymore at times. I need to stop. \n\nBeen doing all 3 for a while now, usually all at once too (+1 alcohol too but I quit that a while ago). \n\n2 down 1 to go.\n\nHead up king/queen, you\u2019re doing great!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lminma/decided_to_quit_porn_weed_and_nicotine_all_cold/go6n3fg/"}
