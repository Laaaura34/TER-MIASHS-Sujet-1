Though 21 was a shit one I\u2019m proud of the changes I\u2019ve made for my health. Hardly ever drink anymore or smoke cigs. \n\nI keep weed around but that\u2019s because it\u2019s a big hobby for me and in the future I would much rather be the dad that lights up a joint after work instead of the one that pours up a glass.\n\n\nI hate to admit it but going cold turkey often seems like it\u2019s working initially and then comes crashing down. I don\u2019t want to discourage you, but being aware of that will help you prevent it from happening. Make sure you\u2019re replacing them with healthy rewards!
