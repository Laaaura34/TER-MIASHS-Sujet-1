Whenever someone is doing something that seems strange or wrong to me, I remind myself that (generally) it makes sense to them to say/do whatever is going on.  So I try to figure out how they see things such that it does in fact make sense rather than dismissing them.\n\nThat doesn't mean that I always (or even often) come around to agree that what they're doing is indeed sensible, but I find it easier to be both more forgiving/understanding and just generally less annoyed when I start from that point of view.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pzteho/i_decide_to_be_less_judgmental/hf3575y/"}
