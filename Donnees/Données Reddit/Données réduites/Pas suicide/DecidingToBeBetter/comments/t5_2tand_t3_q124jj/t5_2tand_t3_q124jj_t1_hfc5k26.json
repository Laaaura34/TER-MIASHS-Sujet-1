All the thoughts that come to my mind is that the issue is me being me. I don't want to be me. I wish I wasn't, but I get that it may not be entirely true\n\nI'm honestly very afraid of having bad times after a good time, as my life is filled with bad times mostly and whenever I have a good time, I don't wanna lose it at all just to be back on them.\n\nYou seem to have more stability and know how life works better than me - cause honestly I got no idea how it works. So perhaps that's why I can't understand it all well. I agree that I have to be able to sit with myself and figure out what's wrong inside, though.\n\nRegardless your reply is appreciated. I'm trying to look inward and keep trying to figure things out", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q124jj/i_hate_that_reddit_and_random_strangers_is/hfc5k26/"}
