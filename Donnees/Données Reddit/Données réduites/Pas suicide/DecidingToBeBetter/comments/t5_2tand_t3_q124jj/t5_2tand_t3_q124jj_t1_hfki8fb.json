Sadly I don't have the option to therapy. Therapists usually suck here because it's a 3rd world place and honestly I have no interest in being on medication randomly without knowing if I really need it or not.\n\n I used to think that my depression is situational, as in moving out and being independent and not being so alone would make me feel better but now I'm starting to think there's more to it. Like on an internal, or existential level or maybe I simply overthink it. I hope it's not chemical imbalance\n\nI actively try to get into learning more about my struggles and everything with internet. It can be helpful at times and it definitely did help me out. Although sometimes I give up everything but I'm trying. I suppose I'll turn to music making to at some point but right now.. it's not something I can bring myself to do, I feel as if all the spirit and creativity inside me were gone. If it was there in the first place, that is\nMaybe when I get w guitar I'll start on it.\n\nThank you for your through reply. It's appreciated. I wish u the best too. Hopefully I'll get out of this someday", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q124jj/i_hate_that_reddit_and_random_strangers_is/hfki8fb/"}
