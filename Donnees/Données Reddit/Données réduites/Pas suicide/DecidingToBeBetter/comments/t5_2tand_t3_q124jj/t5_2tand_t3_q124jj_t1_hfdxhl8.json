I very much agree with you but on the other side there are indeed things I wanna change. Not because society but because me. I don't care if someone is unhappy in my situation or not, I know I'm not. Like having independency from my family, finding friends, finding something I wanna do as a career (I got no idea about this one yet). Lately I just been very questioning if I do all of this, will I feel okay eventually? I think maybe some things are troubled internally too as you pointed or maybe I just think too much about everything. I wish I knew which one it is \n\nI appreciate hearing that I have a lot of time but I feel exactly the opposite, every second is passing and I'm living like this. but probably that's my negative thoughts and me being hard on myself.\n\nBut yeah, that's all. I hope I can get somewhere. And by this I mean being fulfilled on my own terms.
