I will humbly share my opinion.\n\nThis may sound strange to you but it is a spiritual truth:\n\nOur psychological conditions are not always about us. There are forces of Nature at work all the time that affect our psychology and inner peace. \n\nIt might be that you are feeling this way because your environment is feeding you experiences that are not healthy for your Soul. Yes you have a Soul despite how much our modern society tries to hide this under the carpet. \n\nMaybe it's the environment, maybe it's the people around you, maybe it's the food you're eating, maybe it's mental feedback loops (repeating thoughts) that you haven't identified yet, maybe it's even the configuration of the planets themselves. Yes really. Everything in the Universe has an effect on our experience. \n\nWhat I do in my healing practice is help people identify how the world is affecting them and how to correct it. Like I mentioned it is spiritual holistic healing. It might not be for everyone. \n\nBut if you're curious and want to talk more I'm happy to help. I am not looking to charge money, I am doing this to practice my healing art as my personal form of Devotion. \n\nBest of luck \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc do not give up.
