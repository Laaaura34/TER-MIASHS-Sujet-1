You shouldn't do anything with the intention of being delusional.\n2. Spiritualism is just a just a hippy way to say 'subjective conscious improvement'.  It's a very broad category and while some people might find some use for astrology or tarot cards it doesn't mean you do if it sets off your BS alarms.\n3. If you find a resource that is helping you lead a better life or helping those around you use a better life than use it despite whatever label might be thrown on it.\n4. Sometimes you can take some of the 'mystical' spiritualism components and extract wisdom from them.  For example, I don't believe in chakra stuff but the reality is if you focused on improving your 'chakras' it would lead to overall life improvement.   Not because there is a literal heart chakra located at the root of your spine or that eating broccoli helps it but doing things to improve your compassion, joy and kindness will overall lead to a better life. \n\nI hope that makes sense.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/psrq7t/should_i_drink_the_spiritual_koolaid/hds0105/"}
