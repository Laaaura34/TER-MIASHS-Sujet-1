I don\u2019t think one needs to be a christian to follow their golden rule. And the Buddhist have a ton of things that make perfect sense, but you don\u2019t need to believe in reincarnation. I think spirituality and religion can be an attractive thing for someone who is codependent. It takes away most mysteries in life, giving you answers about why we are here, our mission in life, where we\u2019re going when we die. Even if those things aren\u2019t true, THEY believe them, and that\u2019s the point. Personally, I consider myself to be a pretty rational and pragmatic person.. the idea of \u201csight\u201d and tarot cards seems outlandish to me, but it\u2019s all about what it means to you. I\u2019m sure there are a lot of people who go to church/mass/temple/etc. who don\u2019t really believe it, but like the community aspect. I would just be careful that it doesn\u2019t turn into another kind of codependency, or worse, an addiction.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/psrq7t/should_i_drink_the_spiritual_koolaid/hdsig0w/"}
