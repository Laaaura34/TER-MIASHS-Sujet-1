Needed to hear this, especially today. Today was day 1 of attack a mammoth sized pile of work I\u2019m drowning in and have been for over a year. Set what I thought was a realistic goal. Only accomplished 1/4th of the list, but it\u2019s better than the 0-1% I had been doing. Same goal tomorrow with room for forgiveness. Will keep my aim high and feel good about how much I achieved as opposed to how much I didn\u2019t complete. I\u2019ve got this! Well, I will get there!:)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l4u0b0/when_practicing_self_care_doing_a_little_every/gkspub6/"}
