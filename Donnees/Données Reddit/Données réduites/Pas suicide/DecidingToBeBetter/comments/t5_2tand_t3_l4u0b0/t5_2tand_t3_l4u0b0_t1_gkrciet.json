You remind me of a story. It's the story of a little bird trying to drink water from a large jar.\n\nJust incase you've not heard this story before, allow me to share it.\n\nBut here's the problem: the jar had less water than it can carry. And the bird can't reach the water with it's beak. And if the bird try to reach it, it will fall into the water and drown.\n\nSo the bird did the next intelligent move, one that relates a lot with this post.\n\nThe bird flew to a place where it could find small sized pebbles. It will pick a pebble with it's beak, take it back and drop it into the jar.\n\nAnd each time this little bird dropped a pebble into the jar, the water level in the jar rises.\n\nSo it kept doing that until it's beak could reach for the water inside the jar.\n\nAnd when that happened it drank it's fill and flew away.\n\nThe lesson I learned from this was the fact that small little steps, no matter how tiny is an intelligent way of accomplishing a goal.\n\nSo yes, it's way better to practice self care or anything for that matter little by little every single day.\n\nAnd if I may add to that, consistency is crucial.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l4u0b0/when_practicing_self_care_doing_a_little_every/gkrciet/"}
