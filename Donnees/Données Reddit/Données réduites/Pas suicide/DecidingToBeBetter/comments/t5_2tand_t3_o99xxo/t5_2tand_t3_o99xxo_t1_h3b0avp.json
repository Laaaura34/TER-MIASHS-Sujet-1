You just can\u2019t feed it. Feed the good side of you by doing good for others including yourself and not wanting anything in return. Just good for goodness sake. Getting angry and frustrated is part of life so you just have to decide how you\u2019re going to react to it. The only true freedom we have is how we are going to react to any given situation. Most importantly is to always get up after you fall. A battle is just that, sometimes you win and sometimes you lose.
