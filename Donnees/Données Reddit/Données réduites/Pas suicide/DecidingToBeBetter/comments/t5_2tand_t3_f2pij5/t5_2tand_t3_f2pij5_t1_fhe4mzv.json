I really enjoyed him, but I know I was just a body to him. I had to force myself to cut ties and not go to his shows, unfortunately for me he lives in town and plays around here often. I see him around more then I'd like, but it is fun to see his face when I say hi and then walk away. \n\nI'm glad you didnt go. Sometimes it's hard to lose someone you were infatuated with, but it's a blessing in disguise. Well sometimes.
