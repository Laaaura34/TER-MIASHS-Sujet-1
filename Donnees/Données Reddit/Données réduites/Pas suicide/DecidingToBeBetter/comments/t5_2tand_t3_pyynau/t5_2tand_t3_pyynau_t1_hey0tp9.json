Look for that one small ounce of interest/excitement/joy in anything. For me, I was hopeless for years and legitimately thought I\u2019d be better off among the stars. I knew the only thing I could do was make changes, BIG changes, in order to hopefully expose the problem (easier said than done) This is key, as you have to try different things to recognize the wrong things. I started mixed martial arts as means of distraction from the intrusive thoughts, and a healthy physical challenge too. I found the most wonderful group of people who pushed me to my limit physically and mentally and suddenly I had an outlet, a place I felt I belonged and I think that\u2019s the key.

Once you\u2019re there, you\u2019ll get a taste of true joy and you\u2019ll know how to find it again.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pyynau/i_cant_give_meaning_to_my_life_nothing_interests/hey0tp9/"}
