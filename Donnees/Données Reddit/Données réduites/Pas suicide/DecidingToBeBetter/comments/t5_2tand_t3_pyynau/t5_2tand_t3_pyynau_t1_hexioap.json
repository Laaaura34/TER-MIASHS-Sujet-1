Might be helpful to think of it like an infection or something. It\u2019s not YOU, per se, it\u2019s something that\u2019s happening to you. Meaning that when you find the answer to why you\u2019re feeling this way, you\u2019ll be left with all the good that is the real you. Ups and downs are normal, but feeling like you are is not. Get some help, can\u2019t do it on your own! I will change the oil, brakes and some other little things on my truck, but if it really breaks down I wouldn\u2019t try to rebuild an engine on my own. Know your limits. Hit me up anytime you need to chat. I\u2019ve been dealing with this depression crap for 20 years or so and have lots of experience with how it effects me.
