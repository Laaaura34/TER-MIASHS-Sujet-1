No ambition, goals, friends, didn't really care about anything, sat around all day and did nothing. Then I realized, those things I didn't care about or have or did, is what's causing my suffering. So I started going to the gym, taking care of myself, learning how to be more sociable, and just making an effort. (still a work in progress) The main thing for me was that I was waiting to feel good to begin, I was waiting to become interested in something to begin. Instead of waiting for that time, I just went and started something new. My life is way better now. For me It was about putting in an effort even if I thought it was stupid or a waste of time.
