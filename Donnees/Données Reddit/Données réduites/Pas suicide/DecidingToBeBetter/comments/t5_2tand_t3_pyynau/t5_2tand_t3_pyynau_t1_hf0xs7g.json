I think it is but I\u2019m just another random person on Reddit. It\u2019s why I suggested therapy. Last year around this time I was not doing well. It didn\u2019t occur to me that I might have been depressed, but looking back I think I was. I was experiencing anxiety which also didn\u2019t occur to me either. Long story short, I tried different modalities and I think they all helped me. I work at my mental and emotional health every day. Some days more than others. \n\nAs Cat Steven\u2019s sang, oooo baby it\u2019s a wild world. \n\nTreat yourself like you would a good friend who is struggling. There really, really is joy to be found. Wishing you much happiness.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pyynau/i_cant_give_meaning_to_my_life_nothing_interests/hf0xs7g/"}
