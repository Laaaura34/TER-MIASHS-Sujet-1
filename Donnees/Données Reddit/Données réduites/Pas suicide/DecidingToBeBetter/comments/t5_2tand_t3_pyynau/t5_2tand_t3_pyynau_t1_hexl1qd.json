I promise. I know this feeling well. It can feel suffocating and like there\u2019s no point to anything. It will pass. I know that doesn\u2019t help much in the moment though. \n\nWhat usually helps me is having small projects to work on. Learning something new for no particular reason (I picked up learning Spanish with the Duolinguo app), coloring, fixing something around the house with help from YouTube, anything to keep your mind occupied. \n\nI don\u2019t want to diagnose anything over the internet, but the things you\u2019re talking about are always telltale signs of my depression sneaking up on me. It always passes, but in the moment it is really difficult to recognize on my own. Surrounding myself with people I could trust to be honest with me even when my own brain wasn\u2019t was key and trusting my doctor enough to tell her what was going on was world changing.
