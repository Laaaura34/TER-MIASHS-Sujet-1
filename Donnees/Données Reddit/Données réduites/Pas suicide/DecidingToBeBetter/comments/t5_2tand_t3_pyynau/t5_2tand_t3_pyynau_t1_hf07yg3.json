They make it seem like you're just super sad all the time, but for a lot of people it's just a lack of will. I remember being very happy, just unable to force myself to do basic things. \n\nI started taking 2400mg of fish oil and 20k units of D every day (tapered off D over the course of 6 months to 5k units per day). Then I started exercising every single day. Then eventually I'd get done exercising and still feel like doing stuff. Eventually I started getting more enjoyment from getting shit done, now I'm on a roll! Super productive every morning, taking good care of stuff.
