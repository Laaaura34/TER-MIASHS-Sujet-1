( with goals im working towards, that make me happy) I recommend panda planner for planning.\n\n- have a short cold shower in the morning for 30 seconds and then a warm shower\n\n- Be kind to myself every day which means: accepting all feelings, talking to myself like a great kind dad or mom would (in the mirror each morning I say \u00abyou are loved and good enough just the way you are\u00bb and in my own head I talk to myself with an accepting, kind and calm inner voice)\n\n- I take action on the things I want even though they are scary, and I feel resistance. Accept the resistance and do it anyway.\n\n- train for at least 10 minutes every day. Can be everything from yoga, weightlifting, running, walking etc.\n\n- one time each day connect with someone, call a friend, family, meet up for coffee.\n\nThis has taken me from depressed to a positive person excited for what the future holds.\n\nStart with one thing first:\n\nI would recommend starting with cold showers, start with 10 seconds, then build up to 30s-1 minute. That will kickstart your production of endorphines and dopamine, after a few days you will already start to feel a change. There has been tons of scientific studies on cold therapy. I was sceptic, but it actually works and the science proves it as well. Good luck, you can do this :-)!\n\n\nJust take one step everyday and soon you will have walked around the earth", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pyynau/i_cant_give_meaning_to_my_life_nothing_interests/hf1oygf/"}
