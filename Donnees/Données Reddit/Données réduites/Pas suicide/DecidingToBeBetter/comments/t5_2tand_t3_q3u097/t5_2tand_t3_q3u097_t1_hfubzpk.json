I just stopped talking to her. For YEARS. We had been friends since freshman year of HS.  \n\nI did kind of miss her, so I started talking to her a bit on FB. We like each other's posts, share a couple of links, she's not as bad as she was, and it is kind of comforting having a peek in her life and her having a peek at mine.\n\nSo yeah, keep her at arms length or even take a break. A month, a year, years. Whatever.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfubzpk/"}
