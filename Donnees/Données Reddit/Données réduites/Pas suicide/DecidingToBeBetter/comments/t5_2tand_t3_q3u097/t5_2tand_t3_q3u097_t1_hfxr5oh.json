The things you said are almost identical to the friend I had.  \n\nMy realization of this happened by accident.  I was going over old emails when I realize that throughout the years, she always asked for advice or wanted someone to hear her about her problems.  So I was always there for her.  When the roles were reversed, she never asked or became interested in my problems/issues.  All she said was \u201chope it gets better,\u201d  or \u201cthat sucks.\u201d  She never provided any advice or guidance.  It was at that moment I cut her off and never felt happier.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfxr5oh/"}
