I never realized how much my best friend was holding me back and filling me with insecurities. I don\u2019t think there was any malice involved, I think our worst traits just came out around each other and we amplified them. \n\nCutting them out of my life was a huge step forward. They always discouraged me in everything, told me to cut my losses, not to try for things because I will just fail..things like that. Now, I would never have described it that was at the time, I would have said he was helping me to be pragmatic and other things, because I didn\u2019t have the clarity then that I do now.\n\nTake some time off, it will be good for your mental health.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfuehod/"}
