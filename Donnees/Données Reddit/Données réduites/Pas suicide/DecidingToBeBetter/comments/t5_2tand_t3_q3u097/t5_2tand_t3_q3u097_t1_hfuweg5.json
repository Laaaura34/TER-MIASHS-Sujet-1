So if you feel like Jay influence is no longer positive, putting some distance wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing. But, be careful about trying to put the responsibility of you holding yourself back on to Jay. Jay isn\u2019t forcing you to go to the bar. Jay isn\u2019t holding your phone hostage and preventing you from reconnecting with old friends. Jay isn\u2019t stopping you from talking about stocks, jamming out on the guitar, or going on hikes. I feel like you\u2019re putting a lot of responsibility for the fact that you haven\u2019t taken initiative to reconnect with friends and explore other activities onto her, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s entirely fair. If you don\u2019t want to go to the bar, don\u2019t go. Suggest other activities, or invite Jay to do things that don\u2019t involve drinking and the bar. And if she has no interest, then maybe this friendship has run its course. But I think it\u2019s a bit of a fallacy to think that if she was magically gone from your life, that you would be doing all of these things towards self improvement and hanging out with motivated people just automatically.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfuweg5/"}
