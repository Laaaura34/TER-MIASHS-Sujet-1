I started a year ago and I\u2019m just beginning to accept my mixed emotions surrounding creating a better life for myself, which required remodelling my entire social life. It\u2019s a bit like saving and budgeting. It might radically change your daily experience, you won\u2019t experience certain things you\u2019ve been comfortable with etc\u2026 but after a while, you\u2019ll see you have more of yourself in order to afford the life you deserve. \n\nIn my case, I\u2019m a musician and I had to let go of so many working relationships which were also my social circle, saying no to income and socializing all in the name of saving myself for a better future. Let go and keep faith. These people can still be in your life to some capacity. Be loving towards them but don\u2019t waste your time and energy. Be the person you envision yourself being consistently and you\u2019ll have less time for them. Eventually they\u2019ll move on because like attracts like and they\u2019ll probably won\u2019t want to hang out with you either. \n\nWhen confronting anyone, don\u2019t talk about what they do that you don\u2019t like, talk about what you need to do for yourself. Example, don\u2019t tell your friend she\u2019s a Debbie downer, but say you need to spend more time working on your passions and being with like minded people.\n\nYou know instinctively that you need to let go. The sooner you do it, the sooner you\u2019ll start living the life you deserve.\n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfuyph4/"}
