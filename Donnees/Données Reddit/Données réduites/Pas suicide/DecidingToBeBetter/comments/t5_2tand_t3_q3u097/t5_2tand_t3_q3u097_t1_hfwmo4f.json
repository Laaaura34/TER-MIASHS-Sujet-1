It would likely be heartbreaking. You can edit the cast of people in your life but it's not about \"us\" all of the time. It's about bringing ourselves up by bringing others up. I'm not saying you need to be a savior here or that it's even possible, but I think there is way to determine if there is something salvageable or changeable (\"Hey Jay, what do you think about going hiking this week? I know it's different for us, but...\") before deciding the relationship is truly not good for your mental health.\n\nIt scares me a bit how quickly people on reddit (not saying this is the case with you OP!) want to let others go sometimes. Self-improvement is about improving, and that improvement may not look like what you think - it may mean working on a friendship, and if relationships mirror our own issues back to us, maybe you can ask yourself what in this friendship could be triggering you? Does there need to be a \"plan,\" or can you let this figure itself out organically and continue to honor your friendship with this person while exploring other friendships? Best of luck to you OP.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfwmo4f/"}
