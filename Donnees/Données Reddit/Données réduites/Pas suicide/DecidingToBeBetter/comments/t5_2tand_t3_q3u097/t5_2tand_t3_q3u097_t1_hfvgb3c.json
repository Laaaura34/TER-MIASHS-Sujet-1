All his new friends went to the opera and fancy restaurants and I still went to the same dive bars we always did. I didn't realize he was suddenly looking down on me and all of the fun we used to have. He was somebody who used to happily engage in bullshit with me then just ditched me as soon as I was struggling instead of telling me \"Hey, your negativity is a real bummer. Sorry you're going through something but you need a therapist.\" So as a former Jay, just know you're going to be crushing her and making her feel like she was never your friend to begin with. She'll probably struggle years with her self worth but at least you can talk about the stock market, now!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfvgb3c/"}
