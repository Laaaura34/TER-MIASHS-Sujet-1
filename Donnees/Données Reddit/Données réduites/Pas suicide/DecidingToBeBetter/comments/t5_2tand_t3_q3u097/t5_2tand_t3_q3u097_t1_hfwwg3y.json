Maybe instead of quitting her you could try to influence her and show her another way of living. If not, I can bet that you will become her in your new \u201cinstead\u201d relationships. Your new friendships will start to look at you like you do her.  It sounds to me like you\u2019ve already made up your mind and maybe she would be better off without you.\n\nEDIT&REWIND::::: On the other hand\u2026 My gawd FUCK HER ALREADY! Tell her how you feel and jump her bones! She\u2019s literally probably only acting dumb and saying stuff about her ex to keep you on your toes and to get your attention. She probably only goes to the bar because that\u2019s what she thinks you want to do (trust me, we don\u2019t always have any logical reason to do any of the weird shit woman do to get someone\u2019s attention). And now cut to the chase, make your move because she never will be the one to make the first move, and go live your best lives together with all the other cool folks you mentioned!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfwwg3y/"}
