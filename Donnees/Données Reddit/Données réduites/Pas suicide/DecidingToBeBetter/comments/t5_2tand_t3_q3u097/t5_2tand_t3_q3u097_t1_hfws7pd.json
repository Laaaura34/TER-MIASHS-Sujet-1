You CHOSE to go to the bar with her twice a week. It sounds like you need to think about what you want out of the friendship and then explain those wants and set your own boundaries.  It may be that she becomes someone you see occasionally rather than weekly. Although I think it\u2019s so important to cut out toxic friends, I also think there is a great value in old friends who have known you a long time. So yeah, it sounds like something definitely needs to change in your relationship but I don\u2019t think completely cutting her out is the only option.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfws7pd/"}
