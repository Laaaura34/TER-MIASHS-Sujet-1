We fought, I wrote her a letter about everything I felt was wrong with how she treated me and included what I had found out doing some introspection, that I had in a way allowed this to happen, I was codependent and didn't stand up for my boundaries. Sounds like you have been doing yourself a disservice by not having boundaries in this friendship. Perhaps start there, or cut contact. Whatever works best for you. \nEven now afterwards it's not easy and she still does some of those toxic things, but I've become better at calling her out and putting boundaries. I still want my best friend in my life, but I know that doesn't work for everyone.
