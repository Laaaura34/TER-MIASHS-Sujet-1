Decreasing the time you spend with \"energy vampires\" can salvage the relationship if you do still value them at all. And it's also critical to set healthy boundaries.\n\nI have this problem with my mom. She just won't stop talking about politics, ever, to the point of obsession. She's become so negative about the future. The thing is, I'm totally on her side, but dwelling on it brings me down. I have to work hard to remain positive.\n\nAnyway, I would never cut my mom out of my life, but I had to tell her I can't spend any more of my precious time with her feeling bad about stuff. She took it fairly well, and still needs occasional reminding, but it felt good to communicate that to her in a constructive way.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfvezml/"}
