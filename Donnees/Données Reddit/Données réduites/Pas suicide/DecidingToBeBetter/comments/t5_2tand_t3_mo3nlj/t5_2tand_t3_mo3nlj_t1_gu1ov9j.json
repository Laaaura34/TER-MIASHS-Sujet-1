That said, mindfulness is what helped me move forward because I could start spotting the anxiety and fear of rejection as it happened (hard act before the \"yes\" comes out if you don't practice listening to your emotions). \n\nI want to be clear that i know mindfulness is hard to learn and I'm still very early in the journey, but since it's helped me I want to ask if that seems like an option for you. Right now there's a lot of autopilot responses that aren't serving you. If you practice recognizing those responses as they bubble up do you think that would help? Waking Up app by Sam Harris also extremely helpful for this.\n\nWishing you all the best!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mo3nlj/people_pleasers_saying_no_might_feel_rude_but/gu1ov9j/"}
