It hit home on many levels. I've been a people pleaser in my whole life for the simple reason, as you explained, that it was easier to say yes and deal with my anger at myself for giving in then to deal with the anxiety of having other people disappointed or angry with me. In the last few years, I have learned the following:\n\n1. Saying no to someone else is actually saying yes to yourself.\n\n2. Pleasing everyone else is great, but it leads to depression because often when we say yes to others we're saying no to ourselves. This makes us angry at ourselves which leads to depression. Cycle continues.\n\n3. No is a full sentence. There is no need to explain. If anyone asks why, you do not need to give them an answer. You owe no one an explanation.\n\n4. Oh how I wish I had learned this 40 years ago.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mo3nlj/people_pleasers_saying_no_might_feel_rude_but/gu23kvw/"}
