I *literally* run 10kms regularly and I get out of breath when I walk up some stairs (especially if I'm talking to someone...). \n\nAs someone who used to hate running, everyone I know laughs now when I say I love running. The biggest change for me was an easy one. Music. I put on some upbeat music (Nightcore remixes of songs on youtube are great) and just went out and started. And *god* it sucked at first. But if you set achievable goals (ie. I will run while a song is playing, and while I pick the next one I can walk, and then next week I will run for five minutes and walk for 60 seconds, and the week after I'll fun for seven minutes and walk for 45 seconds) you can definitely do it! Just find a way to move that you enjoy - it doesn't have to be running, it might be just dance (which, if you don't have the game, you can follow on youtube lol), or yoga, or swimming.\n\nAs for eating well, like other comments have said, cooking shows are your friends. There are also some great subs on reddit that can help.\n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hje5jb/im_extremely_weak_and_i_dont_know_how_to_help/fwo8qyf/"}
