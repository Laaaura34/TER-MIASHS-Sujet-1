I used to be an awesome runner, and even I would get winded climbing stairs.  I used to have great muscle condition, and even I would feel the burn when carrying groceries.  If you just push through this initial shock to the system, I think you will find that you can exercise and sustain activity a lot longer than you think.  \n\nOne thing that has helped me is to approach working out as play.  Instead of having a structured workout program, I use a program of curiosity.  What happens if I take off running at a certain pace and keep going?  What happens if I try to invent new movements with weights or my body weight?  How far can I dribble a basketball?  How long can I jump rope?  How far can I swim underwater without coming up for air?  Exercise is just a series of skills to be practiced, and while improvement is cool, it is more satisfying psychologically to do things in a manner where you enjoy the process more than the end result.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hje5jb/im_extremely_weak_and_i_dont_know_how_to_help/fwlsgwd/"}
