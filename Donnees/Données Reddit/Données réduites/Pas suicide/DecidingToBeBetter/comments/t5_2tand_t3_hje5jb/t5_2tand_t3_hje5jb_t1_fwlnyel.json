I honestly learnt from watching shows like Ready Steady Cook. Start with easy things. Learn how to make a salad with your favourite salad veg and some cooked chicken, tinned beans, or something added for protein. Buy a healthyish dressing and crackers and there you are, one meal you have learnt how to prepare. \n\nCheck out r/eatcheapandhealthy for further ideas. Lots of inspiration on there. Jamie Oliver on tv does some fun meals, he has some good books too. \n\nRegarding exercise, why not start with walking? Use your mobile to track your steps, or use a fun challenge app like Pokemon or Strava. Walk a thousand steps, how does it feel? Try upping it slightly and slowly progress. It could be a good way of exploring where you are moving too. \n\nOnce you feel you have more stamina, you could google other exercise challenges to try. Couch to 5k gets you running 5 kilometres. There are plank challenges, push up challenges, yoga videos on youtube.\n\nEdit: oh, and if you want accountability, check out the daily accountability posts on r/getdisciplined. Don\u2019t feel overwhelmed, it is fine to put, \u201cwalk down apartment stairs and back up again\u201d as your only task, no one will judge you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hje5jb/im_extremely_weak_and_i_dont_know_how_to_help/fwlnyel/"}
