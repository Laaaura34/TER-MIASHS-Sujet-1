I\u2019ll give you one piece of advice which seems somewhat obvious but you need to remind yourself of constantly.\n\nYou can never. Ever. EVERRRR. Have, JUST. One.\n\nAddiction is a lifelong disease. I\u2019ve quit smoking a few times. Two seperate occasions I was nicotine free for almost two years, and convinced myself I could have just one, and within days I was back to smoking almost two packs a day.\n\nAnother thing that is true with quitting smoking, is each time you quit and start up again, it becomes harder to quit each time. I\u2019m currently one year nicotine free again but my last quit was excruciating. \n\nGood luck though! N don\u2019t beat yourself up if you stumble.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mngco7/i_quit_nicotine/gtzezw5/"}
