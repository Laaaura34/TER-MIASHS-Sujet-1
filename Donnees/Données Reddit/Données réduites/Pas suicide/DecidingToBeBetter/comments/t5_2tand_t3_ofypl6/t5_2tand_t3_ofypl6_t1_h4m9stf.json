I recall wanting to be an oceanographer when i was young - but I was good at drawing and crafty things... hence i gravitated to what I was getting 'attention' from, maybe i should have left those as a hobby not a career choice- as at present im not in the creative arena - covid has me working parttime in a liquor store. Its not very challenging or financially prosperous. I am looking at new options myself :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ofypl6/i_want_to_learn_to_be_happy/h4m9stf/"}
