Technology changes some jobs - I am a Graphic Designer by education, have my BFA; worked in advertising, newspapers, a game company  and for commercial printers.  The printing business has changed  with the advent of the internet (less need of printed promotional materials, some companies put their annual reports online, and the access of software to create your own newsletters, brochures, business cards, Ads). . . . ; suddenly everyone is a graphic designer. Before covid I was doing custom picture framing, it was very satisfying and I know people were happy with what i did - many left emails about their framed  pieces with my supervisors. \n\nIts not impossible to be happy, what makes us happy can evolve over time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ofypl6/i_want_to_learn_to_be_happy/h4fww0b/"}
