Nothing that i\u2019ve done or am doing currently really excites me anymore and knowing that there are people who found their calling in weird jobs like \u201cglaciologist\u201d or \u201cisland caretaker\u201d makes me wonder if i\u2019m not looking hard enough, or if my calling even has any avenue that i can get in by.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ofypl6/i_want_to_learn_to_be_happy/h4gyl12/"}
