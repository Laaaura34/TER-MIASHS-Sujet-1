All it's really valid for is being called:\n\n*Secrets to a Fulfilling Life for male Harvard graduates of the late 1930s.*\n\nThat leaves out an awful lot of demographics. Women, non-Westerners, non-upper class, non-whites, non-rich. This could have had a serious impact on the study's findings. For instance, this one:\n\n>It\u2019s About More than Money and Power\n\n...for men with a Harvard degree. We can pretty well guarantee that not a single one of these men would ever want for money or power. They're already upper class, well-connected, and well-to-do. They already represented the top echelon of wealth and power in the U.S. Of course more money and more power weren't going to mean much to their happiness or fulfillment. They never had to worry about whether to buy groceries or pay the electric bill; they never had to worry about lacking so much power that police would feel comfortable pulling them over for no reason and beating or jailing them if they felt like it; the world and its power structure were designed to *serve* them. \n\nHow about for someone poor? Someone without connections, without a Harvard degree, without a penis? (Not to exclude trans folk here, just at the time a man in a woman's body probably had few options to change that.) Probably some money, enough to be comfortable and not have to worry, that would lead to *huge* gains in fulfillment and life happiness. Same for a little power. How would it be to not feel helpless in the face of bureaucracy or law enforcement? Probably pretty darn fulfilling.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1vjf4n/the_75year_study_that_found_the_secrets_to_a/ceszdzk/"}
