A virtual hug for you from a stranger. \nI wish you get through this time with grace and peace.\nIt may be difficult but it\u2019s ok to let yourself feel sad here and there. \nYou need to grieve and not feel forced to pretend like things are easy or ok. \n\nBut think of the funny times, the good times. \nThink of all those times and realize that you were fortunate to have spent them with people you care about. Some humans have no one, not one person on this planet. \n\nLive your life with fullness in dedication to those long past but also to yourself. Life is unpredictable; we have to make the best of these seconds. \nEngage yourself in your father\u2019s care and make tiny doable bucket list goals for the both of you. He\u2019s grieving too I\u2019m sure. People who are isolated face worse effects of dementia than if their minds are engaged in activity. Plus you get to make cherished memories and can spend quality time together. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83c\udf40", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/duizbu/a_message_for_those_are_going_through_difficult/f77hyyi/"}
