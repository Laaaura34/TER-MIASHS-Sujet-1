And you will only ever be happy once you stop comparing yourself to others and how they live. Everybody is different. Also, you will never be happy if you care what others think of you. \n\nFigure out who you are and what you like and be yourself unapologetically. I've come to realize I for the most part don't enjoy constant social interaction. That doesn't bother me because I'm not forcing myself to do something I feel is expected of me.\n\nIf you're getting drained because you're insecure and uncomfortable being yourself around others that is a different situation. People say fake it til you make it which isn't terrible advice but eventually you have to be kind enough to yourself to drop your defenses and accept that some people might not like you. But if you become truly confident you will attract a lot more genuine and pleasant interactions.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9gb5y/to_anyone_who_are_quite_shy_and_think_of/hgxnogv/"}
