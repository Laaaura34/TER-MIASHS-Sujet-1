(No boomer hate; 23M here haha!) it\u2019s just that these technologies really add dimensions to relationships that never existed before.  \n\nSome things to look at are: \n- proximity. Are you close to enough physically to have face to face? Do you go to school together? Live with parents or apartments? So much of deciding the right way to implement a tool is to take a look at the problems it\u2019s solving.\n\n- longer term/ deeper would be general interest. My ex and I ended up getting together after she\u2019d moved back to school (we\u2019d met at the end of summer when I was moving around a lot.) We\u2019d decided it was smarter to break it off but found ourselves talking every day about anything and everything. Challenges of distance did eventually arise, but the point is that we never had to doubt that tool (texting) because our use of it was so engaging.\n\nIt seems like using the streak (even if nothing\u2019s being said) to measure some kind of accomplishment or closeness could be substituted for other things that indicate a healthy relationship? \n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ph4hwn/want_to_end_snap_streaks/hbfyzzs/"}
