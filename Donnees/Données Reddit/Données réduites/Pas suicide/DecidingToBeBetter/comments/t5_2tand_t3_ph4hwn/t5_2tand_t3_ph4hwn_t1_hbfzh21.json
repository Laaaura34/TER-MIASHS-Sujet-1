I think i\u2019m just worried that when we both move away to uni we will be snapping eachother non meaningful things just to keep the streak, rather than actually talking because we won\u2019t be seeing eachother face to face as often as we are right now. We are and always have been very healthy but this is just a concern i have for when we both start uni as I want us to be able to talk with more than just pointless snaps of our faces. not sure if that makes sense, hope it does!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ph4hwn/want_to_end_snap_streaks/hbfzh21/"}
