Also the fact that you didn't want to hurt her feelings, I get you, for many years I would keep all the anger and sadness to myself to avoid hurting her feelings as well, but then I learned that I'm hurting so much just by not speaking up. You seem like someone with a very big and warm heart who just went through generational trauma (you basically get treated shitty for trauma your own parents have from their childhood). I hope you can see your mom soon to catch up and hug her so much!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o5iy7r/maybe_ill_heal_a_bit_better_now/h2nq22n/"}
