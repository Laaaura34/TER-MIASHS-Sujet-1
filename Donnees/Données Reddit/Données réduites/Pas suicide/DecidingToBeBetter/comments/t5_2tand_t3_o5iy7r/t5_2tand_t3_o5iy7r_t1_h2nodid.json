I just went through the same situation with my mom last week and I also came on reddit looking for advice and it was the best thing I did because I tend to get into my feelings and want to attack the ones who have hurt me, but this time I didn't attack, I just expressed my feelings without hurting my momma and it really helped. And it's totally understandable that you did it either through text or videochat, it's acceptable that you needed to do this urgently to be able to function later on. Do not feel ashamed about that :) you did what you had to do!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o5iy7r/maybe_ill_heal_a_bit_better_now/h2nodid/"}
