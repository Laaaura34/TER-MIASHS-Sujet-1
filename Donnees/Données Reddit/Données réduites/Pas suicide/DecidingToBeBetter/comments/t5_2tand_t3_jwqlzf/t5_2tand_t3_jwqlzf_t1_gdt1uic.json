It means a great deal to me as now I know how important it is to look out for positivities in life...\n\nI can understand your view on self-criticism clearly as mine is very similar. I have been practising meditation on and off for the past few years, but only recently I have realised that a lot of what I believe to be self-awareness is just self-judgement/self-doubt. Rather than simply observing my thoughts/actions as they are, I have been simultaneously judging/doubting myself negatively. For example,  if I became aware of any destructive thoughts in my mind, I would then immediately think of phrases such as \"I am having these thoughts this again\". I have always felt that those were moments of self-awareness, but I guess they are really habitual critical self-talk that cast doubt on ourselves.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jwqlzf/i_have_decided_to_be_kind_to_myself/gdt1uic/"}
