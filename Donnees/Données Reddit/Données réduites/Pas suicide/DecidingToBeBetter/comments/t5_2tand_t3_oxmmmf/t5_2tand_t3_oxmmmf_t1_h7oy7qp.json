(See my personal [anthem](https://youtu.be/8twpQTna_9w) on the subject.) \n\nMental health first aid is one thing you can do. Our mental and physical wellbeing are intimately connected, so a decline in one usually brings a decline in the other - and an improvement in one can help give the other a boost. So going out of your way to make sure you're taking care of yourself physically can really help with funks. Are you eating regular, reasonably healthy meals? Drinking enough water? Getting a little bit of exercise every day, especially something that gets you out of the house like walking around the block? How's your sleep schedule? How dirty are your physical surroundings? Try to make at least a little progress with one of these every day, and your brain will thank you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oxmmmf/im_done_with_this_funk/h7oy7qp/"}
