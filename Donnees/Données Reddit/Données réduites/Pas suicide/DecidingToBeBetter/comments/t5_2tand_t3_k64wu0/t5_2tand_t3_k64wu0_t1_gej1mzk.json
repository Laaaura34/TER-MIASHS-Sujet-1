It took me 20yrs to recognize this, but getting quality sleep is all about consistency.  I use to try to avoid sleeping as much as possible (\"Life is what happens when you're awake\", I'd say) but I learned that I can get so much more done in less time with good sleep.  The amount differs from person to person, but consistency in timing is critical.\n* Relaxation - Find a chunk of time (10-15min) every day to relax and reflect on what you did today and what you'll do tomorrow.  If there's a particularly stressful situation going on, use this time to just think about it calmly.  Doing this will help prevent burn-out and distraction.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k64wu0/i_created_this_account_with_the_sole_purpose_of/gej1mzk/"}
