We shove it off saying anyone else can do it  better and we never feel the reward for ourselves. Next time you are feeling down, remember the feeling you got when you pulled through and cleaned and made this safe space for yourself! Action leads to motivate that leads to more action. I bet once you started you felt compelled to keep going!\n\nJust remember your badass self did all of that.\n\nKeep it up I'm proud of you <3", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nkgjm8/i_decided_to_deep_clean_my_apartment_after_months/gzf92wn/"}
