Now his family is helping out and he\u2019s had to quit drinking, eat healthy and keep the place clean for him and his cat. I\u2019m devastated that he is sick but if he hadn\u2019t gotten sick he would still be living in filth eating take out and drunk every night. Hoping he ca live out the rest of his life clean (literally) and sober.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nkgjm8/i_decided_to_deep_clean_my_apartment_after_months/gzdpp04/"}
