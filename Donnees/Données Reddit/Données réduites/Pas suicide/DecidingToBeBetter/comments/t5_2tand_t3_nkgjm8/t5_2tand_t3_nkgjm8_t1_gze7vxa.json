It does help to have a clear space to help with your mindset. I\u2019ve been depressed on & off since January, I think deep cleaning my entire 1 bedroom apartment will help as well. I\u2019ve got two closets full of clothes and the main closet is full of junk, I only wash the clothes I need on a weekly biases which sometimes I skip. I was doing good though- Did it for two weeks straight. I also need to go do a sink full of dishes right now. It really helps to stick with a daily routine and hope I can keep up with everything.\n\nLast night I meal prepped chicken and had a healthy breakfast! You can do it! \nAs for breakfast they are usually healthy but then I always make bad choices, Meal prep should help with that since I never feel like cooking nightly.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nkgjm8/i_decided_to_deep_clean_my_apartment_after_months/gze7vxa/"}
