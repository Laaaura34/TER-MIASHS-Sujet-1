You are wasting the best years of your life and years of your kids lives miserable. I\u2019m speaking from experience. No one will change unless they want to, and he doesn\u2019t want to. He also has no reason to because there are no consequences. He doesn\u2019t respect you, and will always think less of you for putting up with his behavior. If you can\u2019t leave yet then go to therapy, go to the dr about depression meds, because not being able to enjoy your life is a symptom. Make yourself start doing things without him for yourself. Prepare yourself and then leave him. He\u2019s never going to magically wake up and decide to change and want to marry you after 9 years. Even if he did marry you his behavior would just get worse.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/olziey/tips_on_how_to_live_life_while_waiting_for_your/h5midf7/"}
