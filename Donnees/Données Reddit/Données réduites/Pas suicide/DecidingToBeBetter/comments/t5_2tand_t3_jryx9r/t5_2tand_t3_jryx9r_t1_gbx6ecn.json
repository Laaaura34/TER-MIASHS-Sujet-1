Due to physical health I highly recommend a Vaporizer if someone is going for the latter.\n\nAnd if you can't smoke _and_ be active, the first way to be a stoner is way healthier for you. Even if you have friends who can smoke all day and function, it doesn't mean that _you_ can.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jryx9r/at_18_years_old_i_was_a_depressed_introvert/gbx6ecn/"}
