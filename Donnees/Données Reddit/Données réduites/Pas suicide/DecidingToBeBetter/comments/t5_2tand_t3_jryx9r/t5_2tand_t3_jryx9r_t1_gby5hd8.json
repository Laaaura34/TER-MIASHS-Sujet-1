Literally everyone has them in various degrees of intensity. The point is to limit the ones you can avoid so you're better able to handle the ones that are unavoidable.\n\nI waited until well into my 30s to buy a home and start a family because I wanted to make sure our student loan debt was under control. I've really wanted a puppy for like 15 years, but we decided with a newborn, it's probably best to wait until we have this parenting thing under control. \n\nUnavoidably we've had to deal with layoffs, problems with anxiety and depression, family members trying to kill themselves by abusing drugs, and a whole host of home appliances breaking. That just kind of scratches the surface of what my last couple have years have looked like (nevermind the pandemic). \n\nBut my relationship with my wife is good, I lost like 90 lbs and I don't currently have anymore pressing debt concerns. We've definitely been fortunate in a lot of ways, but I'd say a substantial portion of our fortune has just been through sheer self-inflicted problem avoidance.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jryx9r/at_18_years_old_i_was_a_depressed_introvert/gby5hd8/"}
