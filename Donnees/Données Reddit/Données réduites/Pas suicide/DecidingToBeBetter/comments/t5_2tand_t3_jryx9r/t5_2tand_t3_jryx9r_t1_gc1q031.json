I actually recently did that and am currently in college but have not been able to really tap into my naturally extroverted self and begin to create friends and connections. I feel all alone all the time and I get scared that I\u2019m never going to live out to my potential. I know I will, but I\u2019ve noticed the more I smoke weed the more introverted I get and am starting to switch this habit for running or diminishing it altogether. I\u2019ll never give up weed but I can definitely lower my intake levels of it.\nAnyways, with this whole covid thing, it hasn\u2019t been easy to meet people and be able to enjoy the change in scenery and toxic environment I lived in previously. \nAny advice from anyone I would be greatly appreciated", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jryx9r/at_18_years_old_i_was_a_depressed_introvert/gc1q031/"}
