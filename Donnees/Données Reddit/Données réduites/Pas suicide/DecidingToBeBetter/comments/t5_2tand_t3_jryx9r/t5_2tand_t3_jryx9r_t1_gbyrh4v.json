After HS he was in a dark spot. It\u2019s been three years now and he\u2019s actually growing himself. Not the same person I met five years ago when he had just moved to the country, and had no idea how things would turn out for him years later. He gained a lot of weight, quit sports, and when he gained his work permit he\u2019d put in 16hr days or till he fell asleep. I recently learned that he quit his dead end job, started improving his image, is relearning to talk to women and likely has one lined up, and is being the old ambiverted guy I met five years ago!. He learned what he couldn\u2019t control, and most importantly what he could control, and now he\u2019s on his way to pursue his passions and most likely will become a sort of celebrity in the industry he\u2019s going into with all the ideas on his head. I would like to put in my two Lincoln\u2019s and say that to those guys going through something similar, know that this is only a transition. Like a hermit growing and leaving their old shell behind, to find another they\u2019ll live in until they outgrow  it. You are outgrowing your environment and leaving that shell behind, don\u2019t torment yourself with \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios, or putting people on pedestals, instead look into yourself and find your future within until you find your new shell.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jryx9r/at_18_years_old_i_was_a_depressed_introvert/gbyrh4v/"}
