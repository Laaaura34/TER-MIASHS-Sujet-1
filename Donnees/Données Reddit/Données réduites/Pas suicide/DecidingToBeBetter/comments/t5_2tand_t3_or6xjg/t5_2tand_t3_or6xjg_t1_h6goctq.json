She gets so angry about such situations and it can ruin her day or week.\n\nI'll tell you what I tell her and hopefully it will help: \n\n1. Recognise the cause of your anger.. which in this case is that they treated you unfairly \n\n2. Accept that it happened and is in the past. And when you think about it, you are bringing it into the present \n\nThe fact that it happened sucks. Nobody deserves being treated unfairly.. but you don't deserve having it ruin even more of your day\n\nJust remind yourself that sime people are asses and no matter what you or anybody does.. they will always be alsshiles\n\nIn the play of life, some people were cast as the asshole and their sole purpose is to be an unfair jerk. So when they are assholes just think of it as them doing their job.. just as when a parking officer gives you a fine for whatever reason.. he is just doing his job..  as irritating as it is to you \n\nI also get super mad when I feel I have been fleeced.. And think how silly I was to let it happen and think what I could have done better.. I allow myself to be me about it for 1 hour Max (working in getting this down to 30 minutes) and when I shower so imagine that anger and that incident wash off into the drain \n\nAnd just like the sweet and dirt so washed off..  I never think about it again \n\nHope this helped", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/or6xjg/how_to_stop_being_angry/h6goctq/"}
