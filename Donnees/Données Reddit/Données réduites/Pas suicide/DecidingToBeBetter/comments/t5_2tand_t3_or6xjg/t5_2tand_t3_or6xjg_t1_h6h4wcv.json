Often they are not and its nothing personal. Once you have rid yourself of the expectation that everyone will act in a way you deem fair, you will less surprised or put out when they don't. Life and people are mercurial. It's not always going to go the way you want. It's a waste of your precious time and energy to inwardly shake your fist at an indifferent world. If there is something you can do about it then by all means do so. If not, move on. Alot of it is also ego to have this notion that you are particularly hard done by. Everyone deals with shit. You are no different. Reframing your sense of entitlement helps. Your being angry achieves nothing except sleepless nights and possibly having friends think you are a douchebag for being personally affronted by stuff everyone deals with every day. I am not judging you. I have been there myself. Best of luck. You could get hit by a bus tomorrow and everything you were angry about would be unimportant.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/or6xjg/how_to_stop_being_angry/h6h4wcv/"}
