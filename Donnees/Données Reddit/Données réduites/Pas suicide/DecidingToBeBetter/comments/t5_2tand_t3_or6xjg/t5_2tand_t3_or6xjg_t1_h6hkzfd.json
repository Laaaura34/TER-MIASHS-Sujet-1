Losing an interaction is the best way of describing how i feel whenever a conversation turns into an argument that is neither productive or beneficial and often the fault reside on both parties.  it i often find myself feeling resentful either at them or at myself for letting the situation escalate to the point where it becomes personal. i\u2019m now learning to try to distance myself as soon as i feel like it\u2019s happening cause i know there\u2019s no going back. fortunately it mostly happens with people i\u2019m not close with. \n\nthe thing i have a harder time with is the next thing you mentionned, that other people were able to get to me or overcome my armor. with time i\u2019m getting more tough skinned but i\u2019m still pretty sensitive and when i get angry, i let myself open and vulnerable to attacks and then i get hurt. if i try to retaliate, in the end i end up hurting myself even more because i will act out of resentment, trying to get *justice*. maybe that\u2019s what i need to work on.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/or6xjg/how_to_stop_being_angry/h6hkzfd/"}
