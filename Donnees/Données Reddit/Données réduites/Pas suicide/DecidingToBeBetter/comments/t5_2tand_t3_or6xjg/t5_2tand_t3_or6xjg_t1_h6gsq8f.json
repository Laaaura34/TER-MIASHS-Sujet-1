Often once you leave a situation, and it's still bothering you because you are tense and have an adrenaline rush.\n\n\nIf you can exert yourself physically by say running, press ups, boxing or similar high intensity movement, you can actually wear yourself out. Added to this the positive hormones that are released when you exercise, by the end of it, you'll probably have forgotten all about the thing that made you angry.\n\n\nThis and therapy worked for me.  Once I improved my self worth and self love, I didn't feel so victimised or unfairly treated.... so I got angry less. \n\n\nI still have a trigger that pops up as a result of trauma and is triggered by feeling attacked but it's much less now.  But the biggest improvement for me was feeling better about myself.\n\n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/or6xjg/how_to_stop_being_angry/h6gsq8f/"}
