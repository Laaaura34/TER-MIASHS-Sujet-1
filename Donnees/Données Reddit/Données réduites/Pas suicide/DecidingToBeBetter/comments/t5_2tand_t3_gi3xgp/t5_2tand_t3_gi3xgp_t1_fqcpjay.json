I believe its better to first be aware of how your day looks on paper, in numbers before implementing a change, as it gives a clearer image what kind of a leap you should make. If you're eating, for example, 1000caloriws over your daily needs, and decide to go 700 calories in deficit, for example, it would mean you suddenly make a leap for nearly a day's worth of food, making it awfully difficult to start and making high chances ohf failure. Don't try to suddenly go from one extreme to the other.\n2)take small steps, don't go head first in deep. Pick the habbit apart one by one, analyse patterns to help you avoid urges\n3) try new healthy foods. At first healthy food would taste \"bad\" compared to what you're used to, but the more you replace your old diet with it, the more you will start to crave good food", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gi3xgp/im_stopping_the_binge_eating/fqcpjay/"}
