There are tons of techniques out there that can help... Two examples I can think of are the STOP skill and the TIPP skill.\n\nSTOP skill stands for:\n\nS- stop what you are doing. Imagine a stop sign and if you have to, pause and take a breath.\n\nT - take a step back (literally if you need to). Notice your breathing and take some deep breaths.\n\nO - observe everything that's going on outside (I.e what other people are doing etc) and inside (what am I thinking, what am I feeling, am I tense etc)\n\nP- proceed mindfully. Use mindful skills (check online for these) to help you get into your rational mind.\n\nThere are worksheets available online for this. \n\n\nTIPP skill\n\nT-change your body temperature (I.e splash cold water on your face, take a cold shower, go outside)\n\nI- try intense exercise for anger like star jumps, skipping, running etc\n\nP-paced breathing - look up some on YouTube \n\nP- paired muscle relaxation - again check on youtube\n\nAlso you could try opposite action which is where you do the opposite to how you're feeling (watching a funny video, laughing etc). \n\nI know what intense anger feels like. It's draining, exhausting and horrible. Good luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qcu5zr/anger_fear_jealousy_too_much_emotions/hhj4yiy/"}
