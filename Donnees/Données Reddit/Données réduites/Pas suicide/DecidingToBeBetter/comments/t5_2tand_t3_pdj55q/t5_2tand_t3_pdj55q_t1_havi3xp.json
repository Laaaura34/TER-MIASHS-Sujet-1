You like to be creative, but are discouraged by the apparent futility of it. There is no extrinsic investment in your drive, and that scuttles your intrinsic investment. We are conditioned by our society to be productive and contributive to the economy. Personal creative endeavours interfere with your potential to serve others. Part of it is that your skills are not yet fully refined, and your talent is not valued. This goes against everything you have been modelled in your formative years. But your creative process is a very personal process. Do your art and tell nobody. Amass a body of work known only to you. Keep what you enjoy making. Rid yourself of what does not work. Do not show others your work until you are ready. Do not take council from those close to you. They cannot appreciate or critique your work with sincerity. Show it to them last. They want to see your pride, not your work.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdj55q/what_to_do_with_excited_ambition_and_no_moneytime/havi3xp/"}
