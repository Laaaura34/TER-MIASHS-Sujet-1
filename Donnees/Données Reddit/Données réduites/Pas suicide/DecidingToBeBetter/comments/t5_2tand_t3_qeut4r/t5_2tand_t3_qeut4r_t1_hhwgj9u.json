I would love to hear other peoples lists. \n\n1. I'm pretty open to new experiences. I appreciate that I can find good in many situations, it's brought me a lot of good in life.\n\n2. I'm stubborn, which has it's downsides, but it also means I don't give up on stuff I care about easily.\n\n3. I can be objective and analytical about my own experiences.\n\nThinking through that, it's funny to see how each of those has it's bad side:\n\n1. I can be indecisive as I find  many options sound interesting.\n\n2. I can waste effort pushing towards things I should give up on.\n\n3.
