I appreciate the strength it took for me to admit defeat and file for a divorce from a heartless narcissist. I wasted 13 years of my life with someone who hated my guts. I have ptsd and hearing damage from my time in the Marines, she weaponized those against me everyday. There were plenty of nights where I wanted to give up on life. Then I said no more. I walked out, I filed for divorce and it was terrifying. She changed her ways she said, trying to get me to come back. I held strong. Now I'm remarried to someone who loves me, supports me, and encourages me. We have 2 of our own boys, I have 2 boys from my 1st marriage, she has 1 from her first marriage. Now we're a blended family of 5 boys. With her help and strength we eventually won custody of my boys. And while my ex has not stopped telling my boys what a horrible person I am, my wife is, and that our 2 boys aren't there brothers, my boys know it's all a lie. We've been together 8 wonderful years and I couldn't be happier. \n\nPositive thoughts lead to positive lives.
