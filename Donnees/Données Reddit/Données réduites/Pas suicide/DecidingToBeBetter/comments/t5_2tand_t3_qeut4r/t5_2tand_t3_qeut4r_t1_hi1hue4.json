I have robbed and beaten people that i have known for almost all of my life for little benifet and very stupid reasons.\n\nI have done horrible things to my body. I wear long sleeved clothes because of the awful gang related tattoos that i have aquired. \nI pumped myself full of all kinds of drugs. I injected needles full of god knows what into *every* vein in my body that was visible. I would black out and wake up and wonder \"how the hell did i even survive that time?\" And proceed to inject later like nothing happened \n\n i had a neighbor that i would bully into giving me their pills or i would alert someone that owed them money of thier current location and just swallowed that shit like candy.\n\nI have 3 scars in my torso from getting stabbed. All those stabbings happened over petty reasons i dont even remember.\n\nI have done terrible things. I let good opprotunities leave me. Alot of people want nothing to do with me. I have done the time for all of these things and i have apologized too all the people i could.\n\nSometimes i still get some cravings but ive been clean for close to 2 years.\n\nI have had so much extra income thanks to me not buying strange subtances.\n\ni've been independent for 6 months now. \n\nI kinda got off topic.
