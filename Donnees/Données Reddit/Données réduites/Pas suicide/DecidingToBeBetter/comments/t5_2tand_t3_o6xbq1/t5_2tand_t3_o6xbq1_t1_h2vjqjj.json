But no matter how much if benefits you, or how great it seems, don't let it consume you and guide all your thoughts. If you are part of an organisation or church and you feel one aspect of what they are doing is wrong, then the safest thing to do is to acknowledge to yourself that it's wrong and then decide what it means for you.\nIt might mean you just no longer support the church quite as whole-heartedly from now on got example. But seldom are things black and white. A 'bad' organisation can still feel supportive to the people in it, and a 'good' organisation can have serious flaws. The most important thing is to always remember that you have your own moral instinct and it's important you never let that go, or blindly follow a group or church or movement. You can be part of these groups if you feel they benefit you, but never give, or feel you have to give, yourself over to them entirely.\nIt's when people loose their own individual moral compass and follow blindly that they start making bad decisions and get themselves into trouble.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o6xbq1/why_is_it_so_hard_for_me_to_stand_on_my_own/h2vjqjj/"}
