You\u2019ve been super authentic in this post and I think you should do the same with your family & friends. Share your beautiful experience that you\u2019ve had thus far with said religious group to your friends and family but at the same time you can give them the heads up that you\u2019ve read that other people have had negative experiences and even though that\u2019s not the case with you, you\u2019re being honest and open with them and they can take that information and decide for themselves if they want to join too. \ud83e\udd17 your personality is not weak.
