Addiction is a disease of the mind and it can manifest in all sorts of ways, even in just simple behaviors.\n\nAs far as the portion you quoted: I guess what I was trying to get across is that I had essentially been lying to myself on one level. I had gotten so used to saying I was happy and everything is fine, that I had been ignoring some parts of my life that needed love and attention. That's not to say that everything *isn't* fine, but that doesn't mean there is no room for growth and active improvement. \"Spiritual progression\", as one of my teachers puts it. For me, renunciation of poor behaviors is a means to do this, get intimate with my suffering without indulging in it or letting it guide me. So, what I was simply calling \"contentment\" had actually become \"apathy\" in some ways. Neither are inherently bad traits, but if I want to make positive change then I have to be aware of the truth of my mind.\n\nAgain, I'm rambling but I hope that makes sense.
