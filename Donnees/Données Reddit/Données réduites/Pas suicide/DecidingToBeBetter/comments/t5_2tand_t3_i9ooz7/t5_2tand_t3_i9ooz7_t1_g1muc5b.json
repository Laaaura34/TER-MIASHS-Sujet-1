Thanks a ton. I think I can relate to this quite a bit.\n\nI've been meditating for a while now, and definitely still have trouble staying on top of life and making decisions. Sometimes depression gets me even though I keep meditating. Maybe I do have some apathy or resistance that can be passed off as acceptance/presence.

Good to hear, and I appreciate the encouragement.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9ooz7/i_am_a_recovering_heroin_addict_and_i_have/g1muc5b/"}
