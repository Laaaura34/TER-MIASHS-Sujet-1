Some of the most \"alpha\" (they'd never describe themselves that way because they aren't mental children) dudes I know legitimately love being cucked. Im talking humiliation and everything. Kinks are just kinks dude. It's sexual roleplay, and I hope they have a ton of fun with their partners, personally.\n\nBeyond that, viewers of any sex act aren't, porn or live or whatever, aren't exploited because they engage in a consent-based situation in which they receive pleasure. Thats the opposite of exploitation.\n\nI personally enjoy being a more dominant person in the bedroom/relationship, but then, I don't like pickles and lots of people do, and there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nYou should try living your life with less fear and more self-worth, since this is /r/DecidingToBeBetter after all. Your entire worldview is fear-based, and there honestly isn't that much to be afraid of in life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q6s99e/i_deleted_my_500gb_porn_collection_one_step_to/hghvow1/"}
