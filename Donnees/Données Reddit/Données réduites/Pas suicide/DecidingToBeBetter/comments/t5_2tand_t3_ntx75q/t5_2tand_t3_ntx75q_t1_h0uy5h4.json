It sounds like you\u2019ve gained skills, experiences, and perspective that have led to you having a $65k salaried job. You contributed to the mortgage when it was needed, and had time with your mom which people don\u2019t get back later in life. This will increasingly be the norm for 20 somethings coming after you. Don\u2019t compare yourself to others, their experiences aren\u2019t yours, and were never intended to be. Teddy Roosevelt said \u201ccomparison is the thief of joy\u201d. It isn\u2019t a race, or a competition. As has been shared, figure out what you want to do with the next 5 years, then plan to the degree you\u2019re comfortable with from there (3 years, 1 year, 6 months, 3 months, 3 weeks, this week). \n\nJack London said the purpose of a man is to live. You have been living, and it sounds like you\u2019re looking to make a change to shift your focus/time/ and priorities. Don\u2019t let some false narrative about what \u201cpeople do in their 20s\u201d suck the life, worth, or confidence out of your day today. It sounds like you have some great chapters for your memoir. You tried a venture and it didn\u2019t work, and you recovered and are still standing? Badass. You do you, you want to travel? Great, make it a priority. You want to meet some man or woman for romance? For casual sex? For a family? Great, do it up. You\u2019re right where you\u2019re meant to be. Enjoy every day.  Cheers to your 30s!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ntx75q/i_feel_like_ive_missed_out_on_my_youth_and_i_dont/h0uy5h4/"}
