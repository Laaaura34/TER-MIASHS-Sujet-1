Been that way for about 5 years when I realized I was running out of time to be young and nothing was really happening. I exercise, I meditate, and so on and so forth. My anxiety goes away during/after exercise, so that's a good antidote. I meditate and I used to be really immersed/into it but lately I can't really get my mind in that \"zone\" where it's just me. A whole swirl of thoughts are buzzing constantly. \n\nI also do have goals that I write out, where I want to be/what I want to do in one month, the quarter, and so on. It's just that I feel as if time is running out to do those things. \n\nThanks for the tips, I appreciate it and good luck on your journey.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ntx75q/i_feel_like_ive_missed_out_on_my_youth_and_i_dont/h0wqu8s/"}
