What do you do to calm down?  Do you exercise, meditate, art, something else?\n\nI have a few strategies when I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed: first, I make lists.  \n\nWrite out a list what you want to do, where you see yourself in 1 month , 1, 3, & 5 years. Fill in as much as you want to get you there.  Just so you have some where to aim, if you change direction it\u2019s ok. \n\nSecond, I quit all alcohol and other mind altering substances (besides coffee) and work on getting 8 hours of sleep and cleaning up my diet.\n\nThird, I meditate and pray before bed, 30 minutes.  It\u2019s to help me calm my mind and relax.  I have found keeping a pad of paper and pen  next to me helps so if I HAVE to write something down I do, then continue to clear my mind.  \n\nI hope those help.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ntx75q/i_feel_like_ive_missed_out_on_my_youth_and_i_dont/h0uf9jk/"}
