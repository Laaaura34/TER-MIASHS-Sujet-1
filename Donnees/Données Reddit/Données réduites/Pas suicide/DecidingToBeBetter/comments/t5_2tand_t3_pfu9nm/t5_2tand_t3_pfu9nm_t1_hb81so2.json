Alcohol abuse is one such, being unaware of one's own self and to the sentiments of others is another such. Life is hard. It is meant to be that way perhaps. Just that we happen to hurt some people on our way to the realization. Only thought which occurs is instead of being a pillar of strength to them, I am the one who caused them the pain and once they are gone there's no reversal of anything. \n\nAgain, thank you for sharing your experience. Down the line, I hope I too reach a place where it would all be okay in the end.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfu9nm/reminiscing_about_the_past_almost_45_years_sober/hb81so2/"}
