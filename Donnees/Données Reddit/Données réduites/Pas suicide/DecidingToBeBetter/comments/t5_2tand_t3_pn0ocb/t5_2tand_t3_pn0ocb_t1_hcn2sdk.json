Not sure if I ever will, honestly, but here's how I'm better at it now:\n\n* I can be a miser when it comes to what I buy for myself. I took a risk six months ago and poured a couple grand into a new product for my online store. Since then I've had a ridiculous level of success with it, turning over $20k in the last three months alone. I've owned an old Amazon brand bluetooth speaker for ten years (or so it feels) which refuses to die, and I wanted to buy a replacement once it did. But to reward myself, I went out and got a Marshall Kilburn II (albeit on sale) which is 80% quality, and 20% brand name. But every time I see and touch it, I'm reminded that I took a risk based on research and a hunch, and was handily rewarded. It's almost like a functional trophy. I've actually done this a few times; the first was a $20 parker pen, after I survived a car crash.\n* I pay attention to compliments people pay me for things I've done, and (this is the crucial part) thank them rather than dismiss or diminish it.\n* I take a lot of photos of things I've done, especially minor renovations, clean ups etc. Before and afters. These roll by and on anniversaries, they pop up on Google memories, and I get to see that yeah, I've come a long way.\n\nThe main thing I haven't been able to solve is the ambivalent feeling when I accomplish something. It instantly feels like that's the new floor level I'm standing on, rather than some lofty height I've managed to scale. If you figure that part out, let me know.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pn0ocb/struggling_with_celebrating_personal_victories/hcn2sdk/"}
