Don\u2019t stress about it, finding a doctor can be annoying. I know from experience. In The US, I feel even with the best health insurance it can be a hassle. You can try researching individual therapists. Finding one is kinda like making a friend, you two have to be compatible. A great therapy session for me is a casual convo where I feel comfortable enough to open up about my feelings/struggles and able to really go off and take the conversation from a 1 to a 10. You get it all out then you reflect on it. \n\nYou can talk to friends/family about your problems, and that\u2019s enough for some people. If therapy doesn\u2019t work out I hope it\u2019s enough for you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ocnc88/asking_to_be_put_on_antidepressants_changed_my/h3yd9jt/"}
