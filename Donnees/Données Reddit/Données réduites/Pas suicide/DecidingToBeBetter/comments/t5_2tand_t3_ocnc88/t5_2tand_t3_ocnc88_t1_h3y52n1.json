I\u2019m a big believer in therapy. It took me like 4 or 5 different therapists til I found a really good one. When I go, my only expectation is to talk about how I\u2019ve been feeling. I know it\u2019s not a friend or family member, I\u2019m speaking to a doctor, it\u2019s his job to help me. That makes me get a lot more out than I would talking to anyone else and it feels great. Then he guides the conversation to get me to figure out myself why I feel these ways and why I let the feelings make me do things I feel bad about afterwards. I always feel like my brain is refreshed after therapy honestly.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ocnc88/asking_to_be_put_on_antidepressants_changed_my/h3y52n1/"}
