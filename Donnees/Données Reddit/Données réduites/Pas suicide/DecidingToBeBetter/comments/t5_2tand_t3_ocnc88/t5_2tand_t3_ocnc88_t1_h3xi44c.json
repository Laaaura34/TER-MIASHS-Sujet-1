Ideally they are paired with therapy, this is how you should approach them: The SSRI wont magically turn your life from miserable to glorious without work, it can give you a mood stabilizing effect that helps you become less afraid of acting in the world.\n\nIt is up to you what you do with them. If you don't have a vision of a better life for yourself, an SSRI won't help you get there. It would be useful to plan out ways in which you believe your life could improve, develop a vision of how your life could be better, then with the help of the SSRI, pursue it. \n\nYou still have to do the pursuing, it won't come magically to you. And make no mistake about it, it will be hard. But ideally the fleshing out of a positive future and practical, every-day steps towards it are fleshed out in therapy, then you can go out into the world and implement those steps, which is still hard, with the help of the drug.\n\nThere is a lot of misinformation about SSRIs out there, but they work best in synergy with a truthful attempt to put one's life together", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ocnc88/asking_to_be_put_on_antidepressants_changed_my/h3xi44c/"}
