I spent 20 years on anti-depressants, with several hospitalizations and side effects.\n\nTurns out I am ADHD _and_ mildly depressed, not just well if you think less sad you'll fix your focus issue. Remove the SSRIs, and I'm no longer sucidal. Get on ADHD meds and I am no longer clinically depressed and am mostly functional.\n\nIf you have a diffrent issue just treating the depression might not help, like if you need anti-psychotics over anti-depressants. So may be worth finding a doctor to look shit over, both medical reasons like thyroid and mental reasons like I dunno, CPTSD or ASD burn out.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ocnc88/asking_to_be_put_on_antidepressants_changed_my/h3yokfw/"}
