I was highly recommended trying it for depression after a few years of working with a therapist. It truly became a last resort/this really can't get any worse for me right now when my depression sank to the deepest depths. In my case, I'm kicking myself I didn't try it earlier because it also helped so much with my anxiety, which would float around my head in between depressive lows. I highly recommend talking to a doctor, but my only side effects were a mild headache/stomach upset for the first two weeks (none currently other than I can't drink much which is ideal tbh) but I felt so much better that I barely even noticed them because of the relief I felt.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ocnc88/asking_to_be_put_on_antidepressants_changed_my/h3xiowq/"}
