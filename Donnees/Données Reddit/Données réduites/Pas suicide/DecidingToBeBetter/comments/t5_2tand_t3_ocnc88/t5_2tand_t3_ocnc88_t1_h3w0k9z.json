You most definitely get dependent on antidepressants but you won\u2019t get addicted.\n\nThe same goes for a benzo or opiate or any medication really. If the patient is using it responsibly and not trying to get any type of high from it, they won\u2019t get addicted. They might get dependent (just like they would on an antidepressant).\n\nFear mongering of one medication and praise over the other really makes no sense. If I posted and said \u201cI started taking Xanax everyday and my anxiety is gone and I feel so much better!\u201d I probably would not be met with the same positivity that OP is being met with.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ocnc88/asking_to_be_put_on_antidepressants_changed_my/h3w0k9z/"}
