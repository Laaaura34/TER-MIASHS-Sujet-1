It\u2019s not uncommon for depression to come on when it\u2019s your first time living alone. And it\u2019s easily treatable. Your room being a mess and no motivation are signs of depression. Depression zaps your energy, it makes you not care about things. Once you find treatment those other things will clear up. And it can sometimes take trying a couple of different medications before you find the one that works for you. So if what the doctor gives you doesn\u2019t work please speak up and tell him or her. It\u2019s important to find the right one for you not just the first one the doctor gives you. Many blessings!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1b5rk/i_need_to_change_my_life_around_20f/hfe46lr/"}
