I think you should give yourself a TON of credit for caring enough about yourself to continue to think of and care about improving yourself, you could have very easily lost faith in yourself and gave up trying, but you didn't.  Second, you mentioned that you are going to write one measly line of code... I don't know anything about writing programs but writing that \"one measly line of code\" is the first bite of the elephant and the only thing that is standing between you and the finished app.  & Third, thank you for reminding me that I am not alone in my failure to take action, I am in a constant loop of I'm going to do better, fail to take enough action, give up, stop caring, lose motivation, get distracted, etc, feel like a failure, start over... and it's ok, because we haven't given up, we're not perfect, but it sounds like we are both honest with ourselves enough to reflect and regroup and try again.  Thank you for reminding me to make a list of all the things that I have back burnered and are probably mentally weighing me down that I should make another attempt to tackle over a given period of time.  I'm going to smart small, I need to figure out what my \"one small measly line of code\" is and kick its ass on the regular.  Good luck to you, I'm glad I stumbled on your post.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/6a0h8a/805th_times_the_charm/dhbqfk8/"}
