She makes you feel like she\u2019s genuinely a friend in your corner and has given me words to explain some of the things I\u2019ve been feeling confused/sad/scared of. \n\nI\u2019m about 75% of the way through the book. I devoured the first half and have been trying to slow down and make sure I\u2019m really taking in each section.\n\nI also read her book Daring Greatly years ago, but don\u2019t think I was ready for change at that point in my life. I\u2019m planning to re-read that one once I\u2019m done with this! I think these kinds of books are always worth a re-read, it\u2019s amazing how can continue to find new meaning in it all!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mu1wjf/i_dont_want_to_hide_anymore/gv3a5de/"}
