It was mostly embarrassed. After the year I felt it was enough time that I was ready to find my old friends. Doing so I would finally join the \"Beast\" a.k.a. Facebook I think I was the last holdout on planet earth. They were very surprised and happy I contacted them. Little by little I'm getting my old life back. So take your time, be patient, and let it run it's course. It took me all of fifteen yrs. And it was alcohol and all the drugs you can think of. It was a long process and I quit different drugs over the years. I'm glad I didn't go to prison or rehab or meetings. I did on my own. So you can do this and you can always contact me because it is good to talk. Anytime day or night reach out I will talk to you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mu1wjf/i_dont_want_to_hide_anymore/gv3snt6/"}
