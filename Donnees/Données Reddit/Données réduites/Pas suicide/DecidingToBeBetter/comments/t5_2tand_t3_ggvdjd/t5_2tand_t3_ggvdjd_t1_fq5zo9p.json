In 2 or 3 years if you\u2019re still like this then definitely go seek professional help.\n\nA lot of your hot headedness has to do with being a teenager and that invincible/proud feeling a lot of boys your age have. In time you\u2019ll mature and learn to keep your emotions in check. Or you won\u2019t mature and end up in jail or worse. \n\nEither way, the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging that you have a problem. You made this post so you\u2019re already on the right track. There isn\u2019t any magical advice or technique that\u2019ll suddenly change you. You have to actively and consistently try to change. No one can do this for you.\n\nFrom what you wrote, your pride/ego is what\u2019s costing you. You have an image of who you are (or at least, who you want others to think you are)  in your head and are trying to live like that image. Change that image then you\u2019ll be able to change for real.\n\nWhen situations arise (and they will) just please try to keep the bigger picture in mind. I know it\u2019s hard to do that when you\u2019re in the moment, believe me I\u2019ve been there just like you. All decisions good and bad have consequences, the sooner you get that the better. \n\nTake deep breaths (it\u2019s cliche but it does help for real). Getting riled up by a couple mean words is just childish. Accept some disrespect. That\u2019s part of growing up. It\u2019s hard to do in the moment but decide if what you\u2019re about to do is worth it or not. Killing is never worth it. That will literally ruin your life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ggvdjd/how_do_i_become_more_calm_smart_in_confrontations/fq5zo9p/"}
