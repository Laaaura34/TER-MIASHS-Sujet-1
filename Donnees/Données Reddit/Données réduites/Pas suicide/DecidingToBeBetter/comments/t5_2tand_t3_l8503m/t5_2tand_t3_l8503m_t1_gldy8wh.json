I also need to mention that you are not your thoughts and your past don't define you, most porn addicts have some sort of issues like yours and your gf is completely aware of that. \n\nI know it is hard without feeling guilty but try to spend some time with yourself, analyze your past, your traumas etc. When doing that, you should consider yourself your best friend. If you had one friend that was going through tough times, what would you do to help him bounce back in life?\n\nThe last couple of things I want to say is that you reached 3 months once, why not again? Maybe even more? I had a 6 month porn-free journey too and I can say all the thoughts you have and make you feel like shit will be gone over time. You have yourself, have a great person in your life that believes in you, now imagine what you can do if you fully stick to your journey. Try to get more information, introduce new habits to your life, make peace with your past, mistakes and see if you have the same thoughts :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l8503m/price_of_pornography/gldy8wh/"}
