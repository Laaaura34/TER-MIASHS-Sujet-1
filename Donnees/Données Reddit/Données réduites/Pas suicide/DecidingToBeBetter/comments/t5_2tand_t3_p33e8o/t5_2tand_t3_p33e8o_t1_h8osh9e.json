He's not to blame.  You are.  You're not the victim here.  The people you mistreated are.\n\nYou never physically abused your girlfriends?  And then go on to tell everyone here what they did to you?  Victim mentality and downplaying the emotional abuse you exerted on them.\n\n\"The emotional manipulation I can honestly say I had a hand in that sort of behavior\" Minimizing blame by not only saying your girlfriends were worse, but saying that you only contributed to the abuse with them.  You're a bad boy but not that bad because they were bad girls too?  Seriously?\n\nYou get close by admitting that you're realizing you're the bad guy, but then backtrack by comparing yourself to the star of a TV show and a popular movie character?\n\nThis post isn't someone deciding to be better.  This is a person with a lot of problems looking for validation.  Congratulations on your journey away from being abusive?  Are you serious?  How about just do it for you and not for the internet points.  If you recognize yourself as the abuser in your relationships you don't need support.  You need to go fix it and never treat anyone else badly again WITHOUT feeling sorry for yourself along the way.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p33e8o/just_realized_im_toxic_looking_to_improve/h8osh9e/"}
