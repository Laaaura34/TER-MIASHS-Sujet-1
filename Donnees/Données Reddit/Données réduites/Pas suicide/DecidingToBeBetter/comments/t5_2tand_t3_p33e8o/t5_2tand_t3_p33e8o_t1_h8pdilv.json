It's the entire post.  You do know that not everyone who posts an I'm sorry post here should automatically get support and forgiveness right?  And it's important for victims of abuse to see that this kind of stuff gets called out when it's there too.  If you aren't calling out the sincerity of a post like this then what does that mean?\n\nI knew this would get downvoted but it's important to speak out when someone is clearly exhibiting narcissistic behavior like downplaying their own faults and victim mentality when admitting past mistakes.\n\nTry and look at the post objectively.  It's always I'm sorry I did X, but someone else did Y.  I'm a bad person for doing X, but I'm similar to this charismatic and well-liked reformed bad guy.
