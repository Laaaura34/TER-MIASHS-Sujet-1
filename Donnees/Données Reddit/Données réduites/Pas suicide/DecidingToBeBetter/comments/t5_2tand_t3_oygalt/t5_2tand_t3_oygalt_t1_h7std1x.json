I want to feel less angry or I want to engage in less negative self talk. What you and your therapist will discuss will be about how you can reach that goal, and what is holding you back. If these stories do that then fine. You can have a corrective emotional experience about them. If it's unrelated to your goals then it isn't worth spending time on.\n\nThis is what I dislike about the media and counseling. Television shows leave people with the expectation that if they say a bunch of things that happen to them out loud they will feel better. Therapy is much more about learning the skills you need to survive life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oygalt/going_to_therapy_should_i_tell_her_about_my_csa/h7std1x/"}
