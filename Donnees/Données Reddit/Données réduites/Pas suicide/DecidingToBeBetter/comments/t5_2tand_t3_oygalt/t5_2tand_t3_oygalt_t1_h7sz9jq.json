You go at your own pace. The therapist will ask lots of questions if you don't want to answer a question you can say that. I had people tell me a lot of their trauma in the first appointment. I had people wait to talk about their trauma. There is no right way to do it. \n\nAlso, what happened to you sounds very scary. I'm so sorry you went through that. I have worked with children, teens, and adults that have experienced similar things and it is very painful. You are not alone and you have every right to feel the way you do about your experience. No one deserves to have this happen to them and you did nothing to make it happen. Good luck with everything!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oygalt/going_to_therapy_should_i_tell_her_about_my_csa/h7sz9jq/"}
