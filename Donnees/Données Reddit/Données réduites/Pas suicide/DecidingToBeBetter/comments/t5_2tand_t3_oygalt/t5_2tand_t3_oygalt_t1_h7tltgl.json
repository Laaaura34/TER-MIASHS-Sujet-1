Your therapist will help guide you.\n\nOn a note about your parents, I think you should also hold your mother accountable for part of your experience. You make it seem like your father is 100% responsible for all of your negative experiences, when you said your mother seemed to let all of this happen. \n\nAnyway, I wish you the best with your therapy and hope that these emotional wounds heal.
