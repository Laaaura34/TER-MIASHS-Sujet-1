There are lots of kinds of therapy, and most of them aren't \"have your therapist understand your complete human experience and abracadabra all your issues.\" Different strategies work for different people.  They'll probably suggest some behaviors and tell you to practice them--the therapist is a guide to *your* self-transformation, not a magician with a pill. \n\nAnyway, OP, sounds like you got some stuff going on! Good on you for taking charge of how you go forward.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oygalt/going_to_therapy_should_i_tell_her_about_my_csa/h7tf5dj/"}
