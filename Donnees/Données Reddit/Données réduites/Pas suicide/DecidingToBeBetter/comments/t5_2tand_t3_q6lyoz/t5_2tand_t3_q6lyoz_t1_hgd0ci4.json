I\u2019m also taking a breather from the booze! My goal is just to do a dry October ( any other time I\u2019ve done a dry month it\u2019s continued well longer than the month) The thing I find very helpful to keep in the back of my mind is \u201c it\u2019s just one month, I can go one month etc\u201d. Also having an app that resets my progress if I slip up is a huge motivator for me. Something about seeing 15 days go down to 0 sure sticks with me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q6lyoz/10_days_alcohol_free_for_the_first_time_in_my/hgd0ci4/"}
