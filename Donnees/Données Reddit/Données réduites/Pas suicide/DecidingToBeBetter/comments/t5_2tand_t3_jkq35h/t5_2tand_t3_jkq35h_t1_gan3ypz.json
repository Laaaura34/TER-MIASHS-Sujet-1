They also rip on Trump often.  You\u2019d be surprised but many true conservatives despise trump.\n\nJust look at r/politics main page.  They have never, not once, had a positive article about republicans or a Trump.  Absolutely zero.  \n\nI can get super deep into how the super posters are all mods on the other big liberal subreddits, how bots automatically post and upvote and pro-narrative posts and comments and downvote any dissenting opinion.\n\nIt\u2019s the most toxic, misleading, sensationalist echo chamber on the internet.  Literally over running with bullshit and fake news.\n\nBy the way I\u2019m not a trump supporter.  Check my history, I argue with people on r/conservative all the time.  \n\nBut bar none, r/politics is the worst sub on this site and plays a direct role in the hyper polarization on the internet.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jkq35h/if_youre_going_to_reddit_cut_out_the_bad_subs/gan3ypz/"}
