Right now is a stressful time if you\u2019re in the US.  The president will be chosen no matter how much you stress, or don\u2019t stress.  I\u2019m just suggesting ways to help us not stress. My point is take care of yourself first, and managing stress is a big feat. Managing stress is a lifetime skill. If you\u2019re using reddit like I am, why not make it a good place?  I\u2019m still not going out because of covid, and not getting any of the things I am expecting my life should be. I\u2019ve been depressed on and off my whole life, but if I can turn off the noise right here, I choose that.  And I am offering a recommendation that is helping me through this hard time, with the hope that it helps someone else as well", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jkq35h/if_youre_going_to_reddit_cut_out_the_bad_subs/gakmtl7/"}
