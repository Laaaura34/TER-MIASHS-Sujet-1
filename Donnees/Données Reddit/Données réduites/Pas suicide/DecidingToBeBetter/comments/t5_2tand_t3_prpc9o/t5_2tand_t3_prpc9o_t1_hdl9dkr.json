It's funny, we're more than happy to insult ourselves when we don't live up to our expectations, but we hardly ever thank and appreciate ourselves. It's silly, really. \n\nAnd self care is so important **when it's being used correctly**. I used to think 'being there for myself' meant giving myself everything I wanted; 'bad day? Order a pizza!' 'Feeling exhausted? Don't worry about the housework' 'Is it any day but Monday? Aaah let's just open some wine for the evening. Go for that third glass.'\n\nBad habits just ensured nothing would ever change, so I was always having bad days, feeling exhausted, and it's usually not Monday! I've decided that 'self care' means taking care of later me, tomorrow me. Next year me. And my life has been *so* much better as a result.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/prpc9o/thank_you_me/hdl9dkr/"}
