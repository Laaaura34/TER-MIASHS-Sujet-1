This is the first step. I don't know what the next steps are, but I know that you can change your sense of humour!! \n\nThere are plenty of other ways to be funny and the internet is a great resource. You got grammar puns, self deprecating jokes, even using funny accents. All of those are better than judging others. \n\nHere's some funny people to look up:\nGus Johnson \nCherdleys\nFairbairn Films\nCaroline Konstnsar\npenguinz0\nralphsepe\nCaitlin Reilly \nBrian Jordan Alvarez \nCaroline Ricke\nDrew Gooden \nDanny Gonzalez \n\nNone of these people make bigoted jokes, but they do sometimes use stereotypes or poke fun at certain types of people, or they're crude. \n\nDo and be to others what you would want them to do and be for you. It's a simple rule that can encompass every part of your life. Think about how other people feel before you speak.
