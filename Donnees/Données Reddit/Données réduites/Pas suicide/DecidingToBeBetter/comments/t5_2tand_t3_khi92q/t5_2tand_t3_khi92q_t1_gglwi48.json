It laid out a lot of groundwork about the \u2018theory\u2019 of being a well liked decent person.\n\nBut really, as I changed my toxic behaviors one by one to more positive ones I noticed the benefits in how people treated me, and the enjoyment of that led me to get better.\n\nI unfortunately still occasionally have bouts of toxic behavior with my parents, but that\u2019s because they\u2019re kind of toxic too at times and I get punished if I\u2019m not being toxic, but my friends think I\u2019m a pretty good person nowadays, and I\u2019m happy about that.\n\nSo my two key points are: learn and read books on how to be a good person/how to recognize toxic and harmful social behaviors.\n\nAnd if you hang around other toxic people it might make sense to stop hanging out with them. Part of how toxicity happens to some people is they were brought up in an environment where toxic behavior was considered normal.\n\nAnd honestly, if you have some friends or a decent person that you interact with regularly: you could try telling them that you are trying to improve as a person and ask them if there was anything recently that you did that bothered them, and what could you do in the future to be better. At least that\u2019s what I did.\n\nIf you have any specific questions, feel free to send me a DM.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/khi92q/i_want_to_be_better_i_am_a_toxic_person/gglwi48/"}
