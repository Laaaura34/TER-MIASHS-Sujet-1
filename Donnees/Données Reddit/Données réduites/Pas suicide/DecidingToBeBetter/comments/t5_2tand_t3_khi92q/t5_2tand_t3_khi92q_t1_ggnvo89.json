They do certain toxic things, but after years of dealing with it and having healthy interactions with other people I can discount what they say and do.\n\n At one point I even tackled their behavior by explaining politely but insistently that I wanted to act differently and that it could be a valid way to interact. That I grew up in a different society than them (they\u2019re immigrants) and I see the world differently.\n\nMy dad gave me a bit of shit for tip toeing around what I say (being polite and thinking about the feelings of others)  instead of being blunt and possibly rude, but I managed to get him to acknowledge that at least it\u2019s a valid thing to do, which helped me a lot in having peace whenever he would say something that felt hurtful. \n\nI could tell he really just couldn\u2019t do anything better and struggles so much with ever being emotionally vulnerable. \n\nSince then he has apologized to me on occasion when he yells and I\u2019ve told him I forgive him and I understand that he\u2019s dealing with stress and it bleeds into the way he talks regardless of circumstances. \n\nAnd he acknowledged that that was the case, or at least he didn\u2019t argue or chew me out, which is good enough for now.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/khi92q/i_want_to_be_better_i_am_a_toxic_person/ggnvo89/"}
