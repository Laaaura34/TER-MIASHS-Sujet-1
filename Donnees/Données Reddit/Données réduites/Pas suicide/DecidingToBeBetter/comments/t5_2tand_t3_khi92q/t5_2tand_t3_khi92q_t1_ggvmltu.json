Acknowledging our behaviour is often the hardest, but an integral step in self-improvement! As a therapist myself I can second that therapy can be a great tool in better understanding our behaviour and the potential factors that influence it.

Therapy can also help you work on developing healthier patterns of behaviour.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/khi92q/i_want_to_be_better_i_am_a_toxic_person/ggvmltu/"}
