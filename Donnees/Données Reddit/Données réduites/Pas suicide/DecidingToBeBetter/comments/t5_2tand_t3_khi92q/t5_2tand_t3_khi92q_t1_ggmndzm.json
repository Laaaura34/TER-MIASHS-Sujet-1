It's a great book for this kind of situation.\n\nOne of the key points is awareness. Be aware of your actions. Acknowledge when you mess up, apologize if you have to, but hold on to that awareness. You don't have to hold on to the action, but as long as you stay aware you will be on the road to getting to where you want to go. \n\nAnother tip is to immediately apologize when you do something on your list. If you manipulate someone, immediately say \"I just tried to manipulate you and I am very sorry\". If you make a bad joke, immediately apologize and say why it was a bad joke.  \n\nIn general, studying mindfulness can get you where you want to go! Good luck with everything, I think you are doing an amazing job.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/khi92q/i_want_to_be_better_i_am_a_toxic_person/ggmndzm/"}
