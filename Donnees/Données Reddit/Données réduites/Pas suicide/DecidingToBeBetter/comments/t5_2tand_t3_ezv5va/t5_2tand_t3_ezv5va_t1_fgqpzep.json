I used to binge eat all the time and gained up to 342lbs.  I am currently at 196 and cycle through heavily restricting my food (being obsessive with food rules) to being more lax and either slow losing or maintaining.  Currently in the heavily restricted food stage & justifying it as a long term fast for health benefits, made even worse by having someone for \u201csupport\u201d doing the same thing.  We are comparing our results and how long we are lasting, she\u2019s almost on day 6, I ended at day 3 while keeping my calories under 700/day. \n\nI spoke to my therapist about this back when a I was 250lbs, crying in his office about how I was scared I was developing a reverse disordered eating habit and that I am stressed about how I am not losing weight fast enough.  He continued to push the narrative of being on drug therapy and said there were no eating disorder clinics he could refer me to.\n\nSome days I don\u2019t even care if I get help for it, I just want to get to my goal weight and work it out after that and other days I feel defeated, scared that my goal weight will continue to drop \u201cjust 10 more lbs\u201d and that it won\u2019t be unhealthy if it was...\n\nWishing you health and happiness.  Good luck with your recovery.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ezv5va/starting_counseling_for_disordered_eating/fgqpzep/"}
