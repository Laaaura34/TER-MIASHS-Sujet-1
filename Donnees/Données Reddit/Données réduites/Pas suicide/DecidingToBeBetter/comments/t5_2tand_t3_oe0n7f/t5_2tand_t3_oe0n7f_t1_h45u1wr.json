He was a completely different person when I was young and these last few years. His addiction took everything from him, including his wife, daughter, and step daughter. They all left because they couldn't handle his behavior anymore. \n\nI'm really proud of you, OP. I've seen how that stuff destroys lives, and people, and how hard it is to get off of.
