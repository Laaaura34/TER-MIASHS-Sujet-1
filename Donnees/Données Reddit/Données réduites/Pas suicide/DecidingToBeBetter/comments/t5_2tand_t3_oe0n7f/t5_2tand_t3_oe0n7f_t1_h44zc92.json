(It actually didn\u2019t do anything to me: I tried it twice, and the second time was with a psychiatrist who said \u201cyou don\u2019t by any chance have ADHD, do you?\u201d Apparently being on ADHD meds just negates the effects.) It just seems like a drug which turns people into the absolute worst version of themselves. \n\nIt worries me that it\u2019s becoming extremely prevalent in the gay community due to chemsex, and yet no journalists will report on it, because they\u2019re afraid of being accused of parroting homophobic tropes. It\u2019s just a shame that chemsex really _is_ a homophobic trope that\u2019s become reality. \n\nAnyway, congrats to OP on getting sober. If you can get clean from meth, you know you have the willpower to do just about fucking anything. It can only get easier from here.
