I was doing meth for 5 years. Started only on the weekends, then eventually every day. I understand your \"animalistic\" part of your post. I became an emotional, jealous idiot. It took me going to the ER to finally kick it. Now im 6 years sober! Only thing though is watch out for addiction switching. I switched from meth to weed to molly to working out. I'm 3 months free of any drugs and working out has to be the best addiction I have. Just make sure when you stop to switch to something positive. Other than that, good job and congrats on being a parent!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oe0n7f/40_days_clean_from_meth/h44fwpn/"}
