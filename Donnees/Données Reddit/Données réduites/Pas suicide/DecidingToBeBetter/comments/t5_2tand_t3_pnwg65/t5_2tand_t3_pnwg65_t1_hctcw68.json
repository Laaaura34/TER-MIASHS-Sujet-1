They are in plain sight. I have to literally move them to make the coffee. I started regularly taking them after the first day. \nI keep a toothbrush and tooth paste on the bathroom counter, in the shower, in my kids bathroom and in the kitchen, because if I CANNOT BE BOTHERED, then these are the locations I know I will have the smallest ounce of motivation to do it. \nI meal prep, but I don't eat cooked meals. I eat refrigerated home made protein bowls or bagged salads 90% of the time - cooking/reheating food seems like a lot of work sometimes. \nI wear my workout clothes to bed, so I am already good to go when I wake up. I've even started premixing my pre-workout and keeping it next to my bed so I can immediately take it when I wake up. \n\nRealistically, I am not able to do these things every single day. That's are days where I still just cannot be bothered. I thought for a long time that meant I was lazy, but it doesn't. \nYou don't have to do everything all at once to be improving either.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pnwg65/why_is_is_to_hard_for_me_to_take_care_of_myself/hctcw68/"}
