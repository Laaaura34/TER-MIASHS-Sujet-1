Do you genuinely feel like you\u2019ve been struggling as long as you can remember but everyone around you keeps saying it\u2019s normal but somehow they all have their shit together and you just can\u2019t figure out what you\u2019re missing? Trust yourself. Find out what\u2019s up because if your brain is wired differently, you can keep grinding through attempts at solutions that weren\u2019t made for you but they\u2019re never gonna work. \n\nEspecially with the brain fog too - Could be adhd, ptsd, or a physical problem causing executive function issues and feeling sad is a side effect from struggling and not being able to get it together. Could be depression with a resulting lack of energy and motivation.\n\nI have adhd (and probs some other comorbidities) and for way too long I thought they life was just supposed to be hard and I was just bad at it.
