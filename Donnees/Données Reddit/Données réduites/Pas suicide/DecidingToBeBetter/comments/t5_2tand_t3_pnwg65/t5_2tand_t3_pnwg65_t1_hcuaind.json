I have chronic pain and I'm all too familiar with how addictive distractions can be. It starts as a tool to distract from the physical pain you're in, but then it starts to become a tool to distract from any painful feelings too or anything that might invite emotional pain. I find it useful to channel that distraction addiction into slightly healthier or more constructive distractions like going for walks outside, doing crafts, journaling, reading, painting, napping etc, which are still distractions from the pain, but also have some emotional grounding effects on me so I can then make it through some other basic but hard stuff.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pnwg65/why_is_is_to_hard_for_me_to_take_care_of_myself/hcuaind/"}
