She pointed out that I am very hard on myself about how I can\u2019t do basic upkeep tasks as easily as others and I feel like I am less than others who can take care of themselves. Yet, if the situation were reversed I would never look down on her in the same way I do myself. Which is true! I feel like I\u2019m a failure and therefore have almost convinced myself that I am not worth the effort. Her putting herself in my place really resounded with me and has been the basis of me making small changes in my life for the better.\n\nBasically when it boils down to it, I\u2019ve been working on my self worth. I need to keep telling myself that I deserve to live in a clean environment and a healthy body. I deserve to feel good about myself. I would never look down on someone else who struggles in this way and would never think any other person deserves to live in subpar conditions or be unhealthy. Why shouldn\u2019t I give myself the same compassion?\n\nBy looking at myself the same way I would look at any other person in my situation I\u2019ve been able to give myself grace and see areas in my life where I\u2019ve been killing it, instead of only focussing on where I\u2019m falling short. \n\nIt\u2019s a small mentality change but has really helped me! Maybe it can help you too!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pnwg65/why_is_is_to_hard_for_me_to_take_care_of_myself/hcujk8x/"}
