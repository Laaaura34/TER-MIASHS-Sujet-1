Your mind has to be stronger than your emotions. What do you think of that is your biggest motivation? Focus on that and you will start to do the things that will make your ultimate goal happen. Connect staying off your phone, sleep schedule, eating right to your goal and motivation and your actions will align with being productive to make it happen. Find someone to hold you accountable.
