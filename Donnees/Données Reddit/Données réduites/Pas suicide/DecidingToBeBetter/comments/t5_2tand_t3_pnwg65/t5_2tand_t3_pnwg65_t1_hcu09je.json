I started meditating and making myself get up early in the mornings, 6-7 and make a cup of tea, coffee is too much for me these days. I would make something to eat for myself then get a shower no matter what the day had in store. Even if I knew I was going to lay around the house all day I would still take a shower and brush my teeth. Start doing this every day. Get some good bread and jam and eat toast and jam in the mornings with coffee or tea, it's simple and a good start. You have to do little things that will break your cycle. Learn to be okay just being okay. Be okay with who you are and definitely put down the phone every once in a while and take a walk. It's good to get outside. If you can do these easy tasks, more will definitely follow. Find some way to break the cycle. We can think about it and read all we want, but until we start putting a little effort into it nothing is going to change. We have to make our lives happen, no one else can do that for us.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pnwg65/why_is_is_to_hard_for_me_to_take_care_of_myself/hcu09je/"}
