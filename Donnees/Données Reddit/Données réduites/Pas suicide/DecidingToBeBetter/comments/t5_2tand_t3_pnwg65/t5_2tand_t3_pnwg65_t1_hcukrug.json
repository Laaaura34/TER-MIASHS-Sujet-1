I still use my to do list.\nOnce I got a basic routine going I looked at introducing healthier meals, I started with packed lunches for work. I now have a really good meal plan going. I felt settled and confident with my meals, so I started looking at fitness. I don\u2019t enjoy the gym instead I found some fun dance workouts to do at home, started with short 10/15 min videos every few days and have moved up to 30 mins x3 a week. I got used to that, and I have now added in a \u201cCouch to 5k\u201d program.\nIt\u2019s probably take me close to a year to get it together, but progression not perfection! \nMy To Do List is my best tool. \nTake it easy and don\u2019t try to change everything at once, good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pnwg65/why_is_is_to_hard_for_me_to_take_care_of_myself/hcukrug/"}
