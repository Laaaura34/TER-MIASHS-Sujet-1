During times of famine, it was programmed into us to eat high caloric foods when possible. Things that cause pleasure release dopamine setting off the loop circuit in the brains reward pathways. Rewards that are reinforced through things that help us survive. Not saying that this is us and we cannot change but when we go against our primal instincts, it creates resistance. This is when you have to have the mental fortitude in the thinking part of your brain to push through pain. Our lizard brain was never designed to look for pain, only pleasure. Things that were pleasurable meant survival.\nIn the modern world we live in, things of pleasure are now at your fingertips in excess. Survival has taken on a whole new meaning. Do not be hard on yourself. It's resistance your feeling. If we falter, all we can do is dust ourselves off again and keep moving forward in the directions we set for ourselves. Even though we may be sailing in different ships, everyone of us is battling the same storm.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pnwg65/why_is_is_to_hard_for_me_to_take_care_of_myself/hcuxh5i/"}
