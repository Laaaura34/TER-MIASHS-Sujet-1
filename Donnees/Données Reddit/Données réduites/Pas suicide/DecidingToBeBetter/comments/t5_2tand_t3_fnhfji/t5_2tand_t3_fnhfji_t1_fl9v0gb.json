I have ADHD and this is a classical case of what I have to deal with daily. I would say try to write down 1 to 3 goals (I made a video about how to set goals in 7 steps on my channel, you can look at that) but really, without advertisement, being clear about what I want really changed this year for me. I came up with a system to define my goals and some things I can do to reach them. I was definitely minimal about it, just 3 goals. Once you know what you are working for this is half the motivation. The next half is getting a bit of a system to simplify down. Small bites will make it feel easier. Example: goal is to lose 2 kg in 1 month. Daily habit is 20 minute workout. All you have to do for your goal in one day is spend 20 minutes. That somehow feel easier! Once you have that down, put it in your ToDo's and THEN try the 1 minute rule.. good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fnhfji/a_week_before_the_lockdowns_began_i_did_a_one/fl9v0gb/"}
