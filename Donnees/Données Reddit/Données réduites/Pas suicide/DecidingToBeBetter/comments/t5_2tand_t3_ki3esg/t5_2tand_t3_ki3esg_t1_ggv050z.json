You live in a completely different world than people of lower incomes than you. You likely don't interact with with a lot of low-income people, so it's hard for you to get where you stand compared to them.\n\nBut just imagine, at this moment, millions of people are struggling to put food on the table. Lines and lines of people are waiting at food banks. 300,000 have died from the virus so far. You can never every imagine the hurt and struggle that every one of these people has been through, literally. The human brain is not designed to ever imagine that many people. Thousands of healthcare workers risk their own lives and their families' lives every single day to help Covid patients who are dying. This is all happening around you, and it's just a matter of opening your eyes to it. If you don't know what I'm talking about, watch the news or a documentary.\n\nThe minimum wage is $7.25. People literally work for an hour and only get $7.25. I don't mean this in any harsh way at all, but it's very hard for people to feel pity for rich people, especially the children of rich people. It's not your fault that you were raised this way, and you have enough self-awareness to realize that you were so lucky. What I described above is the reality for so many people. Appreciating your gifts means that you have a grasp on the reality that millions of people go through.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ki3esg/any_help_being_more_grateful_for_what_im_given/ggv050z/"}
