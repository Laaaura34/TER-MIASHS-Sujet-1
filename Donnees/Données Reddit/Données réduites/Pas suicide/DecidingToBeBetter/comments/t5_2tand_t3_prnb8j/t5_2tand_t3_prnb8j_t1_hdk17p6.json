It is doable and it gets easier as you have experience managing class versus work. Starting out part time and then ramping up my course load helped me a lot.\n\nOther than that, my main advice is pick a major that plays to your strengths and is marketable once you graduate. \n\nAs I went through my first year, I was careful to chose classes that met requirements for any major (AKA \"gen ed\"). I didn't know what I wanted to do when I first started. As you go through your gen ed classes, take note of what interests you. Take note of what subjects you excel at and enjoy. Use that to help you decide what career path you want and what you're majoring in. \n\nAs far as marketability, I say that because income is a factor in choosing a career. You probably know what kind of income you want to make eventually. If not, take some time to think about that. Student loans are also the norm, so that's another reason to consider your income after graduation. \n\nMerge those interests and strengths with the practical side of income after graduating. I took a career aptitude test as part of a class and it ended up being super accurate. But what really helped was taking some time to think about and journal about what I liked, what I was good at, and what income I wanted. \n\nBest of luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/prnb8j/going_back_to_school/hdk17p6/"}
