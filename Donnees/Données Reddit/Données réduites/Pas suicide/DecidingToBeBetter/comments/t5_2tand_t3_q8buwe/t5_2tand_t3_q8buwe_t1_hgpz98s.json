People don\u2019t realize marijuana dependency is a very real thing. Started smoking around 16 and spent my 20th birthday in an IOP with a sober program. Best decision of my life. I use an app called I am Sober, helps me find motivation. It can be hard while you\u2019re young, but you\u2019ll find your people. Cutting out a drug also means cutting out people who refuse to respect your boundaries, as well as dealers. It\u2019s scary at first but you\u2019re doing the right thing for yourself long term. This is a really mature step for you to take, wishing you the best of luck. You\u2019ve got this!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8buwe/im_cutting_out_marijuana/hgpz98s/"}
