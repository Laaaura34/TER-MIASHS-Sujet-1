There is a bit too much to go into in one reddit post, but it should be easy to research. CBT trains you to recognize when a thought that appears in your head isn't based on reality, and then to reject that thought. Just because I think something, doesn't mean it's true. That can help when you feel like someone is ignoring you or for when you feel unnecessary guilt.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/issftp/i_might_suffer_from_extreme_low_selfesteem_how_to/g59yv7j/"}
