No one can teach you how to have drive and passion. That comes from within. \n\nHonestly? You sound depressed and board. Seek therapy. Seek enlightenment. Get rid of all the normal bullshit you do every single day and do something else. \n\nDo you usually turn left here to go home? Turn right. Start walking. See where you end up. Did you hate the view? Great, go home and tomorrow don\u2019t turn right. \n\nYou\u2019ll slowly start to learn that you can in fact have control of yourself. You aren\u2019t special. You aren\u2019t so unique that you\u2019re too apathetic to do anything. \n\nYou\u2019re depressed and detached. Fix what\u2019s causing the apathy before you start to fix the outcome of said apathy. Get yourself a connection. Go actually struggle, talk to people who struggle.
