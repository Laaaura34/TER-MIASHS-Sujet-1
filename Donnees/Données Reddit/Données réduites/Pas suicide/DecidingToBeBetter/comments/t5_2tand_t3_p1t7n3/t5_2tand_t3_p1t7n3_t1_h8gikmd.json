It\u2019s not exactly \u201clack of motivation\u201d when there\u2019s literally no personal/professional goal. Your case might be an issue with the lack of feeling accomplished, because you do the main things that would give that feeling and to be honest, I\u2019m proud of you because for me these things *are big.* I mean it. I\u2019m happy when I don\u2019t get panic attacks trying meditation, the word \u201cskill\u201d is enough to give me said panic attacks let alone practicing any, I congratulate myself if I succeed to eat anything in a day, and even when I rarely eat all my meals I cannot even stand up for more than 5 minutes. While the best thing to do, and therefore say would be \u201ctry new hobbies, get career counseling\u201d etc, I\u2019d actually say take it easy (mentally). Sometimes things come to us naturally. You don\u2019t need to have a dead set big goal all your life as long as you keep working on yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p1t7n3/i_want_to_be_restless/h8gikmd/"}
