Not everyone is made for that. When my life is too much of a routine for too long, I tend to get irritable and somewhat despondent.\n\nWhat I recommend you try is something that will be difficult because you probably do not feel like it, is try some new things. I like to take a train somewhere far. Make a long beach walk, talk to strangers on a terrace, pet a dog you meet on the street, go to the biggest mall you can find, go solo-camping or with a friend, go volunteer somewhere. \n\nDo anything new within your power. Force yourself out of your routine for at least 24 hours but preferably a full week. And it's even better if you can maintain this on a weekly or monthly basis. \n\nI know this sounds difficult but this could be solved by the price of a train ticket.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p1t7n3/i_want_to_be_restless/h8fk8z8/"}
