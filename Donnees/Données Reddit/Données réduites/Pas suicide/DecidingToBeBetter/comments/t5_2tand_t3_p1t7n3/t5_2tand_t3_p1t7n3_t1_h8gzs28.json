I remember the first time I read a definition for the word \"anhedonia,\" I was like, \"Oh, I know what that is! I feel that a lot.\" What helped me -- in addition to all the good stuff you're already doing and therapy and stuff -- was this. *Get a hobby that's a little. bit. miserable.* Or even a little scary. \n\nI had this office job that I hated -- would just sort of sleepwalk through the week hating my life. But then, on the weekends, I would go backpacking or rock climbing out in the desert or up in the mountains. I'd put myself through really difficult hikes, climb scary stuff, sleep on the ground, think I heard bears... Mind you, I was always very safe! I had the right gear, knew what I was doing, but would put myself through juuuust enough and \"Shit shit shit,\" moments, that by the time Monday came around I was DELIGHTED to sit at a desk in a soft chair and respond to emails. That little taste of pain and danger had made me appreciate modern civilization again, and made me feel lucky to have what I had and want to succeed. \n\nAgain: don't do anything REALLY dangerous or over your comfort/knowledge. At least once every three months someone unprepared would die in the desert where I used to hike. Buuuut find something that's tough, takes effort, and pushes you just ever so slightly out of your comfort zone, and see if that helps light fire a little bit. \n\nWorked for me, but of course, individual results may vary. Good luck! You've taken a great first step by articulating your feelings and asking for help!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p1t7n3/i_want_to_be_restless/h8gzs28/"}
