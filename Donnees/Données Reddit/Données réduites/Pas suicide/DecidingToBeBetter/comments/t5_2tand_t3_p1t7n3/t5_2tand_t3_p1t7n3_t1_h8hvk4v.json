I wonder if anything has ever truly challenged you, I would love to know the answer. I have spoken to countless people, myself included that struggle with commitment and motivation. The truth is that everyone has the kernel of greatness within them, although greatness is truly subjective to your own tastes.\n\nFor some people, apathy is about avoidance. This means that people avoid doing things that make them feel anything because they don't want to experience the feelings, be that excitement or anxiety. The apathy is a way of toning down the volume.\n\nApathy can also be a means of avoiding the types of responsibilities that lead to actualization. This might sound counterintuitive, but people avoid being a full and authentic version of themselves because by doing so they have to be vulnerable and put themselves at risk. Vulnerable meaning that you could be hurt emotionally.\n\nI can't be sure of the exact reason for your avoidance, but it sounds like you are on the right path by asking the questions. If you want to share any more details I would be happy to respond. I hope this was helpful and I wish you the best of luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p1t7n3/i_want_to_be_restless/h8hvk4v/"}
