I snapped one day and went \"enough. I'm done with this, and I am not doing this for the rest of my life\", and refused to back down when things went wrong. I was a complete fawn and people pleaser. I'd sacrifice everything to make others happy, before I just went \"Nope. Not today, Satan\". I was so freaking miserable that I got to the point where I felt like I had to fight or I'd just completely give up on everything and everyone.   \nIn the last two years, my husband and I have been through hell and back together (like a series of unfortunate events, one after another lol), and we just keep fighting for a better tomorrow. It's exhausting. I can't wait for the point where we can just... relax, lol.  \n\n\nIt does sound a lot like possible depression, to feel so apathetic in everything and your own life. Like others have said, therapy can help. <3", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p1t7n3/i_want_to_be_restless/h8hpqho/"}
