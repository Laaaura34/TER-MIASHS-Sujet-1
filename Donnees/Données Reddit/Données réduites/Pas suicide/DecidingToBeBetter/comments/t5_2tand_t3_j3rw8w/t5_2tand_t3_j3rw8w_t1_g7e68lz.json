For me, learning to be satisfied as I am has really helped me in achieving peace. I still have ambitions and such though, but I know that once those ambitions are achieved if I\u2019m not already self satiated; the pursuit will only continue.\n\nI think that every contribution is significant whether it be minuscule or monumental. Perhaps consistently making small contributions (whatever it is you can manage right now in the present moment) to make the world a better place every day, will result in the building of a solid foundation you can use to continually make those contributions better. That way when you\u2019re in the position to do something truly great, you have all the little things you did backing you up. \n\nI like to believe even the influence we have on other people is a worthwhile contribution and for that reason simply keeping it positive can feel satisfying.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j3rw8w/how_can_i_contribute_to_the_world_how_can_i_give/g7e68lz/"}
