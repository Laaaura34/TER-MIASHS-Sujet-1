I think that the humbleness you are showing is a very powerful thing and hopefully someone will be inspired by you when they notice this about you :D. I applaud you for being able to become a bit more conscious about your thoughts and deciding to improve. Just reading this makes me wanna try a little harder to improve at the things I want to get better at as well. Good luck to you and I hope you continue grinding for your goals!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n52aa8/choosing_to_feel_inspired/gwznl23/"}
