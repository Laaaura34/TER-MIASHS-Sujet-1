Travelling alone/spending a lot of time outside in general \n2. Not letting others influence my interests & actually investing in things I like asap (before I get influenced and change my mind)\n3. This one is hard for me cause I've literally never followed what I want but making my own decisions - whether it's as small as shopping for something, or eating out or investing my money. Just discovering things I can like is good enough for me atm. \n\nI do say no a lot so I'm gonna try saying yes more (if it is something I can prioritise) \n\nBasically I don't wanna waste this one life I have following what others expect of me and if I don't like what I'm doing, I'm ditching it. I've unconsciously lived more than half of my life in a disempowered state and after realising it, denying it, horribly wanting to go back to the person I was before I've just accepted that that person with that personality is dead. Everything that happened then, I forgive those people and myself for doing what I thought was best for me at that time. But it's not anymore, so I'm going with my gut and building someone new that I am completely comfortable being.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1s4bn/im_done_blaming_others_for_my_life/hfhbydw/"}
