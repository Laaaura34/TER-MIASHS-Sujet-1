Being sober made me much more aware of myself and the situation and it also helped me relax because I knew most people around me had had alcohol and would probably not remember me if I did something awkward. Being alone forced me to socialise with others. \n\nI started to talk to evveryone. Both dudes and chicks just to get rid of all the tensions. It almost always went really well and even if it did not \"lead anywhere\", it really helped to boost my self-esteem a lot. \n\nI managed to maintain conversation and have fun with the opposite sex, but never really got to a level of comfort to exchange contact info. \n\nNonetheless, my plan was always just to talk to people, so I never felt like a failure afterwards. Although, I have facepalmed many times looking back at how easily and definitely I vould have gotten a girl's number had I only asked. \n\nI think it is extremely important to get out of your comfort zone and just tell your inner voice to stfu and just go for it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kaa0wo/i_talked_to_a_woman_and_she_responded_positively/gfb1cmo/"}
