While you sleep, your body and brain perform a host of functions required to keep you healthy:**\"...sleep works to reenergize the body's cells, clear waste from the brain, and support learning and memory. It even plays vital roles in regulating mood, appetite and libido.\"**\n\nAnd this isn't even the interesting in detail stuff. Quality, regulated sleep (going to bed at night at the same time every night and waking up to sunlight at the same time every day) greatly improves the way you function as well as your quality/longevity of life.\n\nYou might try to start sleeping early in increments, gradually pushing it back 30 mins every week. Also stopping using any screen at least 30 mins before you try to sleep helps. If you spend the last 30 mins before you sleep normally on a computer, try spending it stretching or doing yoga instead. It will help to relax your muscles, slow down your mind, and get your body/mind ready to sleep.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lheg5u/stop_neglecting_your_sleep/gmxx10b/"}
