I thrive on 6 hours of sleep. I can also push myself to sleep 4 hours or less for several nights in a row, but then I need a good 8 hours one Night to fully recover.\n\nI\u2019ve never been able to sleep more than 8 hours, and certainly not several nights in a row. \n\nI\u2019ve found that if you mentally convince yourself that you actually have slept well, it gets easier to grind.\n\nThat being said, those young hustlers who preach about 3 hours of sleep a Night, cold showers, never watch a movie, etc. are full of it.\n\nSleep 8 hours if you must every Night. Do not do it if you\u2019re like me and you can alternate between sleeping schedules.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lheg5u/stop_neglecting_your_sleep/gmz3r9u/"}
