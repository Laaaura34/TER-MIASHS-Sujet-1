Some will just listen to you, some will analyse what you will say, others will give you actual tools to help in everyday life. I\u2019ve seen a variety of therapists over the years and I would recommend looking at someone who is more of a life coach than a psychotherapist. IMO the best person I saw was the one who listened and offered practical tools for life, rather than the psychotherapist who just made \u201cclever\u201d observations of my life. Do some research into different therapies out there to see which one speaks to you the most and beware of those which try to convince you that you have a mental health problem you currently don\u2019t feel you have - it\u2019s not unknown - just to keep getting your business.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p1xrci/when_its_time_to_see_a_therapist/h8go9gh/"}
