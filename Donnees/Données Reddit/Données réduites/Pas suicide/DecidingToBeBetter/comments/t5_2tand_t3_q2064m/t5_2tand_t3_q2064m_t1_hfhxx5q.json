The circumstances ended so badly that I just can\u2019t contact them.\n\nHave you ever watched Bojack Horseman? If you have, the one episode that resonated with me was when Bojack so his old friend dying of cancer and Bojack tried to apologize for hurting his friend in the past. While his friend accepted his apology, he said he would never forgive.\n\nThat episode hit me like a freight train. Because, it\u2019s true: some people will never forgive you, even if it\u2019s something that you find insignificant in the grand scheme of things.\n\nSo, it makes me question do I just not value the same things as other people do? Do I not recognize certain things as being important to people? Can I even begin to understand?\n\nThese thoughts race in my head all the time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2064m/im_afraid_im_not_a_good_person_the_people_i_have/hfhxx5q/"}
