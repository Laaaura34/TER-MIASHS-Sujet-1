I used to struggle really bad with self-blame. It\u2019s not only you. We are all flawed. As long as you continue to be a good person you will always win. In my case any relationship that ended badly in life was due to me not knowing my worth and letting myself get taken advantage of. But it wasn\u2019t my fault those relationships ended. I simply played a role in it. When it comes to relationships ending blame cannot be placed on anyone. There\u2019s only one question to be asked \u201cwhat role did I play in it.\u201d Self-blame isn\u2019t something you want to struggle with. Just from reading this post I can tell you are not a bad person. Bad people don\u2019t wonder if they are bad people. Bad people don\u2019t blame themselves for anything. You are not a bad person.
