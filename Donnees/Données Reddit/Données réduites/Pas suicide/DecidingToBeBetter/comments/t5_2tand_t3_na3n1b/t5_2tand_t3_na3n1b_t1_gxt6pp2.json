That is why we do this job! Their is nothing to be embarrassed about! We've seen it all! We don't gossip about our patients like \"look how bad this dude is\" it's usually \"I feel so bad they've been going through this pain\" we want you to feel better. The BEST part of this job is when someone comes in with poorly cared for teeth and after the treatment how they're a completely different person with so much more confidence!! That's what we love. I understand being scared, just try to remind yourself: \"everyone here wants to help me, nobody here is judging me\" because it's 100% true. Go get it OP!! Self care!! Lots of love!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/na3n1b/first_dental_appointment_in_four_years_could_use/gxt6pp2/"}
