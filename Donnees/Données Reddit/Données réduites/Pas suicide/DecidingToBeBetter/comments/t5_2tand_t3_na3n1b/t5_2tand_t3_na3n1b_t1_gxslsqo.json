I started seeing a counselor prior to getting married because I knew I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable smiling on my wedding day. unfortunately what spurred me to action was the pain of a tooth that cracked in half a year later.That push was huge for me though. My dentist was great with my anxiety , I also leaned on the nitrous for the first 2 phases of treatment. Use what you can to get through it. A lot of what the phobia is, is limited and usually bad experience. The more positive experience the easier it will be to kick the phobia. Communicate your fears, and try as hard as possible to work through the discomfort and anxiety. And remember that progress is better than perfection. I had horrible teeth and as a consequence I ALWAYS hid my smile. The damage caused by feeling shame every time you feel happiness is immeasurable. My teeth are not perfect, they are as healthy as they can be now though and my dentist made sure to make them as beautiful as he could and it has made a world of difference. \n\nYou deserve happiness, you are worthy, and you deserve the dignity and confidence of your smile. Step one is the hardest, the rest is mostly momentum.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/na3n1b/first_dental_appointment_in_four_years_could_use/gxslsqo/"}
