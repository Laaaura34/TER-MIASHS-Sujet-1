Super great hygienist who was super patient with me.  Offered to freeze my gums and no additional cost since even a cleaning was gonna be pretty painful with my terrible gums.   Feeling a million times better a few weeks later with a filling replacement booked for later this month and a follow up cleaning in 3 months.  \n\nGood for you for conquering your anxieties and going to get work done :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/na3n1b/first_dental_appointment_in_four_years_could_use/gxt3bqb/"}
