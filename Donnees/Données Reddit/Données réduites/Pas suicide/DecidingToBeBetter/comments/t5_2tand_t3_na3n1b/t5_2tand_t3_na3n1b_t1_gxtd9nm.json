I've had a lot done due to breaking my jaw in a car accident. I usually need something done every couple of years for the past 18 years after the initial dental work (half my teeth are root canaled or fake). I'm always amazed at what has changed in that time.\n\nI think a lot of people forget with neglected teeth that cavaties turn into the need for a root canal. If that's neglected then a dental implant is necessary... And if that doesn't happen then you can get a bone infection and become septic. It's really important to go for your health. And it keeps you living a long life!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/na3n1b/first_dental_appointment_in_four_years_could_use/gxtd9nm/"}
