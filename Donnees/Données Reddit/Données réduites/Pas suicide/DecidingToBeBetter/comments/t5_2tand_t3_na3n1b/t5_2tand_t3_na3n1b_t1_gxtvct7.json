So everytime I'd go in, it's time to fix cavities which meant getting painful oral injections. It wasn't until I was in my late teens that I'd finally experienced a good dentist.\n\nThis guy was so damn smooth he could give me injections in multiple places and I didn't feel a thing at any point. Point being, there are good dentists who apparently take it more seriously or just have better technique. Whatever the case, the guy totally changed my views.\n\nUnfortunately the only way to find out if you have a good dentist is .. well, the hard way. Lol.\n\nMoral of the story: don't be afraid to switch dentists. I'd also think letting any dentist know ahead of time what kind of past issues you've had so (hopefully) they could be extra careful and try to diffuse your dentistry anxieties.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/na3n1b/first_dental_appointment_in_four_years_could_use/gxtvct7/"}
