Well done for taking this step. Yeah dentist visits are one of those things that I\u2019d rather procrastinate. It\u2019s not even about the pain, but the fact that someone\u2019s fiddling with your mouth. It\u2019s worth it though!

Wish you luck with your dental MOT and any repairs, it\u2019ll make you feel so good about yourself once its done!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/na3n1b/first_dental_appointment_in_four_years_could_use/gxrug8v/"}
