I'd just add mindfulness. \n\nOP, if you're actually lighting a candle and meditating every single day, AND taking care of your body, you're doing way more than most people. But if, during those things, you're mentally (or physically and therefore also mentally) multi-tasking, you rob yourself of the opportunity to even *feel* the self-love while giving it. So just be a little more present in those moments every single time. Mindfulness is a muscle. If you don't progressively overload it, it weakens back to what it was before.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ewee/loving_myself_but_how/hg6mwy7/"}
