Finally committed to biweekly therapy sessions and after all these years got a super life changing diagnosis of what ails me. What family made therapy\u2019s importance clear to me is that my therapist said that the brain is a muscle in a way and you have to constantly work it out to make it change and get better. If you only try therapy once or twice it\u2019s like only working out once or twice and expecting to have a perfect body. Improvement takes work and if it\u2019s so bad that your boyfriend is mentioning it on his way out, you probably need therapy just like I do. At least it certainly can\u2019t hurt.
