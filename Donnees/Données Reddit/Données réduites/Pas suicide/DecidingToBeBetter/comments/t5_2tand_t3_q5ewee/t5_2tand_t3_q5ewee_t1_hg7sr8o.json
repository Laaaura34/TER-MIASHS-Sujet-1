To improve yourself as a person, you *have* to come to accept yourself, tolerate yourself, and love yourself as much as you can. 'You wouldn't want to help someone you dislike, would you?' That's what felt like a breakthrough for me, that I'll want to work harder to improve myself if I have some affection towards the person that I currently am. Alternatively: the person you are right now is also the person that that perfect, loveable 'future you' will be. The good things you do for yourself now are also favors you're doing to your future self, and that future self is the culmination of your hopes and aspirations, so of course you would want to help them.\n2. There's a really nice quote from comedian Daniel Sloss that I'm paraphrasing here. You have to love 100% of yourself before someone else can love you. This doesn't mean that you're unloveable if you cannot accept yourself. The point he made was that if you only love yourself like 30%, someone could come around and love you 40% and that would feel like a big deal when it actually isn't. I also believe it would make accepting others' love a lot easier. I feel guilt towards the people who care for me because I feel like I'm too disappointing of a person to deserve it. I have to accept who I am and see that there must be some good in me, that the people in my life have chosen to stay. And I would like to accept their affections without the guilt and regret coming in the way.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ewee/loving_myself_but_how/hg7sr8o/"}
