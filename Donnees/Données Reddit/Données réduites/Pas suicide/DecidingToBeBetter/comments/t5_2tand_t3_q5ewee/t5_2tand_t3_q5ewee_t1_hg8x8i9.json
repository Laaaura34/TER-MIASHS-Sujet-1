Listen to how you talk to yourself \u2014 often our inner voices get tuned out because they\u2019re so familiar and become so ingrained. For example, say someone cuts you in line and you bite your tongue and just simmer while staring daggers at the back of their head. You might think you\u2019re saying \u201cgod I hate that guy, what a jerk.\u201d But you might also be saying to yourself without noticing, \u201cI\u2019m such a wimp, I should say something. But I don\u2019t know, is it even worth saying something, maybe it\u2019s just better I suffer than to cause a scene.\u201d In this moment, you\u2019re making the decision that your suffering is okay, and even attributing that to a negative self image. \n\nYour comfort counts. Your peace of mind counts. Your sense of joy counts. Your boundaries count.\n\nLoving yourself doesn\u2019t only mean physically pampering yourself, it means listening to yourself and getting to know yourself \u2014 how you process information, how you orient yourself in situations, how you react to things. Be kind to yourself as you discover that some of your thoughts and  attitudes may come from fear and lack \u2014 fear of being disliked, fear of being judged, fear of being found inadequate. Realize that these are parts of yourself trying to protect you, that these may be remnants of your inner child who has been rejected and hurt before.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ewee/loving_myself_but_how/hg8x8i9/"}
