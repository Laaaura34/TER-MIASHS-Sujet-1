In the midst of a breakup, I don\u2019t know how much faith you should put into that. He could easily have just been trying to put the blame on you or justify his guilt. Regardless, if you believe it, then it is true.\n\nI\u2019m on the same journey and have found The Four Agreements (don Miguel Ruiz) an unmatched resource.  It \u201creveals the source of self-limiting beliefs that rob us of joy and create needless suffering.\u201d The Journey From Abandonment to Healing (Susan Anderson) has immensely helped me work through relating to myself and working through deep-seated issues. Lastly, the enneagram institute personality test gives an in-depth analysis of your strengths and weaknesses and comes complete with areas and motivations for personal growth. I\u2019m more than impressed with it as a tool for self discovery, definitely worth the $12 fee.\n\nWhat I agree with is that for you to be at your best for others, you must first love and respect yourself. If your needs are not being met, your relationships will take the hit and may eventually go awry. Best of luck to you. The mere fact that you\u2019ve reached out is beyond promising.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ewee/loving_myself_but_how/hg7jv5l/"}
