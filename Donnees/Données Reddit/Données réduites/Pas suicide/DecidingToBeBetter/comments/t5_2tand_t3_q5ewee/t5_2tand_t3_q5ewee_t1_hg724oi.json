An intense fear of selfishness, and feeling driven to live my life for others as it feels more worthwhile than loving myself.\n\nWhat helped me was the realization that by being whole and happy myself, I was able to give more to others. Having hobbies and creative outlets that were personally fulfilling meant I spent less time draining others with my own need for entertainment or validation, and when I came at social situations I had more social energy for others to draw from because I wasn't expending it hating myself or feeling anxious or depressed. \n\nIt's a little like put your own mask on before you help others. You can help more people if you're breathing comfortably than if you're suffocating.\n\nAs far as how to develop it, pursue things you love, write, draw, paint your nails, get really good at something and share that knowledge with others. And yes TAKE CARE OF YOUR BODY like it is an infant baby. If you can't look after your own emotional and physical health how in the hell you gonna look after somebody else's.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ewee/loving_myself_but_how/hg724oi/"}
