You see others so much that you miss out on having your own independent thoughts, feelings, ideas, personality, etc.\n\nUnfortunately, when your personality doesn't show though, it goes the opposite way for attraction. People lose out on depth of connection if the other person is like a liquid that forms to their shape, or someone who becomes their boyfriend/partner. Originality and authenticity that clearly shines through on the other hand attracts, and you want to search for ways to that. \n\nInstead of lighting candles or saying nice things in mirrorif these aren't your cup of tea, notice what these acts represent in the abstract. They all affirm and pull your attention and awareness to yourself. So forget about candles if they mean nothing to you. Do something else that means that way, whatever that way is for you.\n\nAnd stop with judging this as selfishness. That's prrobably the biggest change of perspective you will need to make here to see big results.\n\nGood luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ewee/loving_myself_but_how/hg6acka/"}
