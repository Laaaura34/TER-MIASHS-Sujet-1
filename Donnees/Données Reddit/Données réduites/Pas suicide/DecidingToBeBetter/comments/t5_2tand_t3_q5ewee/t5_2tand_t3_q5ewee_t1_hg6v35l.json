I know intellectually that I\u2019m worthy of love, I just don\u2019t act in ways that show that I love myself.\n\nSO I try to ask myself: is this thing I\u2019m doing or saying or thinking a thing that someone who loves themself would do? \n\nIt\u2019s a fairly simple concept, but it seems to be working. It\u2019s helped me stand up for myself a lot more, and it\u2019s helped me not put myself last, and stopped a lot of negative self-talk. \n\nGood luck <3", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ewee/loving_myself_but_how/hg6v35l/"}
