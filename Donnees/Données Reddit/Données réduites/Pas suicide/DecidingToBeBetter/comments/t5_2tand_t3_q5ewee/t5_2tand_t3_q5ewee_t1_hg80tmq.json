I would also see this better me as another person I would eventually be. This was at the cost of my self-confidence, because that end goal was a moving goal and I was never going to be that better me. Anytime I made progress, I\u2019d realize that the end goal is just as far because I\u2019ve realized other ways in which I want the better me to be better. If you do this too, I got rid of thinking myself in terms of two people; who I am and who I want to be. The version of me that I want to be is still me just makes different choices and hopefully better choices. I bridged the gap between these by starting with complete acceptance of who I am and what I\u2019m like. I tried my best to not judge any part of me. I was surprised to know that I actually didn\u2019t dislike me as much as I thought. So maybe this would be helpful for you, just starting with self acceptance. Being honest with yourself about your shortcomings and your good qualities. At the end of the day, we\u2019re all just a clumps of cells, we\u2019re all allowed to have shortcomings, the key is not hold it against yourself as much. For me the acceptance had to come before the love.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ewee/loving_myself_but_how/hg80tmq/"}
