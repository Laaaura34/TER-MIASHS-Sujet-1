This statement kind of sounds like you don't think that you are inherently worthy of love and respect unless you do something to prove that you deserve love.\n\nYou should stop buying things for self-care and such because this routine can make you feel as if you can only buy nice things if you do something worthy of self-care; stop trying to force self-care routines, they have to come naturally and later they will. \n\nI would suggest using positive affirmations to get started because they do not require you to buy anything or prove anything to anyone, not even proving things to yourself. Instead, they are words of gratitude that you have for yourself because, without other people and items, all that is left is you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ewee/loving_myself_but_how/hg5rizu/"}
