You don't ask how'd you love someone out in the street like that now, would you?\nWell no, because it's insane.\nLet's take this down a notch for a second: maybe you should start by asking how do you *like* yourself before jumping to love.\nAnd just like with any other human being you'd meet in your life, you're probably better off knowing that person before you decide you like them.\nSo, I'll argue that you should start by knowing yourself. Learn who you really are. You probably already have a passing idea at the very least but try putting it on paper/convenient digital notes. How? Well maybe that's the first question you should ask: how would *I* like to write this down?\nYou need to start that conversation with yourself, exercise that open channel and you need to listen -- even when you have unpleasant things to say.\nDo that for a while and then answer this comment with what you found out. Did you like any of it? Did you hate it? What did you like the most? Explore that! Feed that internal relationship. The love that you seek will be down deep in that rabbit hole.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ewee/loving_myself_but_how/hg6jh95/"}
