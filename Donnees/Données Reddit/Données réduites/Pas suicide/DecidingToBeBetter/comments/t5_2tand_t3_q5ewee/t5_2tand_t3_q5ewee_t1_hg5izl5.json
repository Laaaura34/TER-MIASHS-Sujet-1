The entire concept made no sense to me for a long time because love is a relationship and how do you have a relationship with yourself?\n\nMy ways are to just treat myself like 2 different people. Write to myself in a journal. Look at myself in a mirror. Spend time with myself - go on a date and have a nice dinner alone. Listen to my thoughts the way I would listen to a friend talking about their day.  Turns out I'm amazing - all my favourite things are also my favourite things! I am never out of sync! See myself from different angles, like doing the Faceapp ageify and thinking about what older-me wants to say to now-me. \n\nI used to worry if I would look like a crazy person to others or if it was cringey or whatever, but after some time I stopped caring because I'm not hurting anyone and honestly I believe this would be a good exercise for most people.\n\nA lot of fears of being weird or selfish or narcissistic come from society and the people around you wanting you to change to suit them. Spend some time alone and everyone else's opinions - including your ex's, will just fade away until you can hear yourself properly and realise that this is a person worth listening to, because they will be with you your whole life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ewee/loving_myself_but_how/hg5izl5/"}
