I ask myself this every time I feel like being lazy: Do I need to take a break and chill or am I slacking off? Don't measure yourself to any standard other than yours, we all have different amounts of willpower and forcing yourself is a great way to diminish it mid to long term.\n\nThe goal isn't to one day achieve everything, it's to every day make a small improvement that add up over time. Even the tiniest amount of effort put into self-care will pay off eventually if you compound it daily, don't think something is too small to start with and stay doing something small if that's all you can manage right now. It will get better the longer you stick to it, and if you fail just start something even easier.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g32ms0/if_you_can_afford_food_and_have_a_roof_to_sleep/fnplho9/"}
