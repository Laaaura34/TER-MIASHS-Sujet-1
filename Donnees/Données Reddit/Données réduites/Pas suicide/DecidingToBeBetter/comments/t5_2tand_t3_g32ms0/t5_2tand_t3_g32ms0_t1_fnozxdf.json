This isn't a big vacation that is \"wasted\" if we don't accomplish anything. It's a global pandemic. Something unprecedented for our current times. Its completely okay to do whatever helps you get through it. For some that might be focusing on improvement, but for others it's going to be playing video games and chatting with friends all day.\n\nI for one am struggling with my mental health through this. Which means I spend most of the time doing whatever makes me happy (mostly playing the sims.) If I find i have an urge and the energy to do some cleaning or yoga or make something then that's great! \n\nHowever sometimes the only productive thing I manage is having a shower and making my bed. And y'know that's perfectly fine too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g32ms0/if_you_can_afford_food_and_have_a_roof_to_sleep/fnozxdf/"}
