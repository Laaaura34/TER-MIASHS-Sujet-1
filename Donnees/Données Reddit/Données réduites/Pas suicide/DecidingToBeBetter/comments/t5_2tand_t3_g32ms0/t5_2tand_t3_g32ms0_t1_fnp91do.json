I definitely understand where you're coming from. I too have spent an above average amount of time watching TV and Movies. I knew from the get go that I was going to have to be consistent with my personal wellness habits though. I'm been doing Yoga, Meditation and practicing creativity nearly everyday. As I as productive as I could be? Definitely not. Am I going to come out of this a happier and healthier individual? I'm definitely going to try.  Rock on my friend!
