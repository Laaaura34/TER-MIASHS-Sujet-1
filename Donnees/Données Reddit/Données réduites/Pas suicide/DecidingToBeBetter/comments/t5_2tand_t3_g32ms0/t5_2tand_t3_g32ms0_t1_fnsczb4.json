Some of them didn't even have homes, or if they did, they didn't have access to some of the basics that I have access to.\n\nI think of them everyday. Every day, I wonder how they are doing, hoping they are safe and well during this time of struggle. There's only so much you can really do.... I'm just hoping that whoever returns when this pandemic is over, I can provide the best help and support possible. The best way I can do this is by what I'm doing now: Improving myself by giving myself time to learn a new language and also making sure I'm at the best of mental and physical health that I can be.\n\nI hope your routine also helps you tremendously with both helping yourself and helping others. May you be happy, at peace, and healthy during these times.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g32ms0/if_you_can_afford_food_and_have_a_roof_to_sleep/fnsczb4/"}
