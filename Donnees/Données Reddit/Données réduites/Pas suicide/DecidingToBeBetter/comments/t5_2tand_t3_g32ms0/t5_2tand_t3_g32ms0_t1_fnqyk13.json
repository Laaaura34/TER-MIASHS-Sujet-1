You're using privilege in the sense that it's a privilege at work to use the coffee machine but it's your right to a safe work environment.\n\nBut you can also use privilege to mean not having a certain disadvantage. For example being able to see is a type of privilege. Think about how many obstacles you'd face daily if you were blind. With all else being equal, it's clear the sighted person has the advantage, thus privilege. You can analyze privilege for pretty much any aspect of human existence. Everyone is privileged in different aspects. It's not about living a privilege free life or having more/less privileges than others. It's about analyzing your own privileges to overcome prejudices and to be more empathetic to others. The thing about privilege is that you're often blind to your own because it's your normal.\n\nSo in that sense it is a privilege to have a place to stay and food to eat because there are many who don't. You don't have the disadvantage of being homeless and food scarce.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g32ms0/if_you_can_afford_food_and_have_a_roof_to_sleep/fnqyk13/"}
