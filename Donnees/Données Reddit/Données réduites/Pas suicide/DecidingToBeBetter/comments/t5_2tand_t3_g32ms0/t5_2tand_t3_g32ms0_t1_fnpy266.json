It is a necessity. No one should be without it. No one. Especially not people who were fully employed a couple of weeks ago.\n\nShelter -- the thing that keeps you safe from the elements, from predators, that gives you privacy -- is not a privilege. It is a necessity. No one should be without it. No one. Especially not people who were fully employed a couple of weeks ago.\n\nThe collective worth of the 400 richest Americans has doubled in the last decade, from 1.27 trillion dollars to 3 trillion dollars. Trillion. \n\nThe federal minimum wage has not been raised in more than a decade.\n\nBy all means, take this time to improve yourself. Reflect, nurture yourself, grow.\n\nBut you are not privileged. Not for having food and shelter. You have the necessities you are entitled to. Other people have been robbed of those natural rights by a broken system. \n\n[source to collective wealth stuff. ](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/11/26/ten-year-challenge-400-wealthiest-americans-shows-fortunes-doubled-2009-while-tax)\n\n [more collective wealth sources](https://www.businessinsider.com/forbes-rich-americans-list-1982-versus-today-wealth-trends-2019-11)\n\n[universal declaration of human rights from the UN.
