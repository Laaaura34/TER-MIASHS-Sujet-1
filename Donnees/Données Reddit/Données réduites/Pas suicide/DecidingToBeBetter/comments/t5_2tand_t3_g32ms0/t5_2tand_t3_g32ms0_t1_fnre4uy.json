Good for you for trying to find positive alternatives. But people that are still working are not \u201cprivileged\u201d I\u2019m not sure if your friends said that or you saw it somewhere but that\u2019s just my opinion. Grocery store employees making 10$/hr while risking their life\u2019s possibly getting infected vs someone that got laid off and qualifies for $2,000 a month in JUST federal aid, is a bit privileged to me. \n\nI do construction work. I\u2019d rather be laid off and get that 2k a month + regular unemployment = 3.5k a month for sitting on my ass, I don\u2019t get that option though because I have an \u201cessential\u201d job. So I go out. Work and risk it for way less then 3.5k a month. My peers and I are definitely not privileged, it\u2019s just current circumstances suck for everyone. And I feel for people that lost their jobs for sure, but idea of someone out there saying I\u2019m privileged because I have to work to make ends meet kinda irritates me. \n\nEither way, good on you for trying to make light of dark times.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g32ms0/if_you_can_afford_food_and_have_a_roof_to_sleep/fnre4uy/"}
