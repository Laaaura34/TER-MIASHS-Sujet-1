Super grateful that I can actually do these things and enjoy them.\n\nFor me it helps if I treat it like a vacation/rehab type of thing. Working out in the nice weather and watching/playing my favourite games and movies in the evenings with no worries of work or forced social events to keep up appearances is certainly a breath of fresh air for now. \n\nBy no means do I want this to last forever obviously. I know others aren't in such good positions. With some being from abusive homes and the like. You have to find a silver lining somewhere though and ride it out until this thing is over, otherwise you may go insane.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g32ms0/if_you_can_afford_food_and_have_a_roof_to_sleep/fnqhzgn/"}
