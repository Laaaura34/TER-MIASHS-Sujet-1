My first day at work started at Work From Home. Although I don't particularly like the job owing to doing the same shit everyday, I consider myself extremely lucky because at this crucial time of crisis, when everyone is getting their dreams stripped off from them, I seem to be one lucky human who made the cut. \n\nI am living in an Airbnb where I need to pay way more rent than a proper place. I will have zero savings for the next 1-2 months, but I still consider myself luckier than most. I hope that this lockdown ends ASAP, and people get back to the place where they always wanted to be. \n\nAnd with due Respect, Fuck You China.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g32ms0/if_you_can_afford_food_and_have_a_roof_to_sleep/fnrfkkq/"}
