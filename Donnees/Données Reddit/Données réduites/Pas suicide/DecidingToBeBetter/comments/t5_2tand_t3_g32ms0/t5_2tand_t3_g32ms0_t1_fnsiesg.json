(Sims 3, with Ambitions) I have an inventor who is working her way up from 0 in a new town. As soon as she gained the ability to invent a time machine, after her first trip, she came home with a son! Another mouth to feed in a one-bedroom house, where her only job depends on diving into piles in the dump for scrap...but she's doing it. She just earned enough money to build a house with a second bedroom and a tiny garden. All from scrap she got from the dump!\n\nMaking rich, successful sims is so boring to me. But having them live long, fulfilling lives where they've earned their successes really makes the game worthwhile.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g32ms0/if_you_can_afford_food_and_have_a_roof_to_sleep/fnsiesg/"}
