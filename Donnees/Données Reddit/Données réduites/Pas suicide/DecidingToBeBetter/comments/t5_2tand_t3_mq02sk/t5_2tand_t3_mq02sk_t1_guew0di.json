I had this thought over a year ago and I wanted to change like the way you described. I think I accomplished that at least for some time. I just want you to warn you about something. You are doing this for other people, don't forget to make things that make YOU happy or otherwise you are just living other's people's life. People that are most convenient to you will stay and you will share a long road together. Learn to say no and when to say no, there are a lot of takers, so never let someone that makes you feel down to be in your life, even if you think you can hold it.\n\nI hope your journey lasts and accomplish your goals, this way of thinking is wonderful :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mq02sk/i_need_to_change_i_want_to_be_a_light_to_everyone/guew0di/"}
