When I was your age, I decided to volunteer for a local crisis center. This was one of the best things I have ever done for myself, not only bc it is a good feeling to be there for others who are hurting, but also because I had to go through an intensive 6 week training on how to manage the phone lines. The training included: how to be an active listener, how to look for and give out referrals, how to handle suicide calls, how to get immediate help to people in active, acute emergencies, and just in general how to not give advice but to reflect what others are saying and be a good listener and helper to them. This may be a good start to your path! Good luck and I look forward to hearing about your progress \ud83d\ude01\ud83e\udd70", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mq02sk/i_need_to_change_i_want_to_be_a_light_to_everyone/gudwt03/"}
