If you can listen and better yet, empathize, and just recognize the hardship they face, then it validates them and they're not alone or thinking they're being selfish or silly.\n\nI got something of a reputation on some Discord servers for being someone to listen and help others and it's amazing how far this little will go when you mean it. It's also amazing how many people with depression don't accept themselves and think they're just a burden, so if it's clear someone is on that wave, little affirmations of their value can really help even if they seem a bit redundant to state outright. I have a friend with actual paranoia and while I've known him for years it still helps to agree with an obvious good idea or let him know he's valued as a friend because he can never assume as much.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mq02sk/i_need_to_change_i_want_to_be_a_light_to_everyone/guhysmr/"}
