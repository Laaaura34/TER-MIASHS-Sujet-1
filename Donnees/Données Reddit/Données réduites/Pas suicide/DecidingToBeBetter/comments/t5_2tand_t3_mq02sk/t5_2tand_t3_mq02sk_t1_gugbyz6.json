My one big philosophy is that I always want to treat people with kindness. Now, the problem with being kind is that people will see it as weakness and therefore try and walk all over you. So along with being kind, you need to make sure you have firm boundaries. I also like to follow the \u2018tit for tat\u2019 protocol. I will always be nice to someone, but if they start being horrible? Well, I\u2019ll still be nice, but more cautious. I always give people multiple chances, but even then you quickly learn who doesn\u2019t deserve more chances. Cutting those toxic people out of your life will help immensely", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mq02sk/i_need_to_change_i_want_to_be_a_light_to_everyone/gugbyz6/"}
