But I want you to be careful that your self-worth isn\u2019t invested in the effect you have on other people.\n\nStart with yourself. Empower yourself. Make sure that you are in good health. Physical and mental. Fix up all the things in your life, and you\u2019ll realize you can help others do the same. You say you don\u2019t struggle, which is very fortunate. Take the opportunity to find your passion. You will be able to give the most through that. If you think it\u2019s helping others, then consider working on your communication skills. There\u2019s many directions you can take it. If you want people to feel heard, be a good listener.
