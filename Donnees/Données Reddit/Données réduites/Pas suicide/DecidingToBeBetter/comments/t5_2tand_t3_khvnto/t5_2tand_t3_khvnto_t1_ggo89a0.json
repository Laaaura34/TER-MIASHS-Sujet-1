I fell into the same traps.  I'm glad you're getting out of it, and I wish you well.  I also miss those who are no longer in my life quite dearly and understand, though I don't have a solution for you.  All I can tell you is that when you continue on the path you're currently referencing, life changes for the better.  The peace that comes with this decision is a big deal.  My greatest peace came from my pursuit of God through realization that I couldn't have screwed up worse and needed authority over my life, similarly to how you're turning to a therapist currently, though obviously there are some differences there too.\n\nIt's a long, lonely path, but it is one that comes with great peace as well.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/khvnto/i_was_an_objectifying_manipulative_person_i/ggo89a0/"}
