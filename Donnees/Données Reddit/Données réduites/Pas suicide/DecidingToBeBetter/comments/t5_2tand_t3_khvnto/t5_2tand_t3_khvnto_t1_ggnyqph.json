I agree, you\u2019re not a bad person, you\u2019ve just done bad things. You are worthy of love you just have to know the right way to do it. \n\nI\u2019m struggling so much with my separation because I can\u2019t fault my husband for being the way he is (he\u2019s had a traumatic life) I just can\u2019t let myself be broken because of it. \n\nI truly wish you the best and hope that you find love and peace in your life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/khvnto/i_was_an_objectifying_manipulative_person_i/ggnyqph/"}
