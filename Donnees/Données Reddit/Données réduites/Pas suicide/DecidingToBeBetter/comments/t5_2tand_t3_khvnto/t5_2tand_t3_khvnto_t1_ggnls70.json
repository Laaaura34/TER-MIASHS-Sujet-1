However, being reflective and having remorse and empathy are an important part towards making change.  Hold on to that. Perhaps making a plan for what you will do differently in the future might help. \n\nI actually broke up with my boyfriend because he was lying and initiating relationships with other women online (some other stuff too). I know he means well and he made some bad decisions repeatedly. He tells me that he will work towards change. However only time will tell. I\u2019m glad that you can understand your ex\u2019s choice to leave. It\u2019s a good time to work on you. \n\nGood luck to your journey into becoming better! You will be all the better for it if you can commit and follow through :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/khvnto/i_was_an_objectifying_manipulative_person_i/ggnls70/"}
