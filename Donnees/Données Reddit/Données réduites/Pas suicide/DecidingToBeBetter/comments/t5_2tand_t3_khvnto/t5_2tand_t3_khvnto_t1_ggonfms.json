I lost my supportive, happy, successful partner because I couldn't keep myself together and was acting out in strange ways.  \n\nNow it's been over a year since I've seen them and it has been immensely difficult.  The pandemic exacerbated everything because it made me be alone with myself for days and days.  \n\nI know it probably doesn't need much now, but you are making progress.  If you're staying in therapy, reflecting on your previously toxic behavior, and trying to be better in general then just know you are on the right path.\n\nSometimes, for me, I felt like I didn't deserve to be better.  For the first few weeks, I thought it would be better if I was hit by a car or died in some freak accident.\n\nIt's a long road, like you said, but you are walking down it and that's what matters most.\n\nGood luck friend.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/khvnto/i_was_an_objectifying_manipulative_person_i/ggonfms/"}
