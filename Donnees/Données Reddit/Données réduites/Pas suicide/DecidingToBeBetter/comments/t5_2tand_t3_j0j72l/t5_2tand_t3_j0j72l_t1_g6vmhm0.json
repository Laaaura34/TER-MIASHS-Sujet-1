You give power to what you believe in. Listening to new perspectives will give you tonne of help I advise looking up the YouTube channel after  skool.\n\nSolid post and I've followed many of the same steps. After Skool is an amazing channel and has so much insight that we usually ignore in our daily lives. The \"living in the present\" video really changed things around for me, and I've always believed the best thing about Reddit is obtaining various perspectives from people who are from all walks of life. The statement above that's bolded is especially true because as explained in one of the After Skool videos, we really do let our egos run rampant - often out of fear of being accepted for who we are. The thing is, at the end of the day you still have to come home and face your real self when you look in the mirror.\n\nEnjoyed reading this and OP's post.
