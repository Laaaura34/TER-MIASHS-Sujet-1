I\u2019ve also worked for local governments here and it\u2019s just hard working and living here.  I like the natural environment so much that I put up with the people and I call it sunshine tax.  I put up workers in town in my house and almost all of them leave frustrated with the lack of work ethic, low pay and asshole factor.  I\u2019m hoping that all the people who moved here recently who work remotely will help bring more intelligent voters, we need it.  Colorado will be lucky to have you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4uq1z/i_did_it_im_finally_leaving_florida/hg3gh9n/"}
