There are wonderful people here (not saying I'm one of them) but they are hard to find and most do not stay long.\n\nI live in a stupidly enchanting area/neighborhood now but grew up in abject poverty in fucking Largo. Hopefully you are not familiar with Largo. It was awful at the time but made me way more appreciative of * culture * when I dropped out of high school (yes told you I am really from Florida) and started leaving as often as I could. Almost all of my close friends live elsewhere but I'm a writer and tend to require more alone time than most so I love living here.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4uq1z/i_did_it_im_finally_leaving_florida/hg2kefz/"}
