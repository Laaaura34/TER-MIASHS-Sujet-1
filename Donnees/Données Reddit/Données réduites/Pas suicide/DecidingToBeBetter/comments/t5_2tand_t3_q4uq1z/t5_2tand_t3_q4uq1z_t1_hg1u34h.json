I lived in Denver but visited Golden often. You have access to hiking and mountain bike trails (south table, north table, lookout mtn, white ranch, clear creek, golden gate canyon [my favorite], and many more) close by, some you can get to by cycling. There's a cute downtown, a climbing gym, and a train that will put you in the middle of Denver. It's only about 25 minutes to central Denver via driving, however I've heard the traffic got worse. Not sure what you're interested in, but it's really easy to meet people, no matter what you're interested in.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4uq1z/i_did_it_im_finally_leaving_florida/hg1u34h/"}
