Just because people don't think the way you do, doesn't mean they don't love or care about you just as much.  We all have different ways of showing that we care.\n\nI have expressed these same feelings as you in the past.  I'm an extrovert in a group of introverts and it can be quite taxing being around people that don't prioritize things the way I do.   \n\nI voiced my concerns with them and they try their best to help look out for my feelings and needs.  However it's important for me to understand that it's unfair to try to change people to fit my mould. \n\nIn the end yes, go find new friends that can meet your needs.  However don't cast old ones aside without letting them know your feelings. \n\nI am rooting for your happiness!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oem6gn/i_deserve_better_friends/h48f33y/"}
