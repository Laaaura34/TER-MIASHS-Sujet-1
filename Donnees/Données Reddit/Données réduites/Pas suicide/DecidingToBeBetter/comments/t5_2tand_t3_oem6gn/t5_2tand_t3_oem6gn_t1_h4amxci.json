Realizing that you deserve better kinds of friends is such a huge step to take. It's one I wish I had done in my early 20s but thank goodness I eventually learned. My wife and I decided to get a divorce in February and I felt really alone. Since then, so many of my friends have reached out to give me support. It's made a world of difference. I think about how that all would have gone if I had just stuck with some of the terrible friends I had when I was younger and I shake my head. Selfish, thoughtless people just drain your time and energy.\n\nLife is short and you deserve to have good people there to share it with.
