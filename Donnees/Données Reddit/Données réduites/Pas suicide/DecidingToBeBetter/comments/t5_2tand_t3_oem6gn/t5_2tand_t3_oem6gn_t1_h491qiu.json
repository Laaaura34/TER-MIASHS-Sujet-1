Sometimes we see what we want to see. When I have my doubts about someone, I set them free. \nI studied with a friend for a licensing exam. I passed and he didn\u2019t. This was 2 years ago. For almost 18 months I helped him study. He kept failing and making excuses. The last time, he told me he was going to bring an extra cell phone and text me from the bathroom with questions during the exam. I said that I would not help him cheat. I told him after the exam that I didn\u2019t appreciate him telling me that and that I wished him well on his journey. Done. \nLooking back, I should have set stronger boundaries. He didn\u2019t respect me. \nWe deserve people in our lives that honor us. Lose the selfish ones. \nBe kind to yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oem6gn/i_deserve_better_friends/h491qiu/"}
