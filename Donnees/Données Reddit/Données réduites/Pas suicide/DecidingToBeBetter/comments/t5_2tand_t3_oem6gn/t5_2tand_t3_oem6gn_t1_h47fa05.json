I don't know the solution but I think it's just about putting yourself out there and investing in those people who start showing even the tiniest amount of effort that you appreciate it so they stick around.\n\nI talked to my therapist about it bothering me that I always create and plan my friends' hangouts and that no one ever invites me or makes the plans. I always wonder, if I stop, would they even reach out? She gave me a small bit of wisdom: your friends show up, don't they? They respond to your invite? Everyone has their piece in a friend group that they're good at, and not everyone is good at making plans. Being interested, showing up, and having a good time in itself is a skill. My friends are each unique and bring a part of themselves to my events that make them better - one of my friends loves games so he often brings our group a new game to try, one friend is really good at making quality conversation, and another is funny. No one else plans the events but I guess that's me. Hearing her say that to me that way helped me feel less bitter about it. I still want to find people who invite me out sometimes but I do appreciate what I have now more.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oem6gn/i_deserve_better_friends/h47fa05/"}
