Every day was a hard won battle.  \n\nThere are a thousand small steps that you can take to improve your happiness and contentment, here are some examples:\n\n* meditate\n* walk, just go for a walk\n* recognize every success, celebrate it, and keep celebrating it until you beat it with a better success in the same area.\n* Tell yourself \"It's going to be OK\", and believe it.\n* Wherever possible make the decision that's healthier, and work up to the tough ones.\n* keep up your introspection, but don't be hard on yourself unnecessarily.\n\nKeep talking, it will be the path to reducing your social anxiety.\n\nPlease post as you make progress or encounter challenges.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nxirao/please_help_me_help_myself_to_do_better_feedback/h1fsxm2/"}
