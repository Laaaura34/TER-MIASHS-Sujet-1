I have been thinking about things for years. My Dad used to say which is so cliche that there will always be a light at the end of the tunnel sometimes it\u2019s dim. I finally can see it. That cliche is my biggest pet peeve and now I realized my Dad was right.\n\nThings are going to become better. We\u2019re all going to get better we just have to put as much effort into it as we can and not just talk about it. \nI\u2019m not having a good moment or anything I just finally decided all the stuff I heard over the years about recovery and sobriety and anxiety I CAN DO IT.  Finally I believe I can get better like everyone say oh if I can you can.  \nI\u2019m going at this not too hard but enough to take one day off tomorrow and then from there it\u2019s time to live and ACT.
