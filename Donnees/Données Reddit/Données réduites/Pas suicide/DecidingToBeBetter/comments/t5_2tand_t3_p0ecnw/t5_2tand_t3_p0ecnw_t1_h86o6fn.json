All of them, except me, so they've always believed that by \"bashing me\" in some form or another, I would resolve myself to \"prove them wrong\".\n\nThat kind of reasoning just never worked for me. Ever. Even when I'm in a particularly good mood or even if I'm good at that one thing. \"Proving someone wrong\" has just never been my jam.\n\nOn the contrary, I find that the few times where I've succeeded in improving myself was when I was surrounded by people who nurtured my potential and strength, and tolerated or sought to improve my weaknesses. Just like on your example with your partner loving you for the things that you dislike about yourself, and that being a \"propeller\" in you being more motivated to improving yourself :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p0ecnw/be_supportive_of_people_dont_shame_them_into/h86o6fn/"}
