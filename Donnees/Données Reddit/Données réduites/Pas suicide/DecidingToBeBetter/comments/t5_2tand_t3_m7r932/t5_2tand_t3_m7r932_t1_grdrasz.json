First step for me was to be brutally honest with myself - I realized I was wasting tons of time and energy putting up with things that exhausted me or made me feel drained or shitty. Like, dealing with an inconsiderate \u201cfriend,\u201d not giving myself time to be alone and enjoy things I wanted to enjoy without limits, letting my time and energy be taken advantage of, being treated like a pawn at work by my employer and never communicating honestly. I had to deep dive and recognize, oh shit, these things are making me feel TERRIBLE. Once the identification hit, the journey became about how to reduce instances in which I felt small, unimportant, unheard, taken advantage of. The tough part is communicating these newfound needs. And guess what - those needs are aka boundaries. \nI\u2019m 28F and have seen/heard a lot of complaints about terms like \u2018boundaries\u2019 and \u2018abuse\u2019 and \u2018trauma\u2019 being thrown around, which could be true. Maybe though people are just getting in touch with those parts of themselves at varying rates. Idk. Main thing is, this all starts with you. What makes you feel good? What makes you feel bad? And what do you have the power to change about those things in your favor?\nHope this helps xo", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m7r932/how_to_set_boundaries/grdrasz/"}
