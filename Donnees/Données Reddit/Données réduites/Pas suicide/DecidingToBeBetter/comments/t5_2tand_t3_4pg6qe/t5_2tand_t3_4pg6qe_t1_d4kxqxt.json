Just block them and move on. For some that encourage you. Just spend less time with them. \n\nRecently, accepted that a friend of 10+ years will never drop the trash he hangs around and it's negatively influencing me. \n\nI came to that decision last year but gave them another shot. I didn't get much done. 1 month of avoiding them and everything is so much easier. Cut out TV, fapping, video games, junk food, drinking, weed, gossip. You name it. \n\nIt's all about making everything all this self improvement stuff easy. Make a schedule. Follow it.\n\nSolution get new friends that encourage the behavior. Because these old fucks will keep dragging you down if they can't keep up. \n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/4pg6qe/how_to_deal_with_complacent_friends/d4kxqxt/"}
