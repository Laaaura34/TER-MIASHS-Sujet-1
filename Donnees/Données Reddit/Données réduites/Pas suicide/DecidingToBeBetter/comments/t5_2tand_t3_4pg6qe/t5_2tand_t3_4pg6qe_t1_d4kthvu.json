Will it be a little awkward? Yes, definitely, they're not your usual hang! But if you keep hanging out with different people, who you want to be will inevitably come out because you'll be busy redefining yourself with every new social encounter.\n\nIf figuring out people to hang out with seems tough, I'd recommend a Meetup group. Eventually, you'll find other people to hang out with who will both 1. make you feel better and 2. be better people to hang out with.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/4pg6qe/how_to_deal_with_complacent_friends/d4kthvu/"}
