I applaud you for at least being aware. Everyone is so quick to call other people toxic and use people as scale goats. We\u2019re all flawed, some more than others. You\u2019re not toxic, you have toxic traits that can be worked on. Big difference.\n\nI\u2019m in a similar boat though. I get so jealous and I think everyone is out to get me.
