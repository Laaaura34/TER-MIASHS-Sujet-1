The inner struggle. Admitting to and understanding that you are the source of a problem is you honing and sharpening your weapons. It\u2019s also the toughest part. I too used to be a toxic person but what eventually helped me grow past my insecurities was actually quite simple. I would challenge you to \u201ccount your blessings\u201d. Do an inventory of the things in your life that you love and adore and then make an attempt to picture your life without them. Now instead and letting that thought drive you negatively, imagine what you would do to keep those things in your life. Remove your feelings of anguish from the equation. Only identify the positives and what they mean to you, truly.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be able to go living happy without my family. I know that. Because I know that, I am a much better husband, father and altogether, better person because instead of me constantly seeking approval and affection from them, I simply show them and remind them how much they mean to me as often as I can. Not just saying it, showing it.\n\nI really hope some of this helps. I know that struggle and know what type of place your heart goes to. Be kind, be thankful, be calm and never forget to count your blessings. In a world as cruel as ours, they are priceless treasures, never to be taken for granted.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfy8tr/i_realised_i_am_a_toxic_person/hbbgw5b/"}
