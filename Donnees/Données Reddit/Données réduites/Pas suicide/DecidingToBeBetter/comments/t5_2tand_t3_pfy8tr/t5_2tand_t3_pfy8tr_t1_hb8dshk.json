That's just what relationship is about, vulnerability and faith.He is your home here on Earth and you never get paranoid when you're in your house and the walls could collapse and expose you when you sleep. Just enjoy his company instead of making it into something to despair about, easy right? love is something that is winning to you completely but insecurity steals seconds and minutes from you each moment you're supposed to be enjoying or be at comfort with him. Be vulnerable knowing you're each others home here on Earth glued securely by love and let your strong emotion of love and faith towards him acts and speak for you instead of insecurity and other delusional stuff that's robbing you of seconds. After all, home is where you don't need to wear a mask and still be fully accepted and even desired and loved.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfy8tr/i_realised_i_am_a_toxic_person/hb8dshk/"}
