I was exactly like you, and I realized that perfectionism was a bitch to make me act toxic like that. \"I need to be perfect, because if I am perfect, my bf will always love me and want to be with me ALL the time\". Plus, I am a validation whore, I need to be validated all the time to feel good.   \n\n\nTook many years of therapy to understand that trying to be perfect just bothers everyone around, including me. And the validation aspect, I look for it in different ways now. If I get a simple \"good job\" at work, I focus on it. If I need someone to validate that I am beautiful, I ask a close friend to tell me something they like about me because I am in my needy days... this way, things get lighter and I am not hovering over my boyfriend 24/7 trying to make him happy at any cost and making him validate me for anything I do...", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfy8tr/i_realised_i_am_a_toxic_person/hb87t0i/"}
