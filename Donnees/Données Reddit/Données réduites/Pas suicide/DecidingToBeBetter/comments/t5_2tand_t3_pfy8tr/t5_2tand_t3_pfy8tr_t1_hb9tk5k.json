Likely lots of abuse and/abandonment starting at an early age. You began experiencing very negative thoughts about yourself and have never been able to foster truly healthy relationships with others because you don\u2019t actually like yourself and don\u2019t feel you deserve them. \n\nIf this sounds like your experience, look up Borderline Personality Disorder to help understand why you unintentionally sabotage relationships and push people away. \n\nThen find a therapist trained in Dialectical Behavioral Therapy to learn how to love yourself and be the emotionally stable person you really wish you could be. Emotionally stable people naturally attract healthy relationships. \n\nBottom line; You are a valuable person with a lot to give in this world. Dedicate some time to finding love and respect for yourself by placing blame of your traumas where they belong. But do so without anger. And you will naturally be less volatile, more patient, and less jealous.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfy8tr/i_realised_i_am_a_toxic_person/hb9tk5k/"}
