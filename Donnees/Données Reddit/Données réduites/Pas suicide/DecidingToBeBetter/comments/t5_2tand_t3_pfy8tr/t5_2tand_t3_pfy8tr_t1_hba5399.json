When I went to premarital coaching with my now husband our amazing therapist worked with us on our communication and how to understand and empathize with each other. It was SO helpful. We\u2019re still benefitting from that now. We had our different phases of attachment too. When I left Germany and moved to the US to be with my husband I became a bit more clingy in the beginning (cause I had no friends, no job, no hobbies there yet) and it triggered him to be more avoidant. So interesting how the dynamics can change. Now we\u2019re securely attached again and leave each other space. It sure was quite a bit of work to get there though. \n\nHere\u2019s a useful book list about the subject: \n\nhttps://bloomsoup.com/best-books-attachment-theory/\n\nI def also recommend couples therapy.
