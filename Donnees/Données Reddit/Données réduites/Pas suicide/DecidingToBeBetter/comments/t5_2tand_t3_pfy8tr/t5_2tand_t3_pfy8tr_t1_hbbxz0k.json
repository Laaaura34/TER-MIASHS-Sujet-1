It does seem to be attachment style and somewhat love language. My husband has some avoidant attachment and my ex did not. My ex was a lot more verbally reassuring as well. I felt totally secure but my ex did not and actually he was often feeling jealous and insecure. It was the only relationship in which I wasn't the one that was afraid of losing the other person.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfy8tr/i_realised_i_am_a_toxic_person/hbbxz0k/"}
