For example, if the boyfriend needs space, rather than trying to give him space while being in my normal environment, I will either go for a fun visit with distant friends for a few days or I'll take a full vacation just for me. I know one of them he was slightly envious, but if he wasn't a butthead I wouldn't have taken a week-long solo mountainbiking trip. \n\nIs there something besides your boyfriend that brings YOU joy? Don't worry if it makes him happy or not. The point is that if you make yourself happy, it will be contagous and will make him happy. \n\nIf there are other things you can do for just improving your own life, now is a good time to do them. Maybe add in more exercise, even if it's just walking. Or make yourself your favorite meal just for you. Meditation is another great thing that will help you improve your own good feelings separate from him.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfy8tr/i_realised_i_am_a_toxic_person/hb9lpxe/"}
