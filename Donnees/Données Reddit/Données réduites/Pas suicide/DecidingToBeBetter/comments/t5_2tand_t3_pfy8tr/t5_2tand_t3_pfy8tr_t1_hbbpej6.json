You want to change and learn how to avoid or manage  the negatives that are damaging your happiness and  may ultimately drive away your partner.  The second thing you need to do is to research options for professional medical help and guidance.  If you have friends who work within the local medical community, ask them to recommend several psychologists or psychiatrists.  Your friends will have learned over time which doctors tend to have the best results with their patients.  Within that group, find one that you feel comfortable with and whose personality and style are agreeable with your own.  You may have to schedule visits with several doctors to find one who is the correct fit for you.  Then work hard to make the necessary changes in your thinking and behavior that will in the end enhance your self esteem and create a happier life for you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfy8tr/i_realised_i_am_a_toxic_person/hbbpej6/"}
