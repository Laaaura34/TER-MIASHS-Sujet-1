Nobody is born toxic. There is something that triggered this for you to feel so insecure and in need to be loved. You are just showing a temporary behaviour towards yourself and your partner. You are in a process of learning how to love in a healthy way. The fact that you want to work on yourself and are aware of the consequences of your actions shows that you care and that you're also a loving person that needs to learn first what means to love. You're not toxic. You're under development :) And that's ok.\n\np.s. I felt like this and I see myself in your words. Therapy helped me a lot to go through this and what I did figure out is that, in my case, these behaviours were signs of insecure attachment (anxious attachment style) caused by the narcistic parenting, who didn't show me love in a healthy way. So I kinda feel that's you talking here as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: good news - this is something that you can work on and you can create happy, healthy relationships. So chin up! And please, be kind to yourself :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfy8tr/i_realised_i_am_a_toxic_person/hb8413i/"}
