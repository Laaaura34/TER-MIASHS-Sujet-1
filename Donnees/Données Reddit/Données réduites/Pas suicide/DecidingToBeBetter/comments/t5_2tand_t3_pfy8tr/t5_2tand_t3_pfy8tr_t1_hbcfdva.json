We did some premarital counseling, but not nearly enough and we definitely didn't go deep enough. Plus, I had a hard time articulating things like this - I tried to explain that I felt like my husband could be controlling at times, which worried me. But the therapist shot down every example I gave and said \"that is not controlling behavior.\" So I felt a little crazy lol. \n \nNow I know, it's his anxious attachment. He never tells me not to go out or see certain people, but he indirectly guilt trips me when I do. As I result, I turn down some invitations because it's just not worth the hassle - and then of course, I resent him because I turned down the invite just because I didn't want to deal with his response.
