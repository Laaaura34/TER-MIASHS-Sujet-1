I didn't realize until after something crappy happened to me. Now I take a moment to evaluate my situation. I respond how I think is rational. I accept it I'm wrong. I also choose to feel the pain of it all. I can turn off the feels for some reason - obviously something is wrong with me lol. But I now have decided to just go with it. It makes life hard and I've been going through it this entire year. Expressing myself here, therapy, and support groups have made it much easier to accept. I would like to think I am less toxic now. I wish you a peaceful route I life that helps you find your way through your toxicity.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfy8tr/i_realised_i_am_a_toxic_person/hb9dsgb/"}
