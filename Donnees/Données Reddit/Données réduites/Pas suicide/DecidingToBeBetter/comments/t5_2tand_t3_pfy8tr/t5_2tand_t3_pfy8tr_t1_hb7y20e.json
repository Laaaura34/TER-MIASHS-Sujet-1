I've been there myself. I used to have this idea that I somehow drew only toxic people to me, some kind of weird thing about me that attracts them. Maybe that may be the case, but if it is, it's because at times I was being toxic and self absorbed myself.   \nI have found that holding emotions in only has ever lead to them bubbling up and exploding out of me in anger. Could that perhaps be similar to you seeing anger as a defense mechanism ?  Sometimes things hurt because they matter, and if you never felt the negative, you couldn't appreciate the positives  as well. Too hallmark-y ? Maybe. \n\n In the past, I have also felt like you mentioned in the beginning of your post where you speak of being afraid of being left alone. I understand that completely, and I know I have pushed people away soley out of fear of rejection or abandonment.  It's easier to swallow if a parting or breakdown of a relationship was somehow \"your choice\". At least that's how it is for me.  The best thing I have found is to be mindful of your emotions and actions, and that you can monitor things before you \"bubble\" over. I have to regularly remind myself to view another persons perspective and why they may be acting  or reacting to me in a certain way.  \n\nSorry for so much word vomit. But on the plus side, now that you have recognized something about yourself, you can begin to address it and work on a more positive way forward.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfy8tr/i_realised_i_am_a_toxic_person/hb7y20e/"}
