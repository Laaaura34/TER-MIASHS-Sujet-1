You do things to please people and those people you're pleasing end up not being pleased. I fell into this trap. Hard. \n\nDo yourself a favor: try everything. Try some sports, try cooking, try writing, try reading, plan and execute small/moderate projects, try exercising. Find yourself by trying things you may not like. I found collecting and other hobbies that I tried started to generate my own taste. \n\nThere are large communities that revolve around everything. Find your tribe. \n\nAlso, don't sweat it. I know that sounds counter intuitive. Try not to pressure yourself, you're extremely young and have plenty of time to find yourself. Just be honest with yourself and things will fall into place.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qesw4v/im_turning_18_next_week_and_i_feel_like_ive/hhvc59t/"}
