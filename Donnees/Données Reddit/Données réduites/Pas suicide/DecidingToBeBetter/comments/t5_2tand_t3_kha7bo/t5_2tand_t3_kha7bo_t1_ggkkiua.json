No amount of compliments from your wife, looks from strangers, etc will ever be enough if you don\u2019t believe yourself to be of high \u201cphysical value\u201d. In fact, one of the telltale signs that you have high self-esteem is that you can look in the mirror and admire yourself, independent of what other people say or do.\n\nHow do you get there? Well it\u2019s not through summoning some will power or saying a mantra or looking at a situation differently. It\u2019s through putting in hard, tough work. I\u2019m sure you can think of something in your appearance or physical stature you would like to change that you can through exercise, diet and grooming. Throw everything you have it, not because other people will notice but because you owe yourself all of that and you deserve it :) \n\nLastly, sometimes you may be unable to do certain things because of your status in life. For example, It\u2019s very unlikely that I\u2019m going to win an Olympic gold medal in slalom skiing because I spent the first 20 something years of my life in a tropical country. That\u2019s fine by me. You might be feeling something similar but with respect to becoming older rather than upbringing. You can\u2019t change your past, and you can\u2019t control some uncontrollable things like nature or aging. And that\u2019s okay. Even given those constraints, there is so much life to be lived :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kha7bo/i_really_feel_as_if_i_have_dwindling_physical/ggkkiua/"}
