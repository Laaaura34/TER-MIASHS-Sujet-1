Very sound advice, it\u2019s freezing in Canada so no nature walks for me unless I\u2019m bundled up, no excuses though! \n\nI also just want to say I\u2019m pretty new to the Reddit community and this is the first time someone\u2019s actually taken out the time to reply to my post (if I recall correctly), so I\u2019m very thankful for your comment. All the very best with your Foundations course, if you ever have any questions related to studying Law - if you\u2019re coming down this path - give me a shout and I\u2019d be happy to help in any way I can.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a6cp7a/need_a_word_from_the_wise_from_any_lawyers_or_not/ebtu64y/"}
