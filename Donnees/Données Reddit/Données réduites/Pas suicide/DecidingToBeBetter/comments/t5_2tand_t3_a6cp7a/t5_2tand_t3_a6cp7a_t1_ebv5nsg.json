I too was more of a regulatory lawyer and advisor, with maybe 10% of my time in court. Nonetheless, I found a more outgoing personality very helpful for career advancement. I was never the life of the party, but networking and making connections with others in the profession, as well as your own partners, is important to advance as well as generate business. I\u2019m in the US, so it might be different where you are. I\u2019d say a happy medium is a good place to be - attend enough events outside of your comfort zone to make 1-2 new connections per event (don\u2019t feel like you have to \u201cwork\u201d the entire room), and those connections will build up over time. But definitely don\u2019t ignore the importance by shutting yourself in your shell. Even one-on-one personal lunches or dinners can help you build your \u201cnetwork.\u201d ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a6cp7a/need_a_word_from_the_wise_from_any_lawyers_or_not/ebv5nsg/"}
