What life change are you referring to? If we're talking about traveling, I think most people want to, but feel too connected, too rooted down in their day-to-day lives. They dont know how to unplug and take the leap. When I was released from custody and moved home, I didn't have any roots in place. Everyone had already moved on, out of state. I had no daily routine anymore. So it was easier for me to make the leap and travel. I had a small savings from living in a DOC halfway house and being forced to save, and solo traveling is surprisingly very cheap. I was living in Vietnam for a long time and my monthly expenses never exceeded $1,000 USD. That was rent in an apartment, motorbike, cell phone, gym, and eating out or ordering food for every meal, never cooking. It took a few months of searching, but I was able to find a remote job eventually to cover my expenses, and that same job has been exclusively paying my bills the last three years. It's never too late, and if you ever want to talk about traveling, or anything else, shoot me a message.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p4l62d/i_robbed_a_walgreens_pharmacy_with_a_knife_and/h91wi6v/"}
