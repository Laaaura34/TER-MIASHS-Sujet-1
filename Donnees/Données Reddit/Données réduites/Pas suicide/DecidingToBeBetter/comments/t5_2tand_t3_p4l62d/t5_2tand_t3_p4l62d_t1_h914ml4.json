I, myself, suffered from addiction for the good part of a decade. I got clean at 36, I\u2019m 41 now, my wish is always that I did it sooner but I truly feel I\u2019m right where I\u2019m supposed to be. I pray that you stay healthy & that a lot of young people can learn from your story. When I think about some of the crazy shit I did back then it\u2019s almost as if I\u2019m thinking about another person, like it wasn\u2019t me, yet it absolutely was. Keep your stories coming when you feel comfortable. There\u2019s a lot of strangers out here who support you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p4l62d/i_robbed_a_walgreens_pharmacy_with_a_knife_and/h914ml4/"}
