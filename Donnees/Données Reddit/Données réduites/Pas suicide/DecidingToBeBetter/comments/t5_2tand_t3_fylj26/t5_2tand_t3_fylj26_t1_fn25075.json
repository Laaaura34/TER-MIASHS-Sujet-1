I don't think I'm chasing a future emotion, and I cannot properly identify what emotion or sensation I would be running from. I have a really hard time putting my finger on it. \n\nBut some things I've experienced are telling me that it due to something I'm lacking and something I am running away from. For example:\n1) When I meditate deeply upon letting go of all the musts or in some meditations where I visualize a father/mother figure giving me support  so that I can relax I usually both feel a strong emotional surge and a bodily relief.\n2) When I feel sick (having a cold or similar) my mind usually pushes me to perform even harder. It's like something within is trying to avoid  the realization and sensation of not being able to perform at a high performance.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fylj26/how_do_you_find_the_balance_between_performing_at/fn25075/"}
