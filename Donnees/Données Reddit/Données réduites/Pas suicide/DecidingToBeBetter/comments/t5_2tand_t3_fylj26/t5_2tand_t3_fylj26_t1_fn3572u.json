Approach it from curiosity as if your brain is a computer and you want to take a look at the program it's running. The first step is find out what you're thinking. Our results (and our emotions) are always caused by our thoughts and our interpretation of the circumstances in our lives. Our opinion of our circumstances (what we make our circumstances mean about us and our lives) is what drives us to feel an emotion and we take action from that specific emotion that creates a set of results. We want to look at our thoughts to find out which thoughts are creating the results we don't want in our life. Holy coachy talk, I went a little rainman mode on this lol, let me know if any of this resonated with you. If not, I'll take another shot at it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fylj26/how_do_you_find_the_balance_between_performing_at/fn3572u/"}
