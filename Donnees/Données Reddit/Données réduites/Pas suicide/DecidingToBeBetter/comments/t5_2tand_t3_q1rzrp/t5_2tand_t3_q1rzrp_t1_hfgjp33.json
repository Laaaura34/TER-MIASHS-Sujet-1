I actually just did some udemy lecture right now lol. \n\nLet me tell you something from my experience with NoFap. I have once reached 90 days of no PMO, so maybe I know a little bit about it. There is actually one thing about NoFap which is scientifically proven, and that is the higher testosterone levels you get when abstaining for about 3-12 days or so (depending on the person on when this kicks in). I myself noticed this kick after about 7 days of NoFap or so. I felt more confident, women just looked way better on the streets, couldn't keep my eyes off of them, but was also more confident about it and wouldn't feel like an ugly looser next to them. \n\nBut after that there were no additional benefits. So only this boost of energy but then it fades away. Either I accostumed myself to that feeling or my testosterone levels went back to normal. I think it's a combination of both. \n\nI only USE NoFap for specific purposes. Will I have a date in 10 days? Ok I need to start NoFap ASAP. A exam in fee days? NoFap. Now I will go to an event on the weekend, I started today with NoFap because of it. Its a little bit late, but it still helps. \n\nAlso, I never thought I would get a gf, but I only did it with the horniness resulting from NoFap.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1rzrp/been_attempting_nofap_for_almost_a_year_now_but_i/hfgjp33/"}
