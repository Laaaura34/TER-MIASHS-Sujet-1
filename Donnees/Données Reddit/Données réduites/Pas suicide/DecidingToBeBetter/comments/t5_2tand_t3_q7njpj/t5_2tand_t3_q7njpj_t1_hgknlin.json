Break ups suck n u might think urs is a special kind of pain but it\u2019s not, you\u2019ll get over it give it time. One birthday a few years ago I was alone in another state working a job I hated in an environment completely foreign to me. My parents called me to say happy bday I think but other than that some texts from my siblings. I realized then that I am alone in this world n will die as such. Live for urself n work to become better always. In mind and body. Maybe crappy advice but it worked for me.
