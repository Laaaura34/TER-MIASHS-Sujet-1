Being dumped sucks but being cheated on is a bitch believe me, I\u2019ve been through it twice myself and it\u2019s not easy especially when you are dealing with feelings of regret and anger all at once. It can be mentally draining but I want to let you know things do get better. I was in a similar position last year and I was not myself for a long time until the people around me talked to me and made me realize this wasn\u2019t me and that I shouldn\u2019t let this define who I am. Believe me once you build yourself up again and get some confidence back even the slightest bit you\u2019ll feel better and show anyone including your ex if you have misfortune of seeing her afterwards that you can move on and keep your head held high. 21 is the first step into making yourself a better person. I hope the future is good to you my dude.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q7njpj/its_my_21st_birthday_today_my_girlfriend_of_5/hglcare/"}
