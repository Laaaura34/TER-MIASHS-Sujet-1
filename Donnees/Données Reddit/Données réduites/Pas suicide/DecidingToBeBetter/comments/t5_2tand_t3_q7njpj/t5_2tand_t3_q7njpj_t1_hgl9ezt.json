It\u2019s her loss that she lost someone like you! Happy birthday buddy! Forget others, just treat yourself. I take myself to the movies pretty often. Maybe get some popcorn and watch Netflix with some coke or Pepsi or whatever. Or if you don\u2019t like watching movies or shows, watch something else! I\u2019ll give you some Bollywood movie suggestions if you want (I\u2019m Indian lol) in case you feel like you wanna try something new. You\u2019ll get over her and find someone far better! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q7njpj/its_my_21st_birthday_today_my_girlfriend_of_5/hgl9ezt/"}
