So start your journey with a pat on the back because that's not easy, especially so soon afterward. \n\nThe one thing I'll say is that while there's no wrong way to build a life, there are easier and harder ones. Pursuing a degree and career while in a long term relationship would have meant negotiating things like the amount of time you can spend on school vs your relationship, narrowing your job search to regions compatible with your girlfriend, having to consider the compatibility of the benefits of the job with the needs of your relationship, etc. \n\nIn some cases that's worthwhile but in others it isn't and it can lead people down paths they never would have pursued if not necessitated by other choices they already made. You now have the benefit of being able to put yourself first in all of your decisions and that will only be a positive for you. Get to know your self, your values, your goals, and pursue your dreams and you won't have a problem finding someone who wants to share in that with you when you're ready", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q7njpj/its_my_21st_birthday_today_my_girlfriend_of_5/hgkxixo/"}
