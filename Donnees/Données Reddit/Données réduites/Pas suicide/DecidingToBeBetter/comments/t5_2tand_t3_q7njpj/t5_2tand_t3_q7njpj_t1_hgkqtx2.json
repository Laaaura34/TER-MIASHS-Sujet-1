We were supposed to go out but he never came. I hated my birthdays post the incident but its just a sweet memory now on how I convinced myself to go out alone and enjoy. \nYou have turned 21 and trust me the things you're going through will look a bit easy after a month or maybe a year or so. Right now its absolutely fine to feel they way you're feeling. This is a lesson for you to set your priorities from now. Its a new day a new chance. \nYou're brave \nEnjoy your birthday and a year later you will look back and realise how you are and will be your own support \nHappy Birthday :) Cheers!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q7njpj/its_my_21st_birthday_today_my_girlfriend_of_5/hgkqtx2/"}
