I'm not sure if this will help and I don't want to deflect your situation, but you are not alone. My ex had made me question his loyalty and broke it off but I decided to forgive him, only for him to break up with me 1.5 weeks before my 21st birthday. It was though and I had days when he was all I was thinking about, but one day I woke up and realized he hasn't crossed my mind in days. It'll get better as long as you take the time to process it. I don't have friends either so I understand how lonely this is. Feel free to contact me in case you want to talk to someone who went through similar stuff", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q7njpj/its_my_21st_birthday_today_my_girlfriend_of_5/hgmd1s7/"}
