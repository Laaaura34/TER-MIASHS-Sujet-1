Your finally an adult. Its great that you have a plan and a career because you have something to strive towards in life. The journey is just beginning and its can rough but remember your on the right track and time is on your side so stay the course. You also seem to have. A family that supports and motivates you to do better. The girlfriend thing is fucked up but Just put it behind you as a childhood memory and as time passes it won\u2019t be as vivid and hurtful. You\u2019ll get over it and find another girl. Its a new beginning for you", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q7njpj/its_my_21st_birthday_today_my_girlfriend_of_5/hgkf71u/"}
