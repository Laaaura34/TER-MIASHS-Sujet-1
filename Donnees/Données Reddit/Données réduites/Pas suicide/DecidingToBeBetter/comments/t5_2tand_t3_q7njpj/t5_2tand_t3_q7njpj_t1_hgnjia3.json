I'm inspired by your attitude toward everything and deciding to invest in yourself. \n\nAs cheesy as it sounds, I hope you focus on living your best life. I saw you're gifting yourself a gym membership. If you're motivated by it  there is a motivational buddies sub where you can partner up with someone for goals.\n\nWhatever you choose to pursue, rock on and congrats on giving yourself a gift of positivity and love. \ud83e\udd1f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc9b", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q7njpj/its_my_21st_birthday_today_my_girlfriend_of_5/hgnjia3/"}
