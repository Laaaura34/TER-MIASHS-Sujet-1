Regardless of the things you\u2019re going through, today is a special day for you and you should be happy for yourself for overcoming the obstacles you\u2019ve gone through. \n\nYou\u2019ve got your head screwed on and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to go on in life to be successful. Allow what happened with your ex to be a lesson learned and to move on swiftly with your life. Went through something similar and I am glad things worked out the way it did even tho at the time I didn\u2019t like it. \n\nHope you have an amazing day Bud, keep your head up high", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q7njpj/its_my_21st_birthday_today_my_girlfriend_of_5/hgnv9n8/"}
