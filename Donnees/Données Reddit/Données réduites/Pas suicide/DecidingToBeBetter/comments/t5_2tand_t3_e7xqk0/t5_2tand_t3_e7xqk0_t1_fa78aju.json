I think the relaxation you feel during it is a benefit. You don\u2019t always have to be doing something that \u201clevels you up\u201d, and when you think about it, spending time with yourself as you do something you love and relaxing (aka video games) is personal growth. Too much of anything is not good, but it doesn\u2019t seem to me like you\u2019re doing too much. Personally, I think you might be too strict on yourself. There are ways you can set healthy boundaries for yourself without completely getting rid of something you enjoy, like only gaming on weekends, only gaming every other day, only gaming for a certain amount of time, etc.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/e7xqk0/advice_needed_should_leisure_time_be_optimized/fa78aju/"}
