I can completely relate with your feelings.  Jealousy, the wall of numbness once you finally learn to deal with Jealousy... Completely understandable.\n\nKnow what immediately stand out to me about your story?  Your SO \\*asked\\* you how you feel.  She clearly cares.  She loves you enough to realize that this falls in that gray area where logic says it doesn't matter, but feelings say it does matter.  She loves you, and had the foresight to see this.  That's huge!\n\nIf you haven't already, tell her exactly what's going through your head.  \"The truth will set you free.\"  By asking you, she opened the conversation already.  Be honest.  Separate the logic from feelings.  She will understand.  That's how you can get over that sick feeling - by opening up and letting it all off your chest.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nrkve9/overcoming_jealousy/h0hmhew/"}
