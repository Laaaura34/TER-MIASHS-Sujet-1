Why don't you ask to work remotely and do your work from a cute coffee shop? Or from different places in Europe?\n\nI'd recommend not going to grad school until you have a solid plan.\n\nAnd I'd recommend quitting prostitution. It's just likely that it won't end well--either because someone becomes violent, because you get arrested, or because it affects your emotions in a way you don't expect. Just don't.\n\nOr, heck, just get another job.
