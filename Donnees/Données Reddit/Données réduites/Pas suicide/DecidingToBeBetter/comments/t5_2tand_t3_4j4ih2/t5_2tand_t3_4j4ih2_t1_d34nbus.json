You sound like a person who lives with a true joie de vivre. I like that.\n\nThank you for the concern about escorting. It has crossed my mind a few times about the danger but I have an amazing agency. She calls me in and out of my appointments to ensure all is well. I've only had one new guy. Everyone else was already vetted into her clientele. I have to pay her, obviously, but it takes SO much stress out of the situation.\n\nPlus, she has fabulous taste in guys.\n\nI was thinking of finding a part time job in the city so that I can continue to escort for the summer without worrying about being outed. After that I'd like to move to West Africa or London to study more. I'm just not sure if a gap, say a month or two, looks really bad on my resume.\n\nAgain, thank you for your post. You have a kick ass outlook on life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/4j4ih2/hate_my_job_escorting_on_the_side_so_i_can_move/d34nbus/"}
