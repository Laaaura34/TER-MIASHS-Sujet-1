Your brain will panic to fill that void.\n\nOften times it is replaced by other addictions (porn, eating, social media, gambling)\n\nMy advice is to consciously pick the distraction that will replace that habit.\n\nHere are some suggestions\n\n1. EXERCISE (in my opinion best way to distract the mind is by moving your body \"Dance, Run, Lift\" something physical) \n\n2. Reading / Writing\n\n3. Networking (it's best if you connect this with other hobbies) \n\n4. Cooking\n\n5. Meditation\n\n\nP. S. Put a \"time limit or a Goal\" when your staring out. Not having any of this will most certainly feel like torture.\n\nExample.\n1. 5 sets of X amount of weight\n2. Read 5 pages and write a page summary\n3. Laugh with a family/friend/stranger (either call them, or be with them)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pz1fml/im_done_abusing_my_brain_and_lungs_im_quitting/hey1oy6/"}
