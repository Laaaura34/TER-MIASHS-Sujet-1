(Trying to quit 5 times before that, always struggling with period pains, not getting shit done I wanted to, relying on my very sipportive husband etc.) But it has been 1.5years since I stopped smoking and I finally do not consider Cannabis to be a Necessity and or Problem in my life anymore. If you ever need to talk to someone who went through it feel free to message me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pz1fml/im_done_abusing_my_brain_and_lungs_im_quitting/hf28uic/"}
