It\u2019s a 2-3-2 schedule and it\u2019s night AND DAYS in the same week. I could literally only cover one or two classes a semester. That would take SO long. I\u2019d be reimbursed but no. If I keep it around 20 a year for loans/scholarships I\u2019d be ok given the fact the industry I want pays well. My girl is a worker though. I taught her the importance of that. She wants to be a pharmacist and has an Associates in the med field already and a pharmacy technician. So her needs will eventually be higher education. But right now the focus is me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qb0eue/is_quitting_my_job_to_attend_school_a_good_idea/hh7g3dg/"}
