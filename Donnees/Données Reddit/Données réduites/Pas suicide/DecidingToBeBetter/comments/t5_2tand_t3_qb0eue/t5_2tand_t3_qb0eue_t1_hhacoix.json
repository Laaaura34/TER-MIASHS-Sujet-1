But it goes: 24 hours in a day, 8 hours work, 8 hours of doing whatever the hell I want and 8 hours sleeping. I work for financial reward. I want to have that 8 hours of me time to be great, I want the drive to work and around town to be in a decent to nice car, and I want to spend my remaining 8 hours in a nice bed in a nice home. I follow the money. The dream is what I\u2019m doing outside of work. So following a lucrative career I may or may not like is only a small chunk of my life. The income will benefit me outside of that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qb0eue/is_quitting_my_job_to_attend_school_a_good_idea/hhacoix/"}
