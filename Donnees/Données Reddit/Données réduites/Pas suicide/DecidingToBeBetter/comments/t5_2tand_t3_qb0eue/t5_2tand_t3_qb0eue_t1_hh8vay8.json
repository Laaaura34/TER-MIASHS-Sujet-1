Generally accreditation demonstrates program quality\u2014 and that can matter down the road. Like in my field, some jobs actually post that they will only consider graduates from accredited programs. Hopefully your nearby college is accredited but if not, it may be worth looking at other options. Just a thought!!\n\nAlso, your local workforce development office/career center could potentially have some resources - like my county does something unique called an income share agreement. Or they might have straight up grants to help you. Have you looked at the FAFSA yet, or read up on tips to maximize your application to get a Pell Grant? And your college should have dedicated staff or even a whole department to help you as a prospective student navigate financial aid and scholarships\u2014- i.e a Center for Student Financial Aid & Scholarships. \n\nGood luck OP! This is so exciting!! I hope you will post updates \u2014-Sending good vibes your way!! \u2728\u2728", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qb0eue/is_quitting_my_job_to_attend_school_a_good_idea/hh8vay8/"}
