Look into loans and if there is enough left over after paying tuition to live off of. If everything works out it sounds like you could pay off the loan relatively quickly once you start working so max out the government loans and then consider private loans for the rest. Definitely research the repayment terms for private loans because some companies are awful. If you're in the US, the Pell Grant is a big benefit if you qualify. I also wouldn't discount comparing different colleges and their tuition costs or if you can take certain classes elsewhere for less and then transfer the credits, each program has different requirements. \n\nI don't think there's a wrong approach as long you make a realistic plan and stick with it. I'd make some backup plans too like what if your gf loses her job and you're counting on that financial support. Is she done with school or also looking to go back?
