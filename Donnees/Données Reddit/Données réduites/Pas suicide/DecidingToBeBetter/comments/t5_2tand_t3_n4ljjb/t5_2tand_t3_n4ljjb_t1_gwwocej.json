It\u2019s difficult to to even fathom it. But today we are wanting to do better, and if we don\u2019t feel this tomorrow, we have to remind ourselves that we did today so we need to keep pushing. \n\nThis is a journey but the reality is, is that you\u2019ve already made a lot of progress you just don\u2019t acknowledge it, everyday that you get up, that you open the window for some light, that you brush your teeth, those are all big wins. You\u2019ve had to climb mountains to accomplish those small things so don\u2019t discredit the journey it took you. \n\nThe incident that caused your brain injury will have some physical implications to your health but you can fight back by filling up your brain with good thoughts, focus on reading books that will motivate or uplift you. I just read Becoming a Self Empowered Being, by Siim land and The subtle art of not giving a fuck by Mark Manson. Might not be 100% what you need right now but they\u2019re good starts if you need a recommendation.\n\nAny who just want to say again that I\u2019m proud of you, and if you ever lose this feeling just remember that you did feel it once, and if you choose to look for it you\u2019ll find it again", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n4ljjb/after_drowning_in_depression_ptsd_and_addiction/gwwocej/"}
