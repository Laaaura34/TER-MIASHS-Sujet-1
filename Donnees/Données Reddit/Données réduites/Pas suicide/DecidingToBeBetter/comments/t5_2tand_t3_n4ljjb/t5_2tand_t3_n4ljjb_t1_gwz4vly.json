We were trained to do cognitive rehab and help relearn skills and develop adaptive techniques for memory loss and other TBI issues. I also worked with Vocational Rehabilitation at the same job and they would\nhave me work with their clients who had TBI but did not qualify for the particular program. \n\nI would encourage you to contact your state Brain Injury association and/or Voc rehab and see what kind of help you might be able to receive to move past this. It\u2019s not easy but it\u2019s still so possible. Thank you for telling your story.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n4ljjb/after_drowning_in_depression_ptsd_and_addiction/gwz4vly/"}
