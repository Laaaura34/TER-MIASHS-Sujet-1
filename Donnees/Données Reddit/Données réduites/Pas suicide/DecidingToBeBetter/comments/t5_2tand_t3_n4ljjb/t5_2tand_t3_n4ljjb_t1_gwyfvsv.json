Ive been in that position, staring up at a seemingly insurmountable mountain of things you have to deal with to finally get better. And you just have to start. One thing at a time, slowly making forward progress. I had a very similar epiphany recently regarding feeling like i was finally \u201cwaking up\u201d; that it was time to stop sleeping through my life and letting it slip through my fingers; spending all day coping with the pain and trying to distract myself rather than focusing on facing things and actually making them better. I actually had the line \u201ci\u2019m wide awake\u201d tattooed on my a few weeks ago, and i try to look at it to remind myself. Sending love and hope to you, because you should know that you WILL get through this, there\u2019s no other option", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n4ljjb/after_drowning_in_depression_ptsd_and_addiction/gwyfvsv/"}
