I can relate on only some part, like seeing someone be destroyed by addiction and being there for someone mentally ill, or fighting with oneself to get better or to have goals and purpose or to fight depression and possibly PTSD. \n\nI wanted to say that I m proud of you that you lived trough that, that I understand on the part that I can  relate to and I feel compassion and that I m proud for you to share your story! I can not share my story because there is so much secret I kept from a lot of people I met (I know I dont need to tell everything to every people I met with), even here anonymous, I can not share my story. That I can not say it could come from the fact that I had to hide my feeling and my thoughts because I was mocked for some of them (but I trust some people now). But I would share it one day maybe. And I have shared a lot with my therapist, so that count for something.\n\nanyway, I would sleep better knowing I m not the only one struggling or that I have struggled a lot. thank you for that, might we all find peace.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n4ljjb/after_drowning_in_depression_ptsd_and_addiction/gx0cu9l/"}
