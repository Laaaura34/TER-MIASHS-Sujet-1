I love the phrase you picked. My best friend and I are actually getting matching tattoos next week that are going to be somewhat similar, at least in principle -- it'll be the words \"I lived\" going on my inner wrist, so that I can always look down at it to remind myself of all the things I've managed to survive throughout my life (especially over the last six years). My friend's idea, not mine. But I think it could be a good way to reflect on the fact that I'm still here, in spite of everything, because sometimes I feel like it wasn't enough. But in addition to the shit-show that has been these last six years, the phrase \"I lived\" is also meant to be in reference to the trauma of my mom's mental illness during my adolescence, my aunts' suicides, my own PTSD, depression, and panic disorder, the alcoholism I briefly battled when I was younger, and my god-awful luck whenever I traveled (which...got worse, I guess).\n\n With the things I've lived through over the last six years, including some violent and terrifying situations, serious injuries, years spent paralyzed by depression, buried by an addiction that could have easily killed me at any time...reminding myself that \"I lived\" definitely feels more meaningful. Probably sounds a lil' dumb, but I really didn't think I'd ever live through this; I didn't think I'd live through my assault, didn't think I'd live through my addiction, didn't think I'd live through the depression. So being able to reflect on the fact that I got through it just makes it easier to believe that I can keep pushing forward.\n\nAnyway, love and hope to you, too! You may be a random stranger, btw, but your comment still means a great deal to me. Feeling like I've done something meaningful and that I'm making progress certainly helps keep me motivated, so I really appreciate your encouragement!
