Its a tough job but all in all I enjoy working with young people.  I sometimes feel balancing the job and life outside work is walking a knife's edge.  I give a large portion of my positive energy to my students and work to maintain optimism in the face of what often seem like impossible tasks.  I used to be inspired by their triumphs and energy and now I'm just not.  I can't say if its just typical teacher burnout or maybe I'm just comfortable.\n\nI suppose I'll go finish installing some drip irrigation.  At least the flower I planted will get a fighting chance if I do! =)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3697li/how_do_i_get_my_spark_back/crc2czn/"}
