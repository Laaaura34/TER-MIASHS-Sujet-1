I started walking to the bottom and walking back. \n\nNext I\u2019d walk up to the first street light and back. \n\nOne day when I was at the top I went down the other side knowing I\u2019d have to climb it again to get home. \n\nIt just kept growing from there. \n\nMy longest long day so far was 18 miles a week and a half ago. \n\nThis week my long is 20 miles. \n\nThen I taper down for 2 1/2 weeks. \n\nOct 27 I\u2019m doing a virtual marathon. Walking. \n\nI\u2019m doing it on the Vegas strip because there is bathrooms, access to beverages and food, places to rest, tons of people so it\u2019s generally safe, and if the weather gets rainy I can easily continue on mostly indoors. \n\nAfterwards I\u2019m going to start jogging and then  running. My dream for decades has been to run the valley of fire marathon. \n\nI also have Walters wiggles at angels landing in Zion National park on my todo list for the next yearish.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pzre78/in_less_than_4_years_i_went_from_a_guy_unable_to/hf4cano/"}
