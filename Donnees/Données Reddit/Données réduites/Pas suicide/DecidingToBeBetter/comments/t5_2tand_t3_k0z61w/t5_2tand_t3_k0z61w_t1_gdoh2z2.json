While I wouldn't withhold a check mark if I wasn't fully focused during drawing (unless I actively procrastinated), what makes me feel satisfied or not with the session is how focused I was. If I wanted to get some specific result and felt like I didn't follow through without hitting that then pretty much every session would leave me feeling dissapointed.\n\nJust need to trust that if you put in the time and focus the results will come, and if you don't trust that then you might want to put some time on improving your process, but I would think of that as something completely separate to improve from the time spent and managing your attention.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k0z61w/update_i_posted_my_commitment_to_be_better_2/gdoh2z2/"}
