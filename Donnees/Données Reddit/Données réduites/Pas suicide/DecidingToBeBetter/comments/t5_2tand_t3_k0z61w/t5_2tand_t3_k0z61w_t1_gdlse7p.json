Keep working on making yourself better and you'll find your way, but also understand that healing is not all measurable. \n\nI, too, lost a partner right around 7 years around now. And you sound a lot like me, pushing through it with vigor and aimed at meeting goals. That helps a lot. But you are more than your accomplishments too, and I hope you are healing, both through this process and by allowing downtime and being open to true healing.\n\nIt's a tough process. Much love.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k0z61w/update_i_posted_my_commitment_to_be_better_2/gdlse7p/"}
