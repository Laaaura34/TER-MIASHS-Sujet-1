Many of them are completely binary. The ones that do have some wiggle room (like working out), I always count it as long as I did actually work out.\n\nI guess I could start stretching the definition of a work out and end up just doing 1 push up, but then I'm also just cheating my own system. But some days I'll do work outs that are more like a 30 minute light work out as opposed to a 1.5 hour intense work out and it still counts. I think its more important to build the habit than it is to make the most of every single work out.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k0z61w/update_i_posted_my_commitment_to_be_better_2/gdoc97b/"}
