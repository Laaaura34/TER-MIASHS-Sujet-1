A couple of my closest friends are people I've either dated, slept with, or nearly slept with and its now a purely platonic relationship. \n\n\n\nAnd I'll end with my favourite bit of advice I gave myself, it's only weird if you make it weird, irrelevant of whether the other person feels awkward, you behaving normally as if you were just friends will almost immediately cut through any awkwardness. But I hope it all works out for you", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkjdrg/finally_successfully_asked_someone_out_out_on_a/gnlcm5u/"}
