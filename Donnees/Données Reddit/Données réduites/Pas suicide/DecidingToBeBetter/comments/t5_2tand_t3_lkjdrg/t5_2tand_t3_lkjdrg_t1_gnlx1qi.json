I sincerely hope it works out for you. I don\u2019t want to break your heart because you mustered up so much energ to do it but whatever you do, don\u2019t expect anything out of this person. When I was younger, I\u2019d build up fantasies about being with my crush and marrying her, and then when it didn\u2019t work out, I was crushed. The dating world is kind of weird and the truth is it\u2019s awkward and no one knows what the hell they\u2019re doing. Keep an open mind and keep talking to a bunch of girls until you spark a connection. Having options keeps you sane and allows you to get over someone much faster", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkjdrg/finally_successfully_asked_someone_out_out_on_a/gnlx1qi/"}
