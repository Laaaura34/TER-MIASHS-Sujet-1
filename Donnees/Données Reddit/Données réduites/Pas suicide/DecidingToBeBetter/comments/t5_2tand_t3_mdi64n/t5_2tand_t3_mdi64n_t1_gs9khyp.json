It\u2019s called the 5 minute rule. Usually the most daunting part of anything is starting. Set a timer, and commit to 5 minutes of undistracted work on it. Usually by the time the 5 minutes is over you\u2019ll realize it\u2019s not so bad and your momentum will keep you going. If not, 5 minutes at a time is better than 0. Just keep resetting the timer here and there\n\nAs for number 2, an anecdote that helped me. Your thoughts are like cars on a highway, and you\u2019re on the side of the road. Cars are always gonna go by, but you don\u2019t have to get into any of them if you don\u2019t want to. Everyone has intrusive thoughts, the trick is to work at not entertaining them. Easier said than done, sure. But practice makes perfect. \n\nTake progress a step at a time. It snowballs.
