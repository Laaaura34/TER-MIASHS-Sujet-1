I just recently (before covid) had a falling out with a group of friends. I had done some things that were really shitty of me (making out with people in the group and having a depressed attitude). They decided the best option of letting me go was one that I had said about another group member bringing his gf around. I said \"why don't we just create a group chat without him in it and only invite him explicitly.\" They then decided to go this route with me and my end of the group chat grew dead silent. They then decided un invite me from our friends giving the weekend I was making pie for it. I litterally got the  shit text saying I was \"unacceptable\" and boom that was it. I had tried to keep in contact, but all 10 of them cut me off. Now looking back I realise a lot of my behavior was from mental illness. I got diagnosed with bipolar1 3 months after the break up. This has helped me see the reasoning behind my actions and my acting out. I was in mania when I met them and things were good. Then came the depressed side of things and I started to act out. I'm still upset about how things ended  and want to do everything in my power to make it up to them, but I do realize that they have made a choice to not hear from me and I need to respect their boundaries. I still cringe when I look back at past me and the choices I made, but having a diagnosis has helped me come to terms with it. In addition to seeing a therapist try seeing a psychiatrist too. I hope this helps. Thank you for sharing your story. It made me feel less alone.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/owqdjd/i_was_a_horrible_toxic_person_when_i_was_around/h7iobtc/"}
