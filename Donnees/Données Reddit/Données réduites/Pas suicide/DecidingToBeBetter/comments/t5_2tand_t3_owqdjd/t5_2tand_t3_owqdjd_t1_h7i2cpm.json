I'm currently having very similar troubles trying to forgive myself and not being overwhelmed with the guilt/regret of who I used to be just a couple of years ago. I wish you well on trying to get through this.\n\nI think the other people commenting are right, it's a positive sign of growth, however difficult the journey can be. We are a continued work in progress, in so much of society today we only see the final piece, the finished product, but it's important to remember there are countless steps leading up to that picture of \"perfection\". Which frankly, no one is perfect so as long as we learn from mistakes and do our best to survive I think everything will be okay.\n\nAs for forgiving yourself, still not figured that out, so still open to suggestions?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/owqdjd/i_was_a_horrible_toxic_person_when_i_was_around/h7i2cpm/"}
