I think that\u2019s why my HS bff went cold turkey. I slowly processed over time. I remember the first day i couldn\u2019t get up and it\u2019s all i thought about every mean, unnecessary remark, or action i did. It\u2019s not something i\u2019m proud of, it\u2019s best i took myself out of that situation to be alone and focus on me . because it helped me reflect how it was impacting my college friends. that reflection time helped me grow closer with my college friends, there\u2019s always room for improvement but what\u2019s more important is being consistent with that improvement. action is always more solid than words. i would like to go to therapy for it to work on my anxiety and traumas such as above but i\u2019m american and lack access to health stuff lol.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/owqdjd/i_was_a_horrible_toxic_person_when_i_was_around/h7ifey6/"}
