Sometimes when my mind runs away about that stuff I try to ground through the present moment. Focusing on colors and concrete objects, like the shiny green petal or the blue sky. Then, if I go away from the present, I try to harness my energy towards imagining beautiful futures. Keep focusing on who you are, and ground through what feels right. Don\u2019t let that energy or your past pull you back, or take more energy from you than it already has. I know the feeling of wishing others could see how far you\u2019ve come, or wishing you could make amends and explain how you\u2019re different now. Sometimes you get that chance and sometimes you don\u2019t. That discomfort will be there. But you can heal and find comfort knowing that you have the agency to change and bring yourself to a good place \ud83d\udc9b", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/owqdjd/i_was_a_horrible_toxic_person_when_i_was_around/h7hpak6/"}
