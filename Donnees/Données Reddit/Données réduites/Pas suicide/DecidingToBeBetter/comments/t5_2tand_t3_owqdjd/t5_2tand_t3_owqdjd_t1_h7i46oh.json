I've done far more bad than good between the ages of 14-20. I'm still severely haunted by the things I've done. I have good days and I have days where the \"flashbacks\" torment me to the point of being \"stuck.\" I have night terrors, and panic attacks. I used to take daily medications, but they don't seem to work for me. I physically shake my head side to side to \"shake\" out the vivid pictures and memories in my head sometimes...However...I have found that it happens less and less as the years go by.. There are good days/weeks and there's bad days/weeks. You're not alone. You just keep pushing on, and keep trying to make the right choices. It sounds like you've come a long way. I'm proud of you.
