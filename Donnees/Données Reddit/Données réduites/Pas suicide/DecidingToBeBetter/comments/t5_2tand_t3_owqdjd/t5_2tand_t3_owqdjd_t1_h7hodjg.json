It sounds like you've seen the error of your ways.  It sounds like a redemption story.  So, all of your bad memories, they were your lessons.

As long as you do that, it wasn't \"some dickhead doing something really awful,\" it was \"someone learning and growing and becoming a better person.\"  And yeah it takes time to internalize that.  But it's true.  You cannot have a redemption story without some real fuckup situations happening first.  But, everyone loves a redemption story, right?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/owqdjd/i_was_a_horrible_toxic_person_when_i_was_around/h7hodjg/"}
