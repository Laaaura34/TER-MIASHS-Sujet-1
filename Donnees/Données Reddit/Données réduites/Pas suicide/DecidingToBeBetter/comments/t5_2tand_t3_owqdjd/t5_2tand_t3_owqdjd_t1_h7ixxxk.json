I'm 24, and wish I could have done much differently too. I never could stand for my own needs and desires, so I, especially from 14-17 or so, really did regretful things. Fights and shouting matches over things that just seem like bullshit anymore. \n\nI'm getting better. Trying to stand on my own and look out for myself in a positive manner. A bad breakup a few months ago threw me back to adolescence and I've been aiming to be seriously better since. I realized I was a very hurting person and others wouldn't fix me. I have to fix myself. \n\nThe bullying and harassment resonates with me too. I fell into a group of people that were not good for me. When I had a falling out with them (they got too involved in my breakup, among other things), they made it a goal to isolate and abuse. They stalk me.  I had to change my number, and I still can't escape all of it. My hobbies, interests, and values are just fodder for them to use. Very toxic.  \n\nThe parallels are a bit unnerving for me. Even if not direct parallels. Don't hurt too much falling back into the mindset. Life is traumatic when dealing with people like this. Its a defense mechanism to not be trusting and to isolate. You will be better again one day.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/owqdjd/i_was_a_horrible_toxic_person_when_i_was_around/h7ixxxk/"}
