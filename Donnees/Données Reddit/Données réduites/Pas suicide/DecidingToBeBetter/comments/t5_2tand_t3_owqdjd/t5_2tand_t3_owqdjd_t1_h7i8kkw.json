That is so crazy! I will go to bed with plenty of hours to ensure I get a good night's sleep and I wake up just wrecked. It's like my subconscious wants me to obsess over my wrongdoings. I fall asleep with them looping and often even wake up with them being the first thought that crosses my mind. I call them flare ups. They will come and go, but they do get less severe and less frequent as time goes on. I wish I could help more, but it sounds like we're both stuck dealing with it. I did read a saying(on reddit of course) that I have been trying to remember when I'm having these flashbacks. (Excuse the butchering of the saying) They said that whenever they have cringy memories come up..They think to themselves something along the lines of: \"I am so glad I learned from that experience/mistake, it helped me become the better person I am today.\" I know it sounds SUPER corny, but I have tried it a few times and it does make me feel better even if it is just for a few seconds. The things from our past help to shape who we are today and while living with our past selves is difficult and dreary..We could very much still make those bad choices and be that same person we hate, had we not learned our lessons the hard way in the past.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/owqdjd/i_was_a_horrible_toxic_person_when_i_was_around/h7i8kkw/"}
