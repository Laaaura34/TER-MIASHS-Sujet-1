It's a little hard right now to think about where I'll be in five years. I'm trying to just focus on my day-to-day, and it's difficult when you miss someone so much, but time will keep moving forward with or without me, so, I'm just gonna try my best to keep up. Thanks for sharing. I really appreciate it, and I'm sorry that we have the losses of our moms in common. It's really a terribly painful thing to go through. Much love to you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o91gjm/i_managed_to_lose_20_pounds_in_12_weeks_ive_been/h3cy30d/"}
