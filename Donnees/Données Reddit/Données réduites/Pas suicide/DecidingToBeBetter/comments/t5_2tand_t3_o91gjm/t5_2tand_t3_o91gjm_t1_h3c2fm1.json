Depending on how you track weight you may \u201cobserve\u201d more or less drastic loss. Your looking for consistency. Don\u2019t look to the side to see how other people are doing. Be mindful because you are both exercising and dieting that you may be putting on muscle mass while losing fat. You should still be dropping in weight but it may seem slower then someone strictly dieting because muscle has more mass then fat.\n\nIf you have trouble telling what is healthy weight considering you are exercising and dieting  you should see a doctor 2-4 times a year. If your not excessively worried about the pace of weight loss this is probably unnecessary. \n\nSome people, especially women, have a tendency to vary  wildly with water weight. I, not a women, also dealt with this. If helped greatly to take my weight multiple times a day so I could understand how eating, drinking, shutting, pissing, affected things. Some people do not vary that much thru a day and done people do. Make sure you understand your body and consider it\u2019s natural variances.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o91gjm/i_managed_to_lose_20_pounds_in_12_weeks_ive_been/h3c2fm1/"}
