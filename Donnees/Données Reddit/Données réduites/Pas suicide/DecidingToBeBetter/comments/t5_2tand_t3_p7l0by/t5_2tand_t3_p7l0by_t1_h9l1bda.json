When you complete a task, a little win, you get dopamine, you feel good and accomplished. You need to build up this dopamine tank with little wins without too much time in between. Time depletes your dopamine tank. You will build momentum and form a habit of productivity with a lot of little wins and, of course, big wins which are harder to achieve, but usually more important. With a completed depleted dopamine tank, you need to start with little tasks and build up to more important ones. Make sure any task is actually needed though. Fooling yourself with tasks that are not needed or have close to little impact will not cause you to feel accomplished.

Then, I schedule them in a timeblock on my custom calendar. I use the app Amazing Marvin. If I need additional structure, I use the Pomodoro method which eliminates distractions and challenges you to work, but also rewards you with breaks. \n\nRegarding moving to another country, I\u2019m not sure because I don\u2019t know what country your in and your financial situation, but, generally, you should move if there isn\u2019t professional opportunity where you are and/or social opportunities because maybe the people aren\u2019t generally likeminded or the local culture is not to your liking.\n\nAbout the loneliness, finding an online accountability partner from Reddit could help at least temporarily until you think of a way to find real friends.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p7l0by/i_want_to_be_a_better_person_but_i_feel_lethargic/h9l1bda/"}
