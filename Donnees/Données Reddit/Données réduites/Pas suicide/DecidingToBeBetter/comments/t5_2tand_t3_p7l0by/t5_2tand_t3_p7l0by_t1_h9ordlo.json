Check how much suffering would you avoid if you start taking care for yourself, and ask yourself, how better would my life be if I get rid of the unnecessary suffering? How much misery can I wipe out from my life if I do the right thing? this is facing your life, which by the way, it is NOT EASY, but rewarding if we grow the balls to face it right on.\n\nYou said you have no friends, what about your family? I do not know the specifics, but if you are somewhat distant from them, try to keep in touch with them more often, I went abroad as well, just like you for a master, and while it was difficult sometimes to talk to my family, it was always a relief. \n\nAlso, do not overwhelm yourself with that many things, if you want to see big changes in your life, you have to start with small changes. You cannot expect big changes overnight, all starts with little steps. What is the most urgent priority? The master? the language? or the piano? start making little changes to your top priority and add up from there. \n\nHope it helps, keep it strong.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p7l0by/i_want_to_be_a_better_person_but_i_feel_lethargic/h9ordlo/"}
