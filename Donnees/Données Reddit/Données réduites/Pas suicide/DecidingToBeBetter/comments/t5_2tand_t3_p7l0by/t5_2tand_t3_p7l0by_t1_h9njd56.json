You'd be surprised at removing certain foods or atleast being conscious about your choices will change the way you feel. \n\nMake sure you're getting quality sleep. No devices an hour before bed, check for snoring, changing out shitty mattress.\n\nExercise can tough. If this is a trouble area, set a 2 min timer and do whatever exercise you want. At the end of that timer, you're done for the day. You can go even simpler and just try one rep of whatever exercise is not intolerable. One push up, a couple of seconds in plank, a yogic stretch, simple standing up tall - whatever your body needs to get started.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p7l0by/i_want_to_be_a_better_person_but_i_feel_lethargic/h9njd56/"}
