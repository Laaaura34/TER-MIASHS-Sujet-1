You\u2019re putting too much pressure on yourself. There\u2019s a lighthearted book called \u201cthe subtle art of not giving a fuck\u201d. I took parts from it that helped me recognise my behaviours and beliefs and values, this may be helpful to you in terms of growing as a person. What are your values and why are they your values. To dig a little deeper and find those answers will help. Every little task you complete will help you feel accomplished. If you\u2019re doing too many things at once, you will feel like you aren\u2019t accomplishing anything. Write a list, take a deep breath and do something one at a time. Try and enjoy your own company too. It\u2019s easy being alone but it\u2019s hard being lonely. Reach out if you want to :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p7l0by/i_want_to_be_a_better_person_but_i_feel_lethargic/h9l9hap/"}
