I\u2019ve also been there in a foreign country. It helped me a lot to have an accountability partner in Reddit and also I found one on LinkedIn. Try to get yourself involved in groups using eventbrite. They have one near you. I recommend those because it\u2019s more related to a hobby or your studies or even to exercise with someone. Try to exercise too. I remember I was very tired but I started exercising(just say to yourself you will give it a try for 5 min) and boom you will feel better as you created more dopamine. Don\u2019t forget to have a walk and disconnect from social media. You will feel more recharge once you unplug yourself. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p7l0by/i_want_to_be_a_better_person_but_i_feel_lethargic/h9mleen/"}
