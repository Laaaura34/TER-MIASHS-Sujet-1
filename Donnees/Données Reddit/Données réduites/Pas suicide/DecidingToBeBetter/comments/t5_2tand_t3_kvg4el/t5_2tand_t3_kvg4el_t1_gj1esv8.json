Yet, we are sexual beings and that sexuality takes over once the videos rolling and you start going at it. Extremely hard to stop in the midst of it.\n\nI hope you manage to leave porn behind you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kvg4el/after_almost_4_years_of_being_addicted_to/gj1esv8/"}
