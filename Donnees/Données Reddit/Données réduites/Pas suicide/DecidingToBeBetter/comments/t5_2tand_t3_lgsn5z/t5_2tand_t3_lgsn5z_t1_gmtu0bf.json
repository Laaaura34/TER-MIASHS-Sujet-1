Love, give and forgive. Everyone deserves love and attention. Everyone deserves help when in need. Why not give help, be kind, be friendly. It is free. It is so easy to help someone else with something so small. Give a complement or say thank you or say hi. That won\u2019t cost you anything but still almost no one takes the effort to do it. \n\nThanks for your message.
