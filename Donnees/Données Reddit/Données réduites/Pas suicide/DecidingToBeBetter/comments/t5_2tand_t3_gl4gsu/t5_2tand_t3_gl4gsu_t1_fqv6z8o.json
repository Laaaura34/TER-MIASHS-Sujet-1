Its impossible to not feel a bit shaken up when you realize other people have achieved certain things, but at the same time, there has and never will ever be again, another you.

If you can\u2019t accept your self-worth as being enough when you compare it to others, just look at it like this, are you trying hard like they are? Are you facing challenges and dealing with things like they are? Yes, you almost certainly are. They may be rocket scientists and you may be a janitor, but if the thing that you both have in common is that you are working hard to do your best, then in everyone\u2019s eyes, y\u2019all are equally worthy of respect.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gl4gsu/i_need_some_other_way_to_deal_with_jealousy_and/fqv6z8o/"}
