You're still very young.\n\nI had severe PTSD at your age. My father beat me and emotionally abused me. I didn't do anything in my youth except hide and flunk out of high school.  I spent most of my 20's trying to reprogram myself to have social skills.  I'm amazed I still had friends because I was so angry all the time.\n\nOnce I hit my 30's I finally had things figured out for the most part. I worked out every day, I had a good, steady job.   Ended up getting married, but then I lost my job, got divorced and lost everything.  I had to start all over again, but it was ok!  That shit was a cakewalk compared to when I was a kid.   I have a nice house now and a loving girlfriend, and make a comfortable living in my late 40's.  \n\nTrust me when I say you have plenty of time to make things right for yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qelpzg/i_am_22_and_wasted_much_of_my_youth_what_should_i/hhvnnv4/"}
