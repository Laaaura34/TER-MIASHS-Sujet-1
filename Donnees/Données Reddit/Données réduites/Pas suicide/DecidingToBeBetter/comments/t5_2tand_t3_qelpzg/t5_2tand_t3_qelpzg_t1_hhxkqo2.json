Congratulations! My best advice, as someone who has multiple mental illnesses and has experienced trauma, is this: find a therapist. Find a therapist you can trust (in time) and focus on putting everything you can into healing. As for university, I\u2019d suggest setting that aside until you are in a better place. At that point, you will be able to approach the appropriate person at the university and demonstrate that you\u2019ve put work into bettering your circumstances and healing. This was a huge asset to me, when deciding to return to college. Kudos to you for making this first step!
