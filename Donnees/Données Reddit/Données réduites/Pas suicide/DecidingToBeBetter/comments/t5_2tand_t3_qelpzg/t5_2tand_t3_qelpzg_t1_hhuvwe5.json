Change can take weeks, months, or years and can be disappointing when you don\u2019t immediatly notice it. This book does a good job at emphasizing how the process of change is the most important part rather then the results. One of my favorite quotes is \u201cyou should be concerned about your trajectory more then your destination\u201d.  In any aspect of your life (health, money, relationships) by just improving 1% everyday can make a huge difference over time. Again I really reccomend the book as it\u2019s had a lot of the answers I\u2019ve been looking for and good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qelpzg/i_am_22_and_wasted_much_of_my_youth_what_should_i/hhuvwe5/"}
