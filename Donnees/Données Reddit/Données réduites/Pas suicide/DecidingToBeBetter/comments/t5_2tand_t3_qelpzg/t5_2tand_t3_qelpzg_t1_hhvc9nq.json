I had a similar transition into young adulthood and ended up homeless and in and out of rehabs for years. I didn\u2019t get it together until I was 26. I\u2019m 30 now with a bachelors degree and in my first semester of grad school and I am so happy. All to say, when it\u2019s time, it\u2019s time and you have so much to gain now. I just went all in and made me who I wanted to be but couldn\u2019t because of trauma responses and poor coping mechanisms. Look at how you deal with stress and make it a positive change!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qelpzg/i_am_22_and_wasted_much_of_my_youth_what_should_i/hhvc9nq/"}
