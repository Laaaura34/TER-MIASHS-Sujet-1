Walls/ego/fear/attachment are struggles I ignored or distracted myself from. \nNow I feel like I'm playing catch-up and struggle to identify past traumas and behavior as it's been a part of my life for so long.\n\nAs a guitar player myself, I couldn't recommend this more. It really carried me through some hard times with my divorce and relationships. I used to say you can't think about anything else trying to learn a song, and I needed that.\nI have also found some help in meds, meditation, journaling and becoming fairly regular at the gym.\n\nI'm sorry about your mom, I honestly can't imagine. I was close with a girl who lost her mom unexpectedly while we were together and that was one of the hardest experiences of my life and watching her carry on I find incredible, difficult and brave.\n\nI think it shows a lot to ask for help, even online.\nIt sounds like you feel like something isn't working for you and you want to change it.\n\nKeep that, and you will.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qelpzg/i_am_22_and_wasted_much_of_my_youth_what_should_i/hhwfdqh/"}
