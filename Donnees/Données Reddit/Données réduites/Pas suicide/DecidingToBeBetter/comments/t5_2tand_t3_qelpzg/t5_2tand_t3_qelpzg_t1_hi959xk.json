I\u2019ve been under the weather. \nI just applied and attached a letter explaining about my physical and mental health, how I\u2019d worked hard with my medical team and therapists, and that I was eager to return to school. I offered to provide documentation from my psychiatrist and/or doctor. I wasn\u2019t asked to produce them, though. I basically sold the school on accepting me. I had amazing grades in high school, and I think that helped.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qelpzg/i_am_22_and_wasted_much_of_my_youth_what_should_i/hi959xk/"}
