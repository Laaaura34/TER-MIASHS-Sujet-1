All of these terrible experiences have the capacity to inform you, transform you, make you wiser and more empathetic to people who suffer as you have. Failure is incredibly valuable.\n\nI\u2019d highly recommend the work of Jordan Peterson. It really helped me, and millions of others, out of similar circumstances. His work is less about conforming to a premade system of rules and values, and more about developing self knowledge as to what your innate values are, and how to utilize your talents in the world toward your own goals. I also found that conforming to a system (in my case, Zen monasticism) was incredibly beneficial in breaking away from the momentum of my habits, healing from my trauma, and cultivating discipline. I have also found psychedelics to be a very useful tool for breaking habits and honestly examining my own soul. If you\u2019d like, I can point you to some resources.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qelpzg/i_am_22_and_wasted_much_of_my_youth_what_should_i/hhvz0ff/"}
