I think the couple of pieces of advice I can give you are: 1) Don't expect your life to change overnight. You have to work hard at changing so when you inevitably slip up with the meditation, healthy eating, etc. don't get discouraged; when you don't immediately see an improvement and it feels like more effort than gain for weeks on end don't get discouraged. 2) It's very good to have role models, it's something I think I'm missing, but take care not to allow yourself comparison -- I spent and still spend too much time looking at successful people and what they'd achieved by my age and always feel worse off for it.\n\nI don't know what soul searching is either, I'm almost convinced it's a word people use to describe arsing about. I like to think the true meaning of it is just to try new things as much as possible and keep very fresh perspectives.\n\nAnyway reading the hope in your story has been very inspiring and I think I'm gonna go clean up my trash heap neckbeard nest now too!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qelpzg/i_am_22_and_wasted_much_of_my_youth_what_should_i/hhuum5e/"}
