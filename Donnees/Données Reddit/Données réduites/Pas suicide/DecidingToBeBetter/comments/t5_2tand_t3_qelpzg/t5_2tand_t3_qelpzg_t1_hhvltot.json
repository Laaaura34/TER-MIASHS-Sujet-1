Feel the breath enter your nose and follow that breath from your nose till the bottom of your lungs then all the way out on exhale. If you notice a thought enter your mind, acknowledge it but don\u2019t think on it. Return to focussing on your breath. Keep going on it. Your thoughts are neither good nor bad. Try it for 5-10mins. A lot on here are saying they are going for an hour plus. To me that\u2019s pretty wild. Start slow. Focus on your breath. That\u2019s it. \n\nA good app is soothing pods, it\u2019s free and a lot of guided meditations. \n\nIf you have any questions don\u2019t be shy to ask or message.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qelpzg/i_am_22_and_wasted_much_of_my_youth_what_should_i/hhvltot/"}
