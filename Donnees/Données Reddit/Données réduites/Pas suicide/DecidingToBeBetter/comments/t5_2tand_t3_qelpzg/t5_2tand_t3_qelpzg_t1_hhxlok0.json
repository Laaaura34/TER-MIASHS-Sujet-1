Sounds like you know exactly what to do - my only advice is break down all these great things you want to do with your day/week/year/life and really focus on 1 or 2 at a time. Find a way to invest in a healthy routine and balance and be happy to spend your life working on integrating these things into your life and making your every day life a work of art.. where you have time and energy to both help yourself and be available to others and the spontaneity of life .. be prepared to have new/constructive habits or things to do/learn that will replace your cravings and bad days/moments etc\u2026 don\u2019t beat yourself up and get sleep, give yourself a break when you\u2019re not feeling it \u2026", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qelpzg/i_am_22_and_wasted_much_of_my_youth_what_should_i/hhxlok0/"}
