I hope in time you can forgive yourself for \"wasting\" your youth. You were doing your best to cope with traumatizing experiences, and younger you didn't have a ton of tools in the toolbox to process those experiences. Your progress will be held back by any blame, shame or self-loathing for the years \"wasted.\" \n\nDo what you can to not compare yourself to others and their stage in life, but compare yourself to where you were yesterday and see how much progress you've made. \n\nAlso if you get withdrawal symptoms from alcohol you may need inpatient medical detox. \n\nAnd if/when you're able, trauma therapy is the tits. You might need to build a strong, stable base of skills from standard therapy first, but it'll help unlock you from the shackles of the past.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qelpzg/i_am_22_and_wasted_much_of_my_youth_what_should_i/hhvvn89/"}
