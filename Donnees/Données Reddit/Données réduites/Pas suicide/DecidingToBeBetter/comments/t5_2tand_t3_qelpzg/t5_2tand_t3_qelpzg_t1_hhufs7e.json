I will give you the plan to deal with depression and anxiety and live the life you want.\n\nWrite down four main goals for 2022. Just 4, not more. Than write down where you are NOW.\n\nExample: By the end of 2022 I want to be 80 kg / 175 lbs at 13% bodyfat.\n\nRight now I weight at 95 kg / 210 lbs at 20% bodyfat.\n\nI want you to think about four goals you want to reach. Than write it down.\n\nThan research how you can get from where you are now to how you will get there.\n\nExample: i am going to drink a gallon of water a day, have a diet based on my meal plan and sleep 8 hours a night (I will sleep from 22.30pm to 6.30am). I will go for a walk 45 minutes a day and I will do a excercise on Youtube with a personal trainer. Make a habit to do these things daily. \n\nFor building habits I use the HabitNow app.\n\nAlso, you will feel a lot better when you start the 75 Hard Program by Andy Frisella (it is free). Listen to his 50 minute podcast about the program: 14. #75HARD: A Tactical Guide To Winning The War With Yourself. The Program template you can find on his Instagram Highlight.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions. But most importantly: write everything down that is on your mind, than write down 4 goals, write down where you are now per goal, make a plan and execute daily.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qelpzg/i_am_22_and_wasted_much_of_my_youth_what_should_i/hhufs7e/"}
