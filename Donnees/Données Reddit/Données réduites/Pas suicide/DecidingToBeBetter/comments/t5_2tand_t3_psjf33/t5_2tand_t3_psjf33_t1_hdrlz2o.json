But, since \"working on myself,\" a little meditation, some mindfulness and a lot of kindness towards myself my mental condition has improved tremendously over the past few years. One thing I've been doing for some time now is waking up (~05:00) and taking a quick cold shower followed by some Zazen meditation, before my morning cup of coffee or tea. It was a bit of a shock in the beginning, but now I look forward to it. \n\nThere's a famous commencement speech by Admiral William H. McRaven\u00a0titled \"Make Your Bed.\" He later wrote a book titled the same, the Audio version is on YouTube. We might not all be former Navy Seals, but his message is universal, your entire day and your mood starts the minute you wake up (and get out of bed). It's worth a look in to. \n\nFor me, I treat every bath/shower, meal, meditation period, etc. as a Puja. A \"simi\" religious ceremony, for me taking a nice cold shower is a form of honoring my mind and body. I'm not suggesting cold showers Per se, but I think it's beneficial to view these acts as honoring ones self rather than a chore. It's all about perception and intent.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/psjf33/its_interesting_how_a_simple_thing_like_taking_a/hdrlz2o/"}
