Which led to the psychotropic substances?\n\nAt any rate, could you put yourself into a regular routine where you're doing something you like, preferably in person? I know COVID can making things rough. But if there's a trivia night at a pub, or a kickball league, or even like a cheaper university class for something fun-- painting, pottery, photography, dance, exercise/sport/swim/bowling?/etc? Somewhere where you could build a rapport of people outside of work?\n\nJust a thought. And I really appreciated everyone else's comments on here, too.\n\nI'm proud of you for trying to make change to help yourself. I had to go off of antidepressants my parents put me on at 14 when I was 18. Therapy helped so much, because I still had a lot of deep-seated issues from the family system I had to (and still!) work on.\n\nI want you to know I'm rooting for you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q862su/how_to_let_go_of_regret/hgowq96/"}
