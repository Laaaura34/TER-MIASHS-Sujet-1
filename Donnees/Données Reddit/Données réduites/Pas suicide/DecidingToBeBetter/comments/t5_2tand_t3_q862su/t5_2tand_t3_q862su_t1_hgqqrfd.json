What a fantastic community you have with you. \n\nIt may be helpful to understand that we all make the best choices we can in the moment. As you get older and learn things such as coping skills, interpersonal skills, life skills, etc. we look back and analyze all the decisions we made through a rose colored lens. If you knew at 18 what you know now, you could have potentially acted differently. But my friend, you did not, and that\u2019s ok. Your younger self did the best it could with the tools it had.\n\nAs you continue to grow you will develop a stronger sense of self, more skills, and more perspective. \n\nIf you change the story in your head from regret to gratitude you may find that the journey of growth speeds up considerably.  You\u2019ll get off the treadmill of regret (which gets you absolutely nowhere) and onto the path you want to see yourself on. Best of luck and be well.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q862su/how_to_let_go_of_regret/hgqqrfd/"}
