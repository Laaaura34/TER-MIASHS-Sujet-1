It sounds like you're trying your best and you describe yourself as a handsome white tall man, what's not to like? lol I think you mean to say you dont want to sound conceited tho cynical is an appropriate term as well. I'm overweight 5'7\" non white and on the older side, I'm in a broken relationship and I have no problem meeting women and befriending them at all. It's even a problem when come on to me and I'm not available for a relationship. Why is that? The funny part is that I do see and hear they would want a white tall man such as yourself...puzzling. Maybe you need to move? \\*shrugs\\* I dont know you but based on that list of hobbies maybe you're coming across as too aggressive? just scraping for answer here. Thanks for sharing I appreciate knowing your experience", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q862su/how_to_let_go_of_regret/hgqc6rz/"}
