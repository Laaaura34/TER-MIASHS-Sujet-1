Part of why I broke up with an ex was because she had a problem like this and it put a serious strain on our relationship. She was very jealous and insecure and took it out on me by yelling and being mean. At least you\u2019ve started therapy which is very good! You also seem to understand that you have to get out of this mindset which is very positive. Try to build your confidence and remember that he chose to be with you (and stay with you) because you are you.\n\nLove yourself!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcagpu/i_cant_stop_thinking_about_my_boyfriends_ex/hai132y/"}
