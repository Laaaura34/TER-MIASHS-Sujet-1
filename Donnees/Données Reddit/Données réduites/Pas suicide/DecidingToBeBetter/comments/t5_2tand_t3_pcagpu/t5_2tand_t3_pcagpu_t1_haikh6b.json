Basically, you need to employ your willpower and don't check on her. It will make you feel bad, but looking her up is making you also feel bad, as you can read in your own post. You need to deal with those feelings of not checking. If you think about her, try to cut yourself off and think of something else. A good way to go about this is to start trying to focus on yourself. Because all of this time that you are spending on her in your mind, is time you could have been spending on yourself. You need to put yourself first. Start taking care of yourself, start doing things you like, things you have to to improve yourself. With all of these things, baby steps and if you keep it up you will change your behavior. Eventually you will think about her less and less until she isn't on your mind at all some days, weeks, months.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcagpu/i_cant_stop_thinking_about_my_boyfriends_ex/haikh6b/"}
