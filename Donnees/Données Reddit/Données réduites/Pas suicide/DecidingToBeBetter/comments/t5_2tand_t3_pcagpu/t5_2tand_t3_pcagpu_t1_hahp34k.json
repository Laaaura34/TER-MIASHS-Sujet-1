I\u2019ve also made sure not to follow any socials with heavily edited images, I never read beauty magazines, and I avoid commercials like it\u2019s my job, so there\u2019s little for me to see and get butthurt about. \n\nYour ex sounds like a douche canoe and I\u2019m v happy he\u2019s in your past and not in your right now cause you deserve better!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcagpu/i_cant_stop_thinking_about_my_boyfriends_ex/hahp34k/"}
