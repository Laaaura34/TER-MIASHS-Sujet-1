But no matter how hard I tried, she couldn't stop tearing herself down in comparison to someone else I'd known and had been attracted to.  In the end, I believe she had Borderline Personality Disorder and couldn't stop seeing this other person as a threat. We wound up breaking up about a year later, and that was one of the major reasons. I really hope she got help for herself before it was too late.  OP is getting some good advice from people in this thread, and it does sound like it's time to get some professional help to solve this problem.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcagpu/i_cant_stop_thinking_about_my_boyfriends_ex/haivuqk/"}
