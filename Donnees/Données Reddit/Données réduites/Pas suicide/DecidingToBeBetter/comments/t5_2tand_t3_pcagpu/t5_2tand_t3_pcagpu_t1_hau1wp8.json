I haven't really thought about the fact that it might have to do with how I have been treated before. I know that my self esteem always have been rocky, but in combination with how my last relationship was it might have been affected more than I thought. As you mentioned, my brain/body might want to protect me so this relationship won't end up the same. \n\nIt's also hard to not compare myself to others, as it's something I've always done. I will try to find the smaller things that I can't compare to someone else. Thank you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcagpu/i_cant_stop_thinking_about_my_boyfriends_ex/hau1wp8/"}
