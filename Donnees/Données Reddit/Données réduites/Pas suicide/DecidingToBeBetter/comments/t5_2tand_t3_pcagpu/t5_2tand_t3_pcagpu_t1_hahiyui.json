You have to take action. \n\nYour inventing problems in your head and it is going to affect the future of your relationship.\n\nWhat a bummer it would be if all of this led to the dismantling of your coupling, and never had to in the first place.\n\nNo one is doing anything 'wrong' here. No one needs to reassure you of everything, you just need to take control and have the discipline to block these visual distractions and understand that you are more than enough.\n\nGood luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcagpu/i_cant_stop_thinking_about_my_boyfriends_ex/hahiyui/"}
