If you have no backup plan you'll give your arm and a leg (figuratively, of course) to reach it. I you do have a backup, a soft place to land on, you'll always have the excuse, that it's OK enough. The problem is, that to really follow your passion, you'll eventually have to let go of that soft place and hope you don't fall. A few years back, a friend of my sent me an article titled something like going from 7 to 10. The point it made is that to get to 10 from 7, you'll have to go through 4 or maybe even lower. But people are afraid of going lower. \"What if I never get back up to 7?\" I've been like this for the last 2 years. I have an OK job, that pays an OK sum of money. I can certainly survive on my own. But just surviving was killing me. I'm slowly trying to follow my passion now and have set 2 goals when I'm going to leave my job and leave the soft landing behind. Of course both of these are monetary, because we still live in a world ruled by the amount in your bank account. The position I want to put myself is so that I'm not already crippled when I start. I'm now already viewing it as a sacrifice I'm making for my passion. I'm already on my way down from that 7.\n\nAnyway, I really hope you're passion works out.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/22a4ff/this_mans_words_shoot_like_bullets_of_truth_hard/cglbxcc/"}
