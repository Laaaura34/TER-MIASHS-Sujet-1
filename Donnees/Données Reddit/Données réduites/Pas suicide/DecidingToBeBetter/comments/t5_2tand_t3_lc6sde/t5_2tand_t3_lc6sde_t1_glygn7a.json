Write down each of the values you wish that you were exhibiting when you think about these historical event where you didn\u2019t live up to your standards for yourself.\n\nFor example. When you talk about wishing that you had taken career advise from your dad; why is that?  What is the value system you want to practice that would have allowed you to make that different choice back when you had the opportunity.\n\nOnce you understand your values,   Write a daily journal entry about the actions you took that day that were reflective of your values.\n\nThe purpose or this is to remind yourself until it is a habit and regularly thereafter that your actions are a product of your values.\n\nIf you can articulate your values but your actions aren\u2019t matching up with them, then you are lying to yourself.  Which at least you\u2019ll know after going through this exercise.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lc6sde/how_can_i_stop_allowing_past_mistakes_and_regrets/glygn7a/"}
