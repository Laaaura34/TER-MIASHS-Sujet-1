And happy birthday!! \ud83c\udf82\n\nAs for advice, I would say be honest and apologize when you make a mistake. People respect you when they see you struggle and still go back out there, and your daughter is no different. Perseverance is a wonderful lesson, and I promise she will love you all the more knowing how much effort you put into building a life you can be happy in. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kc6dxd/today_121220_i_have_2_years_clean_my_daughter/gfpwzk2/"}
