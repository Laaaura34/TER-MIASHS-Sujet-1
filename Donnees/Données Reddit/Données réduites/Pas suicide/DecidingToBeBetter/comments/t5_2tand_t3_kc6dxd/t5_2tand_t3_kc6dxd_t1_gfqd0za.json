Something from CBT would be good.\n\nThe last thing you want is for one really bad day to push you towards relapse because that's the only stress relief you know. It doesn't hurt to be open and honest with the people in your life about what's stressing you out either. Communication helps. \n\nAnd don't be afraid to distance yourself from bad influences that don't respect your sobriety, even if you love them and enjoy their company. They won't be living your life for you, so don't let them ruin it. You can set hard rules like \"If we hang out, it'll only be in public places where you can't get high.\" Don't be afraid to walk away if they continue to push you into making bad decisions. People who really care about you as a person will try to respect your wishes, even if they don't understand or agree 100%.\n\nAll that said, be proud. You've made a huge change and are putting your family ahead of your desire to use substances. That is critically important, and very difficult for some. You sound like you will make a great parent.
