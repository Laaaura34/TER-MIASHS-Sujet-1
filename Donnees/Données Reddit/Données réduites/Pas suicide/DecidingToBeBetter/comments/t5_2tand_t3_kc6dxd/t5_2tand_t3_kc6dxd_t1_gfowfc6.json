You\u2019re awesome! As someone who is a parent who has never battled addiction, I offer you this: parenting is SO HARD and you will never be perfect. I make mistakes and say/do things I shouldn\u2019t all the time, but all I can do is follow up, apologize, and have conversations with my now teenager. Don\u2019t ever feel like you\u2019re a failure because of your past- we\u2019re all failures as parents and the best we can do is the best we can do.\n\nI hope that read as positive overall - I feel like it\u2019s reading a little sarcastic and judgmental, but that is not how it was intended. You really are awesome and none of us are perfect parents. \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kc6dxd/today_121220_i_have_2_years_clean_my_daughter/gfowfc6/"}
