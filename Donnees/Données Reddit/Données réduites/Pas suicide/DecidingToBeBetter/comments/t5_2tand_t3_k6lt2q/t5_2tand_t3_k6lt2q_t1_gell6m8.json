This will help some with the loneliness. Cuz you're never actually alone. There's thousands of voices, opinions, personalities, people(and I do mean actual people you know) in your head. You just have to remember to talk to them. They're always there. \n\nAs for social media: how about don't bring your phone with you everywhere you go. That way you're forced to experience it. And then BAM! Now you have a story to tell rather than a question, \"did you see my post!?\" Cuz looking at a picture is great and all but hearing how someone else saw the sunset over the mountains, \"oh it was beautiful. An ocean of color washed the mountains in oranges & and yellows, and just a splash of purple as the the sun kissed the mountains goodnight.\" Is so much more interesting. Humans love a great story, everyone forgets that having a camera in their pocket everywhere they go. \n\nMaybe start a writing journal instead of a picture journal(the gram). Maybe still find all the cool things you see. But actually see them, sketch them, paint them, draw/color them (sidenote: these can all be done in a meditative state as well :) win-win) then next time you're telling someone how pretty this flower you can say, \"I was so inspired by its beauty I had to X\" then bust out the painting/drawing/etc. Abstinence is the best cure for social media addiction.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k6lt2q/how_can_i_learn_to_not_want_to_share_every_cool/gell6m8/"}
