This will help some with the loneliness.\n   \nI am my own best friend. Im naturally an introvert so I've always learned to be comfortable being alone and content with hanging out with myself. The loneliness mostly is a newer thing because I lost my job and broke off a relationship with some of my family. I guess I am trying to fill that void with instagram attention seeking. When I was socializing at work everyday, I didnt feel the need to post as much.\n\n\n>As for social media: how about don't bring your phone with you everywhere you go. \n\nI like to keep my phone on me in case of emergencies. I'd be more interested in some sort of app that limits your use.\n\n\n> That way you're forced to experience it. And then BAM! Now you have a story to tell rather than a question, \"did you see my post!?\" \n   \nI agree with this 100% and will try to apply it to my life.\n   \n>Maybe start a writing journal instead of a picture journal(the gram). Maybe still find all the cool things you see. But actually see them, sketch them, paint them, draw/color them.\n\nThis is good advice. I do actually write a ton every single day in my notes. I also try to create at least one thing every day whether that be drawing, writing jokes, making videos,\nfree-wriring, etc. Some of this content is the content I share on IG. That stuff I don't mind sharing, its the things I don't create that make feel shitty when I constantly want to share them.
