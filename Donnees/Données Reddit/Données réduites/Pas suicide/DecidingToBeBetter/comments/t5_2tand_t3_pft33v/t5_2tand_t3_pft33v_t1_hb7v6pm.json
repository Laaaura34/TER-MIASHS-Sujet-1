My one piece of advice for therapy is, not every therapist \"clicks\" with every patient and not every method resonates with everyone. So keep an open mind, open heart and be honest. Being honest means being honest with yourself and really working on things you probably don't want to work with, but honestly also means that after a good amount of effort if something or someone isn't working for you, let them know. I changed therapist dozens of times over 40+ years and only had two that really resonated with me. The others weren't \"bad\" they just didn't hit so deeply.\n\nSo, keep your chin up, your thoughts light and your expectations focused on Yourself. At the end of the day You are the only one that can really help You to be the best You.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pft33v/no_such_thing_as_good_nor_bad/hb7v6pm/"}
