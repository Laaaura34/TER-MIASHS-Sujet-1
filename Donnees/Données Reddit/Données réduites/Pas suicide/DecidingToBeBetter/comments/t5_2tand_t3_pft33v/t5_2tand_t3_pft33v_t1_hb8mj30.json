I was my own biggest problem. I would try to lie and manipulate situations and people just to prove that I was \"right.\" It wasn't until I had about 40 years of trying to keep that up until I got tired enough to give in and let it all go. My ego was my worst enemy and I fought to defend it at all costs. These days I hardly acknowledge my ego, it's such a small and insignificant thing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pft33v/no_such_thing_as_good_nor_bad/hb8mj30/"}
