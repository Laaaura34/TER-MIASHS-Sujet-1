As a young adult who has also been in and out of different types of therapy for as long as I can remember and who has seen multiple therapists, it's nice to know that it really can work out. I think for myself, I was so young and immature that I didn't want to open that can of worms. Whereas now, it's as if I'm looking at it from a birds eye pint of view. I know I have work to do and I am determined to find my peace, even if I have to face some hard truths.\n\nThank you for your kind words, it really means a lot.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pft33v/no_such_thing_as_good_nor_bad/hb8kgfj/"}
