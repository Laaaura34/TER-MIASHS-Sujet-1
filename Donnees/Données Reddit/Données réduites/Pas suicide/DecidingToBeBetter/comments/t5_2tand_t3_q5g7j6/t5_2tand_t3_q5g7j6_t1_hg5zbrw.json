There's no point talking about who's had it worse. Pain is pain, suffering is suffering. You deserve support.\nSecondly, therapy is great but you need to find the right person. Took me three tries to find a therapist I \"clicked with\". It's a relationship, you have to find the right person for you. Have you looked at attachment theory? Might even be worth looking at Complex PTSD. (Bullying can create C-PTSD.) Either way, the numbness sounds like you have some unexpressed feelings that deserve your attention when you're ready.\nFinally, please don't buy into this Hollywood crap of \"your best years being behind you\". You'll know when your best years arrived and for many people it's way after our 20s. I think it puts unnecessary pressure on your present. Progress not perfection. Enjoy the wins, there's more to come. Sounds like you already made some great progress. Be proud of yourself and talk to your friends about your feelings if you can. Be kind and patient to yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5g7j6/how_do_i_get_over_a_lonely_childhood/hg5zbrw/"}
