I took up knitting recently and it's so nice to have a hobby that keeps my mind busy and results in something tangible I can be proud of and get some use from. I too love video games but it's not a hobby that makes me feel good about myself, its more just fun and a good distraction. Also gardening! I'm only growing in pots but it's exciting to see how they develop and grow, it gives me something to look forward to!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bhbjr7/i_see_a_lot_of_hard_working_people_on_this_sub/elti4vl/"}
