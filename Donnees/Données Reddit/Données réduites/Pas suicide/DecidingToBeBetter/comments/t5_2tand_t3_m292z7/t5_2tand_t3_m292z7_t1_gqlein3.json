I doubt it is self-harming, but even if it's self-harm, the only reason I can think of for harming myself is me wasting my life on braindead entertainment on the internet. By doing this, I'm removing the reason I have for self-harming.\n\nSecond, sometimes destruction is needed. Heard of King, Warrior, Magician, Lover by Robert L. Moore? He points out how the warrior must destroy what is corrupt before it can be rebuilt. What I'm doing here is more akin to that.\n\nNor am I giving it away. I'm keeping the remains as a totem, a reminder of what I'm willing to do to move forwards.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m292z7/gonna_break_my_laptop_tonight/gqlein3/"}
