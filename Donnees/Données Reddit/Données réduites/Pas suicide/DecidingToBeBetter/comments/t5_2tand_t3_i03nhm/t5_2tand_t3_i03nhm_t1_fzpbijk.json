It\u2019s not your fault, and happens to lots of people. It happened to me too, but I went back way more times than you. I\u2019m so happy that you\u2019ve gotten out. Don\u2019t go back again.

Best to nip the possibility of ptsd in the bud. Good luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i03nhm/i_left_my_emotionally_abusive_boyfriend/fzpbijk/"}
