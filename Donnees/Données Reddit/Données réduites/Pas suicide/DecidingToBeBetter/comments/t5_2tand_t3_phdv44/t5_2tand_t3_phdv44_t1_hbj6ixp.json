You may have something bigger you wish to accomplish. These drinks you have with friends and bosses... I mean it just isn't you. You're here right now, you can see its an issue even though you're not an alcoholic. I mean do your body some good... What we do now affects us in a few short years. Take it from me... I've learned some things along the way and I can tell you a lot of my friends who constantly drink I'm just not around much anymore. Eventually one sees life differently, eventually you are done with all the problems that stem from it. I understand it's simple drinking with friends but trust me when I say... It can really impact your life... And sometimes we don't see it until 10 years goes by and we're like wtf was I doing. Good luck, don't look at it like ima stop drinking... Instead start developing some self discipline and learn to say NO I WILL NOT BE DRINKING TONIGHT BOSS AND YOUR FRIENDS. IT'S YOUR LIFE. I'm happy you're here. Good luck friend, remember there are some amazing people out here living life to the fullest, and you'll never see it drinking all the time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/phdv44/accepting_that_i_have_a_drinking_problem/hbj6ixp/"}
