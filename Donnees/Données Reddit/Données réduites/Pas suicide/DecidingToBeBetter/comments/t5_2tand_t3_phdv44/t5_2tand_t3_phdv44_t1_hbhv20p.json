My friends seem to think im being overdramatic because I don't want to drink with them and that it's fine to just have a few drinks. But a few drinks one night leads to me drinking everyday almost all day and I don't want to live like that. I think its really awesome that you've reflected on your behavior and decided to do something about it even without the support of friends and family. I also hope that you can find some people in your life that are supportive of your new lifestyle.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/phdv44/accepting_that_i_have_a_drinking_problem/hbhv20p/"}
