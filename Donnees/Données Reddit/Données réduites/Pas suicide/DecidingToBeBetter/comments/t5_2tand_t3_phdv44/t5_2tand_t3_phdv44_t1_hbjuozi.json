It's less about the drinking itself than about feeling depressed for days on end afterwards. I despise myself on normal days but after drinking I am really suicidal.\n\nBut I live in a country where drinking is extremely common. People who don't drink are looked at weirdly. Mild forms of alcoholism are considered normal. I am not sure I can withstand the peer pressure - especially after all of my friends know that I've drunk before.\n\nMy best bet would be to use the excuse of dieting and alcohol being too calorically dense. I am about 50kgs overweight (but I am a huge woman with good curves, it basically looks really curvy with a little too much butt), so it would redirect the discussion about alcohol to a discussion about why a healthy weight is important. And I would feel more comfortable with that discussion than with one about me not being able to stop drinking once I started.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/phdv44/accepting_that_i_have_a_drinking_problem/hbjuozi/"}
