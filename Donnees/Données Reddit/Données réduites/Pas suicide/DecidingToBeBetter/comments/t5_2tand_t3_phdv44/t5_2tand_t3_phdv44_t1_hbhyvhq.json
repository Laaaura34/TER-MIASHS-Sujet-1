I'm sober now but only because I drank so heavily for so many years that the alcohol eroded my esophageal and stomach lining away. Now if I drink I'm in unbearable pain and can't eat for days. And when I do eat the pain and digestion take so much energy I pass out within 20 minutes. Luckily I've quit drinking and I can eat with the aid of medication. I have to take medicine everyday just to be able to digest food without pain. I'm only 31. Doc says eating and drinking wayyy too much in short periods of time is a recipe for this condition- gastritis. Gastritis can lead to worse condit\u00edons and stomach cancer. Don't be like me. If you can't handle the bottle, let it go before you get as bad off as I am. Sending love your way man. You can rise above the bottle.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/phdv44/accepting_that_i_have_a_drinking_problem/hbhyvhq/"}
