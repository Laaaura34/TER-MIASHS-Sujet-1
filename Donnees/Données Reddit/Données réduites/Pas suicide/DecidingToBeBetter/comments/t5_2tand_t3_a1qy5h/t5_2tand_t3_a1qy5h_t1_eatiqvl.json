I do intend to talk to her about this and we\u2019ve sort of just scratched the surface but I\u2019m real bad at talking out loud!\n\nYour idea to incorporate more high-fat foods is an interesting one. I used to eat natural yoghurt for breakfast and it would seem to keep me full for ages! The real problem is definitely the sugar rather than fatty foods so this is a good plan.\n\nMy wife is keen to eat well also, for obvious reasons :) so a meal plan, combined with some stern accountability and removing my ability to secret eat (not taking my wallet out with me to work etc so I can\u2019t buy rubbish) are good goals to improve the eating side of things. \n\nNo need to apologise for focussing on the food either :) you\u2019ve given me a lot to think about and I\u2019ve found your comment really helpful. Best of luck trying for baby number two! :) ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a1qy5h/emotional_eater_smoker_spender_currently_hiding/eatiqvl/"}
