I was severely depressed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's what worked for me (obviously it just worked for me, and it may not for you, so no pressure at all!). ROUTINE. I had to be super strict. So basically, I would get up just before I needed to leave for work so I didn't have time to smoke. Go to work, eat lunch at work with colleagues (so I couldn't smoke), come home, shower, eat dinner, immediately clean up, go and see my friend, watch TV with my mum and then rinse and repeat. I had to formulate a life where I didn't have time to fuck around and fuck shit up. I didn't allow myself to be alone for too long (though I'm an introvert so it was hell). I ground the habit out of me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEvery time you manage to not buy a 20 or whatever, immediately pay it off your credit card. \u00a320 doesn't seem a lot but if you manage to even stop buying ONE 20 bag a week, that's \u00a380 off your card in one month!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I'd tell your wife about the credit card- that's what marriage is for- you are a partnership dude. If you tell her you've fucked up and really need her help and you really mean it, she'll see that. The secret keeping will eat away at your mental health, believe me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can do it. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a1qy5h/emotional_eater_smoker_spender_currently_hiding/easdf77/"}
