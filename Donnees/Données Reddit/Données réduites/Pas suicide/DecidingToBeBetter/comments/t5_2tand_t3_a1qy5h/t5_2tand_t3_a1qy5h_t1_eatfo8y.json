A lot of my friends smoke and, if I\u2019m honest, most of the friendships are quite superficial. I\u2019ve been trying to branch out and move away from those friendships and interact/socialise with new people.\n\nAlso very true about self-medicating. I guess I struggle with my thoughts when I\u2019m not high, so I get high. Someone else suggested mindfulness and similar which I think would help there..\n\nThank you for taking the time to respond :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a1qy5h/emotional_eater_smoker_spender_currently_hiding/eatfo8y/"}
