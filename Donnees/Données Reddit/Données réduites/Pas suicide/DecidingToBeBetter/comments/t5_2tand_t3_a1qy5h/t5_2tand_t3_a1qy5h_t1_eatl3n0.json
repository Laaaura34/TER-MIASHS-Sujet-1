I know that I\u2019m depressed, I just haven\u2019t dealt with it in any kind of healthy way. How long did grinding the habit out take for you? :)\n\nI really like the idea of throwing money that I would\u2019ve spent on drugs onto my credit card - I don\u2019t carry it with my anymore so it\u2019s not even like I can fritter the money on anything else :) I\u2019ve also told the friends I get weed from that I\u2019m taking a break, so I\u2019d struggle to get any regardless, and I\u2019m trying to encourage social interactions that don\u2019t involve smoking, although that\u2019s a bit difficult with the friends I have..\n\nI didn\u2019t intend to keep secrets either, I got carried away and didn\u2019t even really pay attention to how much I was spending, have basically nothing to show for it and, at the moment at least, I can\u2019t bear the disappointment that she\u2019s obviously going to feel. I will tell her though.\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a1qy5h/emotional_eater_smoker_spender_currently_hiding/eatl3n0/"}
