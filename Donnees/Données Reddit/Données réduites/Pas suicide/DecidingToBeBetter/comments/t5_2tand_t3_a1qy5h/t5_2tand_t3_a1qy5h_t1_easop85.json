It\u2019s a great motivator and what better reason to be healthy and working and wise with your money than to be your best self for your kids?  If you are doing it for the right reasons then these things have a way of clicking into place. \n\nIt sounds like your wife really cares about you and perhaps you could think of sharing some of your troubles and goals with her and lean on her a bit for support. I think she probably knows more than you think she does and might know how to encourage you if you are open to it.\n\nIf you are not sure where to start I think you should quit weed first. Just don\u2019t buy it. Instead of buying weed send that money to your credit card.\n\nSecond, since you will have more free time from not smoking try to work more. \n\nKeep track of how much extra money you have from not buying weed and working more. It will be an eye opener and make you feel good about yourself and proud of yourself. \n\nThe eating might improve a little by itself if you are not smoking weed and home alone. Perhaps try to stay out of the house until your wife returns. Look up the concept of food abstinence (only eating at regular meal times, no snacking)\n\nI wish you luck!!\n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a1qy5h/emotional_eater_smoker_spender_currently_hiding/easop85/"}
