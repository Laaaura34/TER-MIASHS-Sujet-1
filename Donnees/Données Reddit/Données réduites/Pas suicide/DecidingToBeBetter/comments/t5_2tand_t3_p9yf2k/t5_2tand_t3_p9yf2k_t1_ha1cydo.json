I got lucky in that I was just kind of deeply over it by that time, and I'm now at the point where I absolutely hate being any shade of drunk. Now I will only occasionally have like one super light low carb beer with a steak dinner or something. Right now it's actually been months since the last time I had any alcohol at all. And my life definitely improved drastically after I set that particular bad habit aside (I went back to college and finished my bachelor's in Spanish with a minor in German, even studied abroad in Mexico, and I'm now a self employed translator lol - before that I couldn't even hold down a job and drank all day (literally), and was in the absolute worst depressive episode of my life). \n\nSo yeah, it's always super inspiring to see other people's stories about getting back on track like this! Good on you and good luck going forward! \u2764 When I was still drinking, sobriety seemed both dull and difficult, but my life is definitely way more peaceful and enjoyable now.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p9yf2k/went_a_whole_7_days_without_drinking/ha1cydo/"}
