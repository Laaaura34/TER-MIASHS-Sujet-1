I definitely am that person who thinks \"if I can't finish it, why even start?\" just like OP, and it's really affected me, especially now that I have kids.\n\nAfter getting out of a really bad relationship, I started working out and was making real progress for a good month, and then got injured and stopped even trying. I feel so much guilt over it, as well as being messy for no reason other than just not following through, and I \"just\" need to start doing better. I'll definitely be looking into the subreddit you mentioned. Thanks so much!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/b2oc60/im_cleaning_my_apartment_for_the_first_time_in_a/eiueorb/"}
