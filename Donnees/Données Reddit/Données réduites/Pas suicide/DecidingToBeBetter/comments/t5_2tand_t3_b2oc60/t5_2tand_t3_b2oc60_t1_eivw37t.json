This is so comprehensive and that's amazing. I feel like every time I look at my room, it's from right in the middle of the mess and I get pulled in every direction wanting to fix everything at once, which is what's so debilitating.

Again, thank you so much for your kindness and your advice! ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/b2oc60/im_cleaning_my_apartment_for_the_first_time_in_a/eivw37t/"}
