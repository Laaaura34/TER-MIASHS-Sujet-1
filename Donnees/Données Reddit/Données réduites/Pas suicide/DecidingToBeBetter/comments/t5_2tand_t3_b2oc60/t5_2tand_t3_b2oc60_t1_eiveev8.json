The hardest part when it comes to cleaning is getting started. It can be a bit of a struggle to figure out a pace that works for you and doesn't leave you burned out.\n\nAs far as keeping things clean, one thing that works really well for me is the 1 minute rule - if I notice something and it takes less than 1 minute to do, I'll just do it right away and be done with it. Clothes that need to go in the laundry, dishes that need to be cleaned, wrappers that need to be thrown out. If i'm leaving my room I'll do a quick scan around for any dishes or trash that needs to leave - anything that can be scooped up quickly so I don't have to make extra trips. This prevents things from accumulating and when I do the bigger cleaning tasks (vacuuming, laundry, etc) everything is off the floor or in the hamper so I can be done a lot quicker.\n\nFor those chores, setting a schedule and working it into my routine has been helpful for me. I decided that every morning after I clean up for breakfast i'm going to wipe down and sanitize the sink. It makes me feel good to look at a clean sink every morning and now that it's a 30 second part of my day I don't really think of it as an extra chore.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/b2oc60/im_cleaning_my_apartment_for_the_first_time_in_a/eiveev8/"}
