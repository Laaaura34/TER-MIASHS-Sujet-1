I've been kind of switching rooms as I go, each day tackling a different problem in a different room (ie all the food trash in the living room first, then same in the bedroom, then gathering clothes from each room, etc) , but I have done what you suggested of boxing things up from one room and putting them in another that they belonged to be dealt with later. It definitely felt frustrating at first because it felt like I was just moving the mess around, but I realized that I wouldn't ever finish any rooms if I didn't do that. I haven't tried lists before, but I definitely will! Thank you! ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/b2oc60/im_cleaning_my_apartment_for_the_first_time_in_a/eivx3xx/"}
