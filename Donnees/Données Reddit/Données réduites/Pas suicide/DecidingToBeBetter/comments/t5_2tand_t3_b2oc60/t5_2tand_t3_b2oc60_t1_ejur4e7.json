I don't feel like I've done enough to warrant a whole new update post, but let's see: the 22 bags of trash have been removed from my apartment and have been replaced with only a few bags of the remaining trash in my apartment, and now I'm mostly just kind of sorting through things to donate or what just needs to actually be organized. I've been a lot more conscious about not bringing up food trash into my apartment, and actually cooking food for myself (and doing the dishes immediately, double win!). I did as a lot of commenters said, and placed a basket in my entryway and throw my keys etc in there, put my jackets up immediately, and if I do bring in shopping bags or new items into my apartment, trying to find a home for it immediately. It hasn't been perfect, and I have seen myself slip into old habits when I'm tired or worn out, but I'm giving myself the ability to be understanding of my own imperfections and the fact that my own growth isn't linear, and that's okay! I do still have one bedroom that really needs to be tackled, but I'm trying to get everything else sorted before working on that one. Cursing my past self for thinking a two bedroom was practical for one person! ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/b2oc60/im_cleaning_my_apartment_for_the_first_time_in_a/ejur4e7/"}
