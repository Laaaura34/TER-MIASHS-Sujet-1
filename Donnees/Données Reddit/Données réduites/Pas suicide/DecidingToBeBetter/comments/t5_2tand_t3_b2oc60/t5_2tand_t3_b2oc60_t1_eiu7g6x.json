I also suffered from thinking if I am going to do something, it has to be perfect. I have smoked cigarettes for ten years, always having an excuse as to why I couldn\u2019t quit. Recently, I started cutting back. First, I would try to go four hours without one, then I started going eight once I got that down. Now I don\u2019t smoke on my way to work, the nine hours At work, or the way home from work, and only smoke in the evenings. Pretty soon, I\u2019ll be able to cut the evenings too. It doesn\u2019t matter that it wasn\u2019t cold turkey, I\u2019m just happy I\u2019m taking strides to be healthier. I am happy for you, and proud you have taken the first few steps. \n\nEdit: right to eight", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/b2oc60/im_cleaning_my_apartment_for_the_first_time_in_a/eiu7g6x/"}
