That is amazing, and i think you will really see a difference one you start getting the house in order.\n\nYou might even be starting to see a difference now, because really, living in a clean and not cluttered space can actually help your mental health.\n\nMy best advice is to just not \"ignore\" the difference or think down on it, a lot of people do that. 'Oh, I feel a difference because i stopped being a slob\", and they think about this in a negative way, putting down the accomplishment.  \n No, you feel a difference because you set your mind to something, a higher standard for yourself and started something. You feel a difference because you see a difference, and want it. So embrace it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/b2oc60/im_cleaning_my_apartment_for_the_first_time_in_a/eiu67lm/"}
