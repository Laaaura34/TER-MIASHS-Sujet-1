I was/am in a very similar situation. I moved into a new place by myself, never fully unpacked, and stopped bothering to pick up after myself. I was living in a depression-fueled garbage dump that only made the depression worse. One day I stopped making excuses on why no one could visit and let a loved one help me clean it, and that\u2019s been the only thing that broke the cycle for me. It can be humiliating and very difficult, but if you have someone who you think cares enough to help, don\u2019t be afraid to reach out. It brings more accountability into it as well, and can help you stay motivated to be pick up after yourself.
