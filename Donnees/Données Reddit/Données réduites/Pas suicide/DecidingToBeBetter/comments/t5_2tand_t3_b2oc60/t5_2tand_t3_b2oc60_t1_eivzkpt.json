I keep mine in a notebook in my pocket, daily.  other folks hang theirs on the mirror or on a wall by their apartment door so it assails them on the way out.  \n\ntwo things from my work world that coincide with this: \n\"It's better to get it started than to wait for the right time to get it started\"\n\"Done is better than Perfect\".\n\nboth the same sentiment, but from different vantage points in the process.
