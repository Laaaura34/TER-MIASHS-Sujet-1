Its definatley not easy to not look back and feel bad about it....but if you want you can feel bad about it and then remind yourself you have changed and little by little accept the fact that it was a PAST now you are in a PRESENT and this changed you will  live in the FUTURE and at one point you will move on from it. See the main solution of forgetting a bad thing needs to be accepted so that you can forgive yorself and move on to a better future\n\nI hope i was of your help and all the best:))", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oll3ow/i_regret_my_past_and_it_kills_me/h5jhtf6/"}
