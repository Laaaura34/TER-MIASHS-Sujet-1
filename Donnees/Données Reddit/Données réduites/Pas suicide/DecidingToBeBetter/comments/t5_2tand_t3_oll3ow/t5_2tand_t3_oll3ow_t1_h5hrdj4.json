We cannot change our pasts. The most useful thing I\u2019ve found to help that is being of service. Using my past experiences to share with someone that despite what you have done in the past, there is a way out and up. Idk what choices you are struggling with, but if there is a way to help other people through those same scenarios, try it. Being useful because of your experiences helps lighten the load of shame and guilt and helps reframe it. Also, making a living amends to yourself and those around you by every day choosing to be better is going to eventually put enough time and space between you and your past that it will become easier. I promise. \ud83d\udc95", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oll3ow/i_regret_my_past_and_it_kills_me/h5hrdj4/"}
