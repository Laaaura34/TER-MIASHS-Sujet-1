You cant change it no matter how much you want to. Learn to accept it and acknowledge that it is past.\n\nFor better or for worse, its an experience whether you like it or not. Learn to extract the lessons from it, rather that hating it in its entirety.\n\nShit happened. Choices were made. There is no right and wrong, only consequences. Now either you learn something from it, or you don't (wasted time).\n\nAdditionally, would you have known how to be a better person if you hadn't gone through all that? You cannot see the light if you haven't seen the darkness, and vice versa.\n\nHope this helps, and stay on course. Often the best of things come from the worst of things.
