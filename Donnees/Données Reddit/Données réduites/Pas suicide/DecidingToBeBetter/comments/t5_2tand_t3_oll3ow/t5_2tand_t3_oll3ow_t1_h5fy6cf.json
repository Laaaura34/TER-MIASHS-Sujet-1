Now to get rid of the negative feelings, take your regret to the next stage. \n\nIn life, when someone does something wrong, one expects the wrong to be corrected. Either in the form of an apology or some positive action in favour of the person wronged. Now you may not be in a position to apologise to everyone you have hurt so try the next option.\n\nInstead of just regretting your wrong actions and suffering from a heavy conscience, take active steps to support people who are wronged online or in real life. \n\nThere are many ways of doing it, for example, if you've been a bully in the past, you can protect someone who's being bullied or offer your support to the person in the form of kind words or other action. \n\nThis will give relief to your troubled conscience and additionally bring greater joy and pride in your self.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oll3ow/i_regret_my_past_and_it_kills_me/h5fy6cf/"}
