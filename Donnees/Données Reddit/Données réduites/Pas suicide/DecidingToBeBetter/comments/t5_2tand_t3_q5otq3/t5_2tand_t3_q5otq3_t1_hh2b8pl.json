Be honest with yourself. Doesn't matter if it's \"I don't know what to do\" or \"I really think I fucked up\", you don't have to tell a soul. Just be honest with yourself. Everyone messes up and has things they need to fix about themselves. It's not the fucking up or having lots to improve that make you a bad person. The people that are toxic are the ones that don't self-reflect and who won't take ownership so they have to warp the world around them to stay in denial. Stay in touch with reality even when it's uncomfortable.\n\n\r  \n2. Everything is a skill and skills are learnable. Seriously. I tutor adults part time and we learn a bit slower than children. We've also got different challenges - for adults there's a lot more anxiety and what we think we can/ can't do is very tied up with our identity (i.e. \"I'm not a maths person\"). However, you can learn literally any skill enough to get by, and after a few months of use it becomes easier, and after 6 months - 1 year depending on the complexity of the skill, it's second nature. It's really encouraging reading about how our brains are plastic and have the ability to change throughout our lives.\n\n\r  \n3. If at first you don't succeed and you've given it a good try...try a different strategy/ resource/ counsellor. I was lucky with my first counsellor. Unfortunately, the relationship counsellors I saw weren't a good fit. It also applies to when your needs evolve - now I need help with CBT and restructuring the way I speak to myself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5otq3/current_toxic_person_looking_for_advice_from/hh2b8pl/"}
