They have chosen to let a convicted pedophile come around my family, INCLUDING my niece that he molested. I was raped as a teen and understand what that can do to a person mentally and physically and I put my foot down about it. In the end, my family chose him over my daughter and I (or at least that\u2019s the way I see it). I will not waiver on my stance regarding the situation and how I feel they\u2019re doing so much damage to her by having to see her abuser constantly and exposing him to more children. Most of my anger and resentment comes from that. And while I\u2019ve  come a long way and have healed a lot from it, deep down it hurts me the most and I use the loss of my family to project and cast anger onto others. I\u2019m pretty bitter about it all to think I apparently am not better than a pedophile because how could my family choose him? Anyway, that\u2019s a whole can of worms I\u2019m trying to work through. The other battles are tough ones, but doable. I just don\u2019t really know where to start. Everyone is suggesting meditation, but I just am not sure if that\u2019s for me. Or if it is, I wouldn\u2019t know where to start. I\u2019ve tried meditating before, and maybe I wasn\u2019t doing it right. But I didn\u2019t see any benefit prior. But I genuinely appreciate you taking the time out of your day to see some good in me and responding to help. I just hope I can correct it before it\u2019s too late.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5otq3/current_toxic_person_looking_for_advice_from/hg7wxsd/"}
