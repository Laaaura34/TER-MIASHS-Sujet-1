It has this thing called judge your neighbour- and by you getting out all of your hurt and resentment and why you are triggered you can then \u201c do the work\u201d. I won\u2019t go in to it any further because to try to summarise it takes away from the epiphanies you will get. \nIf you don\u2019t feel good enough- you can project that \u201c not good enough\u201d feeling in to others via criticism and blame etc. One thing that is helpful - especially when talking to children- is nonviolent communication. Try to use neutral terms- identify your emotion and the need behind it. No one listens when they feel attacked, so it\u2019s in your best interest to communicate in a way that the other person can hear better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5otq3/current_toxic_person_looking_for_advice_from/hg7oftl/"}
