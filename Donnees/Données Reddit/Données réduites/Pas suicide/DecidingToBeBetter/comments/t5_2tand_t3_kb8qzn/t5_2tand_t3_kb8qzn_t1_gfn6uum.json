They use small video lessons to break down and summarize personal development books with the actual authors. They also have exercises to go along with them. So you could go through an entire book's learning in like 2 hours.\n\nBut mostly, I just use Google/YouTube search whenever I have something I want to know or learn about.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kb8qzn/what_is_a_valuable_skill_to_put_100_hours_in/gfn6uum/"}
