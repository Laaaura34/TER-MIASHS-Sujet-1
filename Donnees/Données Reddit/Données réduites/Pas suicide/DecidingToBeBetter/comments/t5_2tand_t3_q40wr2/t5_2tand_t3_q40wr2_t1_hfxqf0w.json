I can definitely empathize with your story. I\u2019ve destroyed my life a few times over and spent several fortunes on the stuff. I\u2019d recommend trying to get into an in patient rehabilitation program if possible. If that\u2019s not an option find an NA or SMART Recovery meeting to attend. A therapist that\u2019s well versed in addiction is also advisable. It\u2019s not an easy drug to beat but it is possible. It\u2019s going to require a lot of work and dedication. r/sober r/REDDITORSINRECOVERY r/stopspeeding are all safe places where you can talk with others trying to tackle these same issues. This is a winnable fight though. I know you\u2019re in a very dark and low place right now. I e been there too a bunch of times. But this is 100% beatable. Find a Narcotics Anonymous meeting ASAP! https://www.na.org/meetingsearch/ \n\nBest wishes, I\u2019m rooting for you hard!!\ud83d\udda4", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q40wr2/severe_cocaine_addiction/hfxqf0w/"}
