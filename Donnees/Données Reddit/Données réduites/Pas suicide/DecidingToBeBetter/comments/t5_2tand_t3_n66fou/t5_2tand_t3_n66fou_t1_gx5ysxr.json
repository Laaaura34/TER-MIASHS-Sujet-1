Pathetic during my younger days. There are those anime scenes where the main character meets his other younger self and have appreciated to be able to grow. I kinda felt that way and have completely understood the concept of it.\n\nLooking back, after going through a dysfunctional family, a fucked up relationship, years of bullying, years of observation and years of being 'different'. I still managed to survive and meet people, people that made me want to openly say \"I want to live\" rather than \"I want to survive\".\n\nThe trauma, no doubt still haunts me. But that's an opportunity for me to tell others that \"I've been through this, I still do, but I'm still here for you guys\"", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n66fou/i_owe_it_to_all_of_my_past_selves_to_make_the/gx5ysxr/"}
