If the relationship doesn\u2019t work out, or he\u2019s not quite who you thought he was (ie he\u2019s abusive), you\u2019ll be broke in an unfamiliar place. \n\nOnly move if you know you have a job lined up and the means to take care of yourself if things don\u2019t work out with him. Consider getting an apartment on your own or with roommates/friends and start attending therapy to help with your anxiety and self esteem. A boyfriend can\u2019t fix that for you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9zwiz/should_i_24f_leave_my_parents_home_and_move/hgzp9e4/"}
