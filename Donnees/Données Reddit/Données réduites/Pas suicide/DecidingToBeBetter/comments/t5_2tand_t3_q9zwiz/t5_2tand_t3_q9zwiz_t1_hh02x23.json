On one such post a redditor advised me to move in w my bf as i was facing similar problems as OP. I fucking hated him to assume i had one and yeah its like so easy to just pack up and move w another human and be a fucking liability to them. It's such a vunerable situation to be in. I like when people are reasonable as people in his comment thread lol.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9zwiz/should_i_24f_leave_my_parents_home_and_move/hh02x23/"}
