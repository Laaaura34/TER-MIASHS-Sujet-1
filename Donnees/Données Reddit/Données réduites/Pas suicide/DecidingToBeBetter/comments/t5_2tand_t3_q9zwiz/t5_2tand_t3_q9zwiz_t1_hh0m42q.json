It's very easy to get hired if you are fluent in English and there are literally no shortage of these  jobs. You can keep doing these jobs till you find the job you desire. So, I would advice you to first make sure you have a job in some city or preferably your bf city and then move out. Chandigarh has lot of telecom job but the living cost might be a bit higher than other cities. Message me if you need help finding telecom jobs in Chandigarh/ Mohali.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9zwiz/should_i_24f_leave_my_parents_home_and_move/hh0m42q/"}
