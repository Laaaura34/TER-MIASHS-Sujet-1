Only problem is I dont have that emergency savings cus I had to pay off a lot of things including therapy. If I was in your position I absolutely would take the risk and move out, especially cus you have 3-4 months worth of savings which is great. Just make sure you don\u2019t end up relying on your bf cus that can be even worse than living with your parents no matter how much you like him.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9zwiz/should_i_24f_leave_my_parents_home_and_move/hgzyqbs/"}
