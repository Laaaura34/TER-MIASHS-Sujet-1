It is a loss. Just like a death, you will feel grief. The pain/sadness means you really cared. Keep that in mind as you go through the pain - and come out the other side, because you will. And, in all likelihood, will go through this many more times. In fact, I hope you do, because that will mean that you don\u2019t stop trying. \n\nIn relationships, the success ratio is usually REALLY bad. Often times, you will have many, many endings and only one that keeps going. \n\nStay strong!!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eyg6bv/self_harm_free_for_6_months/fghkt8u/"}
