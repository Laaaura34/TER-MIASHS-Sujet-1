I know the feeling of wanting to hurt myself to feel pain. Running helps, feeling so tired and out of breath, your legs burning, but you keep going. Lifting weights, making yourself push when your muscles are burning and sore. It helps man, and it's a healthy addiction as long as you don't take it too far. But you can aim yourself in that direction. I would also maybe talk to someone, try to figure out why you feel the need to do this to yourself in the first place. Don't feel inferior in life man. Every one else is just human too. Even most people that seem like they have it together are falling apart on the inside. So just know it's okay to be okay, to be you, and it's okay to like yourself. Good luck, keep up the strength to resist damning yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ohapi5/24m_it_has_been_12_months_since_i_last_self/h4p72g7/"}
