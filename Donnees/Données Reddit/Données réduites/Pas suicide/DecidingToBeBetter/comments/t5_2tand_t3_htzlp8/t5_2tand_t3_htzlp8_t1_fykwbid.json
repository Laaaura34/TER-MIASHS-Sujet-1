It\u2019s used to doing things in a certain way and it\u2019s not going to like changing - but you\u2019re in charge and it\u2019ll get used to it. \n\nTry practicing delayed gratification to get yourself going. Like when you wanna do something, but you have other priorities, tell your brain it can have the thing in 20 minutes. In 20 minutes, see if you can go another 10 minutes. \n\nI like to think of my brain like a half-trained pet rabbit. It sort of has its own agenda, but it\u2019s not trying to be mean, it\u2019s just doing what it knows. Be nice to it, give it treats, ease it into changes, and it\u2019ll be a friendly brain bunny that\u2019s much easier to train! \n\nOk the metaphor got weird but hopefully you get my point lol. Be kind to yourself as you learn these new things, intentionally kind. Practicing delayed gratification can guide you towards a lot of your goals. \n\nGood luck, keep asking questions!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/htzlp8/18_years_old_never_developed_life_skills_where_do/fykwbid/"}
