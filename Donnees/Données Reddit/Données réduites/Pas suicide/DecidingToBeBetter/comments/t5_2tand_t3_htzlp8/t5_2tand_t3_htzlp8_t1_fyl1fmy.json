Cut it out completely if possible.\n\nImplement only 1-2 habits at the same time. Only add new ones when you have been consistent for 3 months with the ones you currently undertake. I recommend starting with fitness and nofap. But feel free to do whatever feels right.\n\nThese will support your willpower and mental balance. Make you more resistant to stressful situations and help you see clearly who you are and want to be.\n\nAs for the \"forcing you to do stuff\".\nYou start doing the work in little steps. Say if you want to study. You dont sit down and try to do 6h study sessions. \nNo. You start with 5 minutes. Because everybody can manage 5 minutes. And after you give yourself probs. Praise yourself mentally or even out loud on what a good job you did! Then, you relax. Maybe a couple hours. Then you do another 5 min. Repeat the process and start increasing the time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/htzlp8/18_years_old_never_developed_life_skills_where_do/fyl1fmy/"}
