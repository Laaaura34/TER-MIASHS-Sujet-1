(on paper)  \n\n\nYou've strived for what was prescribed to others. Perhaps, that's not what you like or needed to do. (I think what you're missing is the sense of mission/or goal to strive for)  \n\n\nI'd like to step back and ask. Why do you want to be this great in the first place (It's a head-scratcher question, maybe an offensive one to others)   \n\n\nIt's a philosophical question. \n\n**Keep asking why.** Most likely your answers will be paradoxical and non-sensical. But this will give you a sense of clarity with Life. Hopefully, you might even find your sense of why with this.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is what I got with this thought experiment. My sense of why (What to strive for)\n\n1. Be a Student \n2. Be a Partner\n3. Be a Friend\n4. Be a Creator \n\nNot grand quests. A very subjective and personal goal. Nonsensical to compare myself to others with this goal of mine.   \n\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Hit me up, would love to know your perspective after reading this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbwqmh/i_feel_like_absolute_crapive_done_a_ton_of_work/hhcfr46/"}
