Your situation sounds like mine right down to the ADHD. I was frustrated, angry at myself and everything else, and I was immature. I was drowning.\n\nJust keep pushing, never stop looking for a something better. I didn\u2019t have a \u201creal\u201d job until nearly 30 and even then I asked for a very low salary because I thought I wasn\u2019t worth it. If it is a job you want but don\u2019t think you\u2019re qualified apply for it anyway. All they can do is say no. And especially don\u2019t worry about what your peers are doing and don\u2019t try to emulate them. Value yourself.\n\nThis sounds easier said than done because it is. Just keep thinking long term. I\u2019m probably not good at advice giving, I just 100% empathize.\n\nJust keep it up, man, and don\u2019t beat yourself up. You\u2019ll make it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m24o1f/im_24_and_i_feel_like_i_have_failed_at_life/gqhcpf4/"}
