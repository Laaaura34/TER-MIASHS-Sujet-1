Now you take that lesson and integrate it. \n\nIf you're trying to figure out who you are, I suggest trying out/looking into a bunch of different things. For your electives, try classes in something you know nothing about (intro level). I'm happy with my education, but I do wish I had tried business courses or econ, or gotten back into music. I should have taken exercise courses! College is a great place to explore - look for different clubs on campus too. See if study abroad might be feasible for you (or even a domestic exchange program) so you can see more of the world!  Philosophy can also be a good intro into how to break down and evaluate values/morals, etc. \n\nYou can also think back to when you were a kid - what did you love then? Reconnecting with old joys can be great. \n\nDiscovering who you is a lifelong endeavor. If that's overwhelming, just start with small actions day by day, from evaluating how your living habits affect the environment to just taking an extra minute here or there to be nice to someone (even if they don't deserve it). \n\nAnd don't try too hard to pigeon hole it into a major or a career - you can apply things like \"help other people,\" \"work with animals,\" \"create\" etc into all sections of your life, and even a variety of different kinds of jobs.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/auo8jj/i_took_lsd/eh9j3a7/"}
