Honesty in all things. Everything you say and everything you do. People are drawn to others who display themselves without reservation and it's not surprising that they are. We all want to be that person that is confident enough to not put on a facade for those around us. If you actually lack the confidence, then fake it. Soon enough you will realize there is nothing to be afraid of, because if someone doesn't like the real you, then fuck them. For every one person who criticizes someone for being an honest person, 10 people are drawn to them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3r2jf0/how_to_be_magnetic/cwkdk7g/"}
