That said, if someone were to ask me, \"do you know you're magnetic?\" I would take it as a compliment and reciprocate some kind words to whomever I was speaking with.  But I would not say, \"yes.\"\n\nI eventually learned that the ability to \"pickup chicks\" is also a side effect of self betterment.  If you seek to improve yourself others will naturally be drawn to you.  Learn to love conversation and say hi to random strangers and you if you try you will learn to be more charismatic.\n\nThere is a dark side to seduction that just seems immoral to myself.  I choose not to study that stuff but I know others who do and enjoy it very much.  \n\nI personally have improved and grown in my natural abilities at picking up women through self improvement and I would highly recommend that over the manipulative powers of seduction.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3r2jf0/how_to_be_magnetic/cwlxv1d/"}
