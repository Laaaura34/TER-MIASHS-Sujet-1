Nearly indescribable. I\u2019ve always had a good work ethic, but not when it came down to working with my demons from the past. I started to work out as well and I honestly look forward to it. I\u2019m starting to feel much better about my physical and mental self. I\u2019m graduating this winter and actually am looking forward to the future now. I\u2019m glad that you are able to get where you\u2019ve always wanted to progress towards and have supportive people around you. You give me hope!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nlv9py/finally_getting_there/gzls6p1/"}
