Thank you for sharing with us. I think it will be hard to reach your ideal when you keep lifting the bar higher for yourself. There is nothing wrong in improving yourself, but if it does not make you happy, you can also learn to be content where you are along the journey. I like to make other people happy too, and it is hard when they put pressure on you. But you have to listen to yourself sometimes. It is your life, if you are proud and happy with what you are doing (and a PhD is not easy!!!!) that is enough. Self-love, self confidence, you can learn and build it. You WILL find your love and your friend circles someday. It will take a lot of exploring, but if you don't believe it is even possible, how can there be any hope of it coming true? Small steps. I know a LOT of college students smoked, drank underage, and I was not one of them. I embrace my nerdy side by finding friends who are also nerds like me. I approach people first sometimes and slowly come to trust them. Yes, I will test them. Like telling a small secret and seeing how they react. I am slow to open up and won't just give away my help. That is my valuable time and energy. I am generous only with my true friends.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oyxe85/will_i_ever_be_enough/h84fhjq/"}
