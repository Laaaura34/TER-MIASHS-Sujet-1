For instance, one night I was just sitting at home alone and was constantly opening social media to see what people had posted. I was tempted to message people for no real reason other than reach out. Now, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that in and of itself. However, I realised that I was using social media as a means to escape being alone with myself for a night. It was then that I realised I had to make more of an effort to be OK with sometimes just being to myself, and my own company being enough. \n\nNow, if someone forgets about you because you aren\u2019t in their feed then I\u2019d argue they aren\u2019t a true friend. There\u2019s nothing wrong with focusing on yourself and every now and again reaching out to friends and even hanging out. I\u2019ve had those fears that friends will forget about me or lose interest if I\u2019m not constantly hitting them up. But it works both ways. Friends can also hit you up and suggest times to hang out. You shouldn\u2019t need to be updating your feed or liking every post from everyone to be a friend. Making an effort to keep in touch and spend time together should be enough. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t overthink it too much. FOMO is such a real thing and it can lead us into unhealthy habits that don\u2019t serve us. Absolutely take the time to foster a solid relationship with yourself. Make an effort to bring yourself happiness and to be content with your own company. But at the same time don\u2019t neglect your relationships. It\u2019s about balance, but only you will be able to work out how that balance will be for you. Hope that makes sense.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mtiaw7/i_deleted_social_media_but_feel_lonely/gv0latj/"}
