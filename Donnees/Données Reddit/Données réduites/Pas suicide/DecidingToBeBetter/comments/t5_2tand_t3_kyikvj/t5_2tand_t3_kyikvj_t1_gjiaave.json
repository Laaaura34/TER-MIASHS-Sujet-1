It has a really nice image in the handle and it makes me happy everytime i go to brush.\n\nIm grateful for my kitchen wares, like my plates, because i think theyre really pretty and i have a whole set.\n\nIm grateful for my couch because i got to keep it when my dad tried to throw it out when i was still living at home. Its old and worn and it's the most comfortable couch i've ever watched tv in.\n\nWhatever you have is worth being grateful for. Maybe you're grateful for your closet, even though you dont have all the clothes you feel you need, maybe you still have that one pair of pants that suits you like a fucking glove.\n\nAlso i dont want an award, i want to help.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kyikvj/gratitude_has_changed_my_life/gjiaave/"}
