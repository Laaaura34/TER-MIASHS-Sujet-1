Since, we all are on some kind of negative cycle at any point in our lives, this whiff of positivity might wash over many other things in our life..... The point being, it doesn't matter what you are thankful for, all that matters is that you feel truly grateful that you have it", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kyikvj/gratitude_has_changed_my_life/gjhnaao/"}
