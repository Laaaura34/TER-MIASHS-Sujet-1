I would try to be grateful for food and shelter but would just feel badly for folks  that don't have these basics; this is just how I am as a person.  You will obviously be different.\n\nHere is my gratitude list so far today\n\nI'm grateful:\n\n\\-I found some more dental floss as I had run out\n\n\\-my Dad, who I care for, hasn't had a bathroom accident today\n\n\\-my brother called today\n\n\\-I mailed a signed contract to my caregiver's company\n\n\\- my body feels awake and a bit tired from yoga\n\nNone of the above is huge but it helps to write it out as it focuses me on what is going well in my life.\n\nI would love to see anyone else's gratitude list for right this minute/today", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kyikvj/gratitude_has_changed_my_life/gji72my/"}
