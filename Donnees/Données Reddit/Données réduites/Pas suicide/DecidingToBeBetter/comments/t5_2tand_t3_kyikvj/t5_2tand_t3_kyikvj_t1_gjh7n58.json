A friend recommended that each week I write 5 things that I was grateful for. It also did not have to be something as big as good health but the little things such as drinking warm tea, making mashed potatoes, going for a 30-min drive to nowhere much, organizing week meal plan, great song I heard, etc.   \nSometimes life is not always about the big things but the little things, the little joys that life brings that makes it all better and the ending to 2020 was better than what it would have  been. I have taken this gratitude attitude into this year and lets see what it brings !", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kyikvj/gratitude_has_changed_my_life/gjh7n58/"}
