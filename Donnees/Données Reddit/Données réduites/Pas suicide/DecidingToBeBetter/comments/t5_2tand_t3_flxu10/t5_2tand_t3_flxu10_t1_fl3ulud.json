Either they don\u2019t think it\u2019s important, or worse, they just don\u2019t care if their partner has an orgasm. Especially with how common casual sex is now, it\u2019s hard to really get to know what your partner likes or get into a rhythm with someone if you don\u2019t really know them and you\u2019re only sleeping with them 1-2 times! \n\nUnfortunately, some women don\u2019t feel comfortable asking for or showing their partner what they want, so the guy may not know what to do to please that particular woman. That\u2019s why people need to be open and comfortable with their partners and able to talk their wants and needs, or at least able to point someone in the right direction. I, personally, think getting that level of comfort and intimacy is difficult with a one night stand. And don\u2019t even get me started on the women who fake orgasms... that\u2019s problematic all around. Fortunately, there are also some guys who DO care, do know what they\u2019re doing, and do make the effort!\n\nIt\u2019s definitely possible that some of these guys are too tired or no longer turned on after they \u201cget theirs\u201d - so that\u2019s why they should at least try to take care of their lady first.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/flxu10/how_pornography_changed_me_and_my_relationship/fl3ulud/"}
