Besides that, she never talked with me about that, I talked with her and she was thinking that was her problem but I knew it wasn\u2019t that\u2019s why I went to a doctor. But this is not an excuse to do what she did. If she wants to be with another person just go, but first break up with me and then she\u2019s free. She was trying with another guy for at least 3 months to be sure that was exactly what she wants, yes she told me this exactly by this words, and if it wasn\u2019t right she would come back. I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m not a plastic bag that you use and throw away. \nBut I understand what you say and I agree that I wasn\u2019t make her happy but like I said, first break up and then do what the heck goes on your mind.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/flxu10/how_pornography_changed_me_and_my_relationship/fl1sxl6/"}
