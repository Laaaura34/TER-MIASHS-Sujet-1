A kind of self statement of \u201clets do it!\u201d to yourself. Usually falling in love with a martial art makes it more of a habit than a chore. Completing a training session gives you a certain happy contentful feeling. With this participate and reward pattern, it helps to apply this expectation in different aspects of life to \u201cpush\u201d yourself to proceed with the challenge/hardship to achieve the goal - life is obviously a lot more complicated than a training session but it helps to stay positive!\n\nso \u201cpump hard\u201d I meant when we push ourselves to do things - incurring stress. Sometimes this push is too hard on ourselves and it can create fatigue that make you lose interest. Having some easier days in between is not being lazy but letting the rhythm calm down to stability.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qa75wy/a_relaxed_run_to_upkeep_a_regular_routine/hh136dg/"}
