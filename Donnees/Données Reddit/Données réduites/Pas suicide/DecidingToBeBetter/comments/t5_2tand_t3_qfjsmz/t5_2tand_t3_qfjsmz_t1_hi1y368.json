She never had a boyfriend until she was in her early 30\u2019s and even now in her late 30\u2019s she\u2019s never really had a serious relationship, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with that! I feel like your main issue here is that you are comparing yourself to others around you. Just because you are doing something different, doesn\u2019t mean that you are doing something wrong. It sounds like you have a lot of great things going on in your life including finishing medical school. I married young and didn\u2019t have a chance to go to school and I wish so much that I would have. \n\nI do agree with your mom some, although I would not say that you were \u201cdesperate\u201d because I do understand where you are coming from. Try to stop focusing all of your time and energy into this relationship that you want and take a while to be thankful for the things that you do currently have. There are many things in life that you will not have an opportunity to do once you\u2019re married and have kids. You should enjoy this time and stop worrying about the future. When the time is right he will come around. It might not be in the time frame that you want it to be, but it will be in the time frame that\u2019s right! \n\nAs far as being chosen, I understand what you mean. I truly believe there is someone out there for everyone so it is only a matter of time until you are chosen. And school is hard, Failing is normal and it happens to everyone. If medical school is your dream then keep trying, It will come!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfjsmz/i_struggle_with_never_being_chosen_how_can_i/hi1y368/"}
