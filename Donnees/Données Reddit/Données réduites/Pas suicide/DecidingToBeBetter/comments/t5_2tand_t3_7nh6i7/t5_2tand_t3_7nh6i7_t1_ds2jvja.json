For example, choosing to eat a healthy snack instead of an unhealthy one. Not a monumental life-changing decision, but a few of those decisions can add up to a good day. More of them, a good week.\n\nAnd it felt good to make these small decisions that I could look back on and be proud of. And feeling good just made me want to make good decisions, and good habits start to form.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve gotten sidetracked. The point was to think about all the tiny decisions you make over the course of a day, and how those are the ones that matter, and that help develop good habits. \n\nAgain, best of luck to you.
