I think that's one of my biggest problems. I can see how disciplined I was living on my own in college and I built some good habits. I was figuring life out. Then I came home and went back to being the shithead I had gotten away from in college. \n\nI think that's one of the reasons I want to move out is because I can see this. The thing that i need to change is thinking that its because I'm home. I have the power to change the way I am now and i can't just up and leave my house for various reasons. I can change not being disciplined. One step at a time.\n\nThank you for the kind words and I appreciate the advice.
