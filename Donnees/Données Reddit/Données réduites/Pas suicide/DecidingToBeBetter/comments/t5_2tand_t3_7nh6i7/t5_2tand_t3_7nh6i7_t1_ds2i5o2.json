After i struggle out of bed and go to bathroom, I head into the kitchen and turn up the water to warm. I enjoy warming up my hands and looking down at the mess from last night dinner. I do not want to do it but I pick up one fork and clean that. Then the next, etc. All the while I am enjoying the productivity and warmness of the water. The task takes no more than 5 minutes and I feel I get a great start of the day.\n\nIt sounds very silly but to me it has made me feel that ultimately change is just a long series of simple, doable actions that are chained together in one direction. From dishes I then feel inspired to cook my rice for the day. From the rice I start my slow cooker. From there in the wait times of cooking I begin to stretch my body. From that I pick up my weights. Within an hour I have my kitchen clean, meals cooking for the day, and my body warmed up. I will likely add to all this by having some audio book or video playing so i can add to my knowledge or mood. \n\nAnd with that done, I feel more in control. And I feel more confident to find the simple chains of actions that will lead to progress in my life.\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7nh6i7/my_life_fell_apart_this_past_year/ds2i5o2/"}
