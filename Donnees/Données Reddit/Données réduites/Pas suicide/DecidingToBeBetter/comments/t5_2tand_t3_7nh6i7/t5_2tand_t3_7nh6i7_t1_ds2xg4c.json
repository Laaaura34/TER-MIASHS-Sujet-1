Then on days I don\u2019t run I can do it at home till I get confidence and some progress. \n\nYeah I\u2019ve been working on my diet, it\u2019s just hard living at home when my parents eat like shit too. \n\nMaybe making a goal of cooking for everyone once a week?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7nh6i7/my_life_fell_apart_this_past_year/ds2xg4c/"}
