Responding to these takes a lot of emotional energy and I just have been burnt out. \n\nI read this response when you first made it and I\u2019ve been thinking about it a lot. I understand what you\u2019re saying and I even put it into practice with some positive results!\n\nI can see how I\u2019m not thankful for the things in my life. I want things in my life I don\u2019t have. In a lot of ways that\u2019s not a bad thing. I have ambition, I have goals, I\u2019m not complacent in where I am. In a lot of ways it has a negative effects too. I compare myself to others, I buy things I don\u2019t need, I\u2019m trying to live up to an image rather than just being myself. \n\nI went to a friends house that I don\u2019t normally hang out with and there were a bunch of people I didn\u2019t know. I found myself very nervous and comparing myself to people around me. Wondering what they thought of me etc. I thought back to this and just started thinking of the things I was thankful for. Thinking of what I wanted and how I wanted the night to go. I practiced mindfulness in that moment and went on to have a good night. Every time I felt myself slip I could grab myself and hold myself up. I was really proud. \n\nI think vocalizing these things would be really helpful. I have been talking to some people from this community and it\u2019s really helped me in making progress. The problem I see is that it\u2019s in my head and in text. I can see how vocalizing these things would have so much more power to them. \n\nI\u2019ve thought about maybe talking to a therapist about some things because I don\u2019t have too many friends near me that I would feel comfortable with speaking to this about. I have one friend from college who I know I could talk to and he\u2019s actually a man of faith himself. I think I\u2019m going to try vocalizing these things in my own time and maybe speaking to him before going to therapy.\n\nThank you for the meaningful response. I really appreciate it.
