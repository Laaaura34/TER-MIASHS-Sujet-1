Generally, I see two main troubles with self-diagnosis (which is what it sounds like you\u2019re doing):\n\n1. You can convince yourself of a certain diagnosis, excluding any contrary information. This can in effect allow you to rewrite your memories or at least misapply your current thinking to how things actually were. Makes it difficult to get proper treatment, as you will be presenting a certain way to any counselor/therapist/doctor. Take your own discoveries with a grain of salt, knowing that reading about these conditions will not make you an expert.\n\n2. There is a high bar for diagnosis\u2014for good reason. We are complicated creatures. There are  numerous conditions that may mimic this particular disorder, or potentially a combination of factors requiring different types of treatment.\n\nEither way, it sounds like you\u2019re experiencing a great deal of distress, and whether or not they can diagnose or cure you, a mental health professional can at least provide you with the best space to sort this out. I strongly recommend setting up an appointment with your doctor or a counselor.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jl2v8q/intense_perpetual_fear_of_being_a_covert_narc/gamyh9d/"}
