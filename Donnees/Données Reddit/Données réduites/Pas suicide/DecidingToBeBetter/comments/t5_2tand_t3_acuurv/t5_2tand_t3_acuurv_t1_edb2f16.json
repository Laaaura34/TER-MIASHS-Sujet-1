Forcing yourself to live a life that gives you anxiety and makes you unhappy seems like a weird choice to me. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being an introvert and feeling content with being independent and learning and doing things. Not everybody is social, high energy etc etc. Many people are like you.\n\nAny chance you\u2019re not happy in your marriage and this is how it\u2019s coming out? There\u2019s nothing wrong with saying some of your choices don\u2019t actually fit with the life you see for yourself. You can change that now. I mean, your child is here to stay but no reason to stay stuck in the exact same life you\u2019re in now if it doesn\u2019t make you happy. Obviously that\u2019s much, much easier said than done but it\u2019s just the vibe i got from reading your posts. \n\nI understand what you\u2019re saying because I\u2019m an introvert (but I\u2019m a social introvert) so i keep my social circles small and i have a lot of independent time. My partner and I are similar with that and he respects my space (for the most part) and if I ever start to feel encroached on I tell him and we talk about it. But if i ever felt like i was stuck in my own life I\u2019d have to reconsider our partnership. (And that doesn\u2019t mean your partner is doing anything wrong. Just might now be a good fit for you) \n\nSorry I don\u2019t have anything better to give you!! Good luck finding your spot!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/acuurv/i_never_want_to_do_anything_and_i_feel_guilty/edb2f16/"}
