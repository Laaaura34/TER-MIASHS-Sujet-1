You never know how things manifest so I had to ask. \n\nFirst, do you meditate? I have found it decreases my social anxiety and puts me in a better mind frame on days I know I\u2019m going to be busier than i might like. \n\nCould you sit down and make a schedule? Say, I need this much time for myself (quiet, alone) every week and if i can get that, I can absolutely give x amount of time to my family. You will know that no matter how social or active you\u2019ll be with family and friends on x days, you\u2019ll have time to do what you want (and need) i the other days. Having set times every week can be beneficial just for your own mind so you\u2019re not showing your displeasure on your face lol \n\nWhich by the way I TOTALLY understand! My partner is having work friends over tonight and I\u2019m still feeling overwhelmed by all the holiday activity and I\u2019ve been wearing it all over my face, my tone, my body lol he\u2019s like \u201ccan you i just pretend to look forward to it?\u201d so i totally get it! Just don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. You are who you are and the fact that you\u2019re even aware of how you might be effecting your family shows you\u2019re pretty awesome. \n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/acuurv/i_never_want_to_do_anything_and_i_feel_guilty/edbcana/"}
