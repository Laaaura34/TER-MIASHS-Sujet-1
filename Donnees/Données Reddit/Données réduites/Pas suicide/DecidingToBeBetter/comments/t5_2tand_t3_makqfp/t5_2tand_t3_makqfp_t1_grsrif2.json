You are soooooooo young, and NOW that you\u2019ve decided to quit is amazing. Do not beat yourself up. It was an experience in life and your gonna do amazing things especially if you keep this attitude up! Don\u2019t worry about what you\u2019ve done in the past too much (way easier said then done). I feel like you should go to a therapist, and talk about your childhood trauma that has had such a huge impact on you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/makqfp/ive_been_addicted_to_weed_and_other_substances/grsrif2/"}
