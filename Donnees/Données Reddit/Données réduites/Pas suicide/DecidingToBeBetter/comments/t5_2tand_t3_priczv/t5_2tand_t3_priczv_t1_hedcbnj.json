Just know you are NOT alone. So many college students struggle with motivation and the job search because let's face it, it's intimidating! My biggest suggestion is to get on LinkedIn. Connect with recruiters, alumni, and look for jobs. A tool I used to help land my internship this summer is [RippleMatch](https://ripplematch.com/index?r=y8hNW5), I can't highly recommend it enough. I made profile in like 5 minutes and it instantly matched me with employers and jobs to apply for. I know a couple of my friends landed interviews at Amazon. Good luck and I know you will get out of this rut shortly, the hardest part is acknowledging that you need to get started and you already took that first step!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/priczv/im_a_senior_in_college_and_i_really_need_to_get/hedcbnj/"}
