Imposter syndrome, procrastination, perfectionism (and frustration when you fall short of your own expectations). Anxiety does not always manifest itself in fear. For me, it manifests as perfection, ruminating thoughts, hyper-critical self-talk, and inattention. \n\nI wasn't diagnosed with anxiety until well into adulthood and only after a neuro-phycological test. But after a little trial and error, I am now taking the right combo of RX's to combat it and I feel infinitely better about myself and my potential. \n\nI just wanted to float the idea out there - what you may attributing to character flaw may not be who you truly are.
