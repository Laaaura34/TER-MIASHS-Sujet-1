I have a extremely addictive personality so I have to go to extremes with some stuff. For instance I\u2019m freaking 40 and my Mom is in charge or my pain and anxiety pills. She gives me a weeks worth at a time so I have to make them last. And with a shopping problem I have with a therapists help I have made the steps to completely eliminate any card info I can use to buy things online. All my bills are on autopay. I get a certain amount of cash each week and that\u2019s all I can spend my debit and credit cards stay locked in a safe. It may be extreme but sometimes you need the help. So don\u2019t be afraid to ask for it and you did the best step by getting the pills out of your immediate reach! (I have taken a whole bottle of Xanax before too so I know that rock bottom place) it landed me in a mental hospital for three weeks. I don\u2019t ever want to go back! If you want or need to talk you can message me! Sometimes just having support is great.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oc6xxb/finally_coming_to_terms_with_the_fact_that_im_an/h3sg3t4/"}
