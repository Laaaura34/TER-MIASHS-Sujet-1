He was also addicted benzos and codeine. I won't go into the details for his privacy (he is okay with me letting people know he's a recovering addict though). The last straw was when he had a psychotic break and spent 7 days on a psych hold. It is a hard road, but I wanted to give you some resources that helped him. Narcotics Anonymous was the best for him. They have meetings twice a day, everyday. They can give you names and numbers for other organisations too. I would also strongly urge you to see your doctor. Benzos ideally shouldn't be just stopped, they fuck with your brain and chemical balance. It can be dangerous going cold turkey. I'm not trying to scare you, I just want you to be able to do this safely with less chances of relapse. Please keep me updated on your progress, and you can always send me a private message if you need to reach out.
