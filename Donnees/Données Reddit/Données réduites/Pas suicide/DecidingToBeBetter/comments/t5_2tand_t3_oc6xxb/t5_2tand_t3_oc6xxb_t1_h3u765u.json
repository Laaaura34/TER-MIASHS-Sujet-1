I had a period where I'd clock in to work at the dealership then by 11am I'd be driving uptown to meet my dealer and then casually do some bumps in the walmart parking lot before heading back to clock out. I only got clean thanks to opening up about it with my girlfriend and taking advantage of my addictive wiring to get hooked on healthier habits. Ill still somehow get hooked on cigarettes every other year or so but no hard drugs anymore and it feels good not to be riding that particular rollercoaster. Also psychedelics are wonderful in helping getting your shit straight if you have good friends that can sit for you. That being said, making the decision to treat yourself better is the most important ingredient! Cheers to you bro!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oc6xxb/finally_coming_to_terms_with_the_fact_that_im_an/h3u765u/"}
