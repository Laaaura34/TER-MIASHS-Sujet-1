When we are unhappy and we want to feel anything but sober then we turn to drugs. I used to be the same way where I wouldn\u2019t ever want to take a little bit of anything, I always wanted to get blackout drunk/high and it was because I didn\u2019t want to deal with my emotions. The second part is impulse control. I don\u2019t know your age but when I was a teenager I had zero impulse control. If I wanted to do something then I did it. As I have gotten older I\u2019ve learned to not listen to my brains automatic reaction because it doesn\u2019t help me make the best decisions. Instead I think about how a poor decision might affect me long term, such as tomorrow or next week or next year. For instance, if I decide to get high today then I will most likely wake up feeling like shit and want to get high again the next day and it just continues. I don\u2019t view myself as an addict but someone who feels their emotions very strongly and used to have poor coping mechanisms. I suggest trying to figure out how to improve your happiness so you don\u2019t need drugs to artificially boost your serotonin and dopamine. This could be exercise or a hobby that you look forward to doing so much that doing drugs would get in the way. I think that the fact you are able to recognize that you have a problem and want change shows that you care capable of making that happen.  I wish you the best of luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oc6xxb/finally_coming_to_terms_with_the_fact_that_im_an/h3sv4ut/"}
