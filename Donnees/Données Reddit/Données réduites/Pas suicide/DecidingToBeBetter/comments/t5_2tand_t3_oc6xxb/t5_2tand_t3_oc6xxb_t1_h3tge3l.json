I applaud you for realizing it but know it's not your fault. It is your responsibility to avoid falling into traps now that you know. Being an addict isn't being a bad person. It's an illness that can be managed but can be more easily managed with tools to help and less shame. I'm an addict. No one really even knows that. They don't know because I realized it before they did. When I realized it I got in my own way for the better. I'd I go to a doctor as much as I want to say give me the goods I say the opposite and let them know I do not want anything I can get addicted to. Better yet though I just stopped doctors visits unless I'm in dire need. I make sure not to hang out with people who do addictive substances, not out of dislike for then but out of knowing I can't while also taking care of myself. I will say that having parents who did all the messing up their lives stuff for me to see is what made it easier for me to see where things could head if I didn't change course. Which also says something about parenting. Sometimes having less than perfect parenting skills actually helps the kids break the cycle which makes me inclined to think not all cases with cps are doing good.... But that's another rant based on mine and siblings different upbringings.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oc6xxb/finally_coming_to_terms_with_the_fact_that_im_an/h3tge3l/"}
