It\u2019s skeezy as fuck and even if it \u201cworks,\u201d it\u2019s the shiftiest possible foundation for a relationship to be built upon. \n\nIf you have social anxiety to the point of seeking out therapy, my advice is to steer clear of trying to pick women up at a park or a bar anyway. Those attempts fail A LOT and will only get less and less effective as time passes. Frankly, in my experience, women don\u2019t like being approached for a date randomly out in the wild unless all circumstances are exactly right (those being that she is single, you are beautiful enough to spark interest on sight, she isn\u2019t busy/late/in a bad mood, etc. etc. etc.). And trying to pick up a rando makes your chances of not just being rejected but being (justly) called a creep go up exponentially. \n\nMy advice is to focus on your hobbies that have a social component, join local clubs or go to Meets, and get talking with women when your primary goal isn\u2019t to start a relationship or get laid. Your conversation will be smoother because you\u2019re talking about something you\u2019re into and comfortable with instead of trying to follow some script for a pickup line, women won\u2019t have the pressure of immediately coming to a conclusion about your date-ability and be forced to go on your looks and opening line alone, and you\u2019ll become friendly or even friends. Then you can ask yourself if you\u2019re interested in more, and if you are, you can approach these hypothetical women as friends and ask if they\u2019re interested themselves. Friends are going to be much, much kinder in rejecting you than a stranger who feels you\u2019ve invaded her day uninvited. Friends are also WAY more likely to date you because they already know they enjoy your company. \n\nMost important of all: don\u2019t approach every interaction with a woman as a chance to start a relationship or get laid. You take a woman\u2019s actual self out of the equation\u2014if you look at a woman for the first time and imagine marrying her, for example, you\u2019re imagining marrying a photograph. You haven\u2019t learned who she is, what she likes, if SHE will treat YOU right, if you have complimentary political views, if she\u2019s a smoker which you hate/love, if she drinks/parties/does drugs/shares a religion/is even into dudes. You\u2019ve objectified her and made her a prop in your life. I know what you\u2019re really seeking is companionship, love, affection, shared goals, all that gooey shit that makes life worth living, but start with meeting a PERSON, not a POTENTIAL MATE. Speak easily and honestly and give her time and space to do the same. Don\u2019t put the weight of your ultimate goal on early encounters\u2014it\u2019s too much to ask and will get you a cold shoulder often. \n\nGood luck out there, friend! Just stay relaxed (as much as you can!), be kind, and let relationships build themselves instead of trying to force them to happen or to look a particular way and you will be totally fine!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o5lkvm/hey_guys_im_24m_and_ive_always_had_trouble/h2o44pp/"}
