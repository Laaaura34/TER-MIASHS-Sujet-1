Eating makes you feel comfortable, but your mind will become a slave to your body as you fixate on your appearance.\n\nSo mindset is where it starts, and to be honest, I don\u2019t have good advice specifically for you for this because everyone is different.  The most broad advice here is discipline - choosing between what you want and now and what you want most.  Think about your food choices before you make them.  Ask yourself \u201cWould I rather have this (food item), or to be happy with how I look?\u201d  If you can be honest with yourself, you\u2019ll choose the latter almost every time.\n\nAnd that segways to my last point: diet is what controls your weight.  You mention a caloric deficit briefly in your post, but everything else refers to your previous athleticism and working out.  And that\u2019s great!  Exercise will make you feel good and motivate you to make better choices, because why ruin feeling good with garbage food?  But, the emphasis needs to be most squarely on diet, because that\u2019s the tool that truly controls weight, exercise is a great supplement to that and will give you better composition at any weight.\n\nHope this helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2xzdb/how_to_i_stop_myself_from_spiraling_into_obesity/hfol7s1/"}
