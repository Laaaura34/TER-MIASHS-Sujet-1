I hate routine and despise the regular, when it comes to fitness this is really not beneficial. So instead of sticking to a workout routine I set myself the goal of doing everyday something new where I am physically active. When everything kinda sucks, new things gave me hope they might be better. Ecstatic dance, skateboarding, rock climbing, hiking, paddle boarding,. It was amazing. While many thing we're incredible difficult I found my happiness because I didn't try to be good. As a newbie I could be awful. My fitness in general got better and now I'm aware of a few things I like to continue. But I will definitely continue to do every month one now thing- just for fun!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2xzdb/how_to_i_stop_myself_from_spiraling_into_obesity/hfovqj5/"}
