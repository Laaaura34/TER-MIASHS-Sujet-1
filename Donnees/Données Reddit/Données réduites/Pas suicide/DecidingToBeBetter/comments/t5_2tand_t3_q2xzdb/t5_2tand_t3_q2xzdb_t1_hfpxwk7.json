It\u2019s boring and unmotivating. The gym is the answer. Get some good music and a nice preworkout (if you must, I prefer plain black tea as a pwo) and get in there. You don\u2019t have to go balls out everyday and in fact shouldn\u2019t go hard everyday. Consistency is what matters so get in there 5 days a week. Just walk uphill for an Hour on days you\u2019re not feeling like going hard or when you need a break.\n\nAlso don\u2019t keep junk food in your home or you will eat it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2xzdb/how_to_i_stop_myself_from_spiraling_into_obesity/hfpxwk7/"}
