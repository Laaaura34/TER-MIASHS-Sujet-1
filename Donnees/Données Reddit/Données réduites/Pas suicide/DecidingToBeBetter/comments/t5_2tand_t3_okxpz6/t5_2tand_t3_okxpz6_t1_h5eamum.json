Honestly, stagnating forever feels more comfortable than moving forward and i can see myself doing that for the rest of my life. I don\u2019t want to fight anymore. I want to sleep all day and only get up to eat or drink. No school, no work, no pressure at all. \n\nMy brain just makes everyone else around me look toxic. I know they aren\u2019t, but the way I see them after a while starts to wear down on my health. I worry that my friends will leave me if they find out i\u2019m a failure. I\u2019m scared that i disappointed my parents by not getting into a good job and they\u2019re just hiding their sadness very well from me. I feel like i\u2019m not worthy of affection and care and that everyone I met in my life simply loathes my existence behind my back. \n\nSure, that might not be the case, but my brain makes it very real to me, and that\u2019s all that matters. i\u2019m just scared that i can\u2019t find anybody who my brain will not make an enemy of eventually. I don\u2019t think i will ever be able to let anybody in during this life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/okxpz6/i_have_decided_to_give_up_on_being_better/h5eamum/"}
