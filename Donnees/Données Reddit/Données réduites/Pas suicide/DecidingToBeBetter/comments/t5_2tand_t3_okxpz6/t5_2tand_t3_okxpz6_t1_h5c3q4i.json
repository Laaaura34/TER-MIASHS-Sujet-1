Sorry to hear that you got low and things keep going wrong for you.  What I see from your post is that you were living your life for other people or what you think others expect of you: pretending around friends, trying to keep up with others achievements\u2026 the only person you need to live your life for is you.  What do you enjoy, what connections would you like, what limits and boundaries will you put in place to stop yourself from getting burned out, what fulfills you and makes you happy??\n\n\nI hope you find a new path to peace and happiness that suits you, for you!!\n\nEdit; on the cutting off thing - I think you need to take a look at WHY those relationships and activities arent fulfilling - you need to learn about yourself and who you are so you can make sure you don\u2019t go from one situation to another without knowing why things are affecting / not affecting you in the right way.  If you can get access to any kind of mental health help, I\u2019d recommend it. Understanding why we do the things we do is so important in finding the right kind of life and environment to thrive (even if that\u2019s a super slow paced life)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/okxpz6/i_have_decided_to_give_up_on_being_better/h5c3q4i/"}
