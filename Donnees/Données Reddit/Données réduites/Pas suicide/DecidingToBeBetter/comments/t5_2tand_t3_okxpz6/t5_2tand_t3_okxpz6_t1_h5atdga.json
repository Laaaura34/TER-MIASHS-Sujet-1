You don't workout or perform the same workouts. \nMaybe you could consider doing something similar and just not focus on being better. Say \"for the next 7 days I'm just gonna do what I want\" and do what ever it is you want. Just maybe not things that will hurt yourself or others.\n\nIn life when we want to change we often try to change too much as once, my second thought is to simply do 1 little thing better a day. If you love drinking soda, exchange it for 1 water and drink soda for the rest. Although that's an extremely simple example the same can work for just about anything.\n\nI hope you find something that will inspire you or help you see a positive outcome. It's definitely hard when everything seems to go bad and nothing ses to bring a positive outcome.\n\nI wish you the best of luck friend and hope you can find small ways to do 1 thing better today!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/okxpz6/i_have_decided_to_give_up_on_being_better/h5atdga/"}
