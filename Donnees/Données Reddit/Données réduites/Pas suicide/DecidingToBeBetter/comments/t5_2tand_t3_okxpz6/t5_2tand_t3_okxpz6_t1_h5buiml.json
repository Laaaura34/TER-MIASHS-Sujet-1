Sometimes that deload is anywhere for 3-7 days. But I feel like it can be alot more complex\nWe each personally can take into consideration lots of variables, like\n-How stressed have I been\n-How busy have I been\n-How are my personal relationships going\n\nIn my current life things are at a pretty low level stress wisenso I feel pretty great and don't feel that im needing a break from anything.\n\nIn the end we all deserve a break every once in a while and opportunities to get away from the many stresses we face in life and often times in life If we don't purposefully seek out breaks they won't come.\n\nI hope that helps!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/okxpz6/i_have_decided_to_give_up_on_being_better/h5buiml/"}
