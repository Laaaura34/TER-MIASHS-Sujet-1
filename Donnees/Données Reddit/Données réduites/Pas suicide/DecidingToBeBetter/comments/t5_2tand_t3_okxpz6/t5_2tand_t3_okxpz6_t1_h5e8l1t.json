Honestly, fuck the whole idea of \u201cgetting back up when life kicks you down\u201d, i\u2019m just planning to not get back up and stay down until something tremendously good happens to me or i die of some freak accident. \n\nI\u2019m done changing already. Everybody else is changing for the better, and I\u2019m miles behind on the race. One step isn\u2019t going to do anything when they\u2019re leaping and bounding as I\u2019m speaking. In the end, life\u2019s pretty much one big competition where you\u2019re being compared all the time, and i\u2019m done participating if i know i\u2019m going to lose. \n\nEverything small i tried just blows up in my face, and everything smaller than that feels insignificant and useless. Since i\u2019m not in the mood to get out of the race by killing myself again, i want to stop moving altogether. I\u2019m going to go drink all the soda there is, eat all the food i want and sleep until i stop feeling tired, you feel me?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/okxpz6/i_have_decided_to_give_up_on_being_better/h5e8l1t/"}
