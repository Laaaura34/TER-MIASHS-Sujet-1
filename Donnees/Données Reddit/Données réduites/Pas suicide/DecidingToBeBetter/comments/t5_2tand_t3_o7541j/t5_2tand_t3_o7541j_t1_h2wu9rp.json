I would suggest sorting those things out first and foremost as you're getting to the age where not taking care of yourself in that regard is going to be noticeably problematic, e.g. causing anxiety/depression, among other things.\n\nWithdrawal for pot, at least in my experience, is relatively mild, but additionally marijuana tends to cause/increase anxiety not reduce it, despite what all the potheads say. I believe the indica heavy strains are supposed to be more anxiolytic, though. My suggestion would be to simply use it sparingly (not regularly) or not at all. It can be a fun diversion for awhile but a lot of people experience negative effects after some time and it can make it difficult to identify why you feel a certain way (e.g. more anxious or depressed, etc) so if it's causing issues definitely at least take a break.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o7541j/deciding_to_quit_weed_after_possible_overuse/h2wu9rp/"}
