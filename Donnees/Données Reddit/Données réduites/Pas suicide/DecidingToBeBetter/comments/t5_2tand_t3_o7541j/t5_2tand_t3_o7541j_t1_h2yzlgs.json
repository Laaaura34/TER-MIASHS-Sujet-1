Thanks for being up front about it. Proper health needs to be drilled into people like me to make improvements. It\u2019s unfortunate that I had to be scared shitless to realize it but I guess I\u2019m glad for it. As of right now I feel a lot better after resting most of the day, a lot of sweating and constant waking up but I do feel refreshed and my mind is clear. Took another trip to the ER just to get more readings and they were the same, elevated due to anxiety but overall nothing dangerous. Doc gave me a small dose anxiety prescription just in case but I honestly don\u2019t think I\u2019ll need it now. I just need to dedicate myself to taking care of my health and stay away from the flower.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o7541j/deciding_to_quit_weed_after_possible_overuse/h2yzlgs/"}
