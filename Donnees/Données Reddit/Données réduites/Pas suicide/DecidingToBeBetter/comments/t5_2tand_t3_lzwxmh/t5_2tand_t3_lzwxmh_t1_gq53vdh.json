I wish I had that sort of strength. \n\nI've been told that it will get easier with time and I'm sure it will. Keep yourself busy and take up a hobby that you can distract yourself with. \n\nI wish you the very best on your recovery journey! I know it's so so hard but hopefully one day, you'll find the one you were supposed to be with :) \n\nStay strong!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lzwxmh/depressed_and_newly_single_but_this_is_whats/gq53vdh/"}
