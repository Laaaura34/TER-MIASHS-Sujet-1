As they chatted, the dog would periodically whine and howl, as if in pain, but just continued to lie there.\n\nThe guy asked his friend if there was something wrong with the friend\u2019s dog. His friend replied that there was nothing wrong with the dog, but that it was lying on a nail sticking up from the porch.\n\nThe guy asked why the dog didn\u2019t just move, to which his friend replied, \u201cI\u2019m sure lying on a nail is painful, but for that dog, it\u2019s only painful enough to complain but not painful enough to move\u201d.\n\nIn short,  only when your threshold to what you will accept changes can you change.\u201d", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fr5j9f/change_is_hard_but_pain_is_harder/flunp0m/"}
