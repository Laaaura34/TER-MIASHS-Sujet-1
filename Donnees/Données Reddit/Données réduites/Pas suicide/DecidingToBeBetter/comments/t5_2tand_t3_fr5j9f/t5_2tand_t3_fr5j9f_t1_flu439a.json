I've gone through the same feeling, excited at first that I want to make a change but it's easier said than done unless you're willing to put in the self-discipline and work hard. Creating a simple routine and easing in to your change isn't as effective although still a step in the right direction. Overall I agree with what you're saying although from a case-by-case basis, it doesn't have to be an instantaneous thing rather than something done over time at ones own pace.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fr5j9f/change_is_hard_but_pain_is_harder/flu439a/"}
