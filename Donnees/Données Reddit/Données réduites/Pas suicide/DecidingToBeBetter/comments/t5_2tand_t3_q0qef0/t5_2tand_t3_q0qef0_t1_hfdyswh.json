After my breakup recently i got more insecure and more doubt until a few weeks ago i said fuck it i\u2019m tired of being down and i started spending money since i dont really spend it on anything, on skin care products, more protein powders and pre workouts, things that make me happy. I started taking creatine and now have even more motivation at the gym i was cutting weight now im gaining slowly and im feeling better, i still am insecure and very self doubtful but im better with confidence now and try to doubt myself less which ends up benefiting me.
