When you're with the right person then you can talk about the things that are holding you back, and you can be honest with them. \n\nI really thoroughly recommend getting your ass into therapy. This takes time and it takes work and you're going to need someone on your side who knows how to do that work. I could have gotten to where I am now a lot sooner if I hadn't been so stubborn about trying to do everything all on my own. I don't like relying on other people or asking for things because I was accustomed to being denied and let down. You're going to go through a lot of things that are uncomfortable and that you'd rather not do. \n\nMight as well do that as a part of therapy; learning and working through your shit rather than just because that's how life feels every day.\n\nYou can feel better than you do. You can be happy. You can be loved and love someone and have that be a healthy, beautiful thing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lgo2p5/can_anyone_with_mental_issues_actually_lead_a/gmtvby6/"}
