Ive grown a lot over a year\u2019s time and it might take another year to be where I truly figure myself out but I know it\u2019s possible. \n\nLoving yourself is harder than I thought, i do everything i can to better myself but I guess im reminded daily of a past that has left me where i am. Even though i have a life a lot of guys wish they had, I have a lot of trauma and baggage that i now am deciding to deal with and its not easy. Drinking used to be my solution but not anymore i cant lose anymore. \n\nGood luck to you, you\u2019re doing great so far", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lgo2p5/can_anyone_with_mental_issues_actually_lead_a/gmtf7fi/"}
