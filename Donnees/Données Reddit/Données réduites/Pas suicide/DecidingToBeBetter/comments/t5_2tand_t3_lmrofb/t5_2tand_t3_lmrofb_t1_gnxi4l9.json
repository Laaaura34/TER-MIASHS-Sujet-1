I'm in a similar situation where I feel like I've made tons of progress in my personal development, but have felt like I'm back at square 1 again due to a few random challenges that came up. It was the perfect mix to push me back into some old, self-defeating mindsets.\n\nBut if we remember the tools we've learned since trying to become better, it's impossible to go back to square 1. We know the tools that work for us, it's just a matter of using them. They're always there, despite the setbacks. Really enjoyed your perspective on how a setback like this would have had a larger effect on you a few years ago. Way to give yourself some credit, we can all give ourselves a little more credit for our efforts imo.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lmrofb/yesterday_i_cracked/gnxi4l9/"}
