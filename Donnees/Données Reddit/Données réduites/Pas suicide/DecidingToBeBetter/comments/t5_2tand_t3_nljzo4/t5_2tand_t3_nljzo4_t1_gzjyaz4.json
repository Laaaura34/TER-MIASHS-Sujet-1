I\u2019m a new manager, and at a first read, I wondered if you were someone on my team. \n\nHearing this perspective from someone on the other side is a great reminder that sometimes the fear of the unknown is scarier than the actual THING. Would you say that\u2019s true for you? \n\nYour comment is also a reminder for me to: 1. create as much transparency and clarity with my employees as possible on the intention of a meeting so it doesn\u2019t leave room for interpretation. 2. communicate early and often how an employee is performing 3. Frequently & actively acknowledge the value THEY have on the team as well as how their contributions have had an impact. \n\nI know you posted this about how YOU are deciding to be better, but I wanted you to know that you are also helping ME decide to be better. So THANK YOU.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nljzo4/i_decided_to_stop_dreading_a_call_with_my_boss/gzjyaz4/"}
