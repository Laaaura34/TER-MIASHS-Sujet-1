What was your reason for leaving in the first place (if you don't mind sharing; trying to spark some discussion because it's fun to me :D)? \n\nI think managing how you're on them is better in some ways than just completely deleting them. Social media is social after all, and it's good to have healthy communication with those that aren't as close with you in real life. I'm proud of you for managing your usage with these apps :D go bestie (can I call you bestie) go !!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o7uyb4/i_deleted_instagram_snapchat_on_january_1_2021/h32duv4/"}
