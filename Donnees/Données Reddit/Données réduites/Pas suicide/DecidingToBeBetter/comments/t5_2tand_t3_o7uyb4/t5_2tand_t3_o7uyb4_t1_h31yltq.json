I remember downloading Snapchat before freshman year of high school, only because a girl I liked had it and I thought that it would be easier for me to become social with her if I had it too. I was right about that, but she ended up cheating on me anyway (via Snapchat, ironically) so we obviously broke up. I didn\u2019t have much of a legitimate use for it after that, and I began to miss the days when I didn\u2019t have to carry the social responsibilities that come with an app like that. The only thing that was holding me back from deleting it was the fact that I had a ton of friends on there, way more than I do on regular messaging. But I\u2019ve decided that it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ll see these same people at my school, and I\u2019ll be able to socialize with them for real. \n\nI also realized how diabolical streaks are. It\u2019s clearly just a way for Snapchat to get you to look at your phone more. You\u2019re afraid to lose your streaks because you\u2019re afraid that your friend might get mad at you, but it\u2019s ultimately pointless. Just a number. It\u2019s smart, but it sucks.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o7uyb4/i_deleted_instagram_snapchat_on_january_1_2021/h31yltq/"}
