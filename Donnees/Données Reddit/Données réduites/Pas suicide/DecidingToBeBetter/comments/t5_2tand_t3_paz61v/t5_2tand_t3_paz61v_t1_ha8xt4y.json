Not in a malicious way, but in a more \u201cwhy can\u2019t I help them stop being dumb\u201d kind of way. I love helping people, but it takes a toll on me mentally. I\u2019m not religious but my therapist taught me a saying whenever I\u2019m having random thoughts about others running through my head that I also use whenever I\u2019m thinking about what I\u2019m about to say and whether or not it\u2019s gossip. She says is this my business, your business, or gods business. That phrase alone has helped me a lot, but it\u2019s not a perfect system.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/paz61v/decided_not_to_gossip/ha8xt4y/"}
