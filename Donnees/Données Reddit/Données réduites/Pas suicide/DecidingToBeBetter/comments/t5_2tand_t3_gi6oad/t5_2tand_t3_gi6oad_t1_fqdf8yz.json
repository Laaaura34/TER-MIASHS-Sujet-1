Time compounds and before you know it you won\u2019t touch it or feel the urge for it. You will laugh at how simple it actually is to resist once you\u2019ve done so for long enough. \n\nI was hospitalized and told that sugar feeds bad bacteria in the gut which was in turn causing me severe pain. I\u2019m better now but I see sugar as the enemy and poison for the body. It\u2019s the same with alcohol and smoking. \n\nI struggled for a couple weeks trying to figure out what I was going to have instead. Sometimes it isn\u2019t the change that\u2019s hard but the lack of planning. What are you going to do if you hit a blank on what you should have? Tea is a good one! But if there\u2019s no tea? Water and if there\u2019s no water you need to decide to not have anything. \n\nYou can do this prior to your decision or learn along the way. After the withdrawals or cravings it\u2019s smooth sailing and now the only muscle you need to develop is the \u201cNO\u201d muscle. \n\nIf someone offers to pour you soda/alcohol or give you a smoke! NO! what are you doing bro! I\u2019m not a smoker! (Remember the identity change) I don\u2019t drink that anymore! \n\nAt the end of the day no one is perfect and you may accidentally fail. Don\u2019t even think of rewarding yourself with either cigs or alcohol cause that would be a really bad idea. \n\nYou love this girl and you said you want to marry her. Make her proud and stick to the change. Also think of how you\u2019re probably damaging yourself by consuming those 2. \n\nMy grandpa told me once that anything too much is poison for the body. \n\nYou got this brother! I believe in you! It gets easy as time progresses so don\u2019t beat yourself up over intrum and early results. Celebrate them. But remember you playing for the end game! \n\nYou got this!\n\n[Edit]\nPs: the goal is to be like a vegan who says no to meat! You want to have that same commitment to say no to a smoke or drink lol.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gi6oad/i_found_the_one_i_know_i_have_to_be_a_better/fqdf8yz/"}
