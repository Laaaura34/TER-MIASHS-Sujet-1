Can you think of a more horrible sin than profiting off of selling slaves? Yet he wrote this beautiful redemption song that has touched and brought joy and peace to people of all races for and walks of life for centuries and across the whole world. I think that's the point of feeling sorry and seeking redemption, because \"to err is human,\" we all make mistakes, and there is a deep and very human beauty in swallowing our pride and owning up to these mistakes then moving past them. It is humbling. \n\nIf you are a spiritual person, you might explore religion to process this. If not, then some heavy literature like \"crime and punishment\" exploring these topics. Some of the most beautiful and profound works of art come from rock bottom, or at least recalling it. If you are a creative, then maybe make art inspired by what you are going through.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p7k43n/is_there_truly_redemption_for_the_worst_of_us/h9mckxn/"}
