Funny enough, I\u2019m also getting ripped in 2020. I think its a good start to changing the world. We can\u2019t fall into the all or nothing trap when we\u2019re trying to do good. If you help one person, even yourself, that changes their world. From that point, the ball\u2019s rolling. Each time you help makes a difference to that person. \n\nI think social work is a very noble goal. With each person you help, you can enable them to help others, and teach them to enable others to help.
