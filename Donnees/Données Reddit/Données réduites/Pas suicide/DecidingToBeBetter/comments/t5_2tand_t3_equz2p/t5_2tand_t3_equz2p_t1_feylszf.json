Even if I might bring huge amounts of energy to a topic at start, I often fail to have a last glim of willpower soon after. \n\nThats why in my life I barely ever managed to stick to one topic of acitivities, which is a shame in many ways. Now I find myself beeing stuck with studies that I didnt chose to do myself, work and workouts. The later two I do enjoy doing.\n\nSo I dont find myself having a lot of time to try other things, but I should def do social work again part time and have set the next impuls towards that today.\n\nOther then that Id be very greatful for more advice on how to foster self discipline and building good new habits, such as breaking with old ones.\n\nIve read many books and articles on it, watched a ton lot of videos, did my own even, yet I still dont see myself having a break through. I dont know if there is such a thing, or if it is just small steps at a time? So maybe I cant see the breakthrough bc it is streched over time so long. \n\nStill I see many other people in my age doing much better in that regard and I wonder. Please help!
