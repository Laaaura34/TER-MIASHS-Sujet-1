No amount of drug, no amount of mix. \n\nWhen I finally came to terms with that, I realized that even with drugs and sex I was suffering. Why not get back in shape and do the hard work for a better life since either way is suffering with the mind I was given.\n\nSo now I'm working my way to a few goals. Move out on my own. Get healthy and cut vices. And figure out my life financially when I get a job again as just a starter stepping stone. \n\nA quote I like that similar: \"Either we make ourself miserable. Or we make ourselves strong. The amount of work is the same\" -unknown\n\nEdit: wow. Wtf! I got a gold! Thank you so much. It made my day. Never thought I'd get a gold. Guess it's TRUE, never say never lol. Thanks again", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/knb2xq/adulthood_occurs_when_one_realizes_that_its/ghkgqpb/"}
