Also kudos for noticing and realizing that for the second time you started to feel anxious because you got reminded of your sickness, not because you actually felt (that) sick by that time.\n\nI've had my fair share of these kinda experiences, especially in uni, and although I didn't love all of my classes, I was still in a more energetic and confident mood when I stayed and finished the classes/exams after feeling anxious. Sometimes even rewarded myself with a snack afterwards, haha", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/onpnix/i_didnt_let_my_anxiety_win_and_finished_my_shift/h5ux46v/"}
