I wish I had some advice, but I'm on the journey, just like you. I also recorded myself and found habits that I didn't notice I was doing, like not making eye contact, so I've been using those recordings to help me out. But I also have social anxiety, and that's a major reason why I can't speak around people and my mind literally goes blank so I end up appearing really stupid and afraid. Is this also something you think you might experience (social anxiety)? If so, you could try considering therapy (although, it's hypocritical of me to recommend because I don't go lol).", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ncp91j/i_feel_stupid/gy6krvs/"}
