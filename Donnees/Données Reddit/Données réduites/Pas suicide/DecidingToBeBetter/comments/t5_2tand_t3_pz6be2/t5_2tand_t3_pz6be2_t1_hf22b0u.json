I take my dogs for early walkies , I can see the stars, it\u2019s so peaceful..basically I realized that the more I do straight away, the less productive I have to be in the afternoon.\n\n- I\u2019m in bed by 9PM!!\n- usually have a list of things I wanna achieve before leaving for work\n- have comfy clothes right next to bed, so I know I won\u2019t be uncomfortable after leaving bed. \n-make tea ( I have no coffee or caffeine)it\u2019s just to warm my soul a bit \n- go out for a walk by 5:20, then I stretch, then I run 20min\n-get home and have a shower- FINISHING WITH FREEZING COLD SHOWER for a minute or so will absolutely change your whole mood seriously \n\nAnd yeah basically everytime I do this, I have this mindset of having successful day ahead of me, full of energy.\nEspecially if I manage to put a wash on or even make a roast or clean a bit\u2026 then I know I can just chill when I get back home from work \n\nWithout the workout and cold shower..I feel tired as shit and I\u2019m grumpy by 10AM.\nI think you neeed to really push yourself the first two weeks, then it\u2019s easier. \nGood luck", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pz6be2/how_do_i_turn_myself_into_a_morning_person/hf22b0u/"}
