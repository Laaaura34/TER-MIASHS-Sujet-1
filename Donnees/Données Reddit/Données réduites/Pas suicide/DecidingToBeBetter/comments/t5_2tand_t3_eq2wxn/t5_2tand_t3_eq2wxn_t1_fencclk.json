Do you feel like it gets you outside of your comfort zone? If not, then the choice is easy: don't travel. \n\nJust to give my personal perspective, I've been on a student exchange for 4 months to Singapore and 4 months to India. I went to India because it made me uncomfortable. Now that I'm back and friends are talking about traveling, I don't care at all. I don't have the need for it so why would I do it? \n\nIt seems like you have made up your mind and you're just looking for confirmation/validation. Trust your instincts and do what is good for you in the long run and what makes you happy and fulfilled. If that is something else than traveling, that is perfectly fine!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eq2wxn/is_traveling_a_necessity_confused_mindset/fencclk/"}
