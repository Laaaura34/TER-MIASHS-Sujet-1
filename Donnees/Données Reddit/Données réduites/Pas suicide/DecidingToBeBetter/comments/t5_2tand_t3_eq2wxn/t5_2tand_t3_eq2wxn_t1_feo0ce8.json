No one is pressuring no one, unless you are pressuring yourself. There is no \"requirement\" to travel. In fact, I know some people who refuse to travel because its hassle on their part. No need to impress others. If you don't want to, then don't.   \n\n\nPersonally, I travel because I want to see something different from my country.
