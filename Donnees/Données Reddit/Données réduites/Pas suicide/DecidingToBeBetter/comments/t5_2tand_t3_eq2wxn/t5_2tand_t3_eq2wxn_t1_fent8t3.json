You're a different person. If YOU want to travel once or twice a year or not at all, then that's your choice! Whatever makes you happy is what you should pursue (taking into consideration the consequences of your actions etc. of course). It's easier said than done, but fuck what social media is telling you. You do you.\n\nAlso, trying to visit as many places as possible just to say you've been there or tick off some list isn't really getting the most out of travelling in my opinion. That's a very superficial way to approach travelling, or anything for that matter, and reflects a deeper flaw within a person.
