You're at a stage where you are understanding and coming to terms with what happened and how it might impact the rest of your life. You're going to be thinking very reactively for a long time. That's because all you know is survival. You have never been given the grace or love to determine your own needs. You've had terrible things done to you, and your brain reacts by putting you in a heightened state of survival. Like anything, it just takes practice recalibrating your perspective.  \n\n\nStart slow. It is not a straight line. \n\nAnd honestly, you are doing great. My life story reads like an episode of intervention until 25.  \n\n\nPlease feel free to reach out to me. This type of trauma, especially when you're at an age where you might not be totally sure of your sexuality, is devastating.   \n\n\nIt took me a decade to determine that I'm bisexual, and the trauma mixed with the general confusion made my journey so much harder. I would hate for you to go down the path of numbing and reenacting your trauma, because the reality is, you will traumatize yourself trying to escape the trauma.  \n\n\nI want to end by saying that I think you are incredibly tough and truly  a badass person. You have survived a dark souls level of difficulty in your first 18 years of life. You don't ever have to prove anything to anyone.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgus7h/im_at_the_point_where_quitting_seems_to_be_the/hi9ziaa/"}
