And eventually after a while of working things out yourself and having someone there to help you through it you will get better I promise. I\u2019m almost 30 now and while everyday is different and some are more challenging then others I\u2019m much happier then I was 5-6 years ago. \n\nDon\u2019t give up my friend, there is a lot of beauty in the world all you need to do it pull yourself out of the hole you\u2019re in and look past the hurt. And you can do it, look at all you\u2019ve been through already! To go through all of this suffering and sadness and you are still here means you are very strong!
