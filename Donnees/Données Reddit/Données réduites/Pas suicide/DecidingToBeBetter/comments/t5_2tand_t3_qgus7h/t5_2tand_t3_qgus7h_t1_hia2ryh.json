Build on what has happened and give hope and guidance to many others who face the same. But it will have to start first with you and as you rise up, you will raise many more. \nLet me know if I can DM you some specific information. \n\nI am not saying it\u2019ll be easy, but it\u2019s good to realize no matter where we are, going in the right direction starts with just one small step in that direction.
