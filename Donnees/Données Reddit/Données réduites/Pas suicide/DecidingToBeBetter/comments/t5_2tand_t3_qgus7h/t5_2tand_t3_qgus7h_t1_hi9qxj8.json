I cant imagine the pain you felt having to hold all that in, and I wont pretend I do. Thank you for sharing with us, and I'm glad to hear you see a therapist! \n\nAre you connecting with them? Maybe you should see someone who you are more comfortable discussing this with. Also, dealing with the ghosts in your past takes time and patience, if you give up now, they will haunt you for the rest of your life and you will never grow past them.\n\nSounds like brother is doing some growing and may not be exactly proud of his actions/who he is. Thats okay, we all feel like that sometimes, the best thing to do is make sure you are safe and comfortable around him and letting him know you accept him for who he is, your brother. HEll, maybe even saying that you only ever feel safe around him is worth a shot, let him know how you feel and he may let you know how he feels.\n\nPlease don't give up!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgus7h/im_at_the_point_where_quitting_seems_to_be_the/hi9qxj8/"}
