I agree with u/CannedAm, at least let your brother know he's safe with you.  In his own time, he'll come back around.\n\nFor you, I get that you're feeling defeated and you're probably sick of trying to heal.  Good that you reached out to the Redditverse.  Maybe it's time to tell your therapist that it's not working out, and find someone else.\n\nAnd yeah, there are a lot of shitty people in the world.  And there are lots more people who are just busy with their own stuff.  And then there are people in the world who will be angels to you.  They're out there. \n\nGood luck with you and your healing journey.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgus7h/im_at_the_point_where_quitting_seems_to_be_the/hi9saub/"}
