I hope everything does get better after all!\n\n Therapy isn\u2019t the cure.  YOU are the cute, therapy is just a space and a tool that offers you the opportunity to do that necessary internal work.  Ultimately, you have to feel it to heal it.  You have to get vulnerable and say the stuff that\u2019s most painful to say out loud and really try be honest with yourself and your therapist about the hardest things, otherwise it doesn\u2019t work the way it\u2019s intended to.  And it\u2019s important to have a therapist you really connect with because otherwise it won\u2019t be easy to share all this vulnerable stuff.  But the potential for healing is there for everyone, and the healing comes from within.  And even when you\u2019re scared, you\u2019re stronger than you know.  But nothing much changes until you start getting vulnerable and really wading waist deep through all the painful bullshit.  I hope this helps.
