It must have been so painful to learn that you weren't alone in your abuse, when your brother shared and then to have him cold shoulder you. I bet he felt vulnerable telling you, too and maybe that is why he's withdrawn from you. Reach out and let him know he is safe with you and that you have felt safe with him. Maybe he s gay. Maybe he's trans, maybe he's experimenting. Does it matter? I feel like you would still be safe for him in any of those cases, but maybe he's scared you will reject him. Let him know he is safe with you. Obviously, that connection is important to you.\n\nHealing hurts. It really does. You have to practice self care. Draw back from things that make you feel worse when you're raw from the healing and telling and reliving. Be gentle to yourself. Reach out to the ones you feel safe with and tell them you are struggling and need their support.\n\nYou are going to be amazing when you come through this. You will come through this. Look what you have already survived!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgus7h/im_at_the_point_where_quitting_seems_to_be_the/hi9bui2/"}
