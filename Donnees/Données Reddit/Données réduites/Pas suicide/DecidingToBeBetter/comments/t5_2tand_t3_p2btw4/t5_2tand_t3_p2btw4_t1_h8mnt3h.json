Trying to think 30 years would only serve to stress me out more - that is the part of \"adulting\" that I struggle with, same as OP. My thought process goes - \"I am already struggling to make sense of past 30 years of my life or wtf I am doing right now; and now as part of adulting - you want me to think about the next 30 years already?? Oh man, this adulting never ends!!\" \n\nFully agree with your example. Working on an immediate broken down goal like that works very well usually. Keeps it light and does not overwhelm. You also see quick results on tiny goals like that, and that gratification serves as fuel to keep achieving other tiny goals. I find that trying to plan/achieve big goals intimidates me so much I will give up before I try and never make the small strides even.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8mnt3h/"}
