If it makes you feel better, I\u2019m in my mid-twenties and haven\u2019t gotten my drivers license yet (my parents never taught me and I\u2019m a bit scared, but trying to get there) and it\u2019s taken me roughly 6 years to get a bachelor\u2019s and I have to add time on. I STILL don\u2019t know if what I\u2019m pursuing is exactly what I want to do, but you know what? Degrees open doors even if it\u2019s not in the field you study in. We are all on different paths, enduring different struggles and twists and turns, and our journey is our own. The best thing I ever did was stop comparing myself to others my age. You might be like me and have many interests, that in and of itself is awesome because now you have all these options. Work on your writing if you want to, pursue that degree if you feel it\u2019ll help you, but most importantly- have faith in yourself, your purpose, and your life! You\u2019ve got this and I\u2019m rooting for you!!! You\u2019ll figure it all out; perhaps there are other things that need attention first? Keep pushing despite it all.\n\nP.S. I also don\u2019t know how to adult and I\u2019ve been in the same shitty apartment and financial situation for 7 years; I\u2019ve tried getting coaching and figuring it out, but hey. It is what it is and being a student makes it more difficult to make good money until you graduate. We\u2019re all just wingin it out here.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8k6wzu/"}
