Start building up small victories to build up your sense of self-efficacy, and make sure that you're spending time with good friends who make you happy. Eat healthy, sleep properly. If none of this is helping, talk to a doctor and get screened for depression.\n\nI also suggestion that you try different part time jobs so you get a feel for what kind of environment you like to work in. There are career assessment resources online-- do some questionnaires and see what comes up. Consider talking to people who work in an industry that you're interested in so you get an idea of whether or not it's for you.\n\nAlso, build some adulting skills while you're at home with your parents. Learn to cook, manage your finances, stuff like that. These might be small easy goals, because there isn't so much pressure on yourself to succeed the first time.\n\nGood luck. You'll get there. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8m7pni/"}
