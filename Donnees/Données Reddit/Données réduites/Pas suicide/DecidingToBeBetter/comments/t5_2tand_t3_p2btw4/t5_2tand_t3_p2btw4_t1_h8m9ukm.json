I'm 32 and have had 26 jobs, if that makes you feel any better lol. I'm finally in something I like now and am consistently motivated about (and been here 1.5 yrs already, longest of my full time jobs). And I'm lucky to have happened on to this job when it could have been failure 27. I don't care about the industry or company, it's definitely not \"my passion\" but it's interesting, makes enough money, and there's enough movement that my brain is happy with spending my days toiling at this.\n\n Maybe getting your associates just isn't working out for you, or you want to take care of yourself, or you're not challenged, or you've outgrown your current place, or need a good therapist to figure out what's going on. When I try so hard to do things that just don't fit what I need at that time it never works out. For me, if I had this career path in another phase of life I bet I would have petered out like the rest. I had some major life changes that forced me into a new environment and true life adulting / taking care of myself, which it feels like I needed for my brain to grow out of the old way.
