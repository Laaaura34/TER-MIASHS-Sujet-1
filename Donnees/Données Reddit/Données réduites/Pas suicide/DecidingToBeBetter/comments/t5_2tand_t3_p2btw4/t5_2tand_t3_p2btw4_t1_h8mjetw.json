My advices is just keep doing something, anything. Whatever it is, hold down a job, Invest effort into your relationships, spend time doing your hobbies, whatever it may be just keep on living your life and enjoy the things that matter in life regardless of careers. Even people who \"have it figured out,\" still complain that their life's could be better. I worked at a hospital for sometime; there I would talk to Dr.s and nurses, high earners, educated people with proper titles in life and learned from that. One, more money, more problems. Two, they face the same struggles regarding sacrificing time with loved ones for the time it takes for \"career success.\" We're all just people trying to find meaning in our life's and \"having everything,\" doesn't necessarily translate to a life you'd be proud to have lived in the future when looking back. So keep on living your life, don't get stuck on an idealistic view of life and end up missing out on living. When we die non of that will matter, what will matter are the things that we often overlooked anyways.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8mjetw/"}
