All I can say though, is look for things you like PRACTICING and EXERCISING. What I mean by this find something you enjoying the process of doing, instead of the outcome or status, income, results, etc.\n\nFor example, I moonlight my 9-5 as a photographer. I grew up dreaming of being a travel/adventure photographer and photojournalist and never wanted to be in a desk. I always just liked listening to people, taking photos, socializing and being creative. As a photographer, I NEVER wanted to do weddings. Seemed boring, to clich\u00e9, and what ever other photographer was doing. But also had to make money. And you know what? I really enjoy it. I get to socialize, I get to observe cool moments and celebrations and I get to use my love for photography to make extra money. It's the practice I enjoy, and it makes the job interesting and allows me to sell motivate. So while it's not my dream job, I love exercising and practicing my photography through it. It's like a muscle.\n\nAs for my desk job? I hate it and I'm still trying to figure out what I wanna do when I grow up too.\n\nIf you can, take the time to discover what you like to practice and exercise everyday. Creativity, freedom and purpose come with mastery.\n\nSorry for any spelling mistakes, on mobile, at my desk..", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8lixwq/"}
