I had a career making 100k when I was 22, 23, 24. I got a good reputation, ended up being able to join a startup and attract investors to it (and still have an offer to invest in my next one, whatever I do), blah blah blah. Also ended up addicted to heroin along the way, for a while. It's not as great as it's made out to be. Well, the heroin is, but the rest isn't. It's a ton of stress, and questioning whether your purpose in life is really just to do _this_. I've simplified my life -- basically ended up following the same path as some of the other people in this thread -- and I'm much, much happier.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8kkd1m/"}
