It\u2019s probably from the days when we lived with about 5 job prospects and most were you follow the family career. The best you can do is find a job you enjoy most of the time. It doesn\u2019t have to be the best but as long as you enjoy it. There\u2019s no defining moment in time when you have an Epiphany and realise oh I want to do that. Sometimes it\u2019s settling in to what you have and enjoying where you are. If it\u2019s not right don\u2019t be afraid to move on. I hope you find hope in this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8k6rv5/"}
