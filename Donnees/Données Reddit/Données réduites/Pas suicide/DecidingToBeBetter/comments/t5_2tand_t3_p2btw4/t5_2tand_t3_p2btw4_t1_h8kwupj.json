I still have no clue what I want to do, but I managed to get into a coding bootcamp and so this is the path I've chosen for now. It's still not my passion, but I get A LOT of people asking \"Do you love coding? Is it your passion?\" and I just think \"No... Should it be?\".   \n\n\nI keep thinking I should love what I do for a job and it feels overwhelming to not be able to find that. Knowing I'm not alone makes me feel so much better.   \n\n\nHow do you find yourself progressing in your career if it's not a passion though? I find that if you're not willing to put extra hours in then how are you going to progress? Surely you have to at least somewhat love what you do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8kwupj/"}
