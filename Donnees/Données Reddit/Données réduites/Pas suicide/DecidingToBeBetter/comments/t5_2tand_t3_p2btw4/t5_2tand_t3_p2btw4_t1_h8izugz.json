Maybe little Sarah was always meant to be a teacher. And Adrian was always meant to be a cop. But for other people like me and maybe you, that\u2019s not really a thing. I feel like we put too much pressure on ourselves to make it a thing and to only work for something we are passionate about. Now at 36, I\u2019m starting to think that\u2019s bs. It\u2019s just a job! A way to make money. We can still be passionate in life about things that matter without it being our full time,  money making job. \n\nI personally studied business because it\u2019s generic and you can use it for a lot of different roles. After school I applied for a bunch of random jobs; everything that crossed my path basically. I took the best offer after some interviews. And when I got bored at that company, I applied for more random jobs and took the next best offer. I just kept taking the next best step in front of me. Now I make 6 figures and work for a large corporation in marketing. Is it my passion? Nope. But my coworkers are nice, I have tons of flexibility and it pays the bills well.  I can easily do my passions on the side and have the money to do so.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8izugz/"}
