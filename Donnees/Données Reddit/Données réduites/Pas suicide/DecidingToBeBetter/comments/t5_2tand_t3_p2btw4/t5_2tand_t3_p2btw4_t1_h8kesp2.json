My younger brother got an apprenticeship at 16 and he's been earning more money than me since then, and he's always been more comfortable financially, but now I've found coaching, I feel like I've found my life's purpose and the earning potential is definitely vast, too.\n\nHopefully, you'll find something soon, you just have to keep positive and be open to accepting things into your life. I would have loved to have been a screenwriter, but honestly, I just felt too mentally drained from my day job, that I couldn't think of anything creative. I always felt that the writing had to come naturally from within and not something you force, which is probably why you struggle, too. Alternatively, it could even be that you just need to find the passion again. A few years ago, I went to screenwriting evening classed and just being around others with the same interest helped me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8kesp2/"}
