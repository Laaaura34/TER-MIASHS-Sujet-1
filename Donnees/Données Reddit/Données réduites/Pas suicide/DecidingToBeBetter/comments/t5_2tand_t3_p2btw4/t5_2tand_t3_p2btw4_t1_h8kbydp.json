Well its too late now you best give up - JK.  Thinking that way you are setting yourself up for failure.  So you've messed around spinning your wheels, no big deal.  Not everyone gets the career of their dreams in fact I would bet the majority of people do not.  Look at me - I went to school for Art Education and now work in data analytics for a health insurance company.  I never knew what I wanted to do but through time, experience, and hard work ended up where I am today.  I still have passions and hobbies that fulfill me, just don't make me money and that's OK.  So just finish school and get that piece of paper - once you have it no one can take that away from you.  Employers also look at the fact that you worked to get that piece of paper regardless of the degree written on it and that counts for something.  Start working for a company that has potential opportunity for advancement and keep writing  as you seem to enjoy it.  You never know what opportunities will come your way - just keep your eyes open.  I didn't move out of my parents house until I was 25/26 and didn't really start to make any real money until after 30.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8kbydp/"}
