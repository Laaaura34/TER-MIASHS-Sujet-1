You are not alone.  There are so many others in our age group (I'm 29) that feel the same.  I think it's probably a lot more people than you think.  And just focusing on the fact that so many others have no idea what to do for a Job, or what would be an ideal job, is a little bit refreshing and helps to not be so overly critical of ourselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a Computer Engineering dropout, 4/5 years, and not being able to graduate and then going back for a different degree and dropping out again really smashed my confidence and self esteem.  But I also thought that I was pretty alone and other people wouldn't understand. \n\nBut people are so good at hiding their feelings, many friends from school have \"careers\" and they aren't happy at all.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPoint is you may never find your ideal career, but you have to try different things and figure it out for yourself.  Stop listening to everyone, that was my biggest mistake. \"you're good at math and science, be an engineer\" or \"you're a good natural salesman, you should sell insurance\" both ended up being terrible fits for me. But now I know and can keep trying other things.  \n\nFind a hobby or 2 that you enjoy and is a positive impact on your life.  I thank the old gods and the new that I have DISC GOLF, and longboarding, otherwise I would have probably given up years ago.    \n\n\nOne love wish you the best", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8l20tv/"}
