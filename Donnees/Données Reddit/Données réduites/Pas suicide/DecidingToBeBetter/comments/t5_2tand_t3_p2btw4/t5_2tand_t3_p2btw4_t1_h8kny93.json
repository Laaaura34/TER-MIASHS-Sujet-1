In fact only few people have the luxury of doing what they love and be paid for it. Even the people who do what they love might hate their job because they don\u2019t get to do it the way they want eg be a landscape photographer but only weddings make money so all you get to shoot is weddings or artists who only get paid to paint art their clients like but they hate it. \n\nI\u2019m younger than you but totally understand how your feeling. I switched majors twice in college and even switched degrees. I flip flopped into wanting to go into 10 different careers during my 4 years and finally after getting a degree in neuroscience and marketing, I ended up working in tech consulting which is my current job. It\u2019s not my passion but im fresh out university (well will be in 3 months while I work full time) and just looking to experience in a field that is semi interesting and pays the bills.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8kny93/"}
