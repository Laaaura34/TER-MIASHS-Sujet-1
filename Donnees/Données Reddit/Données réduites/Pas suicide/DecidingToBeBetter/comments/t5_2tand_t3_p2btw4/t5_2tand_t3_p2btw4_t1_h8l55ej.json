Don\u2019t buy into the hype that people have their shit figured out. \n\nSome of are just really good at pretending and even temporarily convincing ourselves. \n\nI would suggest just starting small. Have a routine of going for a run, cleaning, etc. and then start to add other small things. \n\nTo add to that, it definitely sounds like school is not your thing and that is way okay in this day and age. I would say use online classes like on udemy to add skills over school. This will provided you with way more flexibility in what you learn, when you learn, and the cost is substantially less over traditional school. \n\nYour routine could consist of just an hour or two of online classes.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8l55ej/"}
