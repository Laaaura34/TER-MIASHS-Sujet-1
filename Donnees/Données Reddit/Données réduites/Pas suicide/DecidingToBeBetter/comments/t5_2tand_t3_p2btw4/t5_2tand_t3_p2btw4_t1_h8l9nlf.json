I do career consulting and planning and have worked with quite a few folks that were in pretty bad places. A mother who hasn\u2019t worked for 16 years to take care of her dying husband, and people who have lost motivation throughout their careers. \n\nThe most important part is perspective. Everything has multiple \u201ctruths\u201d. I don\u2019t have much detail about your situation, but based on what you\u2019ve said so far, I can think of the following:\n\nYou\u2019ve changed majors 6 times, so you have a wide grasp of several industries\n\nYou\u2019re creative - or at least have been - and that isn\u2019t something you can \u2018teach\u2019 or \u2018unlearn\u2019. So I bet you still are creative. You just need some motivation.\n\nYou know how to write. And I mean that in the way of communicating an idea to reach an objective. You were once good at that. Again, that is not something you can \u2018unlearn\u2019 and that is a skill that many people who are working high positions don\u2019t have. (Example 2 days ago I asked an executive when he had time to discuss some proposals that we received. His answer was \u201cYes.\u201d) \n\nOne thing that gives me hope in terms of helping you is that you say everything you try you feel exhausted. What I hear is that at least you\u2019re trying stuff. Whether you finish or make it to the end, we can help with that. But the hardest part is taking the first step, and it sounds like you\u2019ve taken many \u2018first steps\u2019. I\u2019m really happy to know that you haven\u2019t given up yet. \n\nFeel free to reach out. My services are \u201cfree\u201d. You can choose to pay whatever you want if it helps. All I ask in return is that I can use you as a success story to help others if we do end up working together", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8l9nlf/"}
