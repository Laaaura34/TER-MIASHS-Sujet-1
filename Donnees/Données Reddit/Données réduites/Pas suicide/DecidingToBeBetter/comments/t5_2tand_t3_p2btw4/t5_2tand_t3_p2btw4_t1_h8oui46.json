Thanks for sharing these insights from your life.\n\nIt sounds like you had to suffer a bit in your 20s while trying to figure things out. I\u2019m glad you found your way and are enjoying your life and career.\n\nFor me, your story shows that you don\u2019t have to have it all figured out at any one point, and that it\u2019s so very easy to suffer when you feel lost and see everyone around you \u201cdoing it right\u201d. Also, you had to wait to find a career that worked for you, to find your way, and your way wasn\u2019t exactly conventional. \n\nAnd if you think about it, you wouldn\u2019t have your career now without the unconventional path you took that led up to it. So in a way, you were never lost, though at the time you didn\u2019t realize it because everything and everyone around you was signaling to you that something was wrong with where you were at that time.\n\nI\u2019m sure we both wish the same experience for OP, and one with even less pain! But whatever their experience, I also hope that they can realize that there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with them or their path right now, so there\u2019s no need at all to beat themself up inside. Just keep showing up each day and be compassionate toward yourself and others!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8oui46/"}
