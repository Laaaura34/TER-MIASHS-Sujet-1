And here are some conclusions I\u2019ve come to:\n\nMost people don\u2019t have one specific thing they were meant to do, and a lot of the time if you try to make a career out of your passions you will begin to hate what you once loved. My solution has been to find something that I can make a living off of while having a flexible schedule and not have to do too much work. For me, that\u2019s been video editing, both freelance and with production companies. \n\nFor the screenwriting thing, I think that a lot of why that sort of pursuit will die out before it even begins is due to self doubt and uncertainty. You probably don\u2019t actually believe that you will ever be a successful screenwriter, and you aren\u2019t sure about the million things you\u2019d have to do to get something like that off the ground, and the anxiety of all that hits you at once when you sit down to write. \n\nBut nobody is a waste of space purely because they don\u2019t have a \u201ccalling\u201d. If you support yourself and are a generally decent human being you\u2019re doing better than a lot of people out there.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8l0owj/"}
