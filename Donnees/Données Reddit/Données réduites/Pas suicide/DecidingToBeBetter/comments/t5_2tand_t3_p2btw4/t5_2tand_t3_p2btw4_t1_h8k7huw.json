While that is logical to some degree especially in my case (foreign student, extremely selective job market and the natural tendency of going for a doctorate in my field: no thank you) I ended up overthinking, got scared too much thinking of future responsibilities, ended up scaring myself for current ones and well... Laying in bed scrolling on the phone, abandoning my academic year and went through a lil hospitalization. This is why I totally agree with you. While everyone should be a little conscious about life and take advantage of opportunities (in order to find something pursuable), overthinking about life and especially career paths can destroy someone. So yeah, don\u2019t think about it too much OP. People are sharing their own experiences but even when it isn\u2019t always shared, you never know someone\u2019s mental state: On paper I\u2019m this strong person that went for a reputable academic path against all odds but in reality I\u2019m just a miserable mess.
