Just like all the other animals, we are not necessarily meant to be here for a specific purpose, we are just here. Here to observe life and to enjoy it. Some of us naturally feel a special attraction to a particular profession or cause, others don't. Neither one is good or bad, it just is. That being said, it is helpful to have a profession that sustains comfortable living at a minimum.\n\nI know this might be a strange offer but here it is. I've got a decent track record of helping friends and family members your age figure out what's next. I'm no professional coach, just a happy person with a good job and a few kids. I'm happy to talk and help figure out a short list of realistic options you might like.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/h8kj67n/"}
