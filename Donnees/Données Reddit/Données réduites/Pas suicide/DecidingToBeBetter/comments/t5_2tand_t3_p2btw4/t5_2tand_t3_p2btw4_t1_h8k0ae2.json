Your post is almost I would describe my current self. I am 27M and I am just finishing my masters in very prospective field, but it looks like that no job offer really interests me.\n\nI am not lazy. I am working hard, but as you said everything exhausts me to the point I just lay in bed or scrolling on the phone. My philosophy was always: \"work hard and don't think about your calling (future). It will come along.\". Damn, it looks like I was wrong. \n\nBut on the other hand don't sweat it too much (dumb advice I know). Work towards your interests, but stay grounded in your expectations. The more options you keep open, the more possibilities you have to finally find out what makes you happy.\n\nAnd it is not too late. 30s i nowhere near end of the life. Push through it!
