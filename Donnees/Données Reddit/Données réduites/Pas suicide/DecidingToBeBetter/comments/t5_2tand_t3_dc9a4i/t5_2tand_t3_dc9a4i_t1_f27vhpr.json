I'm not even letting myself go inside a gas station right now because I am so impulsive and don't trust myself to not just blurt out my brand and end up with a pack. Congrats to you on quitting! The longest I've made it was 6 months and that was 5 or 6 years ago. I'd been switching between vapes and mouth tobacco and I just got tired of this addiction controlling my life and my damn wallet. I don't make enough money to let that happen, nor do I have health insurance so I've been playing a risky ass game so far. Keep it up! Thanks for the support :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dc9a4i/i_didnt_smoke_yesterday_and_im_proud_of_myself/f27vhpr/"}
