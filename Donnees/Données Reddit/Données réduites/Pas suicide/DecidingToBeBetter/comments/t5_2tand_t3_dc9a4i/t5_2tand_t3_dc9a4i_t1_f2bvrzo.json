If you continue to feel that way, it may be a good idea to look for some professional counseling. If I actually felt comfortable doing so or had the money I would probably be doing it myself. I can't stand the medical side of it though. Like just give me a friend with some goddamn credentials and I'll pay them for listening... Anyways, for real good luck with quitting. I hope it helps you out. If it doesn't just keep looking for solutions, it may not happen for a couple months or more but even so when you find the solution it's always worth the time you spent trying to find it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dc9a4i/i_didnt_smoke_yesterday_and_im_proud_of_myself/f2bvrzo/"}
