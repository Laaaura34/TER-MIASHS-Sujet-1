One of the first times I tried to quit I used Chantix. It was terrible. Basically, it is supposed to block nicotine from getting into your brain receptors to create dopamine. In the majority of people, this works. However in some folks, me, it ends up blocking all dopamine and you no longer have a reward system. That sounds like it could've happened to you. Anyway, once I realized that's what was happening, I stopped taking it. I quit smoking for 6 months after but then some girl problems hit me and I was back on the damn things. It didn't even feel good when I started back, I just didn't care.   \n\n\nI personally would not recommend taking anything to quit. You have to want to quit. There will always be cravings one way or another. It's a massive exercise in willpower.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dc9a4i/i_didnt_smoke_yesterday_and_im_proud_of_myself/f2hgmy8/"}
