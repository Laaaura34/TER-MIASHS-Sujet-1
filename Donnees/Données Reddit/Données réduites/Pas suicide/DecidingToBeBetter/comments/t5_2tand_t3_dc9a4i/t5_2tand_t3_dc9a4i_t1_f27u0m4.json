In my situation I actually ended up having to tell people that it was my goal. The few times I have tried before, I didn't tell anyone and I have a short temper already, add withdrawal symptoms and people thought they actually did something wrong, which they didn't I was just being a fucking dick. So I had to let people know, first of all, I'm gonna have a horrible temper for a while and the best thing they can do is avoid me if I'm acting up. (I own up to it afterwards.) Secondly, I have willpower issues and people offer me cigarettes and booze all the time so I had to tell them that if they offer me anything like that I would treat it as if they were insulting me, because if a friend doesn't support you in what you want to do then fuck them. Third, this has been a struggle and a half to get the drive to quit, and like I said I'm proud of myself and damn it if I'm not gonna share some happiness that I've finally managed to get out of myself after a good year or so of being depressed as fuck you know? So that's my excuse for announcing. I plan to hold myself accountable and I hope to be back to share more happy things.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dc9a4i/i_didnt_smoke_yesterday_and_im_proud_of_myself/f27u0m4/"}
