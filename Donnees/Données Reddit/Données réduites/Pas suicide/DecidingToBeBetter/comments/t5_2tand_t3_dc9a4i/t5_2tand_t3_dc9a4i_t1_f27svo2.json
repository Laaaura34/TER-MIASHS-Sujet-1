She tells me if I stay in bed that nothing bad can happen, and I miss the world for a day. I've been doing a lot of things to spite myself and my depression. Going out and pushing myself to be social. Weed started fucking me up in all the wrong ways when I got into a relationship. I would convince myself that everything was a sham, that someone concocted the entire relationship just to fuck with me... then panic attacks, I would collapse on the floor after being unable to control my breathing. So yeah that shit wasn't healthy lol. I was smoking about the same amount as you until 9/30 which I smoked as much as I possibly could (still focusing on how awful I felt doing it) and I have one left that I haven't touched. I've tried many times before, but I think this might be the time I stick to it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dc9a4i/i_didnt_smoke_yesterday_and_im_proud_of_myself/f27svo2/"}
