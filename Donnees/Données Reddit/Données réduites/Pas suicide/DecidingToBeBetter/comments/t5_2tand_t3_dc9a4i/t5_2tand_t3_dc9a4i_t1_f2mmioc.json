First of all it was a great idea to tell your coworkers! I always said spreading the word to as many people as possible is great. Makes you accountable/makes it real but also gives people a chance to help and support you. The unfortunate thing about stress is that the only way for smoking to stop being the go-to response to stress is to PRACTICE doing something else in response. Breathing, walking, venting, even just distraction can help. Try to remember that every single craving passes within 5 minutes WHETHER OR NOT YOU SMOKE! Believe it or not. Smoking will not take away your stress, and with *practice* you will see that you don't need to smoke for the stress to pass. It's totally okay if you have cravings to smoke when you're feeling stressed. I always used to tell people i worked with, \"if for X number of years every time you were stressed you had a cigarette, of COURSE you're going to want one when you get stressed!\" Don't freak out or get worried if you have a craving. Also don't try to pretend it's not there. Acknowledge that it's there and make a conscious effort to try something else. You'll have to play around a bit to find what works for you, but you'll be so glad you didn't smoke once the stress passes!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dc9a4i/i_didnt_smoke_yesterday_and_im_proud_of_myself/f2mmioc/"}
