Not yet. I should mention I'm weaning down from 3mg clonazepam.. switched to diazepam which has a longer half-life, generally better suited to taper with. And that very likely is why I'm a little blue. Also stopped suboxone about 2 months ago. Probably has something to do with it too. And I'm not exercising as much as I know I should be.   But no night sweats. Not yet.\n\nEdit- 3mg klonopin is thought to be equal to 30mg valium.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dc9a4i/i_didnt_smoke_yesterday_and_im_proud_of_myself/f2ceikx/"}
