Keep it up! However, be careful when losing weight. I see people losing a crazy amount of weight in a short period of time, and then they give up and gain it all back (yoyo-dieting in other words). Or, they take it so seriously, they develop eating disorders. \n\nA few tips of mine:\n\n\\- Eat fruits! Fruits are healthy, generally low in calories, full of vitamins, tasty, full of antioxidants, and so on. I see so many morons calling fruits unhealthy because \"iT CoNtaInS fRUctOsE\". Nonsense! Fructose isn't going to kill you, so eat your damn fruits!\n\n\\- Don't skip meals! Even if you don't feel that hungry. Otherwise, you are like going to binge, because your brain signals, you haven't eaten for a long time.\n\n\\- Eat vegetables, BUT: Make sure you eat vegetables YOU like (very important!!). \"I don't like broccoli\", well then don't eat it! Find another vegetable, that YOU like. Vegetables are as fruits low in calories and healthy. It will help you to be in a caloric deficit if you include some vegetables in your meals.\n\n\\- You shouldn't be too restrictive - a diet is not a damn prison! Sure, it is tough. It ain't easy. Otherwise, many more people would have their dream bodies. But if it is to the point you are feeling like poop 24/7, you are doing something wrong. In fact, it shouldn't even really be a diet: It should be a lifestyle - in other words, you should be able to sustain it for life.\n\n\\- Drink lots of water. Water contains zero calories and will help to keep you satiated.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jtk6yy/10_days_of_change/gc6hjsw/"}
