The tension wasn't drug related but it did get to be a burden. I felt it unjustifiably stressful at times keeping up with everybody as they were often hundreds of videos voice messages per day. It was distracting to say the least. A few of us started to turn off notifications and take on a less active role in the group.  \n\nThere were interpersonal conflicts which eventually reduced the group to just two of us. Ironically the group is still going, with just me and one other friend. So we could just switch back to solo messages, as I've done with my other buddies, but it's been funner to keep the group going. We've talked about adding more people back into it, but we kind of like the more relaxed back-and-forth we have these days.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ep35hs/i_removed_myself_from_the_group_chat_of_my_oldest/fehcmby/"}
