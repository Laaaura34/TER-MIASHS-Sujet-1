They fight by completely \u201cforgetting\u201d or overlooking their actions when they\u2019re coked up. Last time I was with them and I chose not to do coke when they were, they essentially spent the night bullying me. Bitching about me when I\u2019m not in the room, then not talking to me in a very obvious way when I am. I\u2019ve literally told them that drugs are having an adverse effect on me and they still call me a loser and boring. Now I\u2019ve left the group and one is confronting me asking what she\u2019s done wrong, but she doesn\u2019t actually care, she just wants a fight.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ep35hs/i_removed_myself_from_the_group_chat_of_my_oldest/feh6qq3/"}
