All in the name of \"jokes\". While I certainly see that it might've been so and I was simply too sensitive to stay with that group, I do think that the behaviour was toxic and am happy that I finally left. Even years later, I still hear them criticizing me when I do something embarrassing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ep35hs/i_removed_myself_from_the_group_chat_of_my_oldest/feh5r0w/"}
