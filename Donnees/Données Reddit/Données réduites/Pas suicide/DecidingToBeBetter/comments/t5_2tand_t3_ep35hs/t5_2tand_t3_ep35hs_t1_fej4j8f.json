I'm in a situation, now, where I opened myself to new friends for the first time in years... and that group has steadily gotten heavier and heavier into blow.  I used with them a number of times, but the shine has worn off and I've recognized the harm it does to my mind in general.  I don't use but maybe 4x/month and it has a serious impact on my creativity and ability to learn.\n\nIn any case... the addition of that drug makes things tricky.  I know that my friends have been Deeply Offended that anyone could possibly begin to believe they were having negative side-effects from the frequent (weekly, mind you) usage of cocaine.  I think it endangers whatever defenses they've built against their own harm from the drug.\n\nI don't have great advice -- I'm drunk -- but please know that you're moving in the right direction.  I hope that you'll realize a future where the actual friends in that group can reconnect, once they've gotten themselves together.  Cocaine is fun, but of zero actual value.
