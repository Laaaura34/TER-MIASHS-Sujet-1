I recently ended a 10 year friendship with my \"best\" friend after a bit of a break in time spent together. During that time I realized the friendship had turned toxic for me, and was feeding into my anxiety. I'm happy to go into more details on what I said to clearly exit the relationship. The icing on top is this person and I share a time consuming hobby that takes place at the same location. Good times!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ep35hs/i_removed_myself_from_the_group_chat_of_my_oldest/fehexg5/"}
