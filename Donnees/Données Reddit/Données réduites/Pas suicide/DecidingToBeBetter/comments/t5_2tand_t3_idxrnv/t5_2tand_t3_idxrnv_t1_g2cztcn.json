For example, if a friend were to introduce you to someone, you could choose to see it as \"a potential partner\" or just to see it as a \"potential friend\", which I personally think makes a big difference.\n\nJust treating everyone you meet as a potential friend makes things more relaxed than seeing them as a potential mate, and gives room for things to develop authentically. Whereas seeing people as potential partners means you're more likely to try to just present the 'good' side of you, and also scrutinise and overthink what the other person does, which makes things less authentic and more stressful.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/idxrnv/ive_recently_tried_to_open_myself_up_to_dating/g2cztcn/"}
