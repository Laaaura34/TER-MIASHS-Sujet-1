It is important and healthy for you to protect yourself, but if you try to avoid pain entirely then you won't really be living at all. \n\nI do exactly the same - i tell myself i have a gut feeling that its going to go wrong, and in my experience whenever i've had that feeling it always has - but I was always reacting to it instead of just observing it; maybe I was just creating a self-fulfilling prophecy? \n\nPerhaps you should keep an open mind, don't force or resist and just observe and see what happens? And if you do get hurt, maybe that's not such a bad thing? It's just another emotion that will come and go, as they always do. For me this has been the hardest lesson to learn, but the most important one.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/idxrnv/ive_recently_tried_to_open_myself_up_to_dating/g2cobwd/"}
