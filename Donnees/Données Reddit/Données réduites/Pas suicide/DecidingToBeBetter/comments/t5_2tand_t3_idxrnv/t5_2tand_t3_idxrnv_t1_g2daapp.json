It took me five years to start dating again after being in an abusive relationship. I took that time to work on myself, get therapy, and develop strong, close friendships instead; one of those friends is now my partner. I personally don\u2019t see the point in dating someone who wasn\u2019t a friend first; it gives us time to get to know each other without the pressure of dating, and it also means that we have a stronger foundation upon which to build a lasting, equal partnership. \n\nSo go invest in your friendships first. Romance will very likely come from that, whether it\u2019s directly from the friend group, or a friend of a friend you\u2019re introduced to and you suddenly click, or at least feel some potential there. Even if it doesn\u2019t, there\u2019s another reason for working on friendships over romance at first: Breakups happen. When you\u2019re in a relationship, you either stay together or you don\u2019t. There\u2019s no protection from that. Bad life shit happens. It sucks, and dealing with that is never fun. But if you have a group of people surrounding you who love you and care for you, and with whom you\u2019re in a relationship of mutual support, you\u2019ll at least feel less alone. \n\nCongratulations on your recovery. It\u2019s a lot of hard work, and while I know I\u2019m just a rando on the internet, I\u2019m excited for you and your future. Best of luck to you. <3", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/idxrnv/ive_recently_tried_to_open_myself_up_to_dating/g2daapp/"}
