Ive lost so many people to dope and to know you're getting to relationships past  your recovery is amazing.\n\nI haven't had a gf in like 10 years man, basically because im selfish and I never wanted to work on myself (I've got a weed problem). Ive basically driven a lot of people (women) away from me and never learned. I am now getting back into it and it sucks, I hate it...but I also know that I need to generally improve my relationships all around, this is just part of doing the hard work of improving ones self.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll this being said, I cant give you advise of dating or women, HOWEVER - I have found learning to meditate and use mindfulness has helped me ground myself to not be sad/angry all the time, work on my addiction, restore relationships, be more confident in myself (therefore allowing others to be comfortable with me). For me, getting subscription to Headspace has changed my life (I'm a pragmatic person and this app goes into the logistics of mindfulness that is easily applicable). \n\ngood luck", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/idxrnv/ive_recently_tried_to_open_myself_up_to_dating/g2crqfy/"}
