I feel your struggle so hard. I have never been to CODA but some of my AA friends have attended. It won't hurt for me to check it out, I'm sure they have zoom meetings as well.\n\nCongrats on your sobriety though. Despite anything else, at least we have that right? No one can take that from us as long as we don't pick up that drink or drug. We will figure this out. It's like what someone said in another post, we can't be afraid to get hurt. We are stronger now. If the time is right, put yourself out there, even if it is weird and scary.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/idxrnv/ive_recently_tried_to_open_myself_up_to_dating/g2dw2no/"}
