Someone I was really close to for so long and then mutually broke up with to try to be friends is being distant but has some sort of hope of reconnecting, I've struggled to see their reasons why, but framing it as you did has really helped me. \n\nI've been struggling with loneliness and desire to get back out there, conflicting with not wanting to get into another toxic and temporary situation. The next time I want to open up to someone I really want them to stay and I know it's going to be hard, and currently there's nobody around in my position to help or advise me. I'll really have to commit your points about boundaries to memory and then give it my best shot once I'm able to meet people again I guess.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/idxrnv/ive_recently_tried_to_open_myself_up_to_dating/g2cz5ec/"}
