I was in a long term relationship through high school and college, and have been single by choice since that relationship ended. In the midst of dating him, I thought I was fine and happy and that our relationship was super healthy. It wasn\u2019t, because I wasn\u2019t. It took a few years of being on my own and figuring stuff out in a new, grown-up context for me to come to terms with a lot of stuff, and be in a place where I feel ready to maybe meet somebody. The thing that has helped me the most with that is...just kind of being okay if it doesn\u2019t happen. Genuinely. If I do meet someone, I want it to enhance the quality of life that I\u2019ve already established for myself. I don\u2019t want to shoehorn myself into something just because I feel like I have to. I\u2019m not big into drinking or partying either, and it is hard to find people with similar priorities and at a similar stage in life as I am. \n\nWhat I have done is started to actively pursue the things in which I am personally interested. Hobbies and outings and social events. I\u2019ve gotten comfortable with going to things on my own (which was painstaking - I\u2019m introverted by nature), and just tried to meet people for the sake of meeting intriguing people with similar interests, not necessarily to date. In my last relationship, I was very into long-term plans and future and marriage, and now I\u2019m more of the \u201clet\u2019s see where it goes\u201d mindset. I\u2019ve also just adopted a pretty staunch honesty policy and given myself permission to not do something if it doesn\u2019t feel right. If I\u2019m not feeling it, or I\u2019m not excited about the person, I don\u2019t try to make it work out of guilt or obligation or fear of being alone. \n\nThere are people everywhere. Not all of them are compatible with me, I know that. And I\u2019d rather be happy on my own than miserable with the wrong person, even if it\u2019s not a serious relationship. I do believe that it\u2019ll happen eventually; the coronavirus has also thrown a wrench into my grand plans too, lol. It sounds like dealing with the person you\u2019re talking to has a greater cost on your emotional bank than a value to it. It\u2019s okay to cut your losses. Not every twenty something copes with their baggage like that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/idxrnv/ive_recently_tried_to_open_myself_up_to_dating/g2c0twi/"}
