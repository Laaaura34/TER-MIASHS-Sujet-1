I have been working through codependency issues and got stuck at internal boundary setting, in form of warding if intrusive thoughts. Your two prong approach sounds like a more developed form of what I started doing recently!\nMy maladaptive thought patterns are rooted in fear of upsetting others and desire for validation, which in turn rest on bedrock of some not fully identifiable (yet?) trauma and shame. So my long term goal is to heal/resolve whatever that might be.\nThe one thing that comes to mind that you could try in your prong two is instead of pushing the thought away ask it what it wants. Try tracing it deeper into yourself. It might not alleviate the anxiety at the moment but might lead you to something else you can work thorough.\nJust a thought, good luck :) and thanks for sharing your method!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n03sle/this_week_i_am_taking_charge_of_my_intrusive/gw4i6s6/"}
