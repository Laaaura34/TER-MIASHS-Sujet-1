I follow a guided meditation app called headspace. My favorite one that I did when I first started headspace and now getting back into it is the \u201ctransforming anger\u201d 10 day lesson. It really helped with anxiety, constant thinking, and the feeling of being overwhelmed. \n\nI highly recommend it and if you\u2019re a student you can get it for $10 a year, but I also just got a message from them saying they\u2019re giving it free for anyone living in Michigan if that\u2019s where you are from. I hope you find it as helpful as I did if you choose to use it \ud83d\udcab", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g60wop/im_getting_back_into_meditation/fo7ct3e/"}
