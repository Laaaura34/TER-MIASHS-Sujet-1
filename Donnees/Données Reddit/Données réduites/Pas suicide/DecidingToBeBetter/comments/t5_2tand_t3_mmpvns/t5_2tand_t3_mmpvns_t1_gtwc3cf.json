Hashes (a bunch of veggies cooked together w spices) are a great go-to and are easy to prepare. I also love making burritos because you can pack a lot of protein into them, and you can make your own tortilla shells! Also have really been getting into Indian food and just overall cooking at home. Checking the nutrition labels on things and just being aware of how much sugar you are actually eating is a huge help too!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mmpvns/i_want_to_cut_out_processed_sugars_and_processed/gtwc3cf/"}
