If you're in the middle it's a lot less clear because you're not consistently *anything*, you're just *there*. So people can see that you're not a genius, that they're not a moron, and then they generally estimate themselves to be somewhere around the upper-middle because people like to consider themselves to be smart. Not always accurate, sure, but on the extreme ends I think we are the most accurate judges of our own ability because only we know how hard it is for us to do things/can see the patterns of failure or success. It's just that where it's uncertain we slightly overestimate it, but I wouldn't call humans \"poor judges of our own ability\" even there as it's pretty close, much less apply it to everyone including the extremes. I think in most cases I'd consider the person themselves to be the most reliable on this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ppqbm3/is_there_any_way_to_increase_intelligence/hd5vpkc/"}
