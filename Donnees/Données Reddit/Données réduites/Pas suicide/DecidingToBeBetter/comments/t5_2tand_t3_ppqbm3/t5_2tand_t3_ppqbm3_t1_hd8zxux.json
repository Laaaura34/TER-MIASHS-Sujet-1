I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a complicated and impossible situation for you. What you\u2019re describing seems to be related to wisdom too, which is the application of your knowledge. True, people have innate abilities but once youre able to apply the knowledge you get, to your daily life, and change your thinking patterns (which will take time and effort), you\u2019ll be able to break out of your ineffective thought patterns that affect your behaviour. Secondly, life experiences! It\u2019s the most effective way! Go experience things, put yourself out there literally, talk to people, or try have totally different conversations with the people already in your life idk but I think being patient as well is important. Give yourself time to experience life, and use what you\u2019ve learned from those experiences to change your perspective, behavior, etc (sorry my answer is all over the place, I\u2019m thinking as I type)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ppqbm3/is_there_any_way_to_increase_intelligence/hd8zxux/"}
