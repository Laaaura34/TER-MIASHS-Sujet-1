I have been social media free for a little over a year now. The last thing I deleted was IG but other than that the other social media platforms I deleted YEARS ago. Honestly best thing I could have done(other than reddit). I was constantly comparing everyone's life and happiness to mine. As if saying to myself \"I'm a good person too why am I never as happy as they are\" which was BS because people are so fake and like you said they only share the \"good times\". I discovered reddit through my partner and its so much better! I hardly get on or when I do its when I'm waiting for something(grocery store line, shopping line etc) good for you though! Mental health is my top priority and people don't talk about it enough and how important it is and how all these social media platforms play a huge part in it. I hope you do great in school and continue being ya best self without all these fake ass people on all of those social media accounts you dumped! Humble yourself enough to enjoy the little things in life and dont feel like you need to show the world how great you are \ud83d\ude0a", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l1tj2z/deleted_all_social_media_except_reddit_6_months/gk2akqq/"}
