Congrats, that's the attitude. My phone was damage 7 month ago. Since then, I've couldn't buy another phone. My activity in SM was reduced, but I'm still in from my computer laptop. However, isin't the same thing. My activity on FB/IG was reduced a lot compared whit before (2 hour per day, more or less). One of the reason to get away of the SM is I can note the insanity on the people: The people are paranoic, you can note a lot of egoism, vanity, fake news, anger, tension... I recommend the Netflix's documental: The Social Dilemma. You'll don't see the SM equal after watched it. I'm totally convinced the SM has to be forbidden, at least for a while time. Thank's to SM, we are being a mass of people being manipulated, idiotic and controlled.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l1tj2z/deleted_all_social_media_except_reddit_6_months/gk6969w/"}
