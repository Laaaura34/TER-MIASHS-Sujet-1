On one hand? I have basically no friends as of now and I am super unsure of how to make new ones amidst a pandemic.\n\nI also use Facebook to post my macrame creations and find new clients. There realy is no substitute for this for me as I don\u2019t have an audience anywhere else. I\u2019m new as well and Etsy would be stiff competition.\n\nLastly I use a weight loss Instagram for accountability but more often than not I just find myself bitching and complaining and wasting time rather than doing anything productive and I\u2019m not sure what to do.\n\nMy mental health is at an all time low, as I\u2019m 30 and still have literally no idea what to do career wise and am currently suffering at a job I hate SO MUCH. Can\u2019t seem to make any progress with my physical health either lately as I just eat out of stress and loneliness.\n\nAll this added up and I truly don\u2019t feel comfortable making any decisions and have never felt more stuck in my life.\n\nAny advice is so welcome.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l1tj2z/deleted_all_social_media_except_reddit_6_months/gk43hbl/"}
