My problems are not big. *American* problems are not big. *Human* problems are not big. It's all very, very lil, and the life of the whole teeny tiny Earth is far more important than whether my stupid asshole piece of shit father-in-law is a racist or not or whether I can in good conscience pay to go to Harry Potter World at Universal Studios, or whether local city laws will allow pit bulls to live in city limits. These things we can think about, of course, and continue to fight against injustice and evil where it lies, but we *also* really need to *not let that fight consume us* and make us bitter and damaged and withdrawn.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l1tj2z/deleted_all_social_media_except_reddit_6_months/gk2a25o/"}
