I had Instagram (IG) when I was in middle school but deleted it bc it was so toxic (follower competitions). I told myself that the next time I got IG I\u2019d have to be 100% confident In myself and I while I reached that about midway through HS, I still didn\u2019t want IG.  The summer right before senior year I decided I wanted IG again. I still have Instagram now but I rarely like and scroll through people\u2019s stories bc I just don\u2019t care. Idc what someone ate or where they\u2019re going it doesn\u2019t help me at all.  All everyone posts and talks about is nonsense and not what\u2019s truly going in their real lives it\u2019s just so fake to me. \n\nThe part I do like about Instagram though is the entrepreneurs and business, stocks, and other inspirational content and accounts on there that I follow. I look at it like if I\u2019m going to use IG, I minds well be putting good info into my brain instead of complete nonsense (shout out to Gary Vee and Warren Knox). \n\nI just got Reddit in September and I like it muccchhh better than IG. I spend significantly less time on IG than Reddit. I mostly use IG for my art account now and sometimes I use Tik tok if I wanna make a video of the process.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l1tj2z/deleted_all_social_media_except_reddit_6_months/gk57be4/"}
