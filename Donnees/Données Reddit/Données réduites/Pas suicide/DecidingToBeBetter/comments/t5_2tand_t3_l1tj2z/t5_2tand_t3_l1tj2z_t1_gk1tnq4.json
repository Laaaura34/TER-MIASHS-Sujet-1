Never understood Twitter, your pretty much shouting into an empty room. I don't understand. SC to me is kinda pointless, I am just getting bots randomly adding me on there now.....time to delete. And Instagram I have but I use it for motivation, but tbh. I deleted the app about 2 weeks ago and have not even bothered about it tbh. There's one girl I speak to on there but she has my number so probably time to delete. \nI have also taken some time off Reddit but I cannot stay away xD", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l1tj2z/deleted_all_social_media_except_reddit_6_months/gk1tnq4/"}
