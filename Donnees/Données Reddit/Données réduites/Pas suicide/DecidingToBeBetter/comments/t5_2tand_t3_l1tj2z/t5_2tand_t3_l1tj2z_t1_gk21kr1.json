I see a lot of similar posts and can say I\u2019ve done the same (well, except that I deactivated rather than permanently deleted). I see ppl talk about it here a lot, but everyone I know irl says they\u2019re too addicted to quit. I haven\u2019t been on since august. I feel no desire to get back on in the near future. I obsessed over my image, and how many likes/comments I got. I was desperate for attention from ppl who weren\u2019t actually relevant to my life. This time has made me re-evaluate what and who really matters to me. I may be back one day, because I\u2019m an artist and want to share my works with the world.. plus I do know some ppl I\u2019d like to reconnect with one day who I don\u2019t have the phone numbers of. But as of today, still offline indefinitely.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l1tj2z/deleted_all_social_media_except_reddit_6_months/gk21kr1/"}
