I understand how sometimes it can be frustrating for you to grow and move on when maybe your loved ones remind you of it constantly at times, but they were probably just hurt or something in the past and don\u2019t want it to happen again. So breathe, don\u2019t take it personally, in fact take it as a reminder of how different the current you is and how far you\u2019ve come from the past and tell them you\u2019ll do better. \nYou\u2019re going to get there! And don\u2019t let anyone ANYONE at all tell you that you can\u2019t, smack em and keep moving forward! \nAnd thank you, I hope so too. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iryuqh/you_have_to_forgive_yourself_so_you_can_truly_be/g576rm6/"}
