In the past 6 years, I've lost all 4 of my grandparents and even though they all were ready to go, it still hurt.\n\nI can totally relate to the attachment to your grandmother's house. When I was 15 my parents split up and my dad sold my childhood home. My entire support system at the time was my group of friends that ALL lived in that same neighborhood. After the house sold I was literally grieving. My best friend lived next door to the old house and I went over there everyday. An old friend's family bought our house and I spent the night there in my old room. \n\nI realize now that hanging around the old neighborhood was making it impossible for me to adjust, and move on. I felt like an outsider looking in on my old life. I hated my new stepmom's large and gorgeous house in the mountains just because it was a 40 minute drive from my comfort zone. I fought with her and my dad constantly because I hated being there. It was an awful time.\n\nI'm not saying you need to move out of your grandma's house or anything, I just wanted to validate how you're feeling, and hopefully my story will help. Just remember that life only moves forward. Your grandma will always be with you (and watching over you, I believe) no matter what happens to her house. \n\nThe past couple of years have been hard for a lot of people, myself included. Thank you for sharing what you are going through. Support is vital in times like these", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfromm/this_year_has_been_really_rough/hb8gdlp/"}
