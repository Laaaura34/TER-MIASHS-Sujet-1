I know I'm not the one you broke up with but genuinely thank you for explaining him why you had to take this step. I'm glad that you didn't ghost him. Nowadays everyone is ghosting everyone and not explaining why cause they're too afraid to face the facts and look people straight in the eye and do it. I'm glad that you explained and didn't let him doubt himself and made him make up various scenarios where he went wrong. Despite hurting someone, you still did find a good thing. You did it in a good way. I'm proud of you. I wish you all the best!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/osyxyd/i_had_to_break_a_heart_but_i_did_it_like_no_one/h6ssljj/"}
