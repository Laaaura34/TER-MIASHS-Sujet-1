It's going terribly currently. My phone is blowing up with insults and threats and then \"I'm sorry\" and rinse, wash, repeat. \n\nI had to remove him from some things already. I had to be assertive and put my foot down and be painfully blunt. It felt like it came to that, or else it wouldn't sink in. He still has texting capabilities with me, he hasn't blown that yet... \n\nI'll be back in a couple days so that will be the true test as I have to move out. He's refusing to accept that it's over, so it's definitely not going to be an easy situation. I have hope that everything will be ok, and I'll keep trying to do the right thing while also taking care of my own needs. Thanks, is appreciate you a lot.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/osyxyd/i_had_to_break_a_heart_but_i_did_it_like_no_one/h6w6t00/"}
