It is so so hard to break someone\u2019s heart when you know they see a future with you. \n\nSomething I have and still do struggle with is how to balance closure with letting them move on. The way I did it was to break up, and then about 4 weeks later we spoke by phone and I answered some questions. \n\nSince then we did not speak once. I still have love for her but I am not IN LOVE with her. There are times I\u2019d like to reach out and see how she is doing but I don\u2019t do it because that will not help her move on", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/osyxyd/i_had_to_break_a_heart_but_i_did_it_like_no_one/h6vux1k/"}
