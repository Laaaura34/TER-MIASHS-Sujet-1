I broke off an engagement like that and remained there as long as she needed to process things. After a week or so she was ready for me to move out and I did. \n\nA month later she started dating a coworker and they've been together for 11 years now. I'm very happy for them and happy and proud that I went about things the right way so that she could heal faster and move on. We don't talk now but remained amicable for several years after that. Breakups do not need to be ugly or leave people damaged. You did good.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/osyxyd/i_had_to_break_a_heart_but_i_did_it_like_no_one/h6rv6wy/"}
