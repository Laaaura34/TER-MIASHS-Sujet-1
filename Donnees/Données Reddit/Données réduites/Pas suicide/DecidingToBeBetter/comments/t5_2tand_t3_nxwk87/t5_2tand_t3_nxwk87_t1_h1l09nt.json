I told a coworker some of my plans for it and he seemed to love the idea. So that inspired me to finally start on designing my first level.\n\nI think AA might be overkill for me. I\u2019m exclusively a beer drinker and most of the time I\u2019m able to limit myself to 6 at max, and usually I fall asleep before that point. And I don\u2019t go into work drunk or anything like that. It\u2019s still not ideal. It\u2019s just that beer is one of the only things that can blunt a panic attack, and it\u2019s hard if I\u2019m in a situation where I can\u2019t drink to stop it. I\u2019m taking tonight off drinking.
