The feeling of having achieved something that day, however small is in itself a rewarding feeling. I do plan some leisure activities through out the day in between tasks - some intellectual and enlightening \"Reddit\" browsing, reading books, personal mails etc.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/og9dlx/day_scheduling_how_to_seize_the_day/h4in8f2/"}
