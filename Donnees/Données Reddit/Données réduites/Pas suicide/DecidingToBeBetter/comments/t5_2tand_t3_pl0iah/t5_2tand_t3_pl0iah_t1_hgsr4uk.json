One thing I dislike about the industry right now, is how competitive it is. I would say that I am a fairly talented designer and I struggled to find a new job. I applied to 100+ jobs, and only heard back from 2. I was so desperate to get out, I was applying to everything I saw. My advice is just to try and reach out the the actual individuals / designers at the company you are looking at. Asking to chat, and review your portfolio goes a long way. Apply, apply, re apply, annoy, and re annoy. Designers are lazy about hiring efforts \ud83d\ude02", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pl0iah/i_quit_drinking_quit_my_toxic_job_and_went_to/hgsr4uk/"}
