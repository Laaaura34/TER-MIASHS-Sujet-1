What you want is to find someone who has already achieved your final goal and, even if it might seem dumb, learn from the mistakes that have already been made. After that, start looking and googling (videos, blogs, publications, social accounts, and so on) about them, and see what you can find. Getting in contact with them could not necessarily mean getting directly to the single person, but could also mean being influenced by what this person has achieved. When used correctly, internet is the best tool at our disposal to learn new things and grow our knowledge, most of the times for free.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oylrif/how_do_i_find_mentors/h8bt9g4/"}
