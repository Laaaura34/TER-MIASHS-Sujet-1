I can hear your excitement in each word.\n\nBut please, be very careful that this does not become an eating disorder for you. I\u2019m speaking from experience. 2years ago I started healthy eating, with many of the same ideals as you. However 12months on, I had developed Orthorexia, and ended up in residential treatment for months. I\u2019m still dealing with it.\n\nIntuitive eating is a great mantra, but don\u2019t slip into unhealthy \u2018healthy\u2019 habits. Why should one day with sugar be a \u2018cheat\u2019 day? It\u2019s just a different day. Alter your language around food, and I expect you will enjoy your journey a lot more.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nzmzyr/gonna_eat_healthier_not_to_lose_weight_but_to/h1rn11j/"}
