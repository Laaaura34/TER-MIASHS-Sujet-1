There are a lot of options but you can still make cinnamon rolls, no bakes, gummies, cookies, etc (even snow cones! Had one yesterday!) with sugar alternatives. The healthier ones in general are monkfruit, stevia, Erythritol, and allulose! They are generally zero calorie, have no impact on your blood sugar, and don't cause weight gain , digestive issues (though be careful if you have IBS, and remember everyone is different!), or break outs. Highly recommend!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nzmzyr/gonna_eat_healthier_not_to_lose_weight_but_to/h1rtwni/"}
