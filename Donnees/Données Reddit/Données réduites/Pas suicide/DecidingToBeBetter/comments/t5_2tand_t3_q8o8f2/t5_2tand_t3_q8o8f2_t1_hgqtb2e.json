I'd usually tell my therapist \"I'm not sure how to explain this part\" and she'd give me some follow up questions to guide me in the right direction. Or I'd sort of ramble to figure out what it is I'm trying to explain. I hope you feel better with your sessions just as I did.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8o8f2/i_want_to_book_an_appointment_with_a_psychologist/hgqtb2e/"}
