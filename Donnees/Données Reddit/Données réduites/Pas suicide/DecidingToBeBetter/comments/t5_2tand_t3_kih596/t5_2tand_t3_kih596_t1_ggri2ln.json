I have had trouble making new friends since I stopped working when I had kids. \n\nI loved making chit chat and acquaintances at the kids activities. I loved going out to eat with friends twice a month. I loved organizing big play dates and chit chatting with strangers at the gym. \n\nNow it\u2019s all quiet. I have lost touch with most people. Those I talk to I have nothing to say to. I feel you. 100%. I usually get so excited for the holidays. Decorating. Traditions. This year I could give less of a shit. \n\n\nIt WILL get better. NOTHING is permanent. You will look back at this time period and remember how bleak it was and how you got through it. You\u2019re not alone. \n\nAnd I agree with what someone else said. Just take small trips out (safely of course) every day. To the market. To the park. Maybe make socially distanced small talk. The days I have small interactions with other humans (who don\u2019t live in my tiny cramped house) I am much happier.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kih596/i_cant_find_joy_in_anything_not_sure_what_i_can_do/ggri2ln/"}
