Thanks for reaching out. Not everyone has the courage to \u201cspeak up\u201d on the internet. \n\nI don\u2019t know how old you are but judging from your comments about recently graduating I\u2019d say you\u2019re in your mid twenties. It is different to leave the school environment after being in it for YOUR WHOLE LIFE haha. But seriously, of course it will be different but that\u2019s the same for everyone. It\u2019s a new stage of life but you learn more about yourself here. \n\nThe pandemic for sure threw a wrench in this here for everyone! So again you\u2019re not alone there either. I know for me, even though I\u2019ve spent less time with loved ones they\u2019ve grown more important to me. You don\u2019t mention your family in your post so I\u2019ll assume they aren\u2019t much of a social connection for you. \n\nOne thing that helped me when I was around your age was actually online dating sites. People in their twenties are brave and don\u2019t mind meeting new people but it\u2019s just about HOW to meet them, really. Obviously members of a dating site wouldn\u2019t be shocked to receive a message. Profiles of girls and guys will tell you if you have similarities or common interests. It\u2019s not weird to message someone you\u2019re not interested in to say \u201cHey I saw you liked this, I do also. I\u2019m trying to make friends in a friggin pandemic do you ever game/etc?\u201d I know it seems weird but if you can make one friend they have friends that you can make friends with etc. \n\nTo be real though, eventually it gets to be a where the only people you are meeting are coworkers. That\u2019s life. \n\nGood luck! Best to you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kih596/i_cant_find_joy_in_anything_not_sure_what_i_can_do/ggrunr0/"}
