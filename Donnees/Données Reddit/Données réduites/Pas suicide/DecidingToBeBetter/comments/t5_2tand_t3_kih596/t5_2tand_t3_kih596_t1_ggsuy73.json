These are difficult times and it is so easy to feel isolated and just feel down in general. You seem to be listing a lot of hobbies you tried to get into that do not include any outdoors activity or pumping up your heart beat. Do you practice any sports or physical exercise? It is a very efficient cure to boredom and depression and fairly accessible. All you need are a good coat and pair of shoes and you\u2019re good to go! I am a new mom on maternity leave in Canada isolated with my new baby and that is really what keeps me energized and feeling better. \nWishing you all the best :-)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kih596/i_cant_find_joy_in_anything_not_sure_what_i_can_do/ggsuy73/"}
