But making it even worse by ignoring your health is a sure fire way to  being tormented by hindsight for the last 20-30 years of your life.   \n\nAnd if looks are all that matter to you- go collect 20 photos of people over 60 or so. Those who look \"good\" are always the fit ones. The pasty, overweight 60 year olds look 80 and move like they are 110.  \n\nWhich do you want to be?   \nBecause it is what you do TODAY that determines it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfqs03/feeling_torn_about_desire_to_look_better_and/hb68b6b/"}
