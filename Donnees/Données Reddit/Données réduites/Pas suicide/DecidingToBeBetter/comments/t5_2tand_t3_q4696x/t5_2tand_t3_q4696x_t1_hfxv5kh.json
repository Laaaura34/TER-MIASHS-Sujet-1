This is fantastic. I'm so glad you've decided to work on yourself. But please remember... Don't try to over diagnose yourself. It can be tempting to attribute everything to a disorder of some sort, but no one is going to help you into just 'wanting' to get the work done; some grit will be needed on your part. All the luck in the world, though! \n\nI've lost a whoole bunch of weight myself over the last couple of years, so if you have any questions I'm happy to answer them! Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4696x/im_morbidly_obese_this_time_next_year_i_hope_to/hfxv5kh/"}
