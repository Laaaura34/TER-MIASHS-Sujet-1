I was a binge eater and 320 lbs. Thanks to fasting, I'm 184 lbs and still going. My health has greatly increased and my remaining lifespan has likely doubled. I've changed my eating habits solely because of what fasting has afforded me. Also,if done correctly, you're not building up hunger all day. I'm not talking about OMAD, intermittent fasting gives you an eating window where really, you just have to delay breakfast and don't snack after dinner. I do three day fasts now and I'm not starving. Full of energy and I feel fantastic. I don't think it's a poor recommendation for a binge eater. I think it's the best recommendation mixed with a low carb way of eating. You guys can keep downvoting me but I'm proethw only person in the comments that has been where OP is now.\n\nAlso, OP is 22 and I think, a male. I'm a 32 year old woman post pardem.
