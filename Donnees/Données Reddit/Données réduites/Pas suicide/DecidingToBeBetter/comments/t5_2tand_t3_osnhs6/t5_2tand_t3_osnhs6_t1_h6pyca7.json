Like I said, I was initially pretty pissed BECAUSE of how much effort it takes to get to these appointments.\n\nI think its understandable to get frustrated if your wife doesn't accept blame. My husband and I went through something similar, as it is very much like him to tell me Tuesday when its on Thursday. He is not good with tiny details like that. However, this is something we are both aware of and so he accepts responsibility. If he didn't, I wouldn't be able to move past it as easily as I did today.\n\nI would definitely bring it up, but only when you are calm and not angry anymore (if you know she will immediate shift blame). I actually did tell him, and he actually said word for word \"They told me Tuesday!\" and I said \"Babe, you and I both know that isn't likely. You mix these things up a lot\" and then he shifted to \"Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to mess you up\".\n\nThis comment is getting long. For me I had to stop letting him shift the blame, and when he does try to do this, I don't get angry I just calmly correct him (which gives him the ability to accept the blame knowing I won't be angry). Then, we try to form a plan to avoid these types of things (together, as a team).", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/osnhs6/husband_said_he_made_my_730am_appointment_for/h6pyca7/"}
