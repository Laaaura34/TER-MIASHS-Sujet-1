Desperately wish my partner had more of this perspective. \n\nIf I ever screw something up monopoly every once in a blue moon it seriously hurts when their being upset leads into them claiming I\u2019m not on their side. \n\nWhen if nothing else at all I absolutely am. \n\nIf they give a shit, knowing they messed up and made your life harder on accident is all the sting and lesson they\u2019ll need without the angry confrontation which is both a lesson and a challenge of not building resentment while also feeling shitty. You\u2019re doing great by your relationship", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/osnhs6/husband_said_he_made_my_730am_appointment_for/h6rstz7/"}
