I honestly struggle with the last line. My wife and I blame each other for every little thing. I can accept my role in what went wrong, but I get so frustrated when she won't accept any of the blame.\n\nIn your case, let's say I show up on the wrong day. I might tell my wife \"Hey, you told me it was on Tuesday, but it was on Thursday.\" Rather than a simple \"oh, sorry. I guess I mixed it up\", she'll likely respond with \"No, I told you it was thursday!\" or \"Oh, i think the phone autocorrected it to thursday\" or \"No, they told me Tues over the phone.\" Regardless, it's always someone else's fault for her.\n\nHow did you handle the situation? Did you just not bring it up? Or did you talk to your husband about it? How did you phrase things, if I may ask?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/osnhs6/husband_said_he_made_my_730am_appointment_for/h6pwhvo/"}
