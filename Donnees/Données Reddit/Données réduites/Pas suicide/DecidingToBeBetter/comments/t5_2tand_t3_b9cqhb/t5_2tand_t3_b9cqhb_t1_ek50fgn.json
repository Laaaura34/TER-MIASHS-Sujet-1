One day at a time, and one step at a time friend. You\u2019ve got this. You\u2019re doing great! \n\nSome things to think about: \n\nYou mentioned student loans. If you are in America, I encourage you to fill out the FAFSA application for grant money. Loans are OK, but grants are so much better. When you have a break from school, I suggest starting now to look for every scholarship opportunity you can find. There are thousands of organizations out there who give free money for education. I think you will be eligible for some of them. \n\nSome employers will pay your tuition, too, or at least part of it. I can save you a many thousands of dollars. Sometimes you pay the tuition up front, but when you pass the class with whatever grade is required by your employer, they pay you back eventually. It takes awhile. Don\u2019t rely on the payback money to arrive in time to register for your next semester\u2019s classes.  \n\nYou know you want to go to college, but consider trade school, as well. Look into it.  There is federal grant money available for many trade schools, too. \n\nYou\u2019ve got this, OP. I\u2019m really proud of you.
