At the time, it seemed so overwhelming and dark. But I knew I had to do something, because my son deserved better. \n\nNow, 2 years later I'm about to graduate with my associates in software development and have a fulltime job lined up at my dream company doing what I love while also being able to provide more for my son.\n\nYou can do it. Take it from a former college drop out. I went from a 1.8 to a 3.4 because I was doing it for my son this time.\n\nOP the only thing you need to do great in school is your daughter. Shes all the love and support you'll ever need on your journey.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/b9cqhb/life_is_terrifying_but_i_keep_pushing_forwards/ek5et3g/"}
