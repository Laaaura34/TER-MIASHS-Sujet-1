If you fell off the wagon and missed a few therapy appointments its okay, I'm not saying you have but I know me sometimes I show up late or forget I have one booked, its also okay if your finding therapy has its difficult points and mountains but it rewarding once you get passed them, and if your still on the wagon that's great many cheers to your success!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m7pob7/after_years_of_being_depressed_and_suffering_from/hi7qpb8/"}
