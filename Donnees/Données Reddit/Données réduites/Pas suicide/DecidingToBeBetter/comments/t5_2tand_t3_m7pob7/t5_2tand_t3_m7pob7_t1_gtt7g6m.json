Recently it was my birthday he mailed me and on my birthday night I kept on apologizing him and saying sorry for almost 3.5 hours even then he didnt forgive me. Next day also he called and the same story followed finally i gathered courage to text him that for \"my mental well being i cannot speak to you any more\"\n\nI do miss him and feel like speaking to him but I guess finally i have realised that my mental well being matters most and once you are healed from within you will end up with someone who deserves you", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m7pob7/after_years_of_being_depressed_and_suffering_from/gtt7g6m/"}
