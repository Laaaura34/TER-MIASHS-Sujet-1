It takes special strength to be willing to look at yourself and your behaviours with the help of talking therapy. I am 4 sessions in myself, and like you, I have a long way to go to breaking my habits and building my self esteem.

What I project into the 'universe' is what it gives me. Hope that makes sense and helps you too", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m7pob7/after_years_of_being_depressed_and_suffering_from/grd9rn7/"}
