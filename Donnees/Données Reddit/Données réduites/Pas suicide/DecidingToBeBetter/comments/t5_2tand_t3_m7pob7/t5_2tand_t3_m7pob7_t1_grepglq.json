Now you can focus on you and doing what needs to be done to get to a better place.  I recently sought therapy for depression.  I had been depressed for many years and during lockdown from covid split from my wife of 15 years with 3 kids.  At that point i was in a very dark place much worse than ever before and had little options, either end it all or seek professional help.  I came out the other end after alot of work and did a 180.  Therapy saved me and now im stronger than i have ever been.  You will get there.  Give it time and be honest with yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m7pob7/after_years_of_being_depressed_and_suffering_from/grepglq/"}
