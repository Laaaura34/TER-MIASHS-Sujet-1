Honestly, I hate going to the gym-- you either get judged or oogled, and I just want to do me and keep it moving. \n\nI have been taking zoom work out classes--specifically dance related classes because I enjoy dancing. I turn my video off during the class and at the end turn it on, wave at the folks In there and keep it moving. I can do what I need to do without being watched. It is so freeing. \n\nI also actually enjoy walking and so I take longer walks a couple times a week (weather permitting), one of which is with one of my good friends. We pick a different park almost every time. \n\nSo, advice:\n\n1. Find something you like to do and do that. If you hate it, don't do it. \n2. Consider doing it with a friend.\n3. Add it to your existing routine a couple times a week. Once something becomes routine (which can take a couple months), it feels weird when you skip it.\n4. Be kind to yourself if you miss it. \n\nAt the end of the day, you can only do your best. You can only fight on so many fronts at once. Depression for me can be downright debilitating. Sometimes just eating dinner, any kind of dinner is a win. So, take your wins and let everything else go.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kquu9c/i_stopped_going_to_the_gym_because_anxiety_and/gi6gvzu/"}
