It's a mixed bag of exercise PLUS social interaction, in a way. So working out at home or outdoors by myself has always been better for me, from a mental health perspective. It just feels like handling one thing at a time on my own terms. Maybe something to give a shot in your case too?\n\nRight now I'm doing a little 4 week daily workout challenge for my New Year's resolution that I'm posting on r/StayingAtHome and YouTube, so feel free to follow along or join me - I'd love it if it's useful for someone else.
