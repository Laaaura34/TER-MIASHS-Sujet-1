With COVID striking and my personal experience going to the gym as a woman, I feel better working out at home or around my neighborhood. I don't necessarily have a goal, but I follow monthly fitness challenges that are led by my favorite fitness gurus and Youtubers. If you're a guy, a lot of my guy friends created their own gym in their garage or have a set routine that involves jogging around their neighborhood and buying their own workout equipments. \n\nI would say that even the smallest movement helped me in motivating myself and getting out of a rut. I think setting small incremental goals would help you getting into the groove and achieve your goal in improving your body image. Exercise is a small part of improving your body, eating healthy is the bigger part of it.\n\nIf you are in need to talk to someone, a friend has been talking to a coach from [TeamAvo](https://www.avocoach.com/), and it's been helping her! They offer free personalized coach matching services and sessions are affordable. Otherwise, I would recommend meditation and talking to a close friend about it, if that makes you feel better! I hope this helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kquu9c/i_stopped_going_to_the_gym_because_anxiety_and/gi909en/"}
