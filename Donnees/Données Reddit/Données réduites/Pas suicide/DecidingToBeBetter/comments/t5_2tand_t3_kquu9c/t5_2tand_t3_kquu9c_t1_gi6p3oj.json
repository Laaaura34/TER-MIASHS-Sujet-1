Anxiety actually gets WORSE when you give in to avoidant behaviors, because staying away from the experiences that you currently experience anxiety over actually trains your brain to fear them more.  I'm not saying to go to the gym, or not figure out a COVID-safe excercise routine and diet.  Those will actually assist in mental health benefits.\n\nI'm saying make sure you are taking care of your mental health as well.  There are actually lots of free mental health apps out there.  I use Woebot to assist in managing and reducing my own anxiety, and it's great.  It also encourages working out and seeking out a healthy diet.  Very good luck to you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kquu9c/i_stopped_going_to_the_gym_because_anxiety_and/gi6p3oj/"}
