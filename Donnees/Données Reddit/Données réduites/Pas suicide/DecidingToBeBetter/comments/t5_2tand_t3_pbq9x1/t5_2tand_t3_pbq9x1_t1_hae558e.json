It\u2019ll be something fresh since you\u2019ve never done it before, and you\u2019ll feel better when you start seeing results. You might even be able to meet some people at the gym, not sure how busy your apartment gym is though. \n\nI use my apartment gym which has decent equipment, not everything I need, but I make it work. What kind of setup/equipment does your apartment gym have?\n\nAlso it can be pretty daunting at the start, and I used to get nervous going to the gym because I was a noob. In reality, no one gives a shit. Once you figure out what you\u2019re doing it becomes much easier.\n\nEdit: I also want to add that if you do decide to start lifting seriously, pick a program!!! I wasted my first few years in the gym just fucking around and building my own half assed workouts. Started a legit program this month and it\u2019s 100x better! You\u2019re also going to have to start eating more if you actually want to gain muscle.
