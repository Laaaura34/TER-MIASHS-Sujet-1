The ONLY thing that worked was sitting down with example questions and writing out answers to them using experiences from my life. Now I have a repository of anecdotes to draw from. Half the time, these questions are only designed to gauge your level of preparation. Did you give a shit enough about the interview to prepare answers? Have you had life experiences, and are you capable of reflecting on those? Tbh once I finally sat down and did the prep, I felt better about myself too, because I was thinking about the positive things I'd done.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qcebrc/been_poor_my_whole_life_passed_phone_screen_to/hhio8hw/"}
