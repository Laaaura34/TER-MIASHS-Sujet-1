He was a drug addict and alcoholic from 18-55\n\nHonestly my relationship being as good as it is with him now, it felt like a pipedream years ago. He may not have survived for more than a few years after that if he hadn't gone into rehab. Was sending nonsense gibberish text messages and couldn't remember a single thing I would tell him. He was sleeping maybe like 3 hours a night. \n\nNow he has a job as peer support at a rehab and he absolutely loves it. He's such a gentle, loving soul. His addicted self wasn't the real him. It was the sick him. The real him is such a dad at heart. He just wants to help and protect. Now he's almost got a job in admin because he's doing so well. He's done a complete 180 and I'm so so so proud of him. Your family is waiting for the real you to come back \ud83d\udda4\n\nIf he can do it, so can you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ixpghf/today_is_my_3rd_year_of_being_drug_free/g69sg43/"}
