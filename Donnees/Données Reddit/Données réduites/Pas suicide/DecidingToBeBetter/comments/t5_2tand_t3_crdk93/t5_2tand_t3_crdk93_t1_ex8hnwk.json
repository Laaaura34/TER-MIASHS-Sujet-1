Thanks for that suggestion! My situation all my life has been either studying my ass off, working my ass off or doing nothing at all. Somewhere in there, I jogged, swam, rode my bike, was a travelling motorcyclist, went to a different country for a Master's degree, moved to a remote location for a job, got married and have watched a total stranger go complete bananas in front of my eyes, all the more wondering what and why.\n\nDon't call me a gem dude, I prefer humane, least I can do for another human, I guess.
