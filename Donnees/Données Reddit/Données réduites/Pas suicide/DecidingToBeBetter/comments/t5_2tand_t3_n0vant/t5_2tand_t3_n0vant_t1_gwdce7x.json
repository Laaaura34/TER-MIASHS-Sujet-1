I'm guessing you're refering to universal red flags - violent tendencies, emotional immaturity, that sort of thing. Working on yourself to improve the things about yourself that can reasonably be called universally unhealthy or not conducive to healthy relationships. One could also though, call an compatibility a 'red flag'. For example, I'm commited to living close to my family, so finding that a potential partner aspires to move around geographically for whatever reason would be a red flag to me. That's the kind of red flag I'm HOPING someone will be okay with 'displaying', so that we get it out of the way and can know if its best for us to move on. Likewise, if there are things about yourself you're struggling to change, but not having success with yet, I think its not a bad idea to let a potential partner know about those things, rather than worry about not displaying them. I think its the word 'display' I'm having trouble with here - though I think what you probably meant was just pursuing self-improvement such that red-flaggy things are not a part of who you are.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n0vant/i_am_a_recovering_peoplepleaser_the_below_article/gwdce7x/"}
