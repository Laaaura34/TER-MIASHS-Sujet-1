Without trusting people (and occasionally having your trust betrayed), how will we ever learn who can be trusted? Cynicism may protect us, but that's like cutting off your arm to avoid papercuts. In the end, it's not worth it.\n\nWhen my cynicism wants to point out the bad things only, and make me doubt and give up, I consciously remind myself of the positive things in the situation, and that cynicism is just the emotions of fear and hopelessness trying to disguise themselves as truth. They are no more true than other perspectives. \n\nSometimes cynisism is only cowardice, while choosing optimism and trust is the path that requires strength.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mnnyjk/im_done_being_a_cynical_person/gtz0naj/"}
