Cause who cares?  Not everything need a bigger reason. I just want to be kind, so I'll try to be kind.\n\nAbout the book recommendations, I've read a lot of them. Sometimes \"Self improvement\" content might only make you over fixate the problem. \n\nMy advice is to stop wasting time judging yourself and others. Life is short and absurd! Do you think trying out a new thing will make you happy or healthy, then do it! No need to overthink.\n\nAlso! Congrats on quitting porn and nicotine, it's a positive change you did for yourself cause you simply wanted to, committed to it and now it's done. That's the mindset.\n\nEdit: typo", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mnnyjk/im_done_being_a_cynical_person/gtz24vu/"}
