It's not free, but it is affordable (around $40 per month--last time I checked, and they offer free trials for 30 days). It's all text based so you don't need to worry about finding privacy for phone/video chatting.\n\nOther options are \"Better help\" and \"7 cups of tea\". I believe these all require payment. I did a quick google search and there's one called iPrevail that offers online therapy or free peer counseling.  \nIn Australia, there is a free 24hr helpline - Lifeline as well all the charity groups offer counselling \\[St Vincent de Paul, Salvation Army\\].", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jtfmb8/doomscrolling_is_my_goto_way_to_cope_with_sudden/gcaucdx/"}
