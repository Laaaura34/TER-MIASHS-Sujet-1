Yeah I got down to 25% bf in January but that was also done super unhealthily as I was eating under 500 cals a day. I felt the worst I\u2019d ever felt in my life. I barely remember those months tbh. I was so consumed with being thin and food that I just wasn\u2019t there. \n\nBut I plan to do it differently now. I want to go slow. Have a 500 cal deficit instead of only eating 500. I\u2019ve had a lot of bad days so far, but I\u2019m starting to learn it\u2019s not about the bad days, it\u2019s about what you do with the day after.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/d303cp/got_my_bod_pod_results_today/ezxwbvw/"}
