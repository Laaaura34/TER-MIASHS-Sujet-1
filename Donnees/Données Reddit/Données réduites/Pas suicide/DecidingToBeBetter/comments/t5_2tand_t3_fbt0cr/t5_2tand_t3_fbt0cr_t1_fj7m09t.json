That\u2019s fine. Fortunately, most people love to take about their favorite subjects: themselves. Ask people a few questions anout themselves and suddenly you\u2019ve got plenty to talk about. \n\nI would also suggest that you go people watching. Go to a coffee shop, a mall or some other public place and observe. Inconspicuously while you\u2019re reading a book or on Reddit.\n\nThis serves many purposes. You\u2019re not procrastinating by reading more books, whivh you might unwittingly be doing; you\u2019re actively getting out and being around people, even though you\u2019re not interacting yet. You\u2019re observing how people interact with each other and learning valuable information on social interactions. You can even imagine what you would do or say in that situation from a comfortable distance without the anxiety of having to be involved until you\u2019re ready to put yourself in the situation.\n\nThis is partly about control. You need to take control of your confidence and concerns about social interactions. \n\nGood luck with your goals!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fbt0cr/any_books_people_can_recommend_for_just_improving/fj7m09t/"}
