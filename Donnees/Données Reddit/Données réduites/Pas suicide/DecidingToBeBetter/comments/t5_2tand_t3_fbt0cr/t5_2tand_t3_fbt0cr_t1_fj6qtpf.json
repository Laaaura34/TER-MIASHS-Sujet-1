In the case where your counterpart doesnt say much, I think in the book there is something along the lines of \"great, that makes it easier because so and so isnt going to say anything to throw me off their true feelings\" meaning that body language is actually much more indicative of internal states than spoken language. Basically you want to listen and observe so carefully that you become the other person and can feel what they feel. Then you simply make comments about how you feel. I am still no master conversationalist I interject and talk over people a lot. (Working on it) basically for me the key was empathy and true listening. It helps me pick up on subtle queues that maybe I'm being too intense or annoying. People fucking love to talk (or type) about themselves.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fbt0cr/any_books_people_can_recommend_for_just_improving/fj6qtpf/"}
