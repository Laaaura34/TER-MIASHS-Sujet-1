I recommend seeing a therapist as well as practicing mindfulness meditation. You need to learn to see things objectively rather than applying judgment to everyone and every interaction. Learn to read behavior, not minds. \n\nThe mindfulness meditation app I use is called Simple Habit. There are others, such as Calm and Headspace. You should also find treatment for your social anxiety and any other possible cormobidities. No book on social skills will help you if you don't learn to accept yourself and your circumstances. \n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fbt0cr/any_books_people_can_recommend_for_just_improving/fj6tm5s/"}
