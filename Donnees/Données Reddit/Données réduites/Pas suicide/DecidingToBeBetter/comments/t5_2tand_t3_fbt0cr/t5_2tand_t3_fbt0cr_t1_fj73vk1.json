Every therapist works differently and not all of them follow the same model. The best one for me is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. My therapist is also my psychiatrist; she prescribes my medications at a separate clinic. \n\nTherapists are mental health professionals, which means they are doctors, which means we should treat them as professionals, the same way we'd treat a medical doctor. We should find one that we can trust and then trust them to do their work. We shouldn't lie to them and we shouldn't hold anything back that could help us heal.\n\nIn America, medicine is a business transaction. If this country were even halfway healthy, this wouldn't be the case, but it is the case. Therapy is for everyone and everyone should have access to mental health professionals. Everyone who has access should visit mental health professionals as needed. \n\nGood luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fbt0cr/any_books_people_can_recommend_for_just_improving/fj73vk1/"}
