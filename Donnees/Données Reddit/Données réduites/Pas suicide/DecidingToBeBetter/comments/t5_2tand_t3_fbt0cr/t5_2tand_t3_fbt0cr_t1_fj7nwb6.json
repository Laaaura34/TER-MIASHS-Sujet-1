The negotiation stuff on selling your idea or need to other person was great and supported by several really detailed examples you could apply use to interpret IRL situations. I\u2019d highly recommend that chapter for anyone who wants to be able to better pitch ideas. \n\nI very easily understood them and was able to introduce them into work by structuring changes to work by using phrases like \u201cif we do it this way, it\u2019ll mean you\u2019re ....\u201d not selling it that it was going to make my life easier.\n\nIt maybe a lack of understanding on my part, the other chapters such as the listening and letting other people talk contained good advice but I didn\u2019t feel have the examples that would help me apply it to my own life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fbt0cr/any_books_people_can_recommend_for_just_improving/fj7nwb6/"}
