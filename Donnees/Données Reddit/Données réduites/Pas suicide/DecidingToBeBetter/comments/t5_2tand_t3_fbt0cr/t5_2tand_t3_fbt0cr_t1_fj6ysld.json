If I had something to worry about coming up, I would be very stressed out about it in the several hours before the event. I think my logical part of the brain was just overactive. \n\nNow, bad things don't bother me for more than 15 minutes after the event if at all. And it can be 15 minutes before I know I have to put up with some rude person, but I'm not stressed about it in the least. It is kind of amusing to me now that I used to get so stressed about things like that.\n\nIt took me about a month of some pretty hardcore meditation to rewire my brain (sometimes I meditation for the entire day), but you should consider it. It was well worth the effort.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fbt0cr/any_books_people_can_recommend_for_just_improving/fj6ysld/"}
