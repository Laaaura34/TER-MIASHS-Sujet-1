I put myself in a state of mind where I was convinced that I could not socially interact and everyone thought I was boring all the time, it came to a point where it was so destructive I wasn't going outside or even interacting at all when buying groceries or people I would semi-know in the area. \n\nOne thing that really helped me really get out of that was to just ask the other person how their day is going and get them to talk about themselves, maybe you don't feel that comfortable talking about yourself.. Maybe you can try being a bit more curious about things in the other persons life.. Just throwing ideas out there from my limited experience.\n\nHope this helped a little, keep us updated how you are tracking <3", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fbt0cr/any_books_people_can_recommend_for_just_improving/fj7cpj4/"}
