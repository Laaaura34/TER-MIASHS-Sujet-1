While it covers a broad range of subjects, I think it's particularly useful in helping you overcome the constant need to evaluate and second guess yourself. Was I interesting enough? Did I entertain my guests? Could I have been funnier?\n\nOnce you build the right mindset, these questions will not matter at all. Now, this doesn't mean that you will not be engaged or focused (as is a common misconception about this book). This means that you will care about the things that actually matter and work in your favor, not against you. I couldn't recommend it enough for you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fbt0cr/any_books_people_can_recommend_for_just_improving/fj784lw/"}
