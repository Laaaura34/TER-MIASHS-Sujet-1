She's a shame a vulnerability researcher, and has her PhD in social work. She backs up her research with her own life stories and growth. Her book Daring Greatly is probably a great one to start with. If you have access to it, speak to a counsellor or social worker. Whether over the phone or text or in person. I hope that helps! Best of luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fbt0cr/any_books_people_can_recommend_for_just_improving/fj7ozev/"}
