Also hiking trails are great when you are somewhere beautiful and experiencing it walking together with friendly strangers. There's less expectation and no anxiety about lulls in conversation when you're all focused on something else like the outdoors. \n\nAlso I was always down to drink and smoke and the places you find to park overnight living in a van are also the places other houseless/homeless people frequent. It felt good to impact their day or night with such minor gifts as a 40oz or some joints or food and to learn so many interesting stories. I mean don't do this in really sketchy areas but also you should be able to drop your judgement and see people as people, especially yourself this way.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fbt0cr/any_books_people_can_recommend_for_just_improving/fj8iu5s/"}
