There's an audiobook spoken by her, and also the paper book, which allows you to do the challenges and mini-assignments she creates each chapter.\n\nI'd also recommend getting a job in retail or as a barista, that'll force you to talk to many people everyday. At first it'll be overwhelming but after a few weeks or months it'll become so much more comfortable. You can read whatever you want in books but it won't do as much as if you have many opportunities to put it into practice.
