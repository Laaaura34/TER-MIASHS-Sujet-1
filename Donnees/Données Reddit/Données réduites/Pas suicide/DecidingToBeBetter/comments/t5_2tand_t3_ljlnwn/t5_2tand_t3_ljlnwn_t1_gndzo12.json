My thoughts embrace some of your points.\n\nHappiness  \nAs many experts and philosophers state: *Happiness is not the goal. Happiness is the byproduct of a life lived well.* We 'live our lives well' by achieving balance across the various aspects of our life and in a way that has a positive impact on others and society.\n\nIf we make happiness the goal, we risk taking the easy ride and this prevents us from experiencing the challenges that make us grow. \n\nPurpose  \nThe point about purpose is an important one. Without purpose - no matter how much effort we apply - we have nothing. Purpose enriches us because it gives us meaning. It's our reason for getting out of bed.\n\nGratitude  \nThis is immensely powerful for our wellbeing both short term and long term. Short term because being thankful for even the smallest thing moves us to a more positive mental state and long term because it's helps us to develop resilience which is essential for dealing with life's challenges.\n\nLiving in the moment  \nAll too often, many of us reach the destination but have no idea how we arrived. This means we've been oblivious to the journey and missed out on so much. Life is a journey and the process that shapes us. There's so much to learn and enjoy along the way.\n\nThose are my thoughts. Thanks again for opening a discussion on a very worthy topic.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ljlnwn/who_doesnt_want_to_be_happy/gndzo12/"}
