I get my energy taken away from me, like water going down the drain. I don't feel like working, studying, reading, listening to music, watching movies, I try to put my attention on something for more than 20 minutes and I fail, and it's been going like that for about 11 years now. Fun fact, i'm 26, I \"should\" be BOOMING with energy and creative ideas and eating the world whereas reality is I get glued to my bed every morning feeling like doing nothing at all and the cycle seems to never stop. Also, my anxiety is always there lurking and ready to take me over.\n\nI've been on an off SSRI antidepressants for years, had my fair share of secondary effects including erectile dysfunction, meaning my PP don't work fine when I'm taking pills, which takes a toll on your masculine ego and your intimate life. But honestly fk it, I'm still fighting it and will fight back until I stop kicking.\n\nMy point being: you are absolutely not alone in going through fucked up depression/anxiety/mental illness. If going through rehab is what it takes to pull yourself out of it, by all means go willingly and embrace anything you experience there. Things cannot get worse than this I dare say. Embrace this shitstorm and navigate through it. It'll be okay.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nzbwut/headed_to_rehab_saturday_morning_not_sure_what_to/h1pap1t/"}
