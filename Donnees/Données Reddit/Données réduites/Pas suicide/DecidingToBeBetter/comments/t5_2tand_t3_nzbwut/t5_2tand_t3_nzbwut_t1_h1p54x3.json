With rehab you basically have very little to lose and everything to gain. Just relax, enjoy your vacation from life and try to soak up all of the experiences and advice/suggestions you get there. You probably won't agree with all of it and that's OK, just try to keep an open mind.\n\nSecondly I think the dual diagnosis is massive, a huge advantage. Actually at this point in my life it seems almost ironic that most rehabs are not dual diagnosis. It seems to me most of us used/drank to escape or treat another ailment. That's my own personal experience. I've quit drinking quite awhile now, but still having difficulty finding the right help with my other issues.\n\nGood Luck to You Friend, I was 19 when I hit rehab. It was a good experience and I made some good friends and connections there that turned out to help me stay sober. You'll be a better man no matter what happens, it's just another learning chapter in life !!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nzbwut/headed_to_rehab_saturday_morning_not_sure_what_to/h1p54x3/"}
