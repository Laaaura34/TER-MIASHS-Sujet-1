Always hope for the best but also make the best happen for yourself! You deserve the best! A big part of this whole ordeal is admitting to yourself that you make/made the choices that put you in this place. Nobody forced the alcohol on you (though there were reasons for it of course) You can change the choices, you have the power to do that. It\u2019s all about changing how you react to stresses because they never go away. Definitely go in with an open mind and say to yourself all the time \u201cI have the power to change this and I deserve a better life\u201d give that gift to yourself. It\u2019s hard but you have a whole amazing life ahead of you. Make it the best one!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nzbwut/headed_to_rehab_saturday_morning_not_sure_what_to/h1pyc1y/"}
