Congrats. Speaking from a recovering addict. You're doing a wonderful things for yourself. You are young and starting now gives you the best chance.\n\nI didn't even realize i was an addict until almost age 30 so you are way ahead. I have 8 years and some change and wouldn't change it for anything.\n\nJust remember: addicts can and DO recover. Like you said, keeping an open mind is huge. Also, getting away from your environment will be so helpful. Remember that everyone there is also there for the same reasons.\n\nJust focus on the positives and try. Just give it your all because you are worth it. I truly am hoping the best for you. Looking forward to any updates. \n\nYou got this!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nzbwut/headed_to_rehab_saturday_morning_not_sure_what_to/h1pkjim/"}
