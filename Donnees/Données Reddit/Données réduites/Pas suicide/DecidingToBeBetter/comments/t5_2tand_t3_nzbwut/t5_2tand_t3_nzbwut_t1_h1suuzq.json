BUT, after all is said and done, life can be awesome. \n\nI've been clean since 2010. I've been institutionalized twice. I'm 63. You are so lucky to get this hard lesson over with now. Take one day at a time, one minute at a time if you have to, believe in yourself, and know there are many who are pulling for you.\n\nWhen you get out let people know, share your experience. That one person who reads about your success may be saved from taking his or her own life, od'ing, or unbearable suffering. \n\nAnd one more thing. Getting clean you're giving yourself a chance for success... you may fall down, have a few bumps in the road, maybe even a crash or two... don't be afraid to get back up, dust your boots off and take that first step... the hardest step you're taking is the one heading to Florida to get clean.\n\nGood luck and God Bless.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nzbwut/headed_to_rehab_saturday_morning_not_sure_what_to/h1suuzq/"}
