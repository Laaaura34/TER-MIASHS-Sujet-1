It\u2019s awesome to see you having the desire. I was stuck in that cycle 8 years ago. That\u2019s almost half of your current life. I one day made the change that you are describing. I wanted to be better, I wanted to succeed. (whatever that is to you) \n\nCurrently, I have a daughter on the way. Happily married and making 110k plus. I do whatever, whenever I want and typically however I want. When I have those moments that I need to escape, I now do it in healthier outlets and jamb packed full of way more fun then I ever had chasing the gurn. It took me years to find my place, but I did it. \n\nI hope my sharing my success will give you a tiny glimpse into the reality that can be. There is so much potential wealth and opportunity out there. You got this!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nzbwut/headed_to_rehab_saturday_morning_not_sure_what_to/h1sx18w/"}
