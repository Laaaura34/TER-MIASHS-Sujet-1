I think that in my head, I make my issues/problems seem greater than they actually are. I don't really have issues being friendly or just simply talking to women in a normal setting. I think that where I struggle is the cold approach and/or transitioning the conversation to become suggestive or relationship-based in general. Asking someone out on a date seems very frightening to me, yet having a simple conversation about school, activities, etc. does not seem frightening at all. \n\nI think the great paradox is that because I have given so much weight to the subject of engaging in a relationship or doing anything sexual, that it makes it difficult to pursue, because to me, since i've put a lot of mental effort into thinking about it, it gives me a lot of anxiety whenever I think about actually pursuing a relationship or something \"more than friends\".", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p6dub1/advice_for_going_to_college_and_putting_myself/h9ckpcl/"}
