I would start by trying to learn from this person. If they are someone you know personally, spend time asking them about their worldviews and opinions on others, and pay attention to how they speak to others. It sounds like a lot of people avoid talking to you, but if you can think of someone who you believe speaks to others in a kind way, I would be upfront that you are wanting to learn to speak to others in a kind way and that you want their help. If you don't know anyone who will help you, thinking of a celebrity who is known for kindness and approachability and watching media on how they speak to others might also be helpful. Good luck, striving to be kinder is a noble endeavor. We need more kindness in the world.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mlrtxb/i_need_to_learn_how_to_speak_to_people_in_a/gtn79m9/"}
