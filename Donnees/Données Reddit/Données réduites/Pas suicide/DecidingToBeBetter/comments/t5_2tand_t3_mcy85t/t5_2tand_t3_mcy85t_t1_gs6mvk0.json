I did too. Breaks my heart to know children are treated like this. Kids drop things. They\u2019re messy and clumsy. So are **adults**!! People are imperfect. Damn. Many of these households and parents I know for a fact (in my experiences) are pro-life but then treat their children like garbage for not being little robots who perform and bend to the parents\u2019 will. Child abuse is actually one of the reasons I became pro-choice as a teen. It is 100x better in my mind for a woman to be able to admit she doesn\u2019t want/can\u2019t take care of a child.\n\nSorry for the rant. You deserved better. So much better. You deserve love and peace and to know you\u2019re not a burden. People are fallible and that goes for kids too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mcy85t/husband_spilled_nail_polish_all_over_our/gs6mvk0/"}
