He created a piece called The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even. It is made from two large panes of glass. He worked on it for eight years before finally deciding to display it. Not long after, while it was being moved, workers dropped it, spiderwebbing the glass very thoroughly. When Duchamp was told what happened he said, \"Good. That completes the work in a way better than I ever could have.\"\n\nIt is a really positive thing to be able to accept what the universe throws at you and to roll with it. Very well done. Your family is doing great in that regard.\n\nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-1010/dada-and-surrealism/dada2/a/duchamp-the-bride-stripped-bare-by-her-bachelors-even", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mcy85t/husband_spilled_nail_polish_all_over_our/gs8m8zu/"}
