My husband and I came from fighty households, and have to remind each other sometimes - reacting badly just makes a situation 100x worse than it needs to be.  When we get frustrated and yell/shame each other it's just pain for no good reason.  It's not going to help us be more careful next time.  We both value our stuff so of *course* we feel bad if we ruin something.  I really try to practice doing an over-the-top, chipper \"well that's ok!\" response when bad shit happens, just that little moment of response can change the course of the entire day, bring you closer together or push you apart.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mcy85t/husband_spilled_nail_polish_all_over_our/gs66j3l/"}
