I grew up in a house where every time something happened, the first reaction would be to assign blame and I lost so many friends growing up because every time they criticised me I'd find something else to blame. \n\nNow I just say oh shit yes the thing has happened, and I work on how to fix it instead of assigning blame (why bother, its already happened?!)\n\nnote: only applies to things that it doesn't matter like who spilled the drink on the couch, who left the window open etc.not serious stuff where you should be taking responsibility", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mcy85t/husband_spilled_nail_polish_all_over_our/gs9alav/"}
