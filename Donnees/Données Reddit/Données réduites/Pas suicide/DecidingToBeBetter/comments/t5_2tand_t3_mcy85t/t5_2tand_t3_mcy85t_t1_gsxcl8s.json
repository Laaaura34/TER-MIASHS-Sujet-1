Being the person to take the \u201cunpopular opinion\u201d can be interesting and quirky sometimes, and other instances it can make you look like a dick, such as this case.\n\nWithout knowing more about my family but going ahead and commenting on what some people do but taking it a step further and suggesting I might not understand my own parents, you unintentionally invalidated my abusive childhood. Let me just share one story that stands out from the rest but by no means shares the extent of what happened during my childhood: we weren\u2019t allowed to laugh or make noises above a whisper at the dinner table. I\u2019ve gotten smacked on multiple occasions for laughing too loud. Sure, it\u2019s because my father has PTSD, I know the reason why he acted the way he did (and not everyone that has been abused has had the fortune of knowing why) but that doesn\u2019t make that type of behavior okay or acceptable.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mcy85t/husband_spilled_nail_polish_all_over_our/gsxcl8s/"}
