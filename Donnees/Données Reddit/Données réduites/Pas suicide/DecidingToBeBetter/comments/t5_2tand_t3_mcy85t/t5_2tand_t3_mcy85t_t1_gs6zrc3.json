It sounds like you are with an amazing person.\n\nI\u2019m still young and going through the beginnings of therapy right now to get over this exact sort of behavior by my parents that left me with a lot of healing to do, so it\u2019s wonderful to hear that somebody who has been through something similar is thriving.  That perfectionism and anger leaves you with the mentality that mistakes are bad. But it\u2019s okay to make mistakes.\n\nI\u2019m glad you are now in an environment that is more accepting of mistakes. I wish you luck throughout your pregnancy!!!! : - )", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mcy85t/husband_spilled_nail_polish_all_over_our/gs6zrc3/"}
