My parents are nice people but a bit weird - I could never talk to them about problems or fuckups because it would be met with anger, so I just never opened up. This really came to a head when I had a car bump, minor damage, called my dad at the scene and he shouted down the phone and hung up. If you can't call your parents when you need them they haven't done a good job in that respect.\n\nWith a toddler in the house I hope we can both be the parents he runs to when he's done something wrong and we can teach him how to own it, fix it and learn from it.\n\nAs long as he doesn't break my guitars or dump jammy dodgers in my home brew beer.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mcy85t/husband_spilled_nail_polish_all_over_our/gs7lpj2/"}
