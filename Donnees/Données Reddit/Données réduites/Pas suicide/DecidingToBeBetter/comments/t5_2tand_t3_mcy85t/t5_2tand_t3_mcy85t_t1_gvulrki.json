I agree with OP has to say. \n\nWhen you tell someone who was abused, they\u2019re are being critical of the abuser when they\u2019re merely speaking of their experience , that\u2019s called invalidation.\n\nBeing critical would be say me telling your comment was crap. You\u2019re minimizing the whole trauma to \u201ccriticizing\u201d. \n\nTip; if you don\u2019t feel empathy or cant show it, just don\u2019t bother commenting on things you have no clue of.
