I used it as a way to relax and \"resolve\" my stress. I found out very quickly after I had stopped smoking that I was much more productive and honestly better at handling life. I'm still struggling but I recommend finding another way to relieve your stress. There are many people that can smoke and be just as productive then those that don't. I find weed to be for certain people. If your using it to cope with stress then it comes as a negative, but if your using it to just have a good time then it can be a fun and positive experience. Judge it on your own accord and go from there; but don't let it effect possible jobs that could help you. Enjoy your life and move past the negatives!
