Then my girlfriend at the time got pregnant and I decided I needed to smarten up and find a career. I couldn't believe the difference not smoking made to me. I felt smarter, more energetic, etc etc. I still smoke very occasionally, like if someone is passing a joint around the campfire I'll have a puff, so I haven't shunned it from my life or anything. But honestly I don't miss it or have any urge for it. YMMV, but I wish you good luck, and hope you experience something similar to what I did.
