Getting an abortion is an incredibly traumatic experience for a significant number of women, and it seems like your girlfriend was one of them.  You in no way understood, and it seems ever tried to understand, what she was going through.  You made what was likely the worst day of her life up to that point about you.  There\u2019s so many hormones and things that happen to the female body starting immediately upon conception.  What she\u2019s feeling is entirely different that what you felt and you don\u2019t seem to be interested in understanding that.\n\nYour girlfriend needed your support to get through a trauma and you weren\u2019t there.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n6fxnt/she_wrote_me_8_months_later/gx7dsk7/"}
