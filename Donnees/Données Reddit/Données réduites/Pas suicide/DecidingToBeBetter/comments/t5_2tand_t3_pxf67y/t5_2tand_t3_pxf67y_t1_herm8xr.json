No drug dependencies though. I've been on the self dev / reflection train for about a year now. One facet I regret not starting with first, is learning about my personality and the personalities of others. I encourage you to dig deep into Meyers briggs and enneagram tests. I also highly recommend audible \"the road back to you\" which is fantastic intro to the 9 enneagram classifications . Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxf67y/achieving_friendship/herm8xr/"}
