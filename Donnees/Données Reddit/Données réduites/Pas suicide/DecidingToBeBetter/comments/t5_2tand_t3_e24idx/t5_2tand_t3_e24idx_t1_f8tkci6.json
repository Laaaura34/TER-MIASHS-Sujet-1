Now get to know yourself with this attitude. Find out what things make you feel what feelings. Be curious. If something you find out seems like it's wrong, don't judge but explore it further. Feelings can be a good guide.\nAlso use your brain. Try the things other people say really helped, and be honest about how they change your mood. Put yourself in situations you think might benefit you. Most people want to feel useful for society, figure out what you can do if that's the case. Can you volunteer? Visit an elderly family member? Get an easy job where you can see results (not talking money)? Get a demanding job?\nBut most of all, fuck conforming to society. There is nothing (okay apart from murder and rape, etc) that you really should or shouldn't do. Studying should only be done by people who genuinely want it, and you might want it one day, but if it's not today then don't beat yourself up.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/e24idx/getting_out_of_your_mind_into_the_reality/f8tkci6/"}
