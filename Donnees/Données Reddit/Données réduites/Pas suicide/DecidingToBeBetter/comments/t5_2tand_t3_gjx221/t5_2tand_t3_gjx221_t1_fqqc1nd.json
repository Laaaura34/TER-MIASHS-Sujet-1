Congrats!!\n\nI just attempted suicide 2.5 weeks ago and part of me was thinking of becoming a nurse after several of them saved my life and I want to give back. But I was worried something like a suicide attempt would somehow get in the way.. because of just my mental or emotional health, or if they\u2019d somehow find out (idk how they\u2019d find out I\u2019m a paranoid person).\n\nNow I know that it CAN happen. I probably won\u2019t do it because Idk if it\u2019s for me but I like to know there\u2019s a possibility.\n\nThanks and good luck to you!
