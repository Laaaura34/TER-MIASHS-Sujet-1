You can buy a book online if you can't get access to a professional who could help guide you. \n\nCBT helps you work out the feelings you have when you doing certain things like \"pocketing\". If you honest with yourself while working through it, it can be immensely helpful to start recognising the signs before you fully go into that mode (which can become a habit or second nature). \n\nUsually, these things are attached to some event, trauma or fear you have which you're trying to avoid to protect yourself from humiliation, emotional pain etc. \n\nCBT can be used for a range of problems like anger management, social anxiety, stress, overeating, confidence, overcoming self-esteem issues etc. I'm not a professional but I did use CBT to help me with my self-esteem and social anxiety and it worked very well. I know of a few professionals that try this before anything else. \n\nThen there is DBT which is based on CBT but is more on the emotional side of things so you have to work out if the problem is more emotional (I do this and it makes me feel incredibly upset and angry) or is it more of a mental/cognitive issue. I.e. if I do this then this will happen and then that other thing might happen and then I'll not have the thing I need.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mk7gku/how_to_stop_pocketing_my_partner/gtecojs/"}
