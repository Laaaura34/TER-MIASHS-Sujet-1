Maybe I was less anxious mentally, but more tired physically, the money wasn't good, I still had to wake up in the morning, I still had to spend all of my day in one place, I still had to deal with rude people while working. \nI wouldn't be able to move out of my parents house with that kind of money.\n\nI'll need to work either way one day, what I'm hoping is this effort now will make my time more valuable when I'm actually working being paid more, able to choose what place I want to be in, able to afford what I want, independent.\n\nI'm not happy where I am, this is the path I have available that will take me somewhere else hopefully. \n\nI see this choice as \"choose your evil\".", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2ctyt/everything_ive_done_in_life_has_been_in_the/hfmizqh/"}
