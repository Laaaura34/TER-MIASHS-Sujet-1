Work will have to be put in, and I\u2019m more than willing to do that, especially if it\u2019s something I am actually interested in. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m also not willing to settle for something that I dread when I wake up on a Monday morning, which has unfortunately been the case for every one of my jobs so far. I always love my jobs at first, simply because it is different than what i was doing before, and I am also an extremely good worker so usually the job comes easy for me, which I\u2019m grateful for. But it doesn\u2019t take long for the sense of \u201cwtf am i doing here\u201d kicks in. \n\nI\u2019ve been working for 5 years now, and people always say \u201coh you\u2019re young, you have time to figure it out.\u201d But this is something i\u2019ve been struggling with since even before I started working, honestly probably since middle school when parents and teachers began asking what potential majors I would choose for college. And if i haven\u2019t figured it out in the last (almost) 10 years of my life, it doesn\u2019t give me much hope that i will figure it out within the next few months. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m really happy that you found something that you want to do. Despite my somewhat bleak response, I will take your story into consideration and hold onto the hope that maybe one day i will find something unexpected. Who knows? Maybe it\u2019s the very next thing I will do. Thanks for responding :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2ctyt/everything_ive_done_in_life_has_been_in_the/hflo1gi/"}
