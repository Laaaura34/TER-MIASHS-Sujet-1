I also understand that I am quite privileged to where I am financially able to make that decision. \n\nSo honestly, i really respect what you\u2019re doing in the fact that you\u2019ve made a decision to stick with one thing and have kept to it. I\u2019ve obviously never been able to do that. I do hope that one day you\u2019ll be surrounded by people who love you for who you are and not for what you\u2019ve bought, and that a passion will ignite from truly becoming yourself. \n\nKeep at it, but don\u2019t work too hard.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2ctyt/everything_ive_done_in_life_has_been_in_the/hflpmyp/"}
