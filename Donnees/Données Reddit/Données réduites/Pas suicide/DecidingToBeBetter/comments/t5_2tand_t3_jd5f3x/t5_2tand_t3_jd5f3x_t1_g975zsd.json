Do whatever your body is telling you.\nCry, smile, laugh, get excited, jump, dance. Just let the emotions flow through your body and pay attention to them because they're going to be times again when you won't feel like that.\n\nYou will have down times again and you gotta remember those feelings you get right now so you can stay motivated and disciplined knowing that you have the power to get the same feelings again.\n\nLife's a roller coaster of emotions and you gotta get used to it.\n\nAnother advice I want to give you is to not react all the way to your emotions.\nWhat I mean to say is that when you feel angry, sad  or depressed, you've gotta learn how to feel the energy and the emotions going through your body but without being reactive to them. That's what you gotta do with positive emotions too. I don't know exactly how to explain that because I'm still figuring this out but hope you get the point.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jd5f3x/6_days_sober_just_had_the_best_day_of_my_life_and/g975zsd/"}
