It's so easy to go a few days or a week without and then reward myself with a late night chill sesh, then slip immediately into daily use again. Fogs my brain, kills motivation, creates more anxiety than it helps (honestly regular exercise or meditation is all you should need), etc. And when I break and go back into smoking, I realize how it affects me physically.
