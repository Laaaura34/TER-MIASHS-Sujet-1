As a heavy smoker, I've quit on and off a few times over the past few years. Currently, I haven't smoked since March. It's amazing! Life truly is different. I'd encourage you to not look at it as a \"t break\", which just implies you're only doing it so you can get higher when you start back up again. Don't set a time limit and just see where it goes. Anyway, being off weed is amazing, but the initial period of quitting definitely comes with it's ups and downs. Be strong! Congrats!!! Happy you are here with us in the present moment!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jd5f3x/6_days_sober_just_had_the_best_day_of_my_life_and/g96m1yh/"}
