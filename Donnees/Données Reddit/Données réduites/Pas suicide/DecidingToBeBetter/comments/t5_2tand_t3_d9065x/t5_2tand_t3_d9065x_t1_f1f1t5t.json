Closing myself off and faking it led me to become an anxious, constantly depressed, and miserable person overall. Deciding to take the genuine route has been a hard change to make, precisely because of the adjustments I've had to make, but now I'm able to connect with others in more meaningful ways. My social life is constantly improving. I can hold conversations much better than I ever have been able to. Overall, life just feels less heavy and I feel like a stronger, happier, and a more relaxed person. In practice, it's difficult, but it's still the best option if you're willing to make the adjustments necessary to connect with others.\n\nI'm 29 years old, and I wish I had gotten over myself years  ago so I could open up like this. It's the best change I've ever made.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/d9065x/why_you_should_always_be_genuine/f1f1t5t/"}
