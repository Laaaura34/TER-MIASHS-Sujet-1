I still took the time to chat with them about my qualifications, why I'm looking for a position, and why I was interested in their company. \n\nThen came the dreaded question I knew was coming. \"Do you have any physical disabilities that could prevent you from performing manual labour?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do.\" I explained to them my situation, how long I've had it, and that if any issues do occur, I jump on it immediately to get it resolved quickly. They were incredibly gracious and quite interested, but ultimately, I had to decline... The kicker?\n\nI was so genuine in that interview and communicative that they told me, when they begin looking for office work in the near future, my resume and phone number will be on the top of their list! They also told me it was unfortunate because I was one of their top candidates for the position.\n\nBeing genuine has worked far better for me in the last few years than \"Fake it 'til you make it.\"", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/d9065x/why_you_should_always_be_genuine/f1f0ftx/"}
