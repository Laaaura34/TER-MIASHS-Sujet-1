We're not exactly the best in hiding our hands either.\n\nThere are situations where keeping your cards close to your heart is necessary. If you're living in an abusive home, for example, or if you are depending on a certain thing to keep living (say, a job). I wish things will be better for you if that is your case, and please, put your life and safety first. \n\nOther than that, however... Keeping ourselves inside the walls we made may feel safe, but really in truth we're just locking ourselves in and denying the good. Plenty of people can see if you have something to hide. Some will distance themselves because of it. While those with malice can and will break through your walls, sneak inside them like a phantom thief.\n\nMeanwhile you are starving and defenseless and cold inside those walls.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/d9065x/why_you_should_always_be_genuine/f1edc4r/"}
