Pay attention to that feeling you get when you want to say something, think about what you want to say, then say it.\n\nFor me, I was afraid of being rejected for whatever opinion I might express. It helped to start thinking that if someone was turned off by that opinion and wasn't keen to discuss it, then we're both better off without each other's company. Don't take it personally. Just move on. Once I started applying that principle, it became easier. Not only that, but the criticism I received became easier to take and learn from.\n\nRecognize your value. Your opinion matters just as much as the others' in the conversation. Even if it's wrong, because that creates opportunities to learn. Not speaking up only hurts you, so have some respect for yourself and say what you need to say.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/d9065x/why_you_should_always_be_genuine/f1fvudn/"}
