Reddit and the rest are like supermarkets/malls with huge mixes of people, goods & services. The dedicated forums narrow it down more with people who tend to be more passionate/enthusiastic or focused on said topic. The members and audience is a bit different.  I wouldn't say dedicated Discords are better though; more like actual message boards / forums.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hp2ega/alternative_to_social_media/fxlyhv8/"}
