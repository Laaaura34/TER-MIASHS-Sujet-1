The links I sent explain this further but to summarize the claim that depression is a chemical imbalance is 50 years old and no longer what researchers think as a cause more like an inconsistent associated effect. One study I remember shows that Prozac a leading SSRI works only 8% better than a placebo. That isn't to say that medication doesn't help people and people shouldn't take it. It is just incorrect to state that clinical depression needs medication to be corrected. It isn't simply a chemical imbalance to be corrected the brain is much more complicated than that which we do not fully understand. Medication can be a tool to work on the issues of why you are depressed but medication itself cannot solve or correct your problems.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ii9773/this_is_a_quote_about_depression_that_felt_like_a/g36fjdq/"}
