I'm assuming you know about /r/raisedbynarcissists.  One thing I will say on this subject, my husband is a therapist and so we get mailers about upcoming trainings all the time.  Just recently we've been getting mailers about adult children of narcissists, therapeutic techniques for overcoming shame and guilt, attachment disorders, developing self-identity.  That sort of thing.  Mainstream medicine is starting to take notice of this group and the unique, lasting damage they incur.  As everyone in this sub always does, I would encourage you to talk to someone about this - a trusted counselor or therapist can help you stay grounded and follow an objective truth as your parents try to manipulate you.  Best wishes in your journey.  You can find yourself and leave their chaos behind.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ov8b48/i_decided_to_fight_for_my_happiness/h77jk1e/"}
