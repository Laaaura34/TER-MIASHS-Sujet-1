What helped me was that when I relapsed I wouldn\u2019t be so hard on myself. I remember I would smoke 3-4 cigs a day and when I relapsed and smoked maybe one every two days ,I would say to myself \u201cone is better than 3-4 a day\u201d. Of course the goal is to quit all together but when i smoked one cig I would try my best the next day to go for 0. Too many times when we relapse we get down on ourselves and that makes us reach for our escapes even more! As long as you don\u2019t go back to your starting point (mine was 3-4 a day) then it\u2019s a  victory and make sure you pat yourself on the back!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/if78cf/i_beat_my_addictions_and_my_life_is_finally/g2m3732/"}
