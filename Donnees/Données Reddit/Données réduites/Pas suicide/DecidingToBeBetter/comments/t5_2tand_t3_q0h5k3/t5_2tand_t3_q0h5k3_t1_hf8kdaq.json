Everyone is different and sobriety and quiting is different for everyone. But what REALLY helped me with coke is 1) a sobriety counter app and 2) walking away and absolutely saying NO when it's offered.\n\nCoke is weird cause it's so easy to get in a party setting, and I like to party. But as soon as it shows up you just gotta walk away and find something else to do.\n\nI think coke is unique where, at least for me, it's easy to say no to but once you start doing it you can't stop. Idk \n\nMan that shit is no joke, good for you quiting I wish you the absolute best.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0h5k3/today_im_quitting_cocaine/hf8kdaq/"}
