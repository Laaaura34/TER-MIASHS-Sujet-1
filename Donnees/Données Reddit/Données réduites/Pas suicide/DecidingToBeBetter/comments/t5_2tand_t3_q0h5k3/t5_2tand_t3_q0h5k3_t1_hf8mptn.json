Don\u2019t give up, even if you slip. Don\u2019t forget that\u2019s it\u2019s ok to ask for help. Na meetings may help. I know you want to do it on your own, but remember that you don\u2019t have to. My mom said she could do it on her own, many many years ago and many many times, but has not succeeded. She needs help but won\u2019t get it. \nDon\u2019t let yourself struggle if you need help. Please. Life is hard, no reason to make it harder. \n\nYou know you\u2019re worth it. You know you can do it. You are loved and are capable of loving. Love yourself and keep on keepin on.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0h5k3/today_im_quitting_cocaine/hf8mptn/"}
