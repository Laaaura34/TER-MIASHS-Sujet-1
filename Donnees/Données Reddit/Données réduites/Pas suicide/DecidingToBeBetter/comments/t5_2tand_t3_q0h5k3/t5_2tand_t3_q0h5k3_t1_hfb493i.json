And I\u2019ve seen some that have helped me way more than not going ever could. I hope you find a therapist, a group, or someone else to talk to outside of your relationship to help you through. I say \u201coutside of your relationship\u201d because as someone mentioned, it is very easy to end up in a codependent relationship as someone in recovery. \n\nYou have been through hell and back. There\u2019s a long, uneasy road ahead. But you got this. Whatever lies ahead is nothing compared to what you\u2019ve been through. \n\nI hope you chose to live a different life, one day at a time. What\u2019s on the other side is immensely richer and more rewarding sober. Godspeed, my dude.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0h5k3/today_im_quitting_cocaine/hfb493i/"}
