I locked myself out of my truck which I have literally never done. Ever. And it took me 4 hours to break into it, which should have only taken me 30 mins max. My problem solving skills, personality, and body have been crashing due to drugs and one thing about me is I refuse to lose my intelligence. I need to be able to solve problems quickly or I get anxious but yeah lol, I\u2019d love to hear more of your story and I\u2019m really glad if I can help inspire or keep someone else on the right track!
