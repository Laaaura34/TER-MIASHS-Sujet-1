Once you find people that do it, they shove that shit up your nose and it's free.\n\nThat's why you HAVE to walk away. And make it clear to your friends you're not doing it. It's up to you if you decide you can't be friends with those kinds of people, for me it works to just tell them NO I DON'T WANT COCAINE.\n\nI so sympathize with you right now. Coke is really addictive, available, and easy to do. But fuck it, it's my least favorite drug. It's boring, addictive and messes with your brain chemistry and emotions.\n\nI'm thinking of you, wish you the best and I hope you are doing ok. \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0h5k3/today_im_quitting_cocaine/hf8ljn7/"}
