You could do some of the following: openly discussing with parents, buying one or a few items to start, and research the car renting policies/requirements. You could even do a pro/con list to see if it's worth pursuing each thing right now and of course, set a reasonable budget. You can't control other people's reactions, and you have every right to be yourself, just take it slow. It'll be okay even if you can't have a \"perfect\" celebration this year, know that there'll be other chances in the future.
