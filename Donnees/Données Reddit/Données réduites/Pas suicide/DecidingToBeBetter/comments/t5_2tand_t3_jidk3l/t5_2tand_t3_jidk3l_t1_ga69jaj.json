It's only good to see the bad experiences didn't reflect badly on your character. Stay strong because there are bad people out there, but most people are good, luckily ! I'm a white girl living in quite homogeneous country (that's why strangers of any color are quite rare) and people in my country are kind hearted, always welcoming strangers, so I expected all people around the globe to be warm and welcoming... I have experienced nationalism/racism in Germany when traveling, whenever I asked random people for a direction or ask anything a traveler would ask, I would get completely unrelated comments like - what are you,Turkish,a Muslim (I'm not catholic and I didn't know a certain day was a holiday when all shops were closed,I asked two grannies on the street why was a shop closed,and they yelled at me) and these weird name callings repeated many times..that's why I don't like Germany for traveling or living.. I feel they hate all non-germanic people..", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jidk3l/when_was_the_first_time_you_experienced_racism/ga69jaj/"}
