I\u2019m really sorry to hear about your situation. People are actually so mean. \n\nI\u2019m going to suggest to you the podcast \u201cYou Need Therapy\u201d. It helped me in my healing from my childhood trauma. A few things I would like to say:\n1. Vanity is a made up concept. Beauty and what is considered beautiful isn\u2019t REALLY beautiful, it\u2019s what society says. Most people do not look anything like models, it feels normal because all that\u2019s pushed at you on IG is beautiful girls but look around in real life. Most people just look normal. Of course people are mean AFFFFFF and will let you know they don\u2019t like how you look. I realized, once I became an adult these petty comments stopped coming so much. \n\nI think a big part in healing is self love and self acceptance. Once I heard that I was like \u201cWell that\u2019s actually impossible for me because I will always hate myself\u201d My mom bought me one of the cheesy ass work books called \u201cSelf Love Workbook For Women \ud83c\udf08\u2600\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u201d Barf. but\u2026I was like loving myself would be cool so I am going to answer every question no matter how cheesy. And although I\u2019m not perfect, I can say I\u2019m so glad I did it because it showed me it is possible to love myself and it\u2019s necessary for me to be happy. \n\nKindness with others will follow once you have kindness from yourself. \n\n2. Healing your inner child, from that trauma, is important too. In the podcast she says: \u201cevery problem you have developed over time to protect yourself\u201d everything we view as bad/challenging. we\u2019ve developed all of our behaviors in response to something. and a lot of these things we developed as LITTLE KIDS. \n\nSo this mean attitude you developed was literally to survive back then. It\u2019s amazing you recognized it and want to change!! Once you start being more authentic and falling into yourself, you are going to attract people that are like you and will be better friends. It may take longer but will be more genuine I believe. \n\nI noticed you said in another comment journaling made you feel sadder, but if you don\u2019t confront sad feelings, anxiety, it will continue to grow outside your control. Maybe if writing isn\u2019t your thing work with a therapist, talk to yourself out loud. No one said Healing is easy, you\u2019re going to need to cry. These are very painful real things, but if you don\u2019t go through the hurt now you\u2019ll carry it forever.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pm77dj/i_want_to_stop_being_a_mean_cold_btch/hcgbmjp/"}
