You were a sad and lonely kid who didn't know better. Imagine someone else in that position can you forgive them for being mean as a defense? \n\nEvery new person you meet is a new opportunity to invent yourself new.\n\nTry not to be mean first and see where that goes the worst thing that can happen is they are mean but I think you can handle that a lot better that you from 5 years ago.\nSo no need to shut every one out by default with insulting them first.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pm77dj/i_want_to_stop_being_a_mean_cold_btch/hcfobp0/"}
