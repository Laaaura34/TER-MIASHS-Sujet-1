Let them teach you. \n\nYou\u2019d never treat that kitty the way you do yourself based on this. \n\nCultivate that feeling of love and slowly expand it to include others. And idk if you are ugly to anyone but yourself, but ugly kitties are awesome. They become popular and beloved!\n\nAlso kitties are unapologetic, unashamed, and have no problem admitting when they need contact. They are also especially clear when they\u2019ve had enough contact and go do their solo thing. It\u2019s a pretty good life you give? Then you have good in you, and it\u2019s too soon to give up.\n\nThank goodness for these here adorable jerks of mine during the pandemic. And a lot of kitties kept me alive through that shitshow. I protected them like nobody protected me, and I knew I was better than those narcissists.\n\nAnd remember we all are feeling more burden right now and it\u2019s coming from the outside.\n\nGood luck xoxo", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pm77dj/i_want_to_stop_being_a_mean_cold_btch/hcgnvyx/"}
