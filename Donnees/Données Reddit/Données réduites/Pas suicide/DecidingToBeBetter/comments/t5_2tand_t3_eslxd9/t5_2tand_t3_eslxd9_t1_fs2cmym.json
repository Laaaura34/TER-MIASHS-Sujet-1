I recently built new computers for my wife and I (going into quarantine as well, wanting to make sure our entertainment/sanity would be accommodated), and was just sort of beside myself realizing there wasn't a pinnacle experience behind it. Bought the master chief collection, refunded it after an hour. I have such insanely positive memories of my time spent on it as a teenager, and it was miserable trying to chase and relive it NOW. Midlife crisis be damned, I'm not sure how exactly to overcome it, but I'm attempting to stay 'constructive and productive' moving forward, despite a fairly deep feeling of ennui and disillusionment with myself. Turnover and burnout is exceptionally high, but still I'm searching for the new group game that might hold my interest and rally my friends behind for the good ol' times.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eslxd9/30m_struggling_with_longtime_video_game_avoidance/fs2cmym/"}
