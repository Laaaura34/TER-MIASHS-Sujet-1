It\u2019s like my soul hurts if I regret not doing something, luckily I\u2019m mid 30s and I\u2019ve learnt that lesson so going forward I\u2019m open to everything (nothing reckless) and it feels liberating. \n\nGood luck on your journey.. it\u2019s never too late!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcot33/5_years_ago_i_regretted_not_following_my_dream/hao4mwz/"}
