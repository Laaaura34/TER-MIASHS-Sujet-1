Which is a challenge in it's own right imo. Most of my peers still love drinking while going out. I hope you can get back on the sobriety train. From past experiences, before this 3 year personal best, I've found that I went very quickly from normal drinker to problem drinker. It usually only lasted some weeks, before blackouts became a bad part of my life again.\n\nI hope you find a new and supportive social circle soon. And maybe some new, non-drinking hobbies.\n\nBest of luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fik2q4/three_sober_years_sober_life_is_sublime/fkiz00b/"}
