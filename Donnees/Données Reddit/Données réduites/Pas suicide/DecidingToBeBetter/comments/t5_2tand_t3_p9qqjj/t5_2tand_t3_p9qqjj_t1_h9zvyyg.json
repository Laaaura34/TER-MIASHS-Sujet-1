I know how you feel, I\u2019ve been in a slump for the past 2 years. I\u2019ve been working 7 days a week for six months, currently swapped to alternating day and night shifts. Sleeping 2 hours a night. I\u2019m working away from home and I have 4 family members in ICU that I may never see again. It takes it\u2019s toll and alcohol is an easy answer. To be honest i am currently drunk, it\u2019s not good and I know that I will regret it in the morning. Just wanted to say stay strong and stick with being sober, I frequent sites like this and stories like yours help me through. I wish you the best of luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p9qqjj/im_going_on_day_7_of_not_drinking_and_im_really/h9zvyyg/"}
