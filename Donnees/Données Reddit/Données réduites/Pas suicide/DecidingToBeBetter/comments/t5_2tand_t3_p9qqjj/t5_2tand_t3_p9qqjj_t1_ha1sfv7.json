You don't mention any physical symptoms of liver failure and this is good. Very good in fact. The liver can only take so much and you stopping before horrible problems present is excellent. \n\n\nI'm glad you have a therapist! I'm glad you got such good advice here. \n\nYummy fruity clean juices at night. Make them delicious . Icy! Fizzy water chilled! Try all the kinds! Load up on things that make them better. Lemons, mint, grapefruit juice. Your body will drink in the nutrients! \n\nYou are saving money! Treat yourself with things your body will love you for. Cheap juicers are available for 40 bucks. Get one.  Did you know that you can't taste spinach in a juice? I love mandrarian oranges, spinach and carrots. Baby carrots are cheap and sweet. Your body may crave sugar in waves. Juices are your friend. \n\nGood luck and talk to your doctor if you see fit. It could be very helpful.\n\nKudos on listening to your survival instinct.  You deserve a happy healthy long life : )", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p9qqjj/im_going_on_day_7_of_not_drinking_and_im_really/ha1sfv7/"}
