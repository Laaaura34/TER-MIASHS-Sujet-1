That's an awesome achievement and that first week is so tough. I would strongly recommend checking out the stopdrinking subreddit if you haven't already. It's a really supportive community all walking the same road and I found reading and posting there really helpful. Reading This Naked Mind by Annie Grace worked well for me too.\n\nYou say you're sleeping more like it's a bad thing! You're healing, you need all the self-care you can give yourself and sleep is key. These early days are tough and it can be hard to stay motivated but I believe it will be worth it.
