I think I'm mainly frustrated because it's hard to measure the successes I want to achieve this early. Like a little over a week ago I started hydrating more, and more regularly, and I noticed tangible boons right within a day, and it got better from there. With this, I think because I'm doing it to focus on and confront my emotional shit, it's harder because improving emotional management takes so long. If that makes sense.. Like when I don't allow myself to run away from, say, work anxieties by drinking, then my brain is prone to find alternative coping methods attractive, some of which (like watching YouTube in bed instead) are also not conducive to working at my mental health stuff. It's so frustrating it makes me want to do really stupid stuff. \n\nThe frustration comes and goes though, so like you said -- one day at a time. Seeing all the positive responses is also helping tonight", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p9qqjj/im_going_on_day_7_of_not_drinking_and_im_really/h9zw89o/"}
