It was hard.  It was really hard, but in the AA meetings they say to take one day at a time.  Sometimes it helps to think that.  What you said about things are rearing their ugly heads for you to look at.  Please look at them.  Face these issues and try to muddle through as best as you can.  Keep a mood journal to just check in.  If you can maybe a few psychotherapy sessions.  They will help to get you over the rough spots.  What helped me the most was to look at how much money I was saving and sort of earmark that money toward something I wanted to buy for myself.  Best of luck and when you look back on it you can count this as being one of the really hard things you did in your life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p9qqjj/im_going_on_day_7_of_not_drinking_and_im_really/ha192yv/"}
