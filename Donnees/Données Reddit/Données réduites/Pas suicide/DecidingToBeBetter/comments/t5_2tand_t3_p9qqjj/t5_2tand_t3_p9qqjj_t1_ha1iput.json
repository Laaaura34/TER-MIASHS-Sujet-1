Even if it\u2019s just taking a short walk outside when you\u2019re feeling drained/depressed, and maybe listening to a playlist of songs with positive energy. Eventually I started going on runs. It was hard, but I saw significant gains in my mental health. I\u2019ve since stopped exercising every day and I notice the difference in the opposite direction. So I\u2019m going to start exercising again :)\n\nI also wrote a little note to myself that I read every morning, which helps remind me where my priorities are before I begin the day, and that\u2019s been really helpful too.\n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p9qqjj/im_going_on_day_7_of_not_drinking_and_im_really/ha1iput/"}
