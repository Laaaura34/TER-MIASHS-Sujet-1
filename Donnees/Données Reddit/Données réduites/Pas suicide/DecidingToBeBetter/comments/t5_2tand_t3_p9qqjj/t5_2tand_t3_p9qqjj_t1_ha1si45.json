There have been SO MANY comments, and they're full of not only support but some advice and strategies that I just have never thought of myself. I'm excited to keep trying them. And I won't be deleting this post because I think revisiting it and all the comments could help me, and hopefully others too!\n\nI will point out one piece of advice that a couple people said that I didn't even think of before, and that is to just try to do a day at a time. I'm really bad at thinking it's all-or-nothing when I make a goal (like not drinking for 3 days) that I really care about, and if I fail I manage to end up feeling full of self-loathing and guilt. But I'm going to really try the day-by-day approach. But yeah, check out the other comments for other strategies. We can both make it today :)\n\nP.s. if you need to reach out, my DMs are open. I'm new at this too, so it would probably be beneficial for both of us", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p9qqjj/im_going_on_day_7_of_not_drinking_and_im_really/ha1si45/"}
