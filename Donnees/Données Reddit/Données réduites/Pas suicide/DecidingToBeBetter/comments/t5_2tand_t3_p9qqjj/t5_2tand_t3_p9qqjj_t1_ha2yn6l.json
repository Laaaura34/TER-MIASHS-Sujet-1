I'm proud of you. :)\n\nI think you need to respect the fact that your depression is a real illness that you have been attempting to treat yourself with alcohol. Think of it as though you've been walking around with a broken foot for years without anything for the pain except what you can find. \n\nDon't worry about whether or not enough has happened to you to \"have anything to be depressed about\"; it doesn't work that way. Some people have an \"adjustment depression\" which is due to bad things happening to them, and others (like me) have depression with a biological cause and that will not stay away without medication and therapy. You won't know precisely what you need until you consult a professional whose job is to help people like you.\n\nHappier times are ahead. Good luck. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p9qqjj/im_going_on_day_7_of_not_drinking_and_im_really/ha2yn6l/"}
