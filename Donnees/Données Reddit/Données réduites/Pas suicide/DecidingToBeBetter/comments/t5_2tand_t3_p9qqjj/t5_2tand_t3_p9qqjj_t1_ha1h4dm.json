I think you\u2019re doing incredible work. It\u2019s normal for anxiety and depression to ramp up when you take away the alcohol you\u2019ve been using to temporarily mask those symptoms. \n\nI make this suggestion constantly:  try out different brands of sparkling waters as alcohol replacements. My 2 favorites are Polar and Spindrift. They have intense flavors, not fake and watery like some other brands. Cold, crisp sparkling water hit like a beer for me and definitely got me through my intense cravings. The cravings will subside though. I\u2019d say the first 3 weeks were the hardest for me. I didn\u2019t leave the house for the first 3 days because I knew I\u2019d find a reason to end up at the liquor store.\n\nI very rarely get cravings anymore, and when I do, they pass in an instant because I can play the tape forward and see what a burning dumpster fire my life will quickly become if I drink.\n\nLast tip, take a selfie every week to note how your face and body changes without alcohol in your system. It\u2019s seriously astounding!\n\nStick with it! You\u2019ve got this!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p9qqjj/im_going_on_day_7_of_not_drinking_and_im_really/ha1h4dm/"}
