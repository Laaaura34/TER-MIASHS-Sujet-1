The record for sobriety is 24 hours. It\u2019s cliche but it\u2019s true, one day at a time! Projecting into the future is what is causing anxiety. Just do the next right thing and stay in today. If you take care of today then tomorrow will take care of itself. All alcohol ever did for me was push off my problems and leave them worse the next day, it\u2019s helped me cope with my problems until it became the problem. Just for today you don\u2019t have to drink.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p9qqjj/im_going_on_day_7_of_not_drinking_and_im_really/ha0q7p3/"}
