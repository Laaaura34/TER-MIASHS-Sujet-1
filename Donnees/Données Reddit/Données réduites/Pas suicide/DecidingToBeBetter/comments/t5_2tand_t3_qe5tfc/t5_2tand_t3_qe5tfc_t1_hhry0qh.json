You used to live like a champ like you said, so you wanna come back to that lifestyle again and when you take a little step it doesnt satisfy you because you know what you are capable of. You used to run without getting tired how can you have fun and feel fulfilled just because you took couple of steps, right? But remember my friend, if we want to run again like that we have to know how much valuable are those steps. So, dont underestimate what you are doing good for you, if you go walking with your dog, it is good. if you make your bed after you wake up, it is good. if you try to get rid of your bad habits, THAT IS GOOD. You are doing great because you ara aware that you are not doing great. it is all about little steps.. if we believe it or not.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qe5tfc/make_time_not_excuses/hhry0qh/"}
