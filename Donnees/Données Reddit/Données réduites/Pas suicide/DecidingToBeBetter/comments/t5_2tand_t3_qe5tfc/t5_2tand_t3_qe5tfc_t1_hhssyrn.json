Turns out I didn\u2019t really like my job and it wasn\u2019t for me. Getting a new one with more time (and less stress) for me has helped so far greatly. I see now that I need to prioritize some other aspects of me and my life more moving forward.\nI\u2019m not saying you should do the same or you\u2019re  having the same problem. But I do recommend taking a lot of time to see what might be causing you to feel like you have no motivation. Iv been lucky and was forced to do this. \n\nI suggest baby steps. I started working out at home in my living room or any room that had space. I kick box, do Pilates, yoga, and random cardio hiit workouts (mostly all equipment free- or just a mat). It started with ones that I could find free online. Now I subscribe to a few fitness programs I like for $10 a month. \n\nI started talking to other people online and then people irl I trust about how I feel. This has made me wonder, what if I had just sought help earlier from a therapist? It might have saved me a lot of time and headaches. \n \nYou seem like you are on the right path. Remember to take time to rest and process it all though. It can be a lot.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qe5tfc/make_time_not_excuses/hhssyrn/"}
