You have no idea how serious second and third hand smoke is and how it really impacts everyone around you. The smoke lingers on clothes and your body for such a long time, and is just so difficult to escape \u2014 even when people aren\u2019t smoking in a home/confined area, etc. \n\nMy father quit ~5 years ago at 60 years old (yay!) and my 63 y/o mom still smokes, but hides it and \u201cnever finishes a cigarette.\u201d Both of their coughs are so painful to listen to, and they both lost a majority of their teeth due to periodontal disease (they have partials/dentures where they\u2019ve lost teeth). For two good looking people it has also definitely had an effect on the their skin. Aside from smoking cigarettes, my parents are healthy, middle class people who have always had health insurance and do not drink alcohol. No other underlying health issues\u2014not even seasonal allergies. \n\nThe toll cigarettes have taken on their lives is really unbelievable, and I truly commend you for making this difficult, yet amazing, decision for your daughter.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n9yl6v/first_week_of_quitting_smoking/gxs1vz7/"}
