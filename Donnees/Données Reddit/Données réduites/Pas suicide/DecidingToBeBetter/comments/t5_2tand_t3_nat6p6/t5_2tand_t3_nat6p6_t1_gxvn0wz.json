I\u2019d recommend Push-ups, pull-ups (or Australian), bench dips, sit ups, Supermans, and squats. Do 10 of each for 3-5 rounds. Go as quickly as you can and add rounds when you feel able to. 3-4 times a week.\n\nAfter that you\u2019ll be primed to start a lifting program. If your goal is to get stronger then your best bet is a barbell focused strength routine. I recommend either Starting Strength or stronglifts 5x5. They\u2019re extremely simple, only 3 exercises per workout with optional accessories. 3 days per week. Add in incline walking for cardio. I did this for 3.5 months and my squat went from 150 to 315 and benchpress went from 145 to 260.\n\nDo that for 3-6 months until you hit a plateau then you will have your base strength developed and be ready for more specific programming. After that your options are limitless and depend on your goals. 5/3/1, juggernaut method, CrossFit, whatever you want you\u2019ll be strong enough to get something out of whatever program.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nat6p6/28_yo_male_looking_to_get_back_into_shape_asap/gxvn0wz/"}
