Life is short and it really is a gift. Money is important but its not the be all and end all, as you well know. We need to find joy in the simple things and learn to live with ourselves (and make peace with the people we are in our own heads). At 28 years old you are still young and can take your life in literally any direction you want right now. Stop being so hard on yourself. Go invest in some self care. New threads, haircut, work out a few times a week, improve diet, start conversations with strangers, read more, reduce social media and Netflix, reduce dopamine inducing bad habits in general, procrastinate less, hydrate, get more sunlight etc. I'm not some guru BTW, I'm just another internet stranger who definitely needs to follow his own advice.
