That takes a lot of time and effort to gain knowledge to do what you did. \n\nThe way you're thinking, personally, I'd say is missed up. Sure you sacrificed things in pursuit of that 1 goal. Now you're well off. Do you know how many people wish/dream of being well off? So pat yourself on the back, first and foremost. \n\nNow those questions you're asking, keep asking them. Jordan Peterson mentioned that the uncomfortable self reflection questions one asks themself is to find the answer of what to do next. \n\nSay you're afraid to communicate to women, or large groups of people. Reflect why then ponder if you weren't afraid to engage with others. That fear is a sign that you could put your attention in socializing for the purposes you determine to motivate you to go out. You don't have to \"party, \" you can join groups that share hobbies or interests and you can put your attention to socializing and improving/learning a new skill. \n\nThis long winded post is to tell you you are fine. The fear is normal because you are aware of what you don't have. No matter. Take the steps, similar to the ones you took that helped you make money, but apply it to whatever you want to now. Thank God there's nothing forceably pulling you in any direction. So take advantage of that and learn to have fun with the discomfort. We all grow and learn more when we do. \n\nAll the best brother, and God speed \ud83d\udcaa\ud83e\udd34\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf93", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ogrnth/well_i_worked_yoked_like_a_beast_of_burden_for_5/h4mdetm/"}
