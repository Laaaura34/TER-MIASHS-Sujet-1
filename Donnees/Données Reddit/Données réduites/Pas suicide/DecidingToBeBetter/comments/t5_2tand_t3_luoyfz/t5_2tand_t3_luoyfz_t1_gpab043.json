I have been cig-free for about 50 days now and I have never felt better in the last five years. One of the biggest motivations for quitting was a well-known post of a Redditor who was diagnosed with a terminal illness partly due to smoking. I don't remember the details, but it kicked the ball into play for me.\n\nSadly, where I live, it is still legal to advertise tobacco products. I really wish it would be straight banned, as in other countries. Nobody needs a cigarette for \"being unique\" or \"doing her/his thing\" (some common advertisement slogans here).
