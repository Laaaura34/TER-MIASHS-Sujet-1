It's not easy. \n\nI just bought my second pack of the year. I had quit... five years ago, I think. May 24th, but I forget the year. \n\nI'm only chiming in to say you might stumble, and that's okay. You'll get right back on track. I'll end up giving this pack to a coworker in a day or two. I won't buy another, at least not for the foreseeable future. I just gave in during a rough patch. \n\nIt gets easier. But even if you cave, you'll get back on track.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/luoyfz/1_year_since_i_quit_smoking_dont_have_anyone_to/gp8w5iu/"}
