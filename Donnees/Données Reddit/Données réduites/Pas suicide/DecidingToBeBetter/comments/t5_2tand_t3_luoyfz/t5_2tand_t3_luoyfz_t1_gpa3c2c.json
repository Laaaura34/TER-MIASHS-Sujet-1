Be proud of your achievement becuase it's a big deal.\n\n I am in the same boat as you, trying to quit cigarettes and after this the weed. Tried it several times, just small breaks. I reduced the number of cigarettes per day but still there is to be worked on. \n\nWeed is still special but I know that one day I will get over it also and turn back into an ocasional smoker. \n\nGood luck!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/luoyfz/1_year_since_i_quit_smoking_dont_have_anyone_to/gpa3c2c/"}
