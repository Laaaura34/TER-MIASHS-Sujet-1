I urge you to go get blood work done\n\nWhen I was 16, I was constantly tired for literal months. I had the same thing you did. Constant fatigue, missing the satisfaction of a good night's sleep. I was very active as well, and no matter how much sleep I got I still wanted more. I got some blood work and turns out I had Epstein-Barr virus, which makes you very sleepy and explains the months of fatigue. When I got the bloodwork done I was also in a competitive swimming season and was low in sodium and chloride which explains why my fatigue suddenly got worse after I had started my swimming season \n\n1 year later at 17 I was tired again, but I wasn't swimming, the virus should have gone away by this point, and I was still very active. Turns out I had an autoimmune disease which chronically tires you out. Even when my autoimmune disease isn't active, I still feel some of the fatigue effects\n\nThis story isn't to scare you but to show that it could be so many things. I encourage you to tell your doctor", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qcrrvc/i_always_feel_tired_no_matter_what/hhkehpd/"}
