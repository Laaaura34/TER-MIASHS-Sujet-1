I had the same feelings as you, always tired and fatigued no matter how much I slept. The one thing that has made a huge difference for me is what I eat, and when I eat. \n\nI\u2019m basically doing intermittent fasting. Eating for only 8 hours a day, fasting the other 16. I don\u2019t eat within 4 hours of bedtime. I also take healthy supplements to make sure I\u2019m getting as much organic nutrients as I can. \n\nI\u2019ve been doing this for about 3 weeks now. I go to bed at around 10:30 pm and I wake up at 4:45 am. I have energy to last me all day, even with that amount of sleep. Also I don\u2019t exercise at all right now. So it\u2019s definitely been my fasting that has helped. Hope this helps you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qcrrvc/i_always_feel_tired_no_matter_what/hhij4tj/"}
