Check out research on chronotypes, there's a decent Vox video on it for an overview. 5:20am is well before even the average \"early\" chronotype. You're also young which means your natural rhythm is going to be shifted later anyways, probably until you're 22-23ish. \n\nBasically you're probably waking up well before your cortisol spikes, which is the hormone that helps with alertness/feeling awake. Even if you've had enough sleep, it's not there to help you \\~feel\\~ like you've had enough sleep. It's good to check with a doctor if you're perpetually tired, but if nothing's found, this could be the issue. \n\nHaving been there, I'd really recommend working second shift if you can swing it (3pm-11pm). I did that for several years around your age and it really helped my mental health. It does make some social stuff difficult but on the whole it was a much better experience.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qcrrvc/i_always_feel_tired_no_matter_what/hhj922l/"}
