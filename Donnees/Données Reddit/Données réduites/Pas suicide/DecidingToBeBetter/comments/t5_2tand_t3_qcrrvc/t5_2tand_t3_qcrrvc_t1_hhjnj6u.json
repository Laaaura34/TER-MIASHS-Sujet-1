It's a combination of issues for me - I have a hormone disorder, mild sleep apnea, and vitamin deficiencies. \n\nMy body doesn't make enough melatonin. It's very difficult for me to absorb nutrients so I have to take big supplements (under doctor's guidance) of Vitamin D, electrolytes and iron. Even just these changes made an enormous difference to my fatigue. \n\nIt's not normal to be sleepy all the time. See a doctor and keep going until you find one that will listen to you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qcrrvc/i_always_feel_tired_no_matter_what/hhjnj6u/"}
