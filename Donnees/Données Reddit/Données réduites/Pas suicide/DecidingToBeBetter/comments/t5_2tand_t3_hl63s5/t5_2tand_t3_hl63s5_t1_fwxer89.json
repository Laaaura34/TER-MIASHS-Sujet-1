Fanfiction can range from \u201cdeleted scenes\u201d (like scenes that could have happened in the source material), to future fics (what happens after the source material ends?), to fix-it fics (maybe the fanfic writer doesn\u2019t like something that happened in the source material and wants to write their own version), to alternate universe (AU) fics (imagining the characters in a different setting or trope). \n\nOne example would be Fifty Shades of Grey being Twilight fanfiction (EL James initially wrote Fifty Shades about Bella and Edward, but changed the names and the setting and published it). There are also many fanfics on websites such as archive of our own and fanfiction.net for any fandom you can think of.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hl63s5/i_rediscovered_my_passion_for_writing_in_the_most/fwxer89/"}
