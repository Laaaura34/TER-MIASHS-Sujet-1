That is so amazing! The fact that your life took off like that in a matter of years is just amazing! You should be so proud of yourself for how far you\u2019ve come! I know it may be harder to see when you\u2019re so close to the transformation, but you have really worked hard to change, and it can be seen, even by briefly writing your story to people on the internet. Improving your character and recognizing the hole you found yourself in is such a feat on its own.\n\nBest of luck, and I hope this passion of yours takes you to even higher places!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mek9nt/i_was_a_full_blown_consipiritard_for_about_10/gsjpobf/"}
