This little rock, floating in space and we grew out of it. I wonder how many other races there are in the Universe, are they friendly? Will I have in my life time meet aliens. How will they be like?\n\nOr just simply the fact the universe is so big, and we are just there... it amazes me each day when I think about it.\n\nThe only other thing that invokes this emotion of respect and be wonderment is when I listen to 'epic music'.\n\nSpace is nature, on a bigger scale(IMO), I'd even go so far universe/space has a certain type of 'life' to it.\n\n\np.s If you want something very soothing and calming in bed, I highly recommend Allan Watt's lectures.
