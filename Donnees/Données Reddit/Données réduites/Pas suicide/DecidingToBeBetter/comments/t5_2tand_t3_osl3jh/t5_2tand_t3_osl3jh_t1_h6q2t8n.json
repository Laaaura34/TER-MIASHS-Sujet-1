I've also been getting back into reading over the last few years, so I identify with the struggle. \n\nOf the ones you listed, I would say **Atomic Habits**. It's one of the best, most actionable books on habit change in the last few years. I started reading **Everything is F\\*cked** and it wasn't resonating with me, so I put it down. I started **Start with Why** a few years ago, but I kinda got the punchline about 30-40 pages in and put it down. (That's okay, and even recommended - once you get the book's message, you can put it down, or jump to specific tactics you're interested in). I haven't read any of the others you listed, so I can't comment on them.\n\nI would also look into Ryan Holiday's **The Obstacle is the Way** and **Ego is the Enemy**. Both fantastic books, and a great primer for Stoic philosophy before diving into the original texts from Aurelius, Epictetus, Seneca, etc. They're also relatively short books, so they shouldn't feel like too much of a burden/slog.\n\nHappy reading!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/osl3jh/after_struggling_and_giving_up_for_2_years_or_so/h6q2t8n/"}
