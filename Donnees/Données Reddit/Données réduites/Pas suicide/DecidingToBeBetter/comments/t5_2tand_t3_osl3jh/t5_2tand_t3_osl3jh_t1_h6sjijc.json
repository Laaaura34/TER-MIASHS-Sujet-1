If I had to describe the book in one or two sentences, it would be that this book is a slap to your face as in on majority of the stuff you believe in. You don't know crap and that's what the book educates you about. Finding the things that are actually important and weeding out the rest. \n\nI think you should definitely give it a read! It's only like 150 pages I think. So by reading 10 pages a day you can easily finish the book in 2-3 weeks or so! : )", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/osl3jh/after_struggling_and_giving_up_for_2_years_or_so/h6sjijc/"}
