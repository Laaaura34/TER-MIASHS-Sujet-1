Yes trying to form this habit has been hard but slowly but surely, I'm getting to it. I'll definitely choose to read Atomic Habits next as it's what the people voted for the most! Also I only mentioned these books as I have physical copies of them except Atomic Habits. I read 30% of the book on my phone. I have plenty of other books, from books by Ryan Holiday to Susan Cain who wrote The Power of Introverts to 7 Habits of Highly Effective people to Can't Hurt Me to Man's Search for Meaning, etc. I have all of these as ebooks. I wanted to avoid using my phone as much as possible that's why I laid out those selection of books. I even have a couple of fiction books namely, parts 1 and 2 of The Maze Runner (I loved the movie so I got the books). Looking forward to expanding my knowledge!! \n\n\nBut again thank you! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/osl3jh/after_struggling_and_giving_up_for_2_years_or_so/h6qd9rg/"}
