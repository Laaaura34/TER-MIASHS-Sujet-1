Things he says are taken wildly out of context and some of the positions he holds on things happen to be beneficial to alt right arguments. He just doesn\u2019t mind saying things that are controversial. Really it\u2019s his \u2018high iq\u2019 fans shouting \u2018liberals suffer from the dunning Kruger effect\u2019 or using so many unnecessary long words that what they say makes no sense (he also makes a lot of unnecessary word choices) or even using what he says in racist or sexist arguments. It\u2019s some of the people he attracts that suck, not him himself. \n\nHim saying multicultural societies aren\u2019t beneficial for example can be used easily in racist arguments, but really he is just saying he believes it always leads to tension and uncooperativeness. Although I don\u2019t agree with him on this and a lot of other political and philosophical stuff, he is a very good motivational speaker and psychologist.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cvw2t2/im_soft/ey7wdoy/"}
