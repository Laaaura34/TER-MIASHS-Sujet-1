Here's why:\n\nI grew up being vehemently against Beyonc\u00e9. It was trendy at the time and I never grew out of it. I thought she was overrated, but I had never even listened to her music outside of whatever played on the radio. But this is how I was with EVERYTHING. Movies, music, even current events. I didn't like anything new and the only reason was because it was new.  I had my opinion and I was unmovable. \n\nThen my sister asked if I would watch Homecoming with her, and I did because she had been asking me for awhile. Well guess what? That show made a fan out of me. I immediately watched Lemonade following that and realized that the woman is an artist, and it was hypocritical of me to dislike her for all these years when I never even gave her music a chance. \n\nSince then I've tried to open myself up to new opinions, and I try not to write off something or someone \"just because\". It was an eye opener at how \"Too cool\" I thought I was and it humbled me. This might not be the exact same situation, but I think it is fitting. I hope you get a chance to open your mind up and eventually you'll be \"Cool enough for school\".\n\nTLDR: watch Beyonc\u00e9's Homecoming for a slice of humble pie hahahahaha", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mwtgin/i_want_to_stop_being_to_cool_for_school/gvklfdv/"}
