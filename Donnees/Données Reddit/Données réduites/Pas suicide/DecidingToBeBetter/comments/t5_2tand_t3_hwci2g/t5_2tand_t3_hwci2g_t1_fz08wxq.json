Minimising tension and feeling more at ease? There are books on this from a spiritual perspective, from a pragmatic  \u201cthree steps to inner peace\u201d perspective, from a storytelling POV (i.e. fiction books about neurotic people becoming centered), etc. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to be difficult or more complicated than this have to be. I only mean to suggest that shifting perspectives is one of the keys here.:)\n\nP.S., spontaneity and self-acceptance are amongst the easiest achievements for children, and the most difficult for self-questioning and self-improving adults, especially those who are or have been neurotic.
