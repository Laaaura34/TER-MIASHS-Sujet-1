Perhaps think about allowing a day between doing any one muscle group with strength training. So, if you do a push-up one day, wait a day (48 hours) before you do it again. That should help the muscle to recover, rebuild stronger, before you hit it again.  \n\nAnd, of course, make sure that you were doing an equal amount of effort in the opposing opposite group. For a push-up, that would be any type of horizontal row, like a seated row or bent over row.  For a pull up, that would be a shoulder press.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hwci2g/i_realised_my_body_is_always_stiff_and_tense_i_am/fyz403z/"}
