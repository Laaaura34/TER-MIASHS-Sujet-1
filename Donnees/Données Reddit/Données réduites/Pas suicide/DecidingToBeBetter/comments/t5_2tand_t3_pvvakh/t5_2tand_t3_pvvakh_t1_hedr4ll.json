Every so often I drop the time down. I started with a gracious period of like 2hrs for each social media app and now I'm down to about an hour in total. Some days it is higher due to it also being how I do my side hobbies/gig. But once im out of time on my phone I have to do it via my computer and that's not as convenient or comfortable.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvvakh/i_overcome_my_dopamine_addiction_everything_is/hedr4ll/"}
