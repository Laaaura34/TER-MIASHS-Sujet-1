What you're essentially doing is like meditation. You recalibrate your brain to a baseline level of stimulation which is lower overall. Basically, your reward center decides when to release dopamine by the things that are biologically \"good\" such as good and sex, and also from environmental training, like social media, porn, tv, praise and validation. You can deprive yourself of these things in order to resensitize your reward center to them, and so you'll get dopamine from otherwise mundane activities.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvvakh/i_overcome_my_dopamine_addiction_everything_is/hefty5n/"}
