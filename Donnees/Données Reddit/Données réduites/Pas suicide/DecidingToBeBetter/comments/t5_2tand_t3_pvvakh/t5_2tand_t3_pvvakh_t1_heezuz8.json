I didn't realize there were things that overlap/cause similar problems between that and adhd. Honestly at this point I just want to feel like I can move forward. My inability to commit attention an inability to focus, and a constant need for \"highs\" through porn, media, social media, etc has me locked in place.

Hopefully I can get an accurate diagnosis of, whatever is up with me and begin moving forward.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvvakh/i_overcome_my_dopamine_addiction_everything_is/heezuz8/"}
