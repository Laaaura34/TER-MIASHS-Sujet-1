Some harder, some softer. Some stay for years, while others easily pick themselves up.\n\nBut it ain't a race. \n\nIt's a beautiful adventure that can turn into a shitshow at any given moment.\n\nThe best we *can* do is to **keep pushing.**\n\nI appreciate you exist. And thank you for your kind words.\n\nMake yourself an awesome person, who more people can thank.\n\nDon't ever hesitate to reach out. For whatever it is.\n\nKeep on keeping on!
