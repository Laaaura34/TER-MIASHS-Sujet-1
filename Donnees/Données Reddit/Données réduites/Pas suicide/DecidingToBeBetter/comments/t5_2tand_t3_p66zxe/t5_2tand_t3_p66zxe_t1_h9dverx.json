I\u2019m 21 and in the UK and I feel very empathetic of your situation. I\u2019ve struggled with anxiety and depression my whole life, I left uni 6 months in because of somewhat of a mental breakdown. You\u2019ve got a lot of good advice and stories here, so I won\u2019t bore you with my experience but if you\u2019d like to message me privately I\u2019m always happy to chat, or perhaps even see if we\u2019re anywhere near each other to meet up for a coffee or something- my treat :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p66zxe/im_20yo_m_and_i_feel_like_i_need_help_just_to/h9dverx/"}
