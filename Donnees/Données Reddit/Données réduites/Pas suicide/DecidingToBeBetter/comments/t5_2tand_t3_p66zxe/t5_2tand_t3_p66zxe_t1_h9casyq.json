Absolutely, labels can be useful too.\n\nThere's then a million questions I'd ask you if we were in person. This stuff is complicated ...\n\nAre you taking medications? Are they helping? \n\nAre you abusing drugs or alcohol?\n\nIs *therapy* an option? (Not just taking drugs but trying to work through some of your past trauma)\n\nHave you ever had a close relationship (friendship, romantic partner, family member) that was healthy? Sounds like you are massively lacking role models for how to build relationships.\n\nDo you or did you ever have any hobbies or anything that brought you joy? How can we reconnect you to that joy?\n\nMental health care is tough. When someone comes to you talking about suicide, the right thing to do is to make top priority to keep them alive. Recovery goes in steps: first make life liveable, then make life enjoyable.\n\nI know you can find peace.
