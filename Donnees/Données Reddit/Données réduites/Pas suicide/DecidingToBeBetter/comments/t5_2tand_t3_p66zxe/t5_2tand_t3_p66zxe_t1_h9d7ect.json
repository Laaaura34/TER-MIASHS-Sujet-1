You are not your diagnosis. I read \u201ci am not in control\u201d essentially, many times throughout this. You\u2019re right. You\u2019re not because you keep telling yourself you are not. You are in control of you and nobody else. Basic CBT. We have a thought, those thoughts create emotions our emotions influence behavior, behavior influences thoughts and we start over. For example:\n\nI need to put on those socks. I can\u2019t do that. I\u2019ve been laying here for days. I\u2019m broken and can\u2019t be fixed. All those diagnosis prove it. If I get up and put on my socks I\u2019ll probably just lay right back down. It will be so unpleasant. There\u2019s no point\u2026.Now you feel hopeless, ashamed, discouraged. Now you stay in bed. \n\nLet\u2019s reframe. Note, reframing is not just contradicting yourself. \n\nI can get up. I have the physical ability. Just because I have those diagnoses does not mean I physically cannot get up and put on my socks. Maybe if I just focus on putting my feet on the floor and standing up, then I\u2019ll feel more motivated to walk over to my socks. It might be super unpleasant at first but i\u2019ll feel pretty proud and astonished if I actually put my socks on\u2026.now you may feel just neutral, maybe a tad less self loathing, a little less helpless\u2026you get up and put your socks on\u2026.now you think to yourself. Hey. I can do some things! And the positive cycle continues until you make it negative again. \n\nStop bullying yourself. Your no different than anyone else, you deserve respect and to be treated with decency. Your past neglect does not justify you neglecting yourself. Be better than those who abused you. You can do it. Your thoughts are just thoughts not facts. You can change the narrative that your brain is feeding you and take a different path.
