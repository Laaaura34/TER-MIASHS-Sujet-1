Sadly, some people aren't even aware of the issue, or don't understand/realize there is a problem. So you are already on the way to finding you! There are sooo many people that will casually touch your life, and they might not ever even know the impact they had on you. \n\nIt's easier said than done, but your head believes what you tell it to believe. So tomorrow when you wake up, don't even let the thought cross your mind. Think about how you want to see yourself. Like if you want to take a shower, cuz you need to. Instead of, ugh, I don't want to. Think about what an awesome shower it's going to be and imagine your skin drinking up the water it needs to feel better and you will be surprised, it will be the best shower ever!\n\nYour mind will always try to find a way for you to be right. But if all you think about is negative stuff, your mind will find evidence to prove that. And I will tell you, you will HAVE to fight the urge to think negative EVERY DAY, but eventually, you won't have to fight so hard. It is a constant work in progress.\n\nLmk how rejuvenated you feel after your shower!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p66zxe/im_20yo_m_and_i_feel_like_i_need_help_just_to/h9e88mg/"}
