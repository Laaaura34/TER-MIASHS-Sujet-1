I\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re going through all this shit. You\u2019ve got a lot of strangers on the internet rooting for you!\n\nTldr: a wonderful Stanford neuroscientist\u2019s one-page description of using sunlight to decrease stress and improve mental and physical health: [here](https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2020/06/03/setting-your-biological-clock-reducing-stress-while-sheltering-in-place/). There\u2019s a 7min video on that page, I highly recommend watching all the way through. Stay strong!\n\n.  .\n\n.  .\n\n\nLong version:\nHave you heard of the professor and neuroscientist [Andrew Huberman](https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab/?hl=en)? He publishes a lot of info on cost-free behaviors people can use to improve physical and mental well-being. (He\u2019s not a clinician, but has posted interviews with some on his Instagram and YouTube page, and publishes great neuroscience data in multiple journals) I\u2019d recommend trying to look into his work.\n\nHis biggest recommendations are: \n1. Get more **sunlight** to your eyes immediately in the morning than artificial light (ie be outside, without sunglasses, for at least 2-10min right after you wake up. Regardless of cloud coverage, and don\u2019t have windows or glasses blocking the sky\u2019s connection to your eyes. This behavior apparently has profoundly positive effects on your body\u2019s regulation of cortisol and melatonin, among other good results. Don\u2019t look directly at the sun; look towards the sky, and blink accordingly.\n2. Get **self-generated optic flow** at least once a day (ie move in a way that your body is creating: walking, running, biking. The idea is to have peripheral objects \u201cflow\u201d by your eyes, which apparently stimulates neural circuits that quiet your threat detection and fear, thus calming a person who is distracted, affected by trauma, or other things. The science behind this is where EMDR therapy originates, when patients move eyes back and forth and \u201cwork through\u201d trauma with a therapist). \n3. Get **panoramic vision** at least once a day, and if only once then ideally in the evening near sunset (ie unfocus your eyes from whatever\u2019s right in front of you\u2014like a computer, phone, or book\u2014and try to see a horizon). This can be accomplished at a beach, the top of a tall building, or even just a field. Similar effects to the previous two of helping to regulate hormones, neuromodulators and neurotransmitters, and bringing a sense of calmness, clarity, and control. \n\nThese are all peer-reviewed protocols with results in many mammals, including humans. \n\nI know it\u2019s impossible to do these every day, and can be hard to even do them at all, but trying to average out 4-7x/week can show amazing results in people who previously reported senses of terrible mental-unwellness. \n\nKeep strong man!
