The fact that you posted this is already telling me that you are desperately trying to end all the hardships that\u2019s causing you pain. And I know you feel like nobody really understands you and you feel like everything is coming to an end, but it\u2019s this type of pain that\u2019s only going to propel you forward. In my life, I went through my toughest battles alone while everyone thought I was okay and that\u2019s why I\u2019m strong. I believe that you are strong too and I\u2019m going to be honest here, people in this world don\u2019t really care about you like that. You\u2019re friends are going to be preoccupied while you\u2019re burning and won\u2019t be able to help you. Your doctors will only serve you based on their paychecks. So it\u2019s all up to you on what you decide to do with your life. Begin your physical and mental transformation and start slowly. The only reason why you believe you\u2019re stuck is because you\u2019re own mind conditioned you to think this way. You have to unlearn your own negative thinking and start telling yourself that you got what it takes and start small. Start by taking a shower, then eat a meal, then get a good night sleep\u2026etc. When you pick yourself up, start going to the gym, write more, read more, eat healthy. It\u2019s all on you. You got no one but yourself to do this and I believe you can do it. You just gotta believe in yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p66zxe/im_20yo_m_and_i_feel_like_i_need_help_just_to/h9cm5xd/"}
