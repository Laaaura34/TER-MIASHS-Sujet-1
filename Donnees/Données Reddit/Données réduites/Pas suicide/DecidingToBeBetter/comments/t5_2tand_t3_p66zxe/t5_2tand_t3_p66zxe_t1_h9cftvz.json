I do things I'm forced to, like go to work. But I'm miserable. I don't clean or do chores, etc. I'm not lazy, because I work 60 hours a week, and if I was just lazy, I imagine I would find it easy to do \"fun\" stuff like playing games or whatever, but I never seem to be able to get around to doing the fun stuff either. I just sit here. If it's an off day and I need to go to the store, it takes me hours to get dressed and leave and my whole day is gone. The best way I can explain it is every day tasks whether it's chores or practicing guitar or playing a game, is like quitting an addiction like smoking. It feels just as hard. Except when you quit smoking it eventually gets easier. Sorry this post isn't helpful, but I wanted to rant a little too and say I understand where you are coming from at least.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p66zxe/im_20yo_m_and_i_feel_like_i_need_help_just_to/h9cftvz/"}
