Not a joke. If you eat enough you'll feel completely insane and disconnect from your body. Lost memories might come flowing in and you'll feel a whole new connection to life. You'll probably cry a lot but when it's over your brain feel as if it's been reset.\n\nI know many people where mushrooms helped heal where doctors couldn't do much.\n\nSmall example: my friend has bad OCD and would wash his hands bloody. He ate a large dose of mushrooms and was able to see life in a different light. His hand washing compulsion went away almost completely.\n\nIf you're at wits end, this I recommend", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p66zxe/im_20yo_m_and_i_feel_like_i_need_help_just_to/h9bpzt7/"}
