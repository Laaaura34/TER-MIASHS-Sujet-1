Sometimes I don't want to do anything ever again. Most days I'm exhausted from doing nothing. Surviving childhood was hard and lonely and I didn't think I would make it past 20. But I did, and now there's this BS trauma to deal with????\n\n\n\n\n\nMedication and therapy didn't fix my problems, but they helped me manage my problems overtime, with practice. My peers who followed the typical path of life are further ahead than I am, sure. They're married, graduated, own homes, some even have kids. Most of them have professional humanitarian careers. Lol I don't, but it's alright. I'd rather have peace in my mind and soul than a house. And I have other things to offer this world. *You do too.* \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI didnt have this mindset or sense of self worth a couple years ago, but here I am. This may seem permanent to you, but you have just slowed down after spending most of your life doing everything you can and being \"gifted.\" You're so tired right now. Everything is moving sooo slow that it feels like forever. That's okay. Rest now. Don't put socks on. Take care of your soul.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p66zxe/im_20yo_m_and_i_feel_like_i_need_help_just_to/h9drt1a/"}
