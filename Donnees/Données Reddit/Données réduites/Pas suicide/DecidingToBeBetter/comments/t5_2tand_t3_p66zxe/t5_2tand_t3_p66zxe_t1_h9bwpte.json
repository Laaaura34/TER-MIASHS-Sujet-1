Obviously someone with ADHD will get distracted more often, but that\u2019s ok. :) When you get distracted it\u2019s as simple as noticing you\u2019ve been distracted, and returning your focus to your breathing and relaxing your muscles. I really like to focus on every feel of the breath. The feel of the air moving through my nose, down my throat, into my lungs, the feel of my lungs expanding, my ribs moving, etc. Hyper focusing on it helps keep me there. \n\nI\u2019ve found that guided meditation works best for me as well, as it gives me something to focus on a bit, and having constant reminders pop in can be especially helpful for those with ADHD. The Mindfulness app is guided meditations typically, and I also love The Honest Guys on YouTube. I just pop on some headphones, get comfy, and listen to them guide me through. They\u2019re great. Got out of body with them once. It was awesome! :D", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p66zxe/im_20yo_m_and_i_feel_like_i_need_help_just_to/h9bwpte/"}
