It's so easy to hyperanalyze yourself and fall into negative recursive thoughts, eventually looking outward to little things you can do to be more present and help others becomes a huge challenge.\n\nBut it's not just a gift some are born with, it's also a skill you can cultivate. Of course you're going to be bad at things you don't have much practice with. Accepting that you're unpracticed instead of untalented at maintaining a positive attitude and self image is an important first step. \n\nMany people who are talented at a young age have things come naturally to them, so when things are difficult they (we) feel dumb/bad/etc. We have to look at challenging things as opportunities to learn and grow, not proof of our ineptitude or failure. \n\nIt's hard, it's hard as fuck. But being happy, despite being difficult, is a challenge that is worth it to accept. Start with doing ANYTHING that feels like a victory, do them as often as possible to build your confidence, and eventually you'll be able to attempt and overcome increasingly difficult obstacles.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p66zxe/im_20yo_m_and_i_feel_like_i_need_help_just_to/h9cc848/"}
