I don't know exactly how they psychs work in the Uk but in the USA they just give you pills and book an appt 4-6 weeks later.  A good therapist does a much better job but there aren't a ton of good therapists out there... and even then it's hard to find the right fit.\n\nResearching psycadelic therapy might be worth while to see if it's a fit.  Again, no clue what is going on in the UK but in the US currently ketamine clinics are available, you can apply for MDMA therapy which will actually become 100% a normalized treatment in the near future and we also have pscilocibin(the stuff in magic mushrooms) coming down the pipeline.  Additionally you can just do this stuff on your own though potentially with some legal risks.  There are also retreats you can go to where it's 100% legal and you would have a therapist/guide to help out.  Michael Pollan's How to Change Your Mind is a great book to read on it since he isn't some hippy but a straight-laced dude who researched the world of psycadelic therapy and even did stuff underground himself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe thing that helped me the most was psycadelics on my own(due to legal reasons) but finding a therapist who does 'integration' therapy.  If you go down that route [https://maps.org/](https://maps.org/) can help you find a integration therapist.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p66zxe/im_20yo_m_and_i_feel_like_i_need_help_just_to/h9jxhgg/"}
