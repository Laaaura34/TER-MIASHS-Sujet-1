Dude you're so young, the problem is not the \"entirety of your life\" because your life hasn't even HAPPENED yet. People are just starting their lives for the first time in their 20's, 30's, even 40's and 50's. \n\nI work with the Innocence Project and we work to release prisoners who were wrongfully convicted and usually 100% innocent and so often were mixed up with a different black guy. One guy was in jail from when he was 15 to 35. One guy was in jail from 30 - 50. These guys are starting over from scratch and they are SO EXCITED. You have a life, you have a gift. You are young and have everything in front of you. \n\nYou don't need to compete with ANYONE. What do you like? Can you work part time at a plant store/summer camp/soup kitchen? You need fulfillment and a lot of people get that fulfillment by helping others or being in an active environment. You need guidelines or you can't force yourself to do something. You can start by just giving 3 hours a week at a soup kitchen -- bond with the others who are there trying to make their neighborhood better. Become a person who's relied on so you can't just drop it when you're bored. \n\nYou can live your life just to meet people and do  good things and eat good food, you don't have to live your life just to accomplish a specific task.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p66zxe/im_20yo_m_and_i_feel_like_i_need_help_just_to/h9boq0y/"}
