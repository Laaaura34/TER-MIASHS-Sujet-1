Stay on your medication or get on some,\n\n2. Quit alcohol. I've found a cold sparkling water is a decent substitute for beer.\n\n3. Cut out sugar.\n\n4. Get yourself frozen veggies. Salt, pepper, olive oil and bake at 425 for 17 mins or until browned. Finish with cheese for a few minutes more in the oven until gooey. Bake protein (chicken, beef, etc) in the oven and make enough for a few days.\n\n5. Follow a video to do exercise: High Intensity Interval Training can be done with no equipment. Something like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpEuvXjxIew\n\n6. If you feel like binge eating eat good things. Binge eat veggies. Don't completely fight yourself. Redirect your self-destructive urges to positive things. Consciously.\n\n7. When mistakes are made it **doesn't change the plan one iota.** Just stick to the plan.\n\n8. Ignore the voice in your head that tells you this is all for naught. That you will fail. That you're worthless and always will be. That is **bullshit**. Do the opposite of what that voice says. \n\nI don't have everything figured out. I struggle with Executive Dysfunction, Depression and Anxiety. It's still hard. These are the things that help me.\n\nYou fight with demons that most people cannot even begin to comprehend.
