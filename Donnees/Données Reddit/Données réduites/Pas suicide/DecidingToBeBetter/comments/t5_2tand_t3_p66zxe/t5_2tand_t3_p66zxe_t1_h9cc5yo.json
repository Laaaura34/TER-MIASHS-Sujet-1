You\u2019re so young. If it makes you feel better, things may get better as you age through your 20\u2019s. I just turned 27 and my mental health issues were the worst from 17-22, and then slowly got better with each year that passed. Same thing with my younger brother - he was suicidal from 18-22 and now he\u2019s 25 and doing a lot better. I really do think age has something to do with it. Other than that, here are some things that helped me: \nLithium (mood stabilizer), quitting drinking and smoking weed, 12 step programs, therapy, meditation, exercise, journaling, and sunlight/being outside. If you could start with walking a bit each day, I really think that will help get your blood pumping and your mood chemicals stabilized. I wish you the best! I really do believe time will help it get better! You can do it", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p66zxe/im_20yo_m_and_i_feel_like_i_need_help_just_to/h9cc5yo/"}
