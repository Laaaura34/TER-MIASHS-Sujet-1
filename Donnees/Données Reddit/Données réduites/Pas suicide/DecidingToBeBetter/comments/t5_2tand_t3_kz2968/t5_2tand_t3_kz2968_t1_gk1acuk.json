I'm 19 and have around 10k in savings with my own apartment and car and I'm set to graduate college next year with a bachelor's in Applied Linguistics at the age of 20. Hell, I know I'm smart enough to get a Master's if I can get myself together. On paper, I've got it all together, but I am a shell of my former self. I've been coasting off of the \"gifted kid\" thing for so long I don't even know if I can genuinely try at anything. I hate school and I hate work, but what I hate more is confrontation, so I'll put up with them because it's easier than quitting. Every day I'm just sprinting for the finish line, the time when I can smoke a few bowls, mentally numb myself, and binge eat. I spend all my free time eating to excess, watching YouTube, and smoking weed. \n\nSo you're in a good place, have goals, and know your weaknesses.\nWhat advice would you give yourself?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kz2968/ive_hit_rock_bottom_mental_health_wise/gk1acuk/"}
