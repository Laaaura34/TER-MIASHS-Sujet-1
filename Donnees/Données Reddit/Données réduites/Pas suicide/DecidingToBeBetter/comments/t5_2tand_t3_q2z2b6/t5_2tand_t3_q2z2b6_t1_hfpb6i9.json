I express affection in acts of service, and this is ripe for abuse when you care about the wrong person.\n\nIt got to the point where I wasn't going to survive, and more, I didn't want to.\n\nSo I learned to say no. And I dug in and clung to it like the last TV at a Black Friday sale. I spent several years being verbally beaten into a bloody mess before they finally realised they wouldn't win anymore.\n\nBut no then became my everything. It was automatic. Because it worked, because it was safe, because no one could abuse me if I didn't give them the opening. And I slowly bricked myself into a box of no, where *no one* could find me.\n\nBut the world changed, and although I'm a long way from those who would hurt me, it took a long time to realise that no was not healthy for me.\n\nI am now learning to say yes again. To give, with care, and selectively, but wholeheartedly. To stop expecting giving to be met with abuse, and to let people in.\n\nI have entered the Era of Maybe.\n\nEdit: this got a lot bigger than I expected. Thank you for the awards. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2z2b6/what_perhaps_seemingly_small_bad_habit_of_yours/hfpb6i9/"}
