I'm pretty good with healthy eating, but I hate exercising. I do a good amount of physical activity (walking and cycling mostly) but haven't found a way to enjoy more intense workouts yet (muscle building and higher intensity cardio). It's good to look at it from the perspective of 20 years down the line though. I would definitely like to keep my mobility for as long as possible.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2z2b6/what_perhaps_seemingly_small_bad_habit_of_yours/hfrw7yl/"}
