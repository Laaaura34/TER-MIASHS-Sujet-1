Scared me to see what i could become if I just didn\u2019t make the choice to leave. Fun af tho. But oooof the money I could have saved if I hadn\u2019t had a similar phase to yours. Like you, I\u2019m okay with my choices cause it\u2019s over now and it wasn\u2019t long, but damn it definitely would have taken a serious toll if I kept at it.
