I have been hyper aware of my friend\u2019s (and mostly partners) very normal changes in mood, and I would always internalize it as a result of \u201cme\u201d. It was clearly a manifestation of me having low self-esteem, believing that I had to prove to someone over and over again that I was worthy of their time. If they were acting \u201coff\u201d, I\u2019d believe that if I couldn\u2019t fix it, I would be seen as disposable. I definitely just wanted to make the people I love feel good, but it put pressure on others to feel good so they could soothe my insecurities. It was also me trying to serve others so I could externalize my inability to please myself. Good on you for working through this habit of yours!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2z2b6/what_perhaps_seemingly_small_bad_habit_of_yours/hfrbudt/"}
