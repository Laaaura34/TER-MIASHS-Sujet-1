I was constantly in a cycle of procrastination, and lack of discipline. I always thought coffee was supposed to help with these (and at first it does) but over time it ends up having the **complete opposite effect**. \n\nIt really is a drug addiction, and it should be consumed more mindfully. Coffee is so widely consumed and when you join the daily coffee cult, you stop seeing the full scope of things and justify the behavior (_the fundamental nature of addiction_). So many people use caffeine as a crutch. Any psychoactive substance consumed daily has a major impact on the course of your life, and the kicker is that the positive effects many people claim from coffee are in reality an illusion.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2z2b6/what_perhaps_seemingly_small_bad_habit_of_yours/hfpy3rj/"}
