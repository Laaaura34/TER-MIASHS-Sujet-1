Complete game changer.\n\n\nTake time to listen to what people have to say, don't butt in with stories just to show them that you can relate to what they're saying, people want to be heard. And if somebody tells you something that you know isn't true, don't correct them. I'm a big music guy, and I was talking to a co-worker and mentioned that I love Janis Joplin. So he told me a story about how she died on stage in the middle of performing a song. This of course is absolutely not true, she was found dead in a hotel room on October 4th 1970. Correcting him might have seemed proper, it would have felt like I was bestowing my knowledge upon him, but instead it just would have made me sound like a \"know it all\". Nobody likes a person who acts like that, you gain nothing from doing it and you can alienate people or make them feel inferior.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2z2b6/what_perhaps_seemingly_small_bad_habit_of_yours/hfpr797/"}
