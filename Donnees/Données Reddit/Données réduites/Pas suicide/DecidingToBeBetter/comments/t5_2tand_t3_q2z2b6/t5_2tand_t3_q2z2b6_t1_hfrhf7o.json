It makes my nails weak and sometimes they bleed. But for the life of me, I can\u2019t stop this small awful habit. Maybe if I wore rings. Anyway it\u2019s small but it has caused me to be more tense when I do it. I also tense my jaw a lot. But the scratching is the most inconvenient since sometimes it\u2019s painful and makes it harder for me to do stuff.\n\nEdit: I know I need to replace it with another thing to fidget with but so far I haven\u2019t found anything. I was thinking knitting would be good, especially when I watch tv or I\u2019m thinking.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2z2b6/what_perhaps_seemingly_small_bad_habit_of_yours/hfrhf7o/"}
