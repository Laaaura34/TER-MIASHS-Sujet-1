It\u2019s important to have grace for yourself. We\u2019re all human and no one is perfect. I\u2019ve struggled a lot with shame and condemnation in the past, but it\u2019s important to remember no one is perfect and no one is going to expect you to be. You love people who are imperfect, right? People with plenty of flaws? If you can love them like that, no matter how dysfunctional they are, you need to recognize you should love yourself the same way.\n\nIt kinda comes from a performance mentality of \u201cto deserve this love, I need to do x,y, and z\u201d. This can come from lack of love or performance based love from parents or other strong relationships in our lives. Seeing a counselor or a therapist or finding a way to reconcile with yourself (for me, I found it through God) is important.\n\nIf you can love yourself and give yourself grace, it\u2019s a lot easier to forgive yourself for not always being positive. There are times when we slip up. I slip up on the gratitude part a lot, but I\u2019ve gotten better over time by giving myself grace instead of harsh criticism.\n\nI hope this helped!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2z2b6/what_perhaps_seemingly_small_bad_habit_of_yours/hftc5q5/"}
