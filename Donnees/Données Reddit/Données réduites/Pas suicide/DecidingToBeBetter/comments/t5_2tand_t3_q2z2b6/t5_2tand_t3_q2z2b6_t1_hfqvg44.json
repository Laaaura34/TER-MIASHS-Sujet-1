I'm curious how you came to realize that this wasn't working for you, and how you changed?  (I'm guessing other people in your life may have told you that you were being too hard on yourself, but that it took time to truly internalize?)\n\n*\\[backstory behind the question, if you can relate:\\]*  My boyfriend (a very wonderful human) has a similar attitude towards suffering (he jokes \"pain is weakness leaving the body!\") and puts himself through more difficult situations than needed (like, biking an hour commute in extreme weather when he's already late instead of taking his car, or eating old food that should be thrown out because he feels guilty that he didn't eat it earlier, etc.)\n\nI admire that he's so tough and stoic and how he makes the best of situations, but it sometimes looks from the outside like needless self-abuse, and part of a lifelong pattern of pretending his comfort and feelings don't matter.  (\"If I'm toughest/neglectful towards  myself, then other people can't hurt me that way.\"  Or something.  I'm a girlfriend, but not a therapist lol.)  I try to encourage him to be nicer towards himself - and I don't like it when he expects too much toughness from me - but I hope this is something he'll discover for himself one day.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2z2b6/what_perhaps_seemingly_small_bad_habit_of_yours/hfqvg44/"}
