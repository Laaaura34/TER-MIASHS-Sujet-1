They don\u2019t have to be working hard, in tandem, and nonstop, and yet they do. I possess the immense gift of every day having a body that, despite its flaws, is successful in letting me experience another miraculous day on this earth. That gratitude mindset for my little collection of hardworking cellular buddies has gotten me through immense loneliness and hardship. It has extended out to make me grateful for everything I get to experience, and for the sheer \u201choly fuck\u201d nature of the world we get to experience", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2z2b6/what_perhaps_seemingly_small_bad_habit_of_yours/hfskck2/"}
