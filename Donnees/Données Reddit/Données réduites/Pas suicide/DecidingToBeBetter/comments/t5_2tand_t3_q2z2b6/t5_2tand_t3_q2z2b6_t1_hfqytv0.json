I constantly felt an impending feeling of anxiety - like the world was about to end. I was so much sadder and more stressed, but I never understood where these feelings were coming from. I thought I must just have an anxiety disorder and/or depression. After quitting, these feelings have greatly subsided. Sure, I still get stressed and sad sometimes, but it\u2019s no where near what it used to be. Weaning off of it was tough though - I had really bad fatigue and mood swings during that period.
