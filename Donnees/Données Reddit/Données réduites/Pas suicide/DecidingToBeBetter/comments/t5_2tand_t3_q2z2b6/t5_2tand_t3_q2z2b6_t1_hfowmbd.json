Not only is it negative and brings other people down, it makes a complaining person more negative consistently. Not just when something bad happens, but you start to look for things to complain about. Then you\u2019re not grateful for small things on a day to day basis because you\u2019re so used to looking at the negative.\nFact is, there\u2019s a lot of negativity in the world and a lot of bad stuff. There\u2019s always SOMETHING to (justifiably) complain about. It\u2019s too easy to look at the negative. But what makes a person strong and happy is looking past the negative and forgiving it and finding a way to be grateful in the situation. Even if someone cuts me off in traffic, I make myself say I\u2019m grateful to be learning to practice patience.\nWords matter. They effect you and they effect everyone around you. It effects your neuroplasticty. If you\u2019re constantly complaining, you\u2019re always going to be negative and unhappy, but if you can overcome and learn to forgive and be grateful and speak words of life over yourself, every part of your day to day life will change. Not always everything immediately, but just enough day by day to motivate yourself to keep doing better.\nYou\u2019ll notice the difference.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2z2b6/what_perhaps_seemingly_small_bad_habit_of_yours/hfowmbd/"}
