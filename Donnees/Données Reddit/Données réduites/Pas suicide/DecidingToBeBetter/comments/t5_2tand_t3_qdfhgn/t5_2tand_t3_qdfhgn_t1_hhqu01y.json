Start there and see what you can come up with. I personally recently picked up macrame and have been making little pieces for around the house and contemplating selling some on Facebook so I can continue crafting. It is a hobby that can be as cheap or a expensive as you want depending on the size of the piece. My other hobbies are reading and doing yoga, and I just set daily goals for myself about how much time I want to do each of those things. In the beginning a hobby kind of feels like a chore until it just becomes part of your routine and you find peace in it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdfhgn/i_dont_have_any_useful_hobby_that_i_can_practice/hhqu01y/"}
