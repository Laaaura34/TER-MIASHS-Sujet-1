Music is so varied that once you get the basics down you can find music to learn that suits your mood or the mood you wanna be in . It\u2019s also a great stress relief too ( for me anyway ) . Plus if you want then you can make up your own music.\n\nNow is music a worthy hobby? I\u2019m not gonna touch that question, that\u2019s for smarter people then me to decide but I gotta say it works for me .\n\nAnyway my friend I hope you find what your looking for and regardless what anyone says your worthy and you will get where you need to be !!
