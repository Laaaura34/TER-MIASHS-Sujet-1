Your worth is not tied to your productivity at work or in your free time. Learning is a great way to enrich yourself and explore your world. Video games encourage problem solving, coordination, and strategy. Watching shows can be relaxing, thought provoking, and of course entertaining. If these things are things you enjoy, that's enough. Hobbies don't have to be things you enjoy that can also benefit other people.\n\nThat being said, if you're looking for something new to try, I recommend crochet. There are so many techniques to learn and explore, but it's also very easy to start making things just with the basic stitches. I find it relaxing and useful as well because I can make things like hats or scarves or blankets. Plus, you can watch shows while you crochet as long as you don't mind looking back and forth from the screen to your project!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdfhgn/i_dont_have_any_useful_hobby_that_i_can_practice/hhniy4b/"}
