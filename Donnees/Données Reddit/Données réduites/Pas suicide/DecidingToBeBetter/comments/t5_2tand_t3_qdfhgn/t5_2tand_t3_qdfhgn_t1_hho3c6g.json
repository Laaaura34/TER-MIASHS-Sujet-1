Just start drawing stuff, start creating, start building, etc. Focus on having fun with the -process-, not the end result. By this, I mean, if you decide to learn something like drawing, learn to have fun when you put your pencil to paper, don't just quit because your drawings aren't good. HINT: the first time you do most things, you'll probably suck at it. Being bad at something doesn't mean you can't have fun though! And being bad at something is the first step in being good at something.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdfhgn/i_dont_have_any_useful_hobby_that_i_can_practice/hho3c6g/"}
