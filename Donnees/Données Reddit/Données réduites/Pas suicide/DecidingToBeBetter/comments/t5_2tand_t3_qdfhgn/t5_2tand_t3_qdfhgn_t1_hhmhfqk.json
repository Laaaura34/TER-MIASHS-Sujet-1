It\u2019s just that having a hobby or interest where you\u2019re actually creating something physical that you can see for yourself can create a sense of accomplishment and progress. It\u2019s easier to feel proud of yourself and like you\u2019re being \u201cuseful\u201d if you can say, hey I made that or drew that or cooked that, etc. Not to mention something like cooking is just a useful skill to have in life. But it can be any number of things. If you like tinkering, you can try messing with circuit boards and building small machines, esp since they said they like fixing/building PCs and stuff.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdfhgn/i_dont_have_any_useful_hobby_that_i_can_practice/hhmhfqk/"}
