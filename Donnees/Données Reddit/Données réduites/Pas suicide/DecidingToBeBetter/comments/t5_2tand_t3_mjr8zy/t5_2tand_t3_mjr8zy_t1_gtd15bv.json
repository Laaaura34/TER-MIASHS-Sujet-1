No change that you make to your lifestyle is going to solve all of your problems, but each change that you make should make you feel a little bit better, or more productive, or more solidly grounded in your own self. And if you\u2019re having trouble finding the motivation to make any changes to make *yourself* feel better, maybe try thinking of your \u2018tomorrow self\u2019 as a different person that you\u2019re being kind to: \u201coh, it\u2019s 11:00,  I can\u2019t decide if I want to go to bed .... wait! Tomorrow- me will feel so much better if I do!\u201d\n\nAlso, for building habits like going on walks and exercising: have you tried doing something like *Zombies, Run !* or listening to an audiobook or podcast while you walk, or trying something like *Workout Adventure* (a DND workout podcast?).
