Get to /r/meditation and do not pass go! Or download the meditation app Headspace and try for free or pay the money (it\u2019s worth the money) but seriously, start with that, you need to learn to see the thoughts and let them go and not get caught up in them, meditation will do that. Start with 5 minutes, work up to 15 minutes a day. \n\nAlso I hope you would not be so critical of yourself and learn to talk more loving and kind to yourself like you would a friend! You have these repeating defeating tapes, that you can\u2019t do it, I would hope you would focus on changing that to \u201cI am stressing and capable\u201d or whatever is powerful for you! Put it on your mirror or where you\u2019ll see it everyday! \n\nYou\u2019re worth it :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mjr8zy/overthinking_is_ruining_my_life/gtcpwjn/"}
