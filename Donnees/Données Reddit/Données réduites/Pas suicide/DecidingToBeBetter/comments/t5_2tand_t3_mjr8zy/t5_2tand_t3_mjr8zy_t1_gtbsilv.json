Usually, it's something that happens right before my weekend, so I spend my two days off worrying about something that in the end doesn't really matter, instead of relaxing and getting away from work.\n\nI recently put on order a part for an extremely complicated phone repair that we usually tell people we don't do at all due to the complexity of it, and our senior tech (the only person who might be comfortable doing that job) will be on vacation when that part comes in, and I'm going on one as soon as he gets back. So can't help but think that somehow this will come around and bite me in the ass. And that's been living rent-free in my head for the past week.\n\nYour mileage may vary, but usually saying something about it to a coworker about the situation usually gives me reaffirmation that I made the right call, or that what I messed up won't be a big deal.\n\nI would say open up to someone you trust that understands the stuff you're overthinking.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mjr8zy/overthinking_is_ruining_my_life/gtbsilv/"}
