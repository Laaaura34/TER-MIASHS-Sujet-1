I went thru the same shit in college. Studied envi science, smoked kush, wanted to create good change in the world and nature, etc. i Felt bored and like i was wasting time. Looking back i wish i did more with my major and got involved in the science community more. I would suggest connecting with ur peers. Start advocating for what you believe in, its not lame. Opposite actually. Practice self discipline but dont force yourself to miss out on opportunities you know you\u2019d enjoy with friends.. unless its against what u believe in or too damaging.
