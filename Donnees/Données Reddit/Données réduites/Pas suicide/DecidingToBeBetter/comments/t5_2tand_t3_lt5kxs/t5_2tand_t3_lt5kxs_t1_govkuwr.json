One of my enduring takeaways is that we are wrecking ourselves by eliminating boredom/quiet from our lives.  Not only was this a silent retreat but no screens, no books, no pen and paper -- just you and your thoughts.  You could meditate (and I did a LOT of that), sleep, or sit in the garden, basically.  I can't remember being so bored for decades before.  I felt like a bored kid on a rainy Saturday afternoon again -- just sitting on a bench, staring at the garden, and trying not to think about meditating.  \n\nOnce I got REALLY bored again though, some amazing things started to happen.  My creativity sparked.  Old problems that I hadn't considered started to knit themselves together.  Old characters from long-ago stories gave me a fresh glimpse.  Connections were coming together without effort.  I just really came convinced that (a) being a bit bored was good for my brain; and (b) the way that I was using my smartphone wasn't letting me get bored.\n\nSo I bought a dead simple little Nokia 3310.  T9 texting sucks but I don't really mind otherwise.  I keep the smartphone for playing music mostly but can still just swap out sim cards and carry it if I thought that I needed other functions.\n\nAs an older redditor, I lived the bulk of my life without carrying a phone.  I remember how to live that way and it is not really a big deal for me.  For me, the solution works I think.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lt5kxs/getting_rid_of_my_smartphone/govkuwr/"}
