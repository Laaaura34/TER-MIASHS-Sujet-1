There is nothing wrong with getting rid of your smart phone... It's addicting as hell and I've heard some really cool success stories on getting rid of it. It was hard for them at times because like I said, it's an addiction and has become our second nature to go on our phones.. but they've become so much more creative and do alot of hobbies with their extra time. It's admirable for sure. I would get a simple phone in case of emergencies though!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lt5kxs/getting_rid_of_my_smartphone/goxou9r/"}
