You said that guys are just human beings, and you just have to really believe that- they\u2019re not going to hurt you or be high in their horse, *they\u2019re just people*. They are not constantly judging you, so try to be yourself around them and don\u2019t stress out- everyone is awkward sometimes, and that\u2019s ok. You don\u2019t have to be super popular all the time, either. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k8gaw4/how_to_comfortably_talk_to_boys/gexs86m/"}
