It\u2019s unfair but life isn\u2019t fair. Likely you just have to do nothing but be present and open to new experiences if he feels like talking to you. And this doesn\u2019t have to fall into potential dating, just conversations.\n\nI don\u2019t have this exact problem but I\u2019ve over done it through several methods, usually having a job opens you up because you have to talk to people you work with. I used work as a place to self develop all the time. Just talking about non personal things can help you develop socially. Eventually you should consider being a person who questions things and want to find out more. This will really open you up as it generally leads to more interesting conversations. So don\u2019t discount asking questions. Learn to ask interesting questions instead of boring questions that get a yes or no answer. \n\nEye contact is something most people are bad at and will continue to get worse the more people stay in their phones. So consider who you\u2019re spending your time with as well. Not everyone deserves your time because then you won\u2019t have time for yourself.\n\nI\u2019m not perfect, I\u2019m still socially awkward. It\u2019s still very painful but it\u2019s easier just being able to talk to strangers. Who I can share deep dark thoughts with is a different story. Sadly. \n\nBest of luck", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k8gaw4/how_to_comfortably_talk_to_boys/geynlp1/"}
