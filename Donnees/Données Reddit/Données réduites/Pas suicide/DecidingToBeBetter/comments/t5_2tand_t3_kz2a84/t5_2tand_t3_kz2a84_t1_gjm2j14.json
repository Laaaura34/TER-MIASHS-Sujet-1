You weren't worried about it all week, you were busy LIVING. It does take practice, practice accepting to yourself, learning to treat yourself like you do others, learning to enjoy the mundane. I started having thoughts in 1994. I started doing the hard work about 7 years ago and have made a lot of progress. I still have moments. I try my best to learn something from each one before letting it go on its way.\n\nThe way I see it, it's all extra credit from here on out baby.
