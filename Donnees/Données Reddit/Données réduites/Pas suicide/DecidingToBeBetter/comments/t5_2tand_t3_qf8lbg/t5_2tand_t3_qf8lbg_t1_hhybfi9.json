It was a college paper, sort of like a mini-thesis. It was meant to take all semester. I did it in 3 sleepless, adrenaline filled days. 3 of the worst days of my life. I was still getting the paper bound during the 3 hour hand in window. I slipped the office depot guy an extra $20 to put mine at the front of the queue. So many things could have gone wrong and missed that deadline, and I wouldn't have graduated, and wouldn't be where I am today. \n\nI shudder, and feel so disgusted when I think about those awful decisions. I'm no-where near perfect, but I've come a long way. That project was a massive wake-up call for me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qf8lbg/i_finished_a_project_that_was_supposed_to_take_a/hhybfi9/"}
