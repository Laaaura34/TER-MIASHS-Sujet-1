I understand how hard it is to get work done with depression, especially when you\u2019re caught in the cycle of falling behind. I was in the same situation on Friday and spent 16 hours doing work that day from 4 AM to 8 - 10 PM. \n\nOne thing to remember when putting off things is that on the days you DID do work, it wasn\u2019t a \u201cgood\u201d day. You probably didn\u2019t feel any different. You probably were still struggling: but what you did was hunker down and get it finished. \n\nPutting it off for later is not going to make it easier. You will NEVER feel like doing it. So if you get it done immediately, you won\u2019t have to worry about having a \u201cgood\u201d day to finish it. \n\nBut let me just say that it is super hard and I feel you, I don\u2019t blame you for falling behind and we\u2019re in this together.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qf8lbg/i_finished_a_project_that_was_supposed_to_take_a/hi0626x/"}
