I think i focused to much on the fake part of the post and not smiling im no psycologist or anything but i would give the advise just not to do things you dont want to do that was essentially what my previous comment was about i didnt like bullshit so i removed myself from situations where i would hear it or be apart. \n\nIn your situation i think not smiling is fine you dont have to smile all the time to be positive or receptive to others i dont think you need to get good at smiling as you said you smile when its genuine why enforce something thats not natural to you dude. The offhand comment about your smile im not sure how to change that apart from surrounding yourself with diffrent people my family throw alot of off hand comments around and thats probably one of the reasons i keep to myself a lot. Alot of rambling but all in all will conclude with we are who we are changes happen throughout life but why change or modify something about ourselves if its something thats occurs naturally to us.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gzbbjz/i_dont_feel_comfortable_smiling_and_faking_it/ftfvhj7/"}
