It\u2019s not over in your 20\u2019s! My parents are MUCH MUCH better off financially now than when they were in their 20\u2019s and get to experience all the good life has to offer now that they\u2019re more secure and their kids are grown. \n\nThey\u2019re in their 40\u2019s and frequently go out and \u201chit the town\u201d and go on multiple vacations a year. This includes Mexico, Paris, Tokyo, Amsterdam, etc. They sometimes go to LA just to hit the beaches and Las Vegas to go gamble and drink. Something they couldn\u2019t do in their 20\u2019s regardless of if they had kids or not. I actually think the older and more secure you are the better your experiences get from what I\u2019ve witnessed \n\nSeeing them live their best life definitely helps my sense of \u201cfleeting youth\u201d. I\u2019m 21 and have a 6 month old daughter so I occasionally feel like \u201cI\u2019m missing out on my 20\u2019s\u201d but then I see my parents and I\u2019m really glad to be a young parent like them. I get to enjoy things alongside my daughter as she grows up while (hopefully) not being too out of touch, she gets to witness what it looks like to work hard and build a stable life from the ground up, by the time she\u2019s an adult I\u2019ll be 38 and have PLENTY of good years ahead of me and hopefully a better basis to do those things.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o4acgk/help_a_23_year_old_put_the_length_of_life_into/h2g5ng2/"}
