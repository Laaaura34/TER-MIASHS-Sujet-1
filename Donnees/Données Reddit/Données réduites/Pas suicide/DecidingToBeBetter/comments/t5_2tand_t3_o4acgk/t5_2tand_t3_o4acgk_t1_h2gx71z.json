In their 20s, people tend to stress about education and jobs and \u201cmaking it\u201d career wise and relationship wise, but you won\u2019t be able to do these things successfully until you have a good grasp of who you are.\nTrying different things in life will help you discover yourself, and so will self-reflection.\nHad I gone into school in my early 20s I would have wasted an enormous amount of time and money.\nBased on my hindsight I know that 10-15 years ago, I might have thought I knew myself but I didn\u2019t have a clue who I was and what I wanted to do, and what\u2019s changed that is experience and a lot of time spent on self-evaluation.\n\nGet to know your soul and body and learn how to care properly for yourself in every aspect, because life is fragile and so is both the mind and body and it starts going downhill really fast if you\u2019re not paying close attention.\nOur perception of time is relative, and if you\u2019re not careful it slips by you while you\u2019re busy with \u201clife\u201d, but without you actually living.\n\nMy dad died right before I turned 32, all because he was stubborn and didn\u2019t pay attention, so don\u2019t put off medical care because of ignorance and stubbornness.\n\nMaybe also fight for free healthcare if it\u2019s not already provided, because that\u2019s one of the fundamental building blocks of any humane society.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o4acgk/help_a_23_year_old_put_the_length_of_life_into/h2gx71z/"}
