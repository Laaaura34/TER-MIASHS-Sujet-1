One of the things that helped me realize I still had a wealth of time and opportunity was watching other people. Some examples:\n\nMy mom decided to go back to school at 40 and graduated top of her class in a field she\u2019d never shown any interest in. Last year at 45 she took three random new hobbies and they\u2019re flourishing \u2014 shows me that it\u2019s never too late to start something [except maybe professional athletics]\n\nMy husband\u2019s grandparents are nearing 90 and only just now slowing down. One of my great grandparents is 90 and still shows up to relative\u2019s homes to chat at random. He\u2019s a wild dude.\n\nMy 85 year old great grandfather still has an active sex life \u2014 and I\u2019m still annoyed at his wife for telling us that information as I did not need the mental image. But she says she wishes he had like anti-viagra.\n\nSo if I live to that long that\u2019s means I\u2019ve used like a quarter of my life. And it feels like it took awhile to get to this point already. \n\nHonestly even a year of life is a really long time \u2014 it\u2019s plenty of time to do something. So an entire lifetime? You\u2019ve got awhile yet before you need to worry about running out of time. Just take life as it comes and when you find a direction that interests you then go ahead and check it out.\n\nSorry if this was rambly and confusing \u2014 I\u2019m very sleep deprived this weekend.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o4acgk/help_a_23_year_old_put_the_length_of_life_into/h2g6agc/"}
