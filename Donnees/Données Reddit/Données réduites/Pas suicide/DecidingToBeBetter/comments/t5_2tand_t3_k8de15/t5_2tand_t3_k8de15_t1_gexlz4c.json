Write down all of your goals on the first page. Want to go to space? Write it. Finding a cure for cancer? Write it. Everything you want, little or big write it down. Next do some research, how do you get to your goals? Write down the process that\u2019ll get you to where you want to be in your life, to where you can say you\u2019re happy with what you do everyday and are successful. Now incorporate that into a daily list, whether that is studying biology or business daily or anything else. Start gradually, completely changing your schedule will make you give up on it, add two new daily chores and add more as you go.\n\nWhat\u2019s the next step? JUST DO IT!!\n\nHope this helps, luck is irrelevant, this is all about dedication. So power to ya! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k8de15/the_stock_of_my_life/gexlz4c/"}
