I couldn't do meditation until I found a form called Paradoxical Relaxation.  It also helps to understand that meditation is a skill so you have to practice it to get better.  I was getting really frustrated when I started but once someone told me it's just like if you wanted to learn to play piano... you would expect to do poorly at first and get better with time.\n\nJournaling is another good system for increasing mindfulness as it makes you think out and rationalize your thoughts, plans and actions.  As you do this more you will get better at doing it in the moment as well.  \n\n\nLastly, taking up activities that can bring you into the moment naturally are good.  For me it's hiking and running(specifically trail running).  I know someone else who enters that space when doing wood carving.  Other common paths would be painting or playing music.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvn5ig/starting_a_mindfulness_practice_even_though_i/heczt1d/"}
