This right here is the entire goal of therapy: to become your own therapist. I admire your commitment to your own wellbeing. Being an honest critic and holding oneself accountable for getting caught in distorted cognitions or unhelpful patterns is no easy task. A need for external accountability and motivation is why many people go to therapy, even if they have a feeling of what would be helpful.
