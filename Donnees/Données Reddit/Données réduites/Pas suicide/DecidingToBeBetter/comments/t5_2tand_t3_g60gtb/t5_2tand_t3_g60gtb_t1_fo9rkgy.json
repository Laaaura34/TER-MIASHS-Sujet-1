I've been thinking about studying psychology a little more though, now that we all are stuck at home. I have been suffering from crippling loneliness for a while. It got worse since last year. Some of the books that have helped me include:\n\n\\- Meditations by Marcus Aurelius  \n\\- Stillness is the Key by Ryan Holiday  \n\\- Lost Connections by Johann Hari  \n\\- The School of Life by Alain De Botton  \n\\- 12 Rules for Life by Jordan Peterson\n\nI still get pretty messed up from time to time, but a re-read of these books help a lot. Can you help me with a link to the CBT Handbook? Also, if you need anything from my collection, I'd be happy to help!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g60gtb/i_started_studying_psychology_in_my_free_time_to/fo9rkgy/"}
