Like I let myself be beaten. \n\nDid you ever feel the same way or was it always as easy as you made it sound? You mentioned that it was tough but didn't go into the details. For example, my Depression, while incredibly extreme, has been off and on for most of my life. I used to cut, but I stopped that almost two years ago. Then other times, I'd just try to have meaningless sex to try and feel in control of my emotions. A lot of looking at memes and hiding my emotions. But you didn't describe yours, and I was wondering if yours was simply something easier to get over? Like I said, I'd try similar tactics, I studied Psychology and branched into Sociology to get over my problems with being in public. However, once I knew what was going on, I felt like things got worse. I don't really know how to describe it at all, but it didn't help. What about you? Is it hard, or did you manage well? \n\nRereading this, I realized I put a lot of personal information. Oh well, it's not like any of you will ever know my name.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g60gtb/i_started_studying_psychology_in_my_free_time_to/fo97iob/"}
