College was never an option but I've been a voracious reader of nonfiction since I was very young. I lost that, among other things, while I was depressed during young adulthood. When I found it again through philosophy, psychology, and physics (maybe a little psychedelics) it radically altered my perception of myself and reality. \n\nI urge anyone struggling with the existential issues of life to reach out. I can't say what will work for you, but I can say what has helped change my life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g60gtb/i_started_studying_psychology_in_my_free_time_to/fo8xvgb/"}
