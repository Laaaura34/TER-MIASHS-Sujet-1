They use it on Alzheimer\u2019s patients all the time but it\u2019s really an unknown technique in the world of depression and anxiety. \n \nThis is such an awesome post! And those books are super on point!\n\n\nIf/when you are thinking of seeking professional help (or anyone else reading this post) look for a CERTIFIED Psychologist with a specialization in CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy)\n\nNOT A LIFE COACH <\u2014- this is very important. Many \u201cmd\u2019s\u201d are not actually phd\u2019s and will not help you get better with these techniques. Look for certified psychologist, CBT specialist, or your specific illness when looking up someone to talk to. \n\nI have been burned by a one too many therapists. While they think it\u2019s in \u201cyour\u201d interest to set goals, and seize the day, it is NOT. It ends up hurting your mental state in the long run.
