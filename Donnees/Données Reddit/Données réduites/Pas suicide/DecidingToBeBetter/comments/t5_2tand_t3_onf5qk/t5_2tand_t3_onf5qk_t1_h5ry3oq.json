I find myself doing a lot of things for others, whiles others don't do the same for me. The reason I do so much for others is because I only see myself as a valuable, wanted person when I am needed. But they do not return the same favor.\n\nAnd that is when I realize this has to do with confidence in yourself and others. A lot of unconfident people do things for others because they think they are only valuable when they are requested. In reality, your time, and you are the most valuable asset that no one should be able to have easily.  It is not that I didn't know this.
