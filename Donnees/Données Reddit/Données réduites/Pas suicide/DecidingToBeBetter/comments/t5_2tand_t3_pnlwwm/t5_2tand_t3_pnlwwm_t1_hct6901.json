Of course it's going to be harder for you than it would be a person who's used to struggling through a \"normal\" life. You're used to not having to fight for it, so give yourself some credit for trying. It's new country for you.\n\nPersonally I think you should have a heart to heart with your dad, and tell him about how you loved your creative job back then and how you felt a real passion for it. You're obviously bored and find no meaning in the work he suggested for you, maybe he could place you somewhere else? In a more creative position where you could flourish?\n\nOr you can choose to pursue your previous career and just deal with the financial downtimes like everyone else. Running your own business means setting money aside for those rough times when you have no work. Other people find a way to get through without a nestegg, so can you.\n\nBasically to put it shortly I get your story, but I don't think having a soul sucking job in your fathers company to redeem yourself is the way to go. In the end it's your life, work is something you do for MANY hours a week, and you SHOULD have at least some passion for what you do or you will be miserable.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pnlwwm/what_advice_can_you_give_to_a_spoiled_brat_who/hct6901/"}
