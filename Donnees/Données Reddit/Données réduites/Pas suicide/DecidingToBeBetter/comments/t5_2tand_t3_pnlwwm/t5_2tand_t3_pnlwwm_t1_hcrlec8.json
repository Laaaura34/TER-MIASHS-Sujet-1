About a year ago I experienced a very deep psychosis from marijuana and some other drugs. Was also in a psych ward for awhile. I grew up in a regular household and didn\u2019t have stuff handed to me but similarly to you I was doing much better in life before psychosis and since that happened I\u2019m in a much worse position. It really threw me off and similarly I feel like I lost a big piece of my identity and don\u2019t know who I am. I can\u2019t give you too much advice because I am going through it too but what has helped me is trying to take my life back day by day. Not thinking too far ahead of myself and take things slowly. Be grateful for what you have and realize there is no rush. Work ethic and discipline is also difficult for me but is getting better. Try to add in hobbies and stuff you enjoy into your life and slowly build up your discipline over time.
