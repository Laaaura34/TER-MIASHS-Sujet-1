The best use of self help isn't to read it once and then be \"done\" IMO. If you want to make use of these materials, I would recommend reading for at LEAST half an hour a day, preferably in the morning but at some time anyway. These messages need reinforcement to really sink in. I would try to do this at the same time everyday too, eg. right after lunch, right before bed, right after dinner etc.\n\nALSO it depends on what exactly you have been reading, the same self help books aren't suitable for everyone, you should find some that suit you personally.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p687hf/48_years_old_with_2_kids_and_still_not_feeling/h9dxmer/"}
