I've always hated driving and it took me ages to pass my test. Then I got a car not long after I passed and barely used it (I lived in a large city with great public transport), plus it had a very dodgy issue with the brakes which was even more scary. I've since moved and desperately need to get a car to see family and just can't imagine getting to the point of feeling okay about driving (let alone enjoying it). It's so nice to hear a success story! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n30m7c/i_started_driving/gwn5bsh/"}
