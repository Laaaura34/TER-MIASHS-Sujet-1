I never felt stressed! But I realized I also stuffed all my feelings. If I had any emotions at all, I smoked to numb them. I could never cope! So in turn, coffee was a constant companion. Then one day it all came to a boiling point, my body shut down, I became ill and I literally thought I was dying!! If anyone has had a panic attack they can relate (??) I could never emphasize before those moments, the brain is such an amazing wonderful tool! The 2nd attack was enough for me to quit weed & coffee cold turkey, bad idea! 3 weeks of hell but coming out the other side feels so so SO much better. It\u2019s true, and surprisingly quitting smoking was easy for me too after 20 years! I\u2019ve replaced coffee with caffeine free tea, it works for me!!! Good luck to you and congratulations on quitting smoking weed. Why did you decide to quit? And why do you want to quit coffee??", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n070p3/i_almost_died/gw5yuv5/"}
