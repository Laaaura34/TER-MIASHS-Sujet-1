As you try to figure out who you are, go experience life: read a book you wouldn\u2019t normally read, go to museums, go for a hike in a park, camp, learn a new language, write, draw, learn a trade, redecorate a room, travel (doesn\u2019t have to be anything extravagant- go to the next town over), listen to some new music, go to a concert you wouldn\u2019t normally go to, go to the ballet or a play, cook - look up recipes from around the world and shop in those grocery stores, plant some flowers, volunteer... the point is be curious! \n\nCuriosity opens up the universe. Good luck! This internet stranger believes in you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n070p3/i_almost_died/gw5ubrk/"}
