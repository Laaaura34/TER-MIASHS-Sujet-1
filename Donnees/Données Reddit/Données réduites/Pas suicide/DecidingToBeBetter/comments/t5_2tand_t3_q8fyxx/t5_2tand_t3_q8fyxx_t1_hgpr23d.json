It\u2019s not as hard to read as it may seem. Of all the self help and psychology books I\u2019ve ever read, this one was by far the most helpful, with it I created real, lasting change.\n\nTake one step at a time, don\u2019t overwhelm yourself. There\u2019s a Nietzsche quote I love that you may find relevant/useful when things get tough. \u201cHe who has a why to live for, can bear almost any how\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019re rooting for you, OP!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8fyxx/starting_today_im_going_to_love_myself/hgpr23d/"}
