Stepping outside of your comfort zone with courage is the most virtuous thing a person can do. \n\nI\u2019ve struggled with social anxiety and have used alcohol, nicotine, adderall, and kratom as crutches, but I quit it all cold turkey three weeks ago. I\u2019ve been pushing myself to do even more social events while sober than when I was drinking. These are things I would be afraid to do even when I had a six-pack of courage, like meeting up with an old acquaintance with some of her friends I\u2019ve never met before at the dog park. \n\nI agree that we all have different standards for what makes us feel proud, and I think doing the things you\u2019ve been afraid to do and diving headfirst into the unknown is an amazing way to see a whole new realm of possibilities and to break yourself out of the cage you\u2019ve been trapped inside of.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o9rdbh/i_am_going_do_something_i_am_proud_of_every_day/h3e6dif/"}
