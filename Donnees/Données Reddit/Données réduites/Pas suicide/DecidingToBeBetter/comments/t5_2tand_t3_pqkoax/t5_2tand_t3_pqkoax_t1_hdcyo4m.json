I quit drinking years back, best decision. \n\nAnd major props for still going out. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve become more of a homebody, but I really don\u2019t enjoy being the only sober one in a room drunk people. I have a friend group that is heavy on the alcohol and I can only handle a few hangouts every so often because I find it a bit tiring. I\u2019ll still have *some* fun moments but it\u2019s not quite the same.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pqkoax/i_havent_drunk_alcohol_for_almost_a_month_yet_i/hdcyo4m/"}
