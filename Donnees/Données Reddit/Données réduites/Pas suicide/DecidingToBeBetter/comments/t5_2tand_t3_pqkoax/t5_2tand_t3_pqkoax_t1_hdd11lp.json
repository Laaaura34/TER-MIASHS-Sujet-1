Then, unexpectedly, and unpredictably, I go from \"I am on top of the world.\" to descending into a deep depression at some point, and that is when I know it is time to go home. The following days, as mentioned, consist of severe mood swings.\n\nNow that I don't drink, I don't experience the \"I am on top of the world.\" feeling, but I do shine with enthusiasm and am extroverted. And I tend to go alone, actually. I've decided to challenge myself, so that's what I've been doing the past month. I usually meet a few people I know, but I tend to talk to strangers, when possible.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pqkoax/i_havent_drunk_alcohol_for_almost_a_month_yet_i/hdd11lp/"}
