I simply think to myself, \"Alright. Tonight, I am going to (insert bar) to get a soda, and then I'll let the event unfold from there.\" I deliberately avoid creating expectations to avoid disappointment. I observe my surroundings and see where people are, if they are with friends, etc. If I am standing next to a person who isn't talking to anyone, enjoying a beer for himself, I introduce myself and let the conversation unfold from there. Sometimes I ask if I can sit on the same bench as someone else, but it depends on the place. In some places, people are open and welcoming, in others, you will most definitely get a no. \n\nTiming is key here, generally. You do not want to introduce yourself randomly to a group having a discussion, for instance. My tip would be: Let your intuition guide you.
