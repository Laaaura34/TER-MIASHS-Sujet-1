Pat yourself on the back,  you\u2019ve experienced immense change. It took a ton of effort to get to when\u2019re you\u2019re at. You recognized a need to change four years ago.   You\u2019re feeling the need for another evolution.  May I suggest taking up a hobby you\u2019ve always been interested in?  Once you get a good base then look around for a group of people who do your same hobby. Small steps to ease into social circles. \n\nYou wanna see a person who is awesome?  Look in the mirror. There are few, few people who have made such a big leap and kept with it. Rock on\u2026", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pqkoax/i_havent_drunk_alcohol_for_almost_a_month_yet_i/hdcik8z/"}
