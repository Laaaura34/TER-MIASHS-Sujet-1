They give me a bit of stick, but I think knowing that there\u2019s always someone sober actually makes them feel safe. \n\nI\u2019m an extravert with ADHD - I get a great buzz just from the music and my friends having a good time! Plus, if one of my friends doesn\u2019t feel like drinking that night, they know they have someone sober to hang out with.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pqkoax/i_havent_drunk_alcohol_for_almost_a_month_yet_i/hddr14g/"}
