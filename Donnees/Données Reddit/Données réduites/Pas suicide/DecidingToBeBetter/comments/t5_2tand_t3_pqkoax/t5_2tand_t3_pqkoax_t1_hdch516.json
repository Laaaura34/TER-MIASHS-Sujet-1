I get so anxious and uncomfortable, that it's impossible to have anything resembling a good time. To make it worse, that's pretty much what my entire social group does whenever they get together, so I'm spending almost all my time alone. To make that worse I work from home and live alone, so I don't even have that interaction. It's gotten to the point where I have to psych myself up to leave for any reason. It's not making me want to drink or use again because this is way better than that was, but my level of isolation can't be good for my overall mental health. Thank Zod for my dog. \n\nAfter I sobered up, I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder, major depression, and PTSD. It seems like once the substances were gone, all that's left were the disorders.\nSaw a psychologist for the first 3 years and a psychiatrist for a year and a half or so. I did a course of meds and they helped but it seems this is as good as it's going to get for me.\n\nPretty much all I do is work so that's going really well, and my health is fantastic for my age, so I got that going for me. I'm not very sad or depressed, but I don't really get excited for anything anymore. \nI'll take this over being where I was any day though. I know no one asked but it feels a little better just getting this off my chest.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pqkoax/i_havent_drunk_alcohol_for_almost_a_month_yet_i/hdch516/"}
