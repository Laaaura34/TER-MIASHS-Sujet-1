I love small talk and find it a great way to start talking to someone. It\u2019s not boring unless you\u2019re boring and faking interest. Getting to some general topics that we all agree are ok at first eases social anxieties, and starts a rhythm you can jump off with. Nothing wrong with talking about where someone is from, what they do, some current events or hobbies. I mean, it\u2019s not like you go deep in the first 5 minutes. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s not like talking to a friend in comfort level. Just talk, find something someone else likes to talk about, and there you go!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ini9d2/i_suck_at_smalltalk_and_used_to_think_i_had_to/g47rpe4/"}
