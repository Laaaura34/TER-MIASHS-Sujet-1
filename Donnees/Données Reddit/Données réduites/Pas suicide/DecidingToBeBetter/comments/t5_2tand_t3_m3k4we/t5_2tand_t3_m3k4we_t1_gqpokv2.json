I wasn't affronting you personally in my follow up response either.\n\nNow I will affront you personally though,  your word choices, paragraph structures and essence embedded in your responds devalue what you think you're saying. From my standpoint, you have a vibe of \"I believe I am usually right, but I hide the fact I like to argue or oppose ideas with an identity of  I am a nice and understanding person who loves the morale high ground\". When you get got or lose the perceived upper hand, you make peace in a tongue in cheek fashion as you quickly disengage.\n\nThat's just me being honest with what I sense from you and I am not upset at all. Hell I want you to go have the best day possible and presently enjoy each day that follows in the way that produces gratitude.\n\nI do respect you and your final paragraph and completely agree to continue to act with good intentions to make the world a better more honest place.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m3k4we/decide_to_be_kind_and_not_nice_because_there_is_a/gqpokv2/"}
