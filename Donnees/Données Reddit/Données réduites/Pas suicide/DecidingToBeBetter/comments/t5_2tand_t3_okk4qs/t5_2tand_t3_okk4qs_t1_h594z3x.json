I learnt this the hard way in the late 80s and never asked for help from my parents when I was struggling as a depressed/anxious child. Basically had to work out for myself how to survive until it was too obvious to everyone that I had a serious problem. My parent were not happy and tried to shame me and saw it as a judgement on their own parenting. It was really hard on everyone. Things should be better now that it is more out in the open and socially accepted nowadays. In my day, it was like coming out as gay in the 1950s, being treated like a criminal or a deliquent. Ridiculous when you think about it now. When a quarter of the population are suffering from something, you are not really talking about any minority or crazy fringe anymore.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/okk4qs/i_told_my_parents_about_my_depression_and_i_feel/h594z3x/"}
