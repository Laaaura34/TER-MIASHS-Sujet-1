It really needs courage to share everything with your parents. I am proud of you for doing that. Even I broke down in front of my parents day before yesterday. I cried with my mom for an hour but it felt good later, though I felt bad for making her cry. They reassured me that I will always have them by my side no matter what. Surprisingly they even agreed to allow me to see a therapist and I have my first appointment on Saturday.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/okk4qs/i_told_my_parents_about_my_depression_and_i_feel/h594jau/"}
