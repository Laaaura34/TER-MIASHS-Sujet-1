Maybe it really have to take you three years to discover that? Because I'm sure a lot of people never learned that in their lifetime.\n\n\nMatter of fact my father is already 47 when he discovered what he wanted to do. He's 52 now and still doing so great. It was as if 2 decades of aging vanished from his face... When I'm still a teen I remember how my father was miserable and couldn't even bring himself up to work. Now he's just so happy. He's making miracles despite the pandemic.\n\n\nWhat I observed is that, the Universe gives a helping hand to those people who give another chance to life again. I am not religious, but I have always saw this in people's lives, including mine.\n\nI only hope that you'll see this with your own eyes, too... How the Universe will stretch itself to support you, once you made clear you want to try life again. \n\nYou deserve everything good in life, sir. I wish you more healing, and fulfillment in your journey. Please live a phenomenal life of your own choosing. You're powerful.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mj9xvc/3_years_ago_today_i_hit_rock_bottom_and_went_to/gt9qy9q/"}
