Sometimes we all need to do that.\n\nI want to ask you a few questions to see whether we can shine light on what you are passionate about:\n\nIf you had everything handled in life to live comfortably, had the money you needed, had the capability to do or learn anything you wanted and had a wide open schedule to take on anything you wanted, what would you want to do with your time?
