I literally would tell myself: just do 1 push up. Just read one page. What is the minimum I can do to say that I\u2019ve done the thing? Naturally you don\u2019t do one push up or read just one page but knowing that\u2019s ALL I have to do means I end up doing more because I\u2019ve started. This helped me realize that motivation is a con and will never come to me. The real fuel is action and action can be as much as reading 100 pages or one word then the motivation follows.\n\nWell done by the way on making the change and sticking with it. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jenmct/heres_what_helped_me_when_i_kept_failingnot/g9fdtm5/"}
