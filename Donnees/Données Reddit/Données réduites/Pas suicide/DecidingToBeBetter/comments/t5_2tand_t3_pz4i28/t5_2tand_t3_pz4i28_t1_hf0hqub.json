I learned that the lack of challenge and hardship in life makes it so.\n\nIn an effort to figure myself out, I swung to the other side of this spectrum. How much I miss the safety and security of my previous life. I also found a lot of pain in this path I took. I again learned, pain is simply a part of life. It is the form of pain that you are willing to take on and sacrifice for that builds you as a person.\n\nChoose so that you don\u2019t regret. Your fire right now may die a bit and lose your motivation again, so I highly suggest you save this post somewhere or maybe even print it out and put it up where you can see it frequently. I\u2019m rooting for ya.\n\nAlso just wanted to thank you for this post. It sparked a little something in me. I am not doing very well the past few months and have been struggling to get a grip of myself. So yeah, thank you", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pz4i28/i_am_done_being_a_thinker_and_from_now_im_a_doer/hf0hqub/"}
