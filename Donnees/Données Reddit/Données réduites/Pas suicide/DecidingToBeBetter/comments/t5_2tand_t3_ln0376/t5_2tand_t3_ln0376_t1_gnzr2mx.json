Almost the same length of time. And yeah definitely vibe with the disassociation. I have a close friend from high school that is a hardcore stoner. Has been for years. And frankly it\u2019s annoying. He makes like $16/hr and has a roommate and cheap rent. Always seems to be low on money but I swear it\u2019s because of how much weed he smokes. Plus when we go out to get lunch or what not, it\u2019s frustrating when he\u2019s stoned cause it\u2019s like talking to a wall.\n\nAnd I get the feeling. I used to be that way, and it feels great as the smoker. People seem to blend into the background and everything sorta becomes homogeneous. In a way it\u2019s a spiritual feeling. But I think that head space should be enjoyed sparingly. It\u2019s not healthy to indulge", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ln0376/decided_to_cut_weed_because_my_memory_and/gnzr2mx/"}
