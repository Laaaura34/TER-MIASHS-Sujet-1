I started with one week breaks here and there, but eventually lowered my tolerance enough to where smoking small amounts was enough to completely derail my day.\n\n\nDon't be afraid to fail at it. In fact, while you're starting to quit, it's pretty acceptable. One thing that helped me immensely was not hanging out with my stoner friends for a while. I love em, but I didn't stand a chance if going over to spin some records and have a few drinks also meant smoking poppers the entire night. Yeah, it sucks being the dork who doesn't smoke anymore, but they understand why I needed to stop and I understand that they're just wired differently and can handle it. If you're actually friends, they'll still be there for you once you've dealt with your shit.\n\nDo what's best for you and everything else worth keeping in your life will still be there for you when you're ready for it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ln0376/decided_to_cut_weed_because_my_memory_and/gnz568g/"}
