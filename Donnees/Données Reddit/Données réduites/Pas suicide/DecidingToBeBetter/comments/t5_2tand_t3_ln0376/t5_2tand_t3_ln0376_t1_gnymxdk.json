That said it will wear off during the night so you wont miss all of your rem or anything. Because of that any effects likely won't be extreme. But sleep is how your brain grows and repairs and whatnot so messing with it is probably not ideal in the long term. To be fair weed can also help with sleep in some ways. So just don't over do it. Try experimenting with how long before bed you hit pen vs how you feel the next day. The sooner it wears off the sooner you can get good rem sleep.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ln0376/decided_to_cut_weed_because_my_memory_and/gnymxdk/"}
