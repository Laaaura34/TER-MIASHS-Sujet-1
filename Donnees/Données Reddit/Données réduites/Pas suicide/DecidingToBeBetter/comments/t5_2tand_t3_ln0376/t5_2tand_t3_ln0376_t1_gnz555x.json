I don\u2019t follow r/leaves because it always felt like there is an animosity toward weed and everyone wants to be permanently done with weed(which is fine, just not something I relate to, I ultimately wanna smoke again socially one day). I recommend r/petioles as well because it has an emphasis on LIMITING use. \n\nAlso, my music writing has gotten *SO* much better. I realized my stoned self found a lot of mediocre music to sound way better than it actually was. Now I\u2019m more critical with my overall instrumentation and can actually write lyrics with meaning to me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ln0376/decided_to_cut_weed_because_my_memory_and/gnz555x/"}
