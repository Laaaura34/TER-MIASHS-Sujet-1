It won\u2019t last going cold turkey if you hang out with nobody but daily stoners. They can say they support all day but their own actions and lifestyles will always going against it in a matter of time, with it being as simple as them making getting back on weed seem like a crazy fun idea or suggesting you have a cheat day down the road. I\u2019ll warn you now that you accept the fact you were using weed as a crutch to bond, relax and be creative. You\u2019ll come to a point fairly soon where you start to feel like you can\u2019t bond with people as easily or enjoy gaming as much without weed. Shit I can be 10x more social drunk than sober but I can\u2019t be drunk every single time I want to hang out with people, and if hanging out with a certain crowd of people is only fun drunk then you\u2019re gonna bored as shit when you\u2019re sober. Best advice I can offer you is absolutely commit to staying sober, but the best path forward is to cut ties and find a new crowd that practices the values you want to have in life. It\u2019s only gonna be 10x harder hanging around people who don\u2019t want to change the same way you do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ln0376/decided_to_cut_weed_because_my_memory_and/go0b4jg/"}
