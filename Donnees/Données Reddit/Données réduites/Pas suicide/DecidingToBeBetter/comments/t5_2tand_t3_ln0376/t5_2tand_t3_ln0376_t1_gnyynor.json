Unironically became a smoke-weed-every-day sorta loser. I quit about a year ago and have indulged here and there, but definitely noticed a huge improvement on memory, anxiety, ability to sleep (and having dreams), generally irritability and sense of responsibility. Dissociation calmed down after a little while. Once I stopped, I realized how much it was affecting my mental health -- it was usually what started rolling the little snowball of negative thoughts down the hill before gravity took over. Self medication became self harm.\n\n\nLike, not saying that it solved all my problems, but stepping away from over an ounce a month definitely got me pointed in the right direction. Career really took off when I quit and was able to actually centre my focus on moving up in the company, moving out on my own and making sure I could save enough money. I'm not perfect, but I'm better off now. Some people are functional stoners and can control their usage and utilize their highs. I like to overdue it to the point I can't enjoy it.\n\n\nDon't ever hit a bong once you get a few weeks out. Ain't worth it man.
