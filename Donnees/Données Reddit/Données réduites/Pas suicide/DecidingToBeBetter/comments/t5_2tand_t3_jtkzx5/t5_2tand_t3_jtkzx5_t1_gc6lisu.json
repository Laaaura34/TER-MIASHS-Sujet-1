Just wanted to come in and let you know that I'm rooting for you!\n\nI'm no expert on self confidence, far from it, but something that's been helping me lately has been the idea to be more aware of how I'm living my life, of the choices I've been making (either through action OR inaction), and then *owning* those choices with as much of myself as I can muster. The more choices that I make, own up to, and accept, the more confident I feel, and the more I'm able to realize that I'm capable of taking care of myself and my emotional wellbeing. I need to believe that I'm not as helpless as I feel sometimes, and that I need to be my biggest advocate for positive change in my life.\n\nThat being said, I want to caution that you need to be on your own side, and that means casting aside judgement for small setbacks and failures and playing the long game, by being supportive and kind to yourself. When we get into \"action mode\", our biggest stumbling blocks for guys like us can often be our own self-criticism. Be your biggest fan! Look at your potential and be amazed by it! Explore new horizons with curiosity instead of fear and leave room in your heart for the possibility of great things, especially when it comes time to take some risks.\n\nI believe in you, man! Good luck, and I wish you the best. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jtkzx5/i_want_to_be_better_for_myself/gc6lisu/"}
