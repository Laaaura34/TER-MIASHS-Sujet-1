Fair. That doesn't play very well with this statement though;\n\n> the health benefits of eating these foods outweigh any potential negative nutritional effects. \n\nIf we can agree that the benefits of plants are theoretical at this point, fine. I'll even buy that we may be able to find health benefits correlated with plant intake, BUT the important caveat here is to acknowledge that those benefits may come at a biological cost somewhere else in the system - and the question then becomes if the cost/benefit is going to be worth it. I'll bet my money on that it isn't, but hopefully we'll see in time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/idhzgu/update_i_quit_coffee_pizza_started_waking_up/g2b604q/"}
