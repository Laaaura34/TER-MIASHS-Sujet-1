Specially after you had those cheat meals and felt better again.\n\nAs someone who uses foods as such a mechanism I would recommend to pay attention to yourself what happens within you to cause having those feelings and maybe having to have those craving for cheat meals again.\n\nLike you said this progress is not liniar, so if what you could deem as not \"good behaviour\" but it still happening, to be not too harsh on yourself. We are all humans, so in those moments to have some self compassion is very helpful.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/idhzgu/update_i_quit_coffee_pizza_started_waking_up/g29khw3/"}
