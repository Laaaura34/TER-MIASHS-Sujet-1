Secondly, I am 90% sure that your depressive symptoms could be related to the way that you're eating. We've been taught for our entire lives that vegetables are good for us, which is why many people in hope of becoming super healthy turns to a purely plant-based diet. The truth is a little different if you look to people who've been vegans for years and then had to give it up due to mental and physical problems - /r/exvegans are full of those examples.\n\nTo keep it short, vegetables are not interested in being eaten, and for that reason they are fraught with defense chemicals, also known as anti-nutrients. These will wreak havoc on your system, as well as inhibit the absorption of essential micronutrients. Moreover, the micronutrients you need are not in an easily convertible form for the human body - when you consider this, you have a diet that isn't serving you well. There are many, many more nuances to this, and I'd be happy to help you out with a diet that'll serve you better (spoiler: it'll contain meat).
