So, I worked harder at meeting new people and adding them on my facebook. \nEven then, I still wasn't satisfied as I looked through my friends list and I knew nothing about them. I was mad at the fact that most of them were  fake not knowing that I was being fake as well. So, I erased them from my friends list. After a few days, I would feel inadequate again so I went off to meet even more people just to add them on my facebook. Facebook helped to create this cycle and harvested my insecurities.\n\nThen I took a break from it. I've learned that the most important things in life are right in front of you and I went off from there. Yes I look happy and drunk in my pictures. My facebook page is still up there as a reminder to myself that I do not wish to be in that position ever again.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1ssvz9/facebook_use_makes_people_feel_worse_about/ce16a0r/"}
