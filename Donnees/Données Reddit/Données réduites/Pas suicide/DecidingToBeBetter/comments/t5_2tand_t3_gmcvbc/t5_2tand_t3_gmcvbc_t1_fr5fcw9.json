I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re in a safer and stable position in your life, I\u2019m sure that helped get you there. \n\nOne tip I have for saving money (I am also constantly thinking about my wants vs needs): any time I want to buy a \u201cwant\u201d I put the money I would\u2019ve spent on it in my savings account and pretend I actually bought it. This has prevented me from unnecessary spending and makes saving more fun. I get the high of buying what I was wanting (even if I never get it) because I took the initiative to put the money aside and better myself and my finances. Hope this helps you too!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gmcvbc/just_paid_of_4500_of_credit_card_debt/fr5fcw9/"}
