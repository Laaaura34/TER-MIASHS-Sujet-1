To be clear, I still love them and we are still as close as we were, BUT - \n\nWhile I can't change this about them, I have now realized ways to handle their episodes. I've learned that the behavior is not my fault. Putting a label on it has allowed me to see my entire life so much more clearly, made me understand my childhood a lot more, and why I am the way I am. Made me realize what I need to work on, and how to react to those around me. It has given me a lot of peace of mind (though I had to go through the steps of grief over the course of a few months), but coming out on the other side, my life is going to be so much better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kczeqx/although_this_year_wasnt_ideal_at_all_a_lot_of_us/gfujfqi/"}
