Through the 2 years we dated, it still sucks, to be honest, to be and feel \"broken up\", but no longer am I having to suffer through the emotional and mental abuse that that guy put me through. No longer having to feel like I am a POS, not worthy, not beautiful, etc... though as difficult it was to leave because of his harrassment and his toxicity, I'll forever be happy that I finally left all that BS and finally able to just breathe again.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kczeqx/although_this_year_wasnt_ideal_at_all_a_lot_of_us/gfw61ip/"}
