I take a pen and ruler and draw a grid that's 7 boxes tall for the week and the X number of boxes wide for however many habits I am tracking. If it's a habit I want to do twice a day (like brushing my teeth) I fill the box in halfway for each, and if it's something I do once a day (like working out) then I fill it in completely when I do it. I have small little icons at the top to show which column is for what and then the days of the week on the left side. I've been tracking my weight in the morning on the right. And then below is where I journal a bit.\n\nAs far as quotes I use an older Kindle. I download books on my phone from LibGen and then email them to my kindle. When I'm reading a book and come across a passage I really like I highlight it. Then it's kept in a \"book\" on the kindle along with all the other passages I've highlighted.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrmsma/17f_finally_quit_smoking_and_toxic_friends/fy93wso/"}
