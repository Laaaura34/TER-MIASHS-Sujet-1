I hope you're really proud of yourself, because going through all that shit is difficult. Super worth it, though\n\nIf you want to keep maintaining consistency, I recommend maybe getting a habit tracking app, the kind where you fill in the habits you want to maintain and check in with it to track your progress. The same could be accomplished by bullet journaling. Or even just using a planner to structure your day. \n\nAlso, screenshot this post and set it as a lock screen or something to remind you what you've gained by developing these habits in the first place. Not to mention remembering what you left behind and how much better off you are now", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrmsma/17f_finally_quit_smoking_and_toxic_friends/fy6pezu/"}
