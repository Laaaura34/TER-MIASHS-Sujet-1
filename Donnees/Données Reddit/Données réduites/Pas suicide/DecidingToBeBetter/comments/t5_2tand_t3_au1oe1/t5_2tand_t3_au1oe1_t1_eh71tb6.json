I am often lacking motivation to be productive. I\u2019ve been reading a lot about motivation and self help, and one thing I am trying is just to start by having one small goal. Whatever is it, for me I also don\u2019t have the motivation to work out and I am always relying on partner to make dinner, which isn\u2019t good. So my first small goal is set a small amount of time 5-10 minutes a day to stretch. I started this yesterday and I feel like it has helped me just to feel the motivation to get my ass into gear. Once I get this going I feel like I can maybe increase my goals and do maybe one small workout and go from there. \n\nI can definitely relate when you say this doesn\u2019t feel like depression but it\u2019s just the lack of motivation. I feel like I overload my life and sometimes I don\u2019t do enough self care for myself.
