I'm currently trying to get there- taking it one day at a time. I have depression and anxiety, and I'm on antidepressants too... it's so easy to get caught up in the depressive mindset when it hits. I've realized that not everyday is going to be great, but that doesn't mean the next one has to be bad too. Take care of yourself. We got this! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pyy8q7/im_becoming_the_person_i_wanted_to_be/hez2ufx/"}
