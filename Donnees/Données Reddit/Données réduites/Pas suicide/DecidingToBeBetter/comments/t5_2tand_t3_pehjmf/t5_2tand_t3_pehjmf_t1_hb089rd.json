I have a degree in Graphic Design (I went straight to university/art school after high school). By the time I had graduated I had already grown out of it. I tried to force myself to be interested in it but it just made things worse. \n\nI started teaching and did that for about 5 years until I realized that my dream job is in finance. I prepared to get into university to study finance and economics (studying for entrance exams etc) which took me about 3 years. It would've taken me 2 if not for the pandemic but I'm not sweating it. There were plenty of trial and errors along the way and I learned a lot from it. \n\nI got accepted this year at the age of 33 and I'll be 36 by the time I finish my bachelors degree and I couldn't be happier! I had my first class today and for the first time since my early 20s I felt like I was on the right track towards my career goals. It was an incredibly liberating and amazing feeling!! \n\nMy logic is similar to yours. Unless I die, I'll be 36 regardless, so I'd rather be 36 doing something I'm interested in. Above all, I'm extremely grateful that I have been granted this wonderful opportunity.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pehjmf/my_parents_made_me_quit_art_and_not_even_think/hb089rd/"}
