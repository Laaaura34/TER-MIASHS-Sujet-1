Personally I think art is about showing what you stand for to the world. Since you had more life experiences, you\u2019ll have more inspiration to draw from and that is actually an advantage over people who are just out of high school.\n\nI also know successful artists, animators, designers and illustrators. It might take some figuring out but there are definitely career options out there.
