Fast forward a few years and random jobs and I felt like I had wasted time and money really. My only rationale is that I proved that I can work hard and the lifelong friends I made were worth it.\n\nIve just had the recent notion that I might like to teach and have found that because I have a Bsc Hons, I can do a Masters of Teaching (either primary or secondary) which is a 1.5 year course.x\n\nI never thought I would want to become a teacher but here I am and because I have a degree already it might not have been as much of a waste as I thought.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pehjmf/my_parents_made_me_quit_art_and_not_even_think/hb1m8g6/"}
