Of course there are ethics involved, like trust, integrity, and honesty. This is something you have to consistently work on.\n\nProfessionalism is both a standard of excellence and etiquette: it's how you treat yourself and others with respect (even in everyday situations). It goes as far as the handshake, the well-groomed hair, ironed clothes, keeping up with your industry's news and having an educated opinion on developments. \n\nA professional does both what is expected of them and exceeds those expectations. They learn how to do their job and do it well - whatever it may be. You can be a professional waiter or professional assistant. \n\nHabits are very important. Time management, stress management, accountability, striving for excellence - having good habits set the frame for future successes. \n\nI highly recommend the Seven Habits of Highly Effective People by Covey.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7phmt7/hi_reddit_what_do_you_think_is_the_secret_to_a/dsifl8u/"}
