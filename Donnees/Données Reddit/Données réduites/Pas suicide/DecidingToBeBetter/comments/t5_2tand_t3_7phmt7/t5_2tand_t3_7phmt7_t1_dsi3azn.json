Someone who hast struggled and hustled a lot and still does but now on a higher - more professional - level. So to get to where he is you\u2019d have to understand what he went trough: he didn\u2019t just stood up from the couch and decided \u201cimma be professional now!\u201d He actually worked hard. Try identifying with that: you\u2019d have a lot of tenacity, the will to pull trough. Also you\u2019d have taken a lot of responsibilities in your life to that point so you also are learned to be reliable. You\u2019ve surely made mistakes but you learned that you can\u2019t give in or hide mistakes you have to stand up for what you did and deal with it. You\u2019d have eaten dirt on your way so you\u2019d appreciate every bit of easy work that comes your way. Also you\u2019d be confident - because you\u2019ve experienced a lot you\u2019ve done a lot you didn\u2019t just quiet when things got rough. And you\u2019ve been in this business for a while so you also know what this is all about a professional knows what he\u2019s talking about. Also you learned to handle people - oh handling people - smiling when you\u2019d like to cry hand shaking when you\u2019d like to brake their hand but all for the sake of connections. You\u2019ve learned that weakness is something for at home cuz at work wen your at what your doing you can\u2019t show that you have weak points. Cuz than people won\u2019t respect ya nor will they trust you. ... \nIt\u2019s hard to acquire that mind set just by thinking about it but knowing where your heading might speed up the process of getting there.\n  ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7phmt7/hi_reddit_what_do_you_think_is_the_secret_to_a/dsi3azn/"}
