I used to be in this camp and now run 5 miles every few days. The first 100 feet is still not enjoyable, but I've learned that you will break through each time and get into a good rhythm where running becomes meditative. Also, what worked for me to get into running was to take it super slow at the beginning. I put myself in a running position but paced myself like it was a walk, just focusing on breathing. I was able to build up from there.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gogbgo/i_went_from_not_being_able_to_walk_1_mile/frgr5zw/"}
