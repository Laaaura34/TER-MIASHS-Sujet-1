Here\u2019s a cute list of tips that will help you:\n1- ALWAYS listen to your body (if you can\u2019t run that day, don\u2019t run that day)\n2- Be mindful of how hard you push yourself (you don\u2019t wanna risk injury)\n3- Try running at slower paces consistently (running slow is easier and can help you build endurance)\n4- Join r/running if you haven\u2019t already (will help keep you motivated)\n\nYou should be proud of your achievement dude. Hope this helps. Happy running!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gogbgo/i_went_from_not_being_able_to_walk_1_mile/frhh7u2/"}
