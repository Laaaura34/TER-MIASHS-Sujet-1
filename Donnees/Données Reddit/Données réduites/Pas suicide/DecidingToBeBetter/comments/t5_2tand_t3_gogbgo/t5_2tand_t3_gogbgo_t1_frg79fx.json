The first 20 feet feel amazing and like I'm made of air and then a minute later I'm hating everything about running, and want to walk the rest of the way. \n\nHowever, I ran a half marathon in under 2 hours last year, after training for about 10 months. \n\nGood effort on my part but I still hate running and still almost every day feel like I can't do it after the first 100 feet. Just try going beyond is what I'm suggesting.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gogbgo/i_went_from_not_being_able_to_walk_1_mile/frg79fx/"}
