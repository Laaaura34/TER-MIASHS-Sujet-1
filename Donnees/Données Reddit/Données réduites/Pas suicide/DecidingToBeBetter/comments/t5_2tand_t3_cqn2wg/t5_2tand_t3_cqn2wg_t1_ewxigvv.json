It\u2019s ground up tea leaves so your body actually absorbs it and has to digest it like food so it\u2019s sustainable caffeine. There\u2019s no jitters or crash plus full of antioxidants. It can be an acquired taste. There are a few coffee shops that offer it in a more blended version so it\u2019s more palatable. I ordered the pricey stuff from [pirates chai](http://www.pirateschai.com)  and a standard $20 bag off amazon then mix them together so it\u2019s not super sweet. After a while of drinking a fair amount I just started mixing it weaker and cut it out. I really love coffee so I try to only drink it for pleasure on days off and limit it to one or two cups. When I\u2019m off caffeine I actually feel better and don\u2019t need it. \nGood luck. Hope that helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cqn2wg/how_to_go_about_quitting_caffeine/ewxigvv/"}
