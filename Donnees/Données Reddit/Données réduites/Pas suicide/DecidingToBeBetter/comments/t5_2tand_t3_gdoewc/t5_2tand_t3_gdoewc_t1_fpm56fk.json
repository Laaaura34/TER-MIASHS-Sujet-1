Another Redditor brought some literature to my attention and it really got me thinking. It\u2019s about how to stop being paralyzed by anxiety and depression. I have absolutely avoided any pain for the last ten years. I won\u2019t summarize the whole thing but basically this therapist talks about how you have to allow yourself to feel uncomfortable and unsafe and not let those feelings dissuade you from growing. It really got me thinking. So maybe the first step I can take is reading that whole book and then just apply for a damn job even though I\u2019m dreading it and the feelings it will give me. I have to accept those feelings, let them happen, and move past them or I\u2019ll never change.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gdoewc/my_life_has_been_wasted_current_times_have_only/fpm56fk/"}
