You are not your failures. You are worthy of being alive and have the right to pursue your happiness purely because you exist. No mistake or setback can take that away!\n\nHave you been to therapy at all? It seems like you might benefit from this. I\u2019d specifically recommend finding someone who can help you outline some goals and work toward them. Maybe a support group could be useful as well. I think by talking to others who are also trying to heal and better themselves you could build some strong connections. \n\nRegarding \u201chow do I start\u201d and \u201chow do I explain to employers\u201d etc, just start small and work your way up. The job market will improve when this virus dies down and the right opportunity will come along. Just don\u2019t give up. \n\nFinally, I just wanted to give my input on how frustrating it must\u2019ve been to be told to \u201cpray away\u201d your illnesses. I notice you had a job at a church, so maybe your family is involved in religion somehow. I just wanted to say that I\u2019m sorry if others have not presented being faithful in a helpful way to you in the past, but I do think it could also be useful just to find a connection to God in your own way (maybe a different church or a prayer group) and just focus on learning more and getting closer to God rather than \u201cpraying something away\u201d\n\nBest of luck to ya.
