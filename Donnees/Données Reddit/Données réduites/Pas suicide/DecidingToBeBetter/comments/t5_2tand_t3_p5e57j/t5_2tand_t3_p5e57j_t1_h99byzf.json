He loves me but it\u2019s no longer the same and I told him I can\u2019t even consider a future that involves marriage and kids if it doesn\u2019t get better. I refuse to spend the rest of my (probably short) life feeling unloved, unwanted and undesired. I honestly feel I will be better off alone than feeling alone in a relationship. You have to choose you, you have to give yourself the chance to blossom, to glow, to grow and feel happy just being you. Yes things and people change, I try to make it a point to appreciate the time that I was given to love.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5e57j/how_do_you_let_go_of_a_person_you_know_is_not/h99byzf/"}
