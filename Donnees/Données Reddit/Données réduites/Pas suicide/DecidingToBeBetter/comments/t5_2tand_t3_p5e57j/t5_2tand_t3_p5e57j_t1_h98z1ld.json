You are doing all the good things. Let it hurt , you are trying to stop feeling hurt because well it\u2019s not fun . You need to let it hurt , in your gut in your mind . Cry it out loud .  This is a must , and like everything else it will pass, do it until it will . Then you can accept it and finally let it go , in that order .  \nGo to a therapist, the best money you will ever spend. I\u2019m a dude and I feel deeply like this , not by choice it\u2019s just how I am , get some help and try to understand this part of you . More power to you !", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5e57j/how_do_you_let_go_of_a_person_you_know_is_not/h98z1ld/"}
