Give your self grace. One way of viewing it is that each new year or new expirience i have in life gives me a new version of myself. I can choose certain things in the setup menu but a lot comes predownloaded. Its not you the person has moved on from its an old version of you. SELF 24.20 is not compatable with RELATIONSHIP 34.20.  Yes we all change and tweak who we want to be. That is life. But yes it can also hurt and be scary when programs that ised to work dont work. \n\nTry to focus on your new programming. Write lots about how your feeling, things ypur scared of. Mourn the pieces of the relationship that have changed and you didnt want them too. Know its ok to morn things past, people past and expiriences past.  But part of mourning is acceptance and eventually moving on. That may just be a different mindset around your relationship or maybe its a new relationship altogether. Results will vary. \n\nAlso pick just one thing you kinna like about yourself. Repeat that to yourself until you learn its strength to ypu. Then add another thing until you know ypirself a little better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5e57j/how_do_you_let_go_of_a_person_you_know_is_not/h976khm/"}
