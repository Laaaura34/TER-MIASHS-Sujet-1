Speak kindly to yourself! \n\nIf this is hard, get a stuffed animal or object that you love a lot and set it down for a conversation. \n\nHave your stuffed animal speak for you: \u201cI want to learn how to let things go and stop stressing about it. I feel like he just doesn\u2019t care about my feelings because instead of speaking deeply to me about what made him change his thoughts toward me, he brushes it off by saying he\u2019s just gonna be different. I don\u2019t know if he cheated on me and is trying to hide it or if he just wants to be done with me, but he\u2019s not happy with me any more. I\u2019m not happy either. What do I do?\u201d\n\nSpeak honestly to that stuffed animal \ud83e\uddf8 as a friend, what is the best advice you could give it?  You can give hugs too and cry together if it helps, or have a tea. \n\nHave the stuffed animal say in plain terms everything \u201cit\u2019s\u201d feeling, anything like \u201cI feel unloved, I feel cast aside, I feel like I\u2019m not being respected\u201d, whatever comes up. Say it out loud in words. Getting it out helps a lot and putting words on those emotions helps too! \n\nYou don\u2019t have to have all the answers now of what to do, but tell your bear you\u2019ll always be friends and you\u2019ll be here while it goes through this tough period and that it\u2019s temporary, but it\u2019s ok to deal with its feelings by HAVING feelings too. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5e57j/how_do_you_let_go_of_a_person_you_know_is_not/h97oypy/"}
