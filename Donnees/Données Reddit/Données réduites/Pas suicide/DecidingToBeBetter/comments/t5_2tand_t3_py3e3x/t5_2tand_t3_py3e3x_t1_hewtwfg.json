Like last week I got a 20$ off 25$ code from Uber eats.  So tried out the Mr. Beast place my little brother has been begging to get stuff from. Another example would be when Instacart sent me a 40$ off of 80$ promo last month. Was a godsend because it cut over 30$ off my grocery bill (would\u2019ve been 40$, but my local aldi puts 10% on top of each item). I\u2019ve found that when you don\u2019t use or open the apps, they send you a decent amount of promos\u2026.and I put the apps on all 3 adult phones in the household, so we get a fair amount of them. Most of them aren\u2019t worth while though\u2026like when Uber eats sends me a 10$ off 30$ code or something (after fees and a tip, it comes out to 30$ anyway, so not worth it\u2026)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/py3e3x/two_months_ago_i_deleted_all_of_my_food_delivery/hewtwfg/"}
