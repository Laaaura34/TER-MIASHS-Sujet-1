I want to cook more, do you have any general tips on planning, meal research, list of good recipes on hand to have?\n\nI\u2019m trying to motivate myself and I cook a little but I want to be more consistent. It\u2019s exhausting to research recipes and then plan and then buy food at the store and then work all day and then feel unmotivated to cook. I want to do more cooking and I enjoy making tasty meals but the activation energy is so high, any suggestions to overcome it?\n\nThanks mate", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/py3e3x/two_months_ago_i_deleted_all_of_my_food_delivery/hetatbl/"}
