Do your best to improve on them, as you can. Also dont be too hard on yourself. Even if you were disgusting(i know youre not), most people do not care at all. So do what you can and repeat in your head, \"Who gives a Fuck\". Because honestly, its probably more you than anyone else. \n\nYou are a beautiful person and I love you friend. Remember, true beauty is inside you. So is self love. Youll find it and be less depressed soon enough, I am sure.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3sw1c/im_trying_to_work_on_myself_but_always_get/hfu0kyd/"}
