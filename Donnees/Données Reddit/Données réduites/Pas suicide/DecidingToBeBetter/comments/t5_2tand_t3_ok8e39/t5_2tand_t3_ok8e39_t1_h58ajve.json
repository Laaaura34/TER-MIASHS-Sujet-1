I am also very lucky to have met someone who truly loves me for who I am. We're going on 10 years married this November, and my best advice to give to you, as someone who constantly plays out more negative \"what if\" scenarios in my head than positive ones, and who suffers from daily anxiety and stress, is to talk these feelings out with your SO often! And maybe you already do this, and if so that is great!\n\nI kept these insecurities to myself for many years early on in the relationship, but that is the true beauty of a loving partnership - having that closeness to be able to open up to each other and be vulnerable, and to lift each other up and grow stronger together!\n\nI am also starting therapy as well for my anxiety. Your post really reflects your readiness to change for the better. I'm really proud of you, OP!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ok8e39/im_going_to_therapy/h58ajve/"}
