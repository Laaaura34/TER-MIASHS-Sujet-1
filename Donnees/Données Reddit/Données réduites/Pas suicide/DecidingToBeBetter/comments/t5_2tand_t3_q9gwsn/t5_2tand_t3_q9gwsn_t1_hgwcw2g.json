Maybe they'll help for you:\n\n1. *Calm down.* Set a timer for one minute. Close your eyes, and focus on your breathing until the timer goes off. Just pay attention to the way the air feels coming in and out of your chest, how the lungs expand, how your nose and mouth and throat feel the air going through. You don't have to change your breathing, just spend one minute focusing on it. If your mind tries to wander, just bring it back to the sensation of breathing. (I keep telling myself I need to do this throughout the day even when I'm not in an anxious mood, but that hasn't happened yet, lol.)\n\n2. *Get out of your head.* Focusing on your surroundings may help break the inner monologue of negativity. Look around you at your surroundings. Find one thing that's red, two things that are orange, three things that are yellow, four things that are green (trees only count for one!), five things that are blue, and six things that are purple. Or go in reverse order. If you want to keep going, find as many things as you can smell, hear, feel, and taste.\n\nThese may help in the moment, but in the long term, if your depression and anxiety are significantly affecting your life, you should definitely seek professional help to manage your mental health. Using tricks like these without tackling the underlying causes of your depression and anxiety is like slapping a bandaid on a gaping wound.
