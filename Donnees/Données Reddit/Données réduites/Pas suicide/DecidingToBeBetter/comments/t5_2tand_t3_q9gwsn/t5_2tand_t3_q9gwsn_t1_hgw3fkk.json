If you are depressed and anxious- you need to talk to a Dr and look into counseling.  There is no \"snapping out\" of this. \n\nYou will find that everything is unpredictable- and it won't get better unless you see someone about it.  Set up an appointment soon. Dr's are booked sometimes a month (or more) ahead of time.  Also- if you can- request to be put on the list if they have any cancelations.  Good luck!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9gwsn/how_can_i_snap_out_of_it/hgw3fkk/"}
