It might just be a dark mood that saps your energy, or it might say, \"You're a loser. Nobody likes you.\"\n\nThat's NOT TRUE, so stand up to it! Say you *know* it's not true, it's just your secret inner bully telling you mean lies and you have the power to shut it up! Say some positive things about yourself instead. \n\nYou can look up Affirmations online and choose the ones that resonate with you.\n\nAlso please talk to your doctor about possibly talking an anti-depressant to help lift your mood. It can be something very mild and low-dose to help you get out of your slump.\n\nGet outside! Walk and exercise! Go to a park, look at the trees and flowers growing! It really does flood your brain with positive endorphins.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9gwsn/how_can_i_snap_out_of_it/hgvxiv4/"}
