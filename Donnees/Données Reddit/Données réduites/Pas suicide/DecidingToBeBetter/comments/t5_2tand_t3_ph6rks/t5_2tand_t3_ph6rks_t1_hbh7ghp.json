I love that movie Walter Mitty, more than I can actually justify since it's generally considered \"ok\". But I can identify with his character so much. When I watched it the first time, I had goosebumps throughout. I dream about all sorts of things that don't align with my real life, and I wonder every moment how I could get the courage to take the steps he did. It's like a switch that went off and he just realized what his quest really was. I want that, and that movie gives me hope.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ph6rks/what_is_your_walter_mitty/hbh7ghp/"}
