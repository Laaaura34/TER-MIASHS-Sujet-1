That kind of movie is my favorite genre. I don't know what the genre is, but quiet movies that don't involve a lot of dialogue or action and nothing happens but at the same time so much happens and they're generously and beautifully filmed. Little Forrest is also very special because the cast and crew met four times over the course of a year to film the movie as the seasons changed.    \n\n\nI think that is how life really is - we rarely ever have these monumental shifts and we emerge completely changed like a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis.  Most of our lives are made up of tiny changes we barely notice happening but when we look back we realize all those little changes added up to something big like a stone worn smooth over centuries.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ph6rks/what_is_your_walter_mitty/hbivwbp/"}
