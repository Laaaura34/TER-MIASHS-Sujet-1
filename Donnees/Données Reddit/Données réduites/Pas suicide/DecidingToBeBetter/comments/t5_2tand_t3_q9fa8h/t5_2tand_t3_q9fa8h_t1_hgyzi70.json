Don\u2019t let that guilt convince that you\u2019re a bad person. Selfishness isn\u2019t bad if it\u2019s you taking care of yourself and putting your own needs(which sounds like your emotional and mental health in this case) first. Contrary to what society might tell you, I truly believe selfishness(within common sense) is a good thing. You have to stand up for yourself when someone else is disrespecting, abusing, or doing anything that you feel violated by or it\u2019s practically inevitable the abuser will continue. I really hope you\u2019re able to see it from that perspective. You\u2019ll feel so much better about yourself when you don\u2019t put up with that shit! Not to mention be happier as a person and start to build more confidence in yourself in case a similar situation arises in the future.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9fa8h/am_i_a_coward_for_avoiding_someone_who_repeatedly/hgyzi70/"}
