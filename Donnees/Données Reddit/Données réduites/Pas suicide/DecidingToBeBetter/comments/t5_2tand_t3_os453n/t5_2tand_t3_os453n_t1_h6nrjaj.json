I'm a recovering addict, with alcohol being my drug of choice, and before I got sober my behavior would often get violent. It started small, yelling, maybe the occasional push, to full out punching my partner in the face. Anger definitely plays a role, but alcohol turns us into someone we don't recognize. This is all just from my personal experience, but I wish I would have quit drinking the first time I got violent, rather than letting the cycle continue.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/os453n/i_abused_him_and_i_feel_terrible/h6nrjaj/"}
