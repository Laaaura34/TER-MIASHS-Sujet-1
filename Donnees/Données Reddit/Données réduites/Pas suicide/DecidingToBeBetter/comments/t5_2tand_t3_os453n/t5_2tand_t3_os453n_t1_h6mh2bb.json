Some people live 60, 80 years and don't complete this step. You already have. \n\nStep two: Seek professional help. Emotional regulation for reactions of this scale is outside Reddit's paygrade. Look for a good therapist. You mentioned cheating as a \"trigger\", so I would suggest looking for a trauma-informed therapist, or a therapist who works with trauma clients. Therapist shopping is like doctor shopping (you have actual gems and you have faker sparkly rocks), so keep that in mind as well. \n\nGood luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/os453n/i_abused_him_and_i_feel_terrible/h6mh2bb/"}
