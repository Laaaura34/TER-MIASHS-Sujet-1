Everybody always tells me I think too much \u2014 and well I see you in me and I think you think too much! This was a learning experience for me, too, to see myself from the outside like this!\n\nI even did an online test that said I was a covert narc, and another that said I was a psychopath. But guess what, if I answered the questions from the perspective of what's the worst I can be I get high scores because I can be an asshole. But if I take the test in a stable, non depressive, non anxious mood I get average to below average scores.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mch6nv/think_im_a_covert_narcissist/gs4k87c/"}
