Meditation and mindfulness I would say helped the most. Having hope that it would get better one day. Believing in something, I know I have a soul. I was destroying it and it took me a while to piece it back together. I prayed a lot. I wouldn't say that I believe in the Christian God the way they talk about it, but I do believe there is a God, and we have a ball of beautiful light inside of us that deserves attention. I believe in karma, not the Reddit type. Although it is a nice touch. We need to try to do the right thing and be in touch with our inner self. Find what works for you. Find what reasons you have to get clean and keep focus on those things to build you up to knowing it is achievable and something you really want.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m8p3ud/being_sober_is_beautiful/grkzd9j/"}
