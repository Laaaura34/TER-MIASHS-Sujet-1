But i think the hardness of it was not methadone although it has its issues but  it seems its just a deeper issue that comes out whenever you're getting clean, all the reasons you started getting addicted just come back. Most people were not happy before methadone or addiction and they return to the same state of misery they were in before addiction started.\nIt sounds like a convenient way of pushing blame on X. X being the methadone, other drug or some \"doctors or the big pharma or life in general. And after the done there just appears other thing to put blame on. The done prevents many people from overdosing and using opioids. This alone saves lifes. I was spiraling to hell rapidly before done and became a scary version of myself i never thought could be me. I was already seeking ways to acquire heroin. I didn't care if i would die. \n\nSo for many people the hell they're going thru is still not as horrible as the alternative. Quiting done just made me see how personal and deep rooted the mental issues were and addiction was just a symptom. Methadone was just a symptom.  I desperately avoided self introspection and admitting blame because deep down i knew neither suboxone nor done nor other treatments or methods was at fault. My brain would just find another cause for all my mental and life problems", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m8p3ud/being_sober_is_beautiful/gru5i9f/"}
