Not just taking a pill, taking a hell of a lot as well. I should be dead. I understand the physicals but once that is gone you will deal with some mental I'm sure. Get help any way you can. Start tapering down your use and see if you can make it through the day without and only use once a day. Whether it be in the morning to get started or at night to relax try to get down to using once a day, then maybe skip days. I know this is a short story on what it really takes, but that story takes place over years of my life. Trying different methods to stop and failing and standing back up again to keep going. That's what it is about, never stop trying to get clean. Do what ever it takes to help yourself get better until you feel like you can beat it. I was an addict for 20 years and tried every type of opiate from oxycontin, opana, then injecting heroin. I started tapering back skipping days and then I could start seeing myself a little and the world around me and start working on myself. I had to change my phone number and stop associating with everyone in that life to get clean. It's a hard thing to do, but do what ever it takes and know it is probably one of the hardest things you will ever do. But stand up and face the challenge and be prepared to get around the obstacles to be free of that stuff. I'm telling you if I can do it, anyone can.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m8p3ud/being_sober_is_beautiful/grky64c/"}
