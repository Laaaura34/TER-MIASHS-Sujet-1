It's not about just stopping what ever your using but learning along the way and working through your problems to better yourself. If I can do it I know anyone can. I was on drugs for 20 years and all that came with it. I'm 35 and I wanted one more time in my life to be happy and be able to enjoy life the way I did before drugs. Find the you that you want to be and take aim and don't let anything stop you. Even on your worst days remember you are better than this, stand up, take a breath and keep trudging my friend. You can make it and it is so worth it to be free of all of that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m8p3ud/being_sober_is_beautiful/grlup0c/"}
