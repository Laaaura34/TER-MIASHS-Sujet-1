Paired with the obligatory \"I am the type of person who lives to please others\". Not buying it at all. You don't \"demand\" that your mum, husband, whoever, do anything. They're not obliged to help you whatsoever. Of course it would be shitty if they didn't, but it's not the legal entitlement you make it sound like. Maybe try \"asking\" them for help if you need it. And at the same time make yourself aware that even though you had a baby it does not mean that you're the only person who can be stressed, under pressure, etc.\n\nI know this came across quite harsh. In short: less \"They have to fulfil their duties!\" and more \"How can we best work this out together?\" Work with them. Not against them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fw5bad/how_do_i30f_change_myself/fmosoxz/"}
