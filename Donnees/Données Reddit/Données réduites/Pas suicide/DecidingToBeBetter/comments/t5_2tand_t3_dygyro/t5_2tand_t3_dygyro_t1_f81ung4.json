So should we be truthful and tell others how we actually feel or should we always lie to keep things 'positive'.  It's my experience that people ask as a matter of politeness or habit, but don't actually care what your answer is and care even less when the response is anything other than 'good'.  It's certainly easier to dismiss it with 'good'.  I also kinda resent the idea that we should always be positive, seems rather idealistic and unrealistic.  I think 'trying' to be positive in general is a good thing though..", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dygyro/i_am_a_chronic_complainer_and_it_affects_me_at/f81ung4/"}
