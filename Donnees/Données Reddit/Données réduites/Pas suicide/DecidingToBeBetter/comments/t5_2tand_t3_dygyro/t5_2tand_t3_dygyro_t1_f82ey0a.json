I as well grew up in a household where the main form of communication was through negativity and complaining, so have always known nothing else. I realized within the last couple years that people around me were beginning to not enjoy spending time with me because of this, but still couldn't find a way to change it. I've taken small steps since, but it seems in the moment I completely forget to try and go back into my old, unhealthy habits. Reading this comment really helped put things into perspective again for me, and give some real solutions to the issue!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dygyro/i_am_a_chronic_complainer_and_it_affects_me_at/f82ey0a/"}
