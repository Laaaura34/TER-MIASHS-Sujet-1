I used a rubber band. My experience was fleeting. The idea that you wear a band on one wrist then if y look u complain you move into the other wrist. Then start over the next day until you can go full days. \n\nI would recommend starting with hours instead of days. If I complain early on the morning then I switch the band and the whole day feels like I failed.  If I reset it at the next hour then I can get right back on track. Hours to days says to weeks and so on.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dygyro/i_am_a_chronic_complainer_and_it_affects_me_at/f82s570/"}
