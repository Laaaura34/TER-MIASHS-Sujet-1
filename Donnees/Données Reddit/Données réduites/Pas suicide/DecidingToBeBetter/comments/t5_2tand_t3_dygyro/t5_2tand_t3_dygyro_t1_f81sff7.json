I went to the local coffeeshop and it was busy-long line, lots of people waiting for their drinks, all the tables occupied. I\u2019m standing in line waiting my turn and this lady joins the line and stands behind me. She says out loud to no one in particular, \u201cWhat a beautiful morning! So many people here enjoying it.\u201d And I just thought about how she was seeing it as a happy social gathering of people who had a common interest-drinking coffee and meeting friends- and instead of complaining about the long line or how slow it was, she cheerfully added something to the mix. It reminds me that I get to choose how to perceive situations. Even if pessimism is automatic, I don\u2019t have to dwell in it. I can choose to be happy, and this gentle reminder from a random lady was really valuable.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dygyro/i_am_a_chronic_complainer_and_it_affects_me_at/f81sff7/"}
