I used to complain ALL THE TIME to my sister. I never really noticed until she brought it up that about 90% of my conversations with her were about my problems, and it started to hurt our relationship. But, I'm happy to say that over this past week I've complained to her only once. Not much has changed in our relationship (she's still kind of aloof and guarded) but I that after enough time we'll start to ease up around each other", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dygyro/i_am_a_chronic_complainer_and_it_affects_me_at/f8216o5/"}
