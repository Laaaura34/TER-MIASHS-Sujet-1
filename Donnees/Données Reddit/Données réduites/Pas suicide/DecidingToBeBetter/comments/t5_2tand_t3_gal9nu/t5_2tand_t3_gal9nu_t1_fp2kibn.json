I needed this. I graduated out of my first degree, Psychology, in 2015. Spent a couple of years applying to jobs to no avail (took on very demeaning retail jobs in the meanwhile). Went back to school to for a Computer Science degree. Just graduated December 2019, a bit before this COVID stuff started happening.\n\nI'm still looking for a job in my field, one that I'm proud to be in, and one that makes me happy to go to work. I'm still struggling, but I think I needed this. I was feeling low and struggling today, but this reassured me that having accomplished so little at 27 years of age doesn't mean I lost everything.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gal9nu/what_do_you_want_for_yourself/fp2kibn/"}
