I spent my 31st birthday in hospital. I have a solid mental health plan I\u2019ve worked out over the last week and I\u2019m trying naltrexone. I want to stay sober so I can succeed at my job I already know I\u2019m good at and enjoy. Drinking was beginning to affect that and so I told my boss I needed some annual leave time and checked myself in.\n\nFor ages I was a \u201cfunctioning addict\u201d but just a combination of stresses including having to move due to covid-19 and I sort of fell apart. \n\nFor anyone who thinks they are drinking too much my advice is speak to your doctor *before* it becomes an issue. It\u2019s easy to slip over that edge from enjoying a drink to it effecting those around you and that\u2019s what happened to me.\n\nI realise I need to find other coping mechanisms because I can\u2019t put my family and friends through watching me destroy myself. \n\nI also don\u2019t mean to preach, if you enjoy drinking and it\u2019s not hurting anyone than by all means continue.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gal9nu/what_do_you_want_for_yourself/fp1636f/"}
