Thank you so much!! I have saved it haha. \n\nThe Stephen King one almost made me cry tears of joy because I have been beating myself up for not writing a publishable novel in the 14 years I've endeavored to write consistently. 19 novels in and I am still disappointed with my quality. But I know I am great! And can be greater! Maybe I should just buck it up because my 24yr old brain has just been given the go ahead to continue writing crap with the joyous glee I had as a babe again. Thank you!!\n\nI will comment though, Kathryn Bigelow also made the original Point Break in 1991 and I believe that movie to be a much greater and wider success than Hurt Locker. I did love both movies btw! But Point Break is definitely my favorite of hers :) \n\nThough maybe it's just rose-colored nostalgia glasses because I do realize that Hurt Locker was HUGE and won many awards haha. But the phrase: \"Young, dumb, and full of cum.\" From Point Break 1991 is one of my mainstays haha!! And hearing Dr. Cox from Scrubs saying it was the best experience of dialogue when I was younger. I was nodding my head saying, \"Yes, yes we are, aren't we?\"", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gal9nu/what_do_you_want_for_yourself/fp1mi4u/"}
