I am now going to major in anthropology. I hate math I am horrible at it. I know everyone says if you just practice a little every day you can be good, but the work in my precalc class made me break down in tears multiple times. No doubt I COULD be good at it, but it so miserably boring for me and I couldn't even imagine having to do something with math in my career even if job prospects are more positive. I am an otherwise 4.0/4.0 gpa student. All other arts and science disciplines are relatively easy for me to grasp except math. I guess I had this idea that I could overcome my kryptonite and be better at the end of it, but more realistically I see myself marginally succeeding and very unhappy. Anthropology and sociology is my true passion, reading and learning it doesnt feel like work at all. Hope everything works out for you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gal9nu/what_do_you_want_for_yourself/fp30t60/"}
