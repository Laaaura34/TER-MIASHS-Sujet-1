I had a life crisis this weekend and broke out hives from stress. I got accepted into a good school in a highly practical STEM major that wasn't suitable for my personality that I only chose because of future career opportunities that are safer and more high earning but do not interest or excite me in the least. Changed my major to something I really love even though it isn't exactly known for fabulous career opportunities. I am 24 and only half way fone with my first undergrad degree. I am now officially stoked to continue my education.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gal9nu/what_do_you_want_for_yourself/fp0uih9/"}
