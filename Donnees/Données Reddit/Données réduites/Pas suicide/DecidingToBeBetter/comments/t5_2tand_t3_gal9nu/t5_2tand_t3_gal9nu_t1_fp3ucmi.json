You need a masters to become a librarian but it\u2019s always been my dream.\n\nI almost had to drop out of my bachelors right before graduation because of financial reasons. Luckily I found a program to pay for one of the degrees I was studying I was a year away from an English Literature and Art History double major but had to drop English Lit for the program I was in that paid for my bachelors. (It was the Starbucks College Achievement Program for anyone interested. They only pay for one degree though)\n\nFinancial reasons are also the reason I was unable to move forward and get my masters. I spoke with my fianc\u00e9 about it though and we both agree it\u2019s my goal. I\u2019ve always wanted it and he doesn\u2019t want me to give up my dreams. \n\nI know of a place that will pay for you to get your masters but it\u2019s hard to get a job there. I\u2019m still going to try and see what happens in the next year. Right now I\u2019m in a great job and love what I\u2019m doing so I\u2019m in no rush, but my long term goals will always be to become a librarian.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gal9nu/what_do_you_want_for_yourself/fp3ucmi/"}
