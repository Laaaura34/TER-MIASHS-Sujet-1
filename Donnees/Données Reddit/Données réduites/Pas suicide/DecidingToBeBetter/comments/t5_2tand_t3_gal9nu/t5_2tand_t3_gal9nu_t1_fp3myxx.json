However I enjoy working and I think at the very least I would have a part time job, maybe something in retail? For a bit of routine and social aspect. \n\nIf I do get to be a grandma, then I'd love to be able to care for my grandkids, pick them up from school etc and make life easier for my kids! Nursery fees are so high here in the UK, you break even most of the time, it's awful. \n\nOther than that, I dont know tbh! Just see where life takes me!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gal9nu/what_do_you_want_for_yourself/fp3myxx/"}
