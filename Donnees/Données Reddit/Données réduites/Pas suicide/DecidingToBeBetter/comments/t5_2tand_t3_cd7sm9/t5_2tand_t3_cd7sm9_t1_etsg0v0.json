There is no such thing as an inherent \"personality\" we all have. You seem so focused on your imagined faults, which isn't very beneficial to you. Life is simply a series of moments and you can reinvent yourself whenever you want. It is all about which actions you take, not what you think you are. Focus on your passions, take some risks and live more in the moment. Did your friend/date turn you down? Not a big deal! What is the worst that could happen? Just try again. Move on. Don't forget to do what YOU enjoy in life, because no matter what, we can never control what others think of us. So put yourself first.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cd7sm9/i_feel_purposelessemptyworthless_and_i_have_no/etsg0v0/"}
