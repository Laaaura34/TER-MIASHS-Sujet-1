But I do have one big tip for you for when you are talking to other people and feel like you have nothing to say: ask questions! You say you \"don't have anything,\" but what you can try to cultivate is a sense of curiosity about other people's lives (especially women, as you seem to think of them only in terms of how much attention they pay you and not in terms of being actual people). I think this will help turn your focus outward (instead of inward, where you're beating yourself up) in when talking to people and make you a much more considerate/adept conversationalist -- interested people are interesting!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's my 2 cents.
