Old habits die hard, but it\u2019s possible to totally shift. I still have so much to learn and I have some points where I\u2019m like \u201cbut I know this already WHY did i react AGAIN?\u201d but observing instead of judging is key. So I have to observe that I\u2019m judging those reactions too bc that\u2019s a reaction LOL! Isn\u2019t life cool? I love this journey. Even the hard and \u201cshitty\u201d parts.
