My father was invited by a friend and did not get sucked into it anymore than that single weekend, but learning that I am in charge of my emotions and can completely control the way I react was profound for someone at my age. I\u2019ve dealt with mental health issues throughout my life, but most of the time I can come back to the process of evaluating my circumstances and choosing how to feel about them. It has been really empowering to choose mindfulness over being reflexive for more than half my life. In all honesty, it has saved me from my darkest thoughts many times over.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i6arpr/once_you_realize_you_can_control_your_response/g0wp6vn/"}
