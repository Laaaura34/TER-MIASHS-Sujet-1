This is a big NLP presupposition - \u201cempowerment comes via responsibility\u201d. One of my favorites because I know how true it is in my own life. I\u2019ve heard of the book before, right now I\u2019m just reading fiction because I\u2019ve read about 200 books over past few years on these kinds of topics and I\u2019m working on the experiential learning since I\u2019ve done all the \u201creading\u201d learning i can do for a little bit LOL. Adding it to my book list though, heard great things!! Thanks so much for reading & sharing the info!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i6arpr/once_you_realize_you_can_control_your_response/g0vquug/"}
