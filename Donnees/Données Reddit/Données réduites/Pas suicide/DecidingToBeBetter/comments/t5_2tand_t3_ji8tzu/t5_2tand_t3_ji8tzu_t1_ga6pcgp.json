I prefer using the word \"toxic tendencies\"- because you aren't all bad! Once you start feeding the good in you- you will want to do more of that. I realized had a big ego earlier this year and had a tendency to manipulate certain situations. The best thing that helped me was:\n-learning the power of no - respecting people's answers\n-recognizing people's boundaries\n-keeping a journal and voicing all my emotions and opinions\n-running - a lot. This helped a lot with regulated my emotions - highly recommend\n- be mindful of the person you want to be and start showing up as them.\nBest of luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ji8tzu/ive_recently_realized_im_a_toxic_person_today/ga6pcgp/"}
