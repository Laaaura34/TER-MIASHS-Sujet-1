It's really hard for most people toxic or not to do that. The fact that you can accept responsibility for your actions, feel remorse, and want to do better proves that you are not a bad person, so do not forget this while you are working on yourself, especially when things get hard or when you are feeling shame or guilt.\n\nI recommend looking into Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. It helps with reshaping the way you think, feel, and act in response to stressful situations. This can be applied to many aspects of your life such as relationships, goals, trauma, anger management, or a variety of mental illnesses. If you have access to a therapist, they can help you with CBT in a guided/structured way. If not, self-directed CBT is also known to be really helpful. It has a lot to do with developing mindfulness, and I have also found it helpful to supplement CBT with readings or podcasts about Buddhism. I wouldnt call myself a buddhist but I do find the lessons and ideologies about mindfulness to be helpful in my everyday life and becoming more like the kind of person I want to be.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ji8tzu/ive_recently_realized_im_a_toxic_person_today/ga598u6/"}
