Not that you shouldn't try to make people you care for happy, but it shouldn't be the end goal. It's like on a plane where they say in case of air pressure drop you should first put your own mask on, then help others. First you need to take care of yourself, find confidence and balance, then you can take care of others too.\n\nWhen we try to shift blame it's because we feel that it's so awful to be wrong, unacceptable, so we try to not be wrong or not admit it. But everybody is allowed to be wrong. I think maybe OP needs to accept that they were wrong and that it's something that happens to everyone. Nobody's perfect, but we should strive to improve ourselves.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ji8tzu/ive_recently_realized_im_a_toxic_person_today/ga5a95w/"}
