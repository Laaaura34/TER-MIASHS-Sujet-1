Guilt and shame is just another tool people use to control.. or self-control.\n\nLike drug addiction, you are trading one crutch for another.  Without the ability to cope with this one.\n\nHonesty, brutal honesty will set you free.  If you are feeling guilty, you have not let go. \n\n**Honesty is beautiful man.  It, gives you conviction. Theres no guilt, and you cant be shamed. You accept what you have done AND do better from then on. (not live in the past, or guilt yourself into servitude)  BE that better person and those around you will benefit.**", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ji8tzu/ive_recently_realized_im_a_toxic_person_today/ga5qyd9/"}
