I'm also a recently reformed \"toxic\" person, and I'll vouch that getting in to see someone is a strong first step. I also recommend meditation, which helps you to look at yourself without judgement (a skill people who act \"toxically\" like myself usually lack).\n\nI am also biased towards recovery groups, so I need to mention that it might be helpful to look into the issue of codependency. Without knowing the specifics of your situation I'll say that a ton of relationship issues fall under the broad category of \"codepency\", and there are recovery groups tailored to it.\n\nLastly, as people have already said, find out the why and forget it. Forgive yourself. It's truly the hardest step on the list.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ji8tzu/ive_recently_realized_im_a_toxic_person_today/ga5d1bk/"}
