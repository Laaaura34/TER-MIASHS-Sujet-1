She cheated on me with an ex. I found out, tried to move forward, but by the end I was so manipulated I didn't break up with her even after she told me I wasn't allowed in her place because HE was there and they were spending the night. I left a career because I thought the distance of my job from my hometown was hurting my chance at having a happy relationship (I was working 4 weeks on and 2 weeks off, in a town 7 hrs away). \n\nThis was 3 years ago and the pain still resonates. I loved that women so much. It has affected my ability to trust partners and that has ultimately left me unable to open up enough to make deep meaningful connections. \n\nI've hurt people since then because of my inability to be vulnerable. I've hurt women that cared deeply for me that I carried no emotions for, even though I wanted to.\n\nGo to therapy. Read The Psycbopath Test by Jon Ronson. I hoped that when I finally broke it off for good, that she learned a lesson and the next person she dated wouldn't have it as hard as me. I dont if it worked or not.\n\nBe better.
