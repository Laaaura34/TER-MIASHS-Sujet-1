Most people wouldn\u2019t let go of their ego and their own selfish self. You\u2019re already on a good path. It takes a lot, and I mean A LOT to admit that you are the toxic person and decide to do something about it. \n\n Since you have realized that, my advice would be to not hold on to your guilts, do not punish yourself in any way, like telling yourself that you\u2019re not worth anything or anyone, take your time but in the end forgive yourself but don\u2019t forget what happened. You need to remember what happened to know that this is not the path you want to dwell into anymore. \n\nAnd finally start loving yourself. After all the process you will go through it may be tough but you need to love yourself again", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ji8tzu/ive_recently_realized_im_a_toxic_person_today/ga5go6n/"}
