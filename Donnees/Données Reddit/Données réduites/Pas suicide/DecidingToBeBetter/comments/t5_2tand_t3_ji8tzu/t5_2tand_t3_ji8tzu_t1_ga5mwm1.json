I was pretty shitty to a lot of people, had people be shitty to me. These guided me on what I think was a good direction.\n\nEmotional toolkit - https://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Toolkit-Seven-Power-Skills-Feelings/dp/031231888X\n\nPower of intention. My main point is how to help own your past actions and move into future ones with purpose in mind. https://www.amazon.com/Power-Intention-Dr-Wayne-Dyer/dp/1401902162\n\nI hate you don't leave me is about behavior disorder but it helped me understand others and the extremes that are experienced. \n\nThere's also a book on the 7 steps of grief I can't find. But there's a bunch out there. You have a change in awareness about yourself and your life and your impact on others. Wouldn't hurt to check one of those out. Feel free to pm cuz I was a huge dick, but 15 years later I'd say I'm a success.
