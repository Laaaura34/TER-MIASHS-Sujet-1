Sounds simple, but you need to remember all the time.\nFor example\n\n Cancelling a meeting with a friend because another person asked you to do something better: No, that's mean.\n\n Manipulating a person to do something for you. No that egoistic and mayve they would have helped you anyway because they like you. \n\nDrink way too much, than you kniw you should at another persons place because you don't need to clean up the mess anyway. No you also don't want to clean the puke of someone else off your floor.\n\nStuff like that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ji8tzu/ive_recently_realized_im_a_toxic_person_today/ga5f3xr/"}
