I've been fighting this too, not sure what's the name, but sometimes i kinda feel like i don't want to do anything, although it's not like I'm tired or anything like that and it goes by days, until I realize that I'm wasting my time and feel like I'm just getting distracted while death comes closer each day. After feeling that bad, I feel an urge to be productive, achieve something, and I stay like that for like 5,6 days, and the cycle restarts... Don't have a solution for you, but I'd like to let you know that I've been worse and I'm improving everyday, so don't lose hope and, again, good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3kzn75/21_years_old_spending_too_much_time_on_my/cv3158t/"}
