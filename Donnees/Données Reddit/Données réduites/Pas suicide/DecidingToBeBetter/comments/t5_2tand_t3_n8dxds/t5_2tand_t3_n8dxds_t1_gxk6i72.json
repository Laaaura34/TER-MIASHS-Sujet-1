Just to let you know. I too am a recovered addict. Heroin. I have been sober for years and I did NA. The biggest take I got from NA was spirituality. Get your spirit right, then your mental and physical will follow. Living spirituality gives you an inner glow and it speeds up. Seek and you will find. It will never fail you.   And spirituality is so personal any direction you start in will lead you to love, light and truth!!! And it is really all you need! Heal yourself. Never ever go back you are worth so much more than drugs!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8dxds/yesterday_morning_my_body_turned_cold_from_a/gxk6i72/"}
