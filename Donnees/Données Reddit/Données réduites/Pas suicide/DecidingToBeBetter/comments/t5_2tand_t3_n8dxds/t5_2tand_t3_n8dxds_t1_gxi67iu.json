That is very scary...thank god for narcan (and your friend who initially administered it).\n\nI attempted suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills a couple months ago...my SO took me to the ER and I was transferred to a locked unit. The whole ordeal was over in about 24 hours (mainly because I begged them to discharge me and promised I would follow up with any referrals/recommendations), but it was also very scary, and a huge wake up call for me that I need to get a handle on all of my mental health/substance use issues. Two days ago I began my journey in a depression-focused partial hospitalization program, and I'm scared to really confront my issues head-on and be held accountable, but also kind of excited.\n\nLet's both begin this new chapter with the goal of thriving and not simply surviving. I see hope for both of us. Glad to hear you're committing to NA and therapy!
