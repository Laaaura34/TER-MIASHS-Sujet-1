Thanks for explaining it to me in more detail! At university I get into the habit of binging when I'm bored and I don't get enough sunshine so I reckon this will be really useful for me! I've been on and off using habit tracking apps but it's not really working for me so I feel this simple journal will really simplify things and ensure I take care of myself and don't feel awful if I don't stick 100% to habits like going outside etc. Have a great morning/evening wherever you are! Sending positivity to you too!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p3ykeg/honestly_just_a_fantastic_week/h8w2v9a/"}
