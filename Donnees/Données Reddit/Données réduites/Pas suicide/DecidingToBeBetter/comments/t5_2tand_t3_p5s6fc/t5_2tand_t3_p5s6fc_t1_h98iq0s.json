I'm and adult and I spend  waaaaay too much time on my phone. \n\nTwo things helped me: \n\nStart watching productivity things on YouTube (like Matt D'Avella). You are aware you like getting lost in YT rabbit holes so lean into it but make a concerted effort to only watch content of value that pertains to your current goal.  I found they will inspire me to do whatever they're doing. E.g. When I was job hunting, I watched videos on job hunting.\n\nMake the internet a reward. After I complete a task, I will reward myself with 10 minutes of whatever the fuck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5s6fc/im_fucked_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/h98iq0s/"}
