I have an identical twin. Sometimes it's hard to find your own friends when you hang out with your twin and his friends a lot. He always seemed to have a knack for social situations moreso than I do. I struggle with finding friends too now that we've moved away from eachother. Been pretty lonely the past year. I went on a tinder date yesterday and he kept asking me about my friends and I was like \"ehhhhhhhh I don't have that many \ud83d\ude43\" lol. I think he was turned off by it too. \n\nI think it would be good for us to find random clubs to join and then go from there. That's my plan at least. Even if I'm not super interested in the club content I'm interested in the people I guess.\n\nGood luck!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oqn3z5/33m_finally_feel_financially_secure_enough_no/h6f4obk/"}
