You should be proud of that.\n\nOkay, so in order to figure out the solution, you have to know yourself very well. This means taking the time to understand fully well what stops you from progressing. But you should also question WHY it happens too. It\u2019s true you have reasons that caused these issues for you but in order to move forward, you can\u2019t stick to the same reason. Childhood and past trauma can be very rough so you could make peace with what happened and realise that it wasn\u2019t your fault. Once you realise that, you mustn\u2019t use your past as a excuse anymore because it will only hold you back. \n\nWhen it comes to the disapproval, validation and what not, you could ask yourself: \u201cwhat will happen to me if I get hateful comment or if I received disapproval?\u201d. Asking yourself questions is the first steps. \nIt is important to talk to someone so it is very good the fact that you have spoken about your issue and decided to move forward. No-one knows you 100% but yourself. In order to have a firm belief, you must come to make peace with your past and start telling yourself \u201cI am worthy of love and I am a independent woman who\u2019s opinion is important\u201d. Even if you end up being selfish, you must maintain a good sense of identity. \n\nFrom reading your post, you\u2019ve already display a courage of strength and bravery of that of a independent woman. I am personally happy that you come forward and share it with other people.\n\nIn the end, wear your identity as a armour so it wouldn\u2019t be used against you. If you believe you are the woman you want to be, keep constantly telling yourself and that way, you will have firm beliefs and conviction in whenever you do.\n\nMessage me if you\u2019d like and I be more than glad to spare a mind \ud83d\ude42", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h8sdcs/my_social_anxiety_is_so_bad_if_ever_i_make_a_post/fusppen/"}
