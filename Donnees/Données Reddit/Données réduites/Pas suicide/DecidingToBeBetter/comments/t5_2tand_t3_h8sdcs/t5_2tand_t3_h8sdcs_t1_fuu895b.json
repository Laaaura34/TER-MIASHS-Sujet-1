Honestly, it\u2019s a lifelong struggle because sometimes when life gets hard it\u2019s easy to revert back to that scared little kid. I\u2019ve greatly improved and these things helped me: First, start small. Just break out of your comfort zone a tiny little bit. Don\u2019t worry about confrontation just yet. If commenting makes you nervous go on something like r/aww and comment that someone\u2019s kitten is so cute. That\u2019s nothing for anyone to get offended by and you\u2019ll get used to stating your opinion. Next, build up with small requests of people. Is your roommate listening to music too loud? Just very politely say hey, did you mind turning that down just a bit? Or if your take out is wrong nicely ask that it be made correctly. These are very difficult things to do when you feel so nervous to speak up. But remember, you\u2019re asking nicely and it\u2019s a small request. You\u2019re as valuable as anyone else and if someone would give you an attitude, it\u2019s not you.\nOne more thing and I\u2019ll leave you alone: if someone does something that upsets you or if someone confronts you and you get anxious/are not sure what to say, remember it\u2019s always okay, if possible, to stop the situation, take some time to organize your thoughts and get back to the person. Nothing wrong with saying \u201cHey, something happened a few days ago that I need to talk to you about.... or \u201c I really want to discuss this with you but I can\u2019t right now, let\u2019s talk again on... Remember this takes time and  practice. Don\u2019t be hard on yourself because even if you were the most confident person in the world, people will sometimes react badly to you because of their own issues that have nothing to do with you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h8sdcs/my_social_anxiety_is_so_bad_if_ever_i_make_a_post/fuu895b/"}
