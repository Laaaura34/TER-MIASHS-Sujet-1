I think your getting to the crux of it when you talk about knowing yourself well.  \n\nJust to add to that, I think it's important to learn to love yourself, accept yourself - just like Mr. Rogers used to say, right? Smart guy.  Once you are comfortable in your own skin, then you won't need the acceptance of strangers at all times, and so when any jerks chime in to say something mean (usually because of their own issues) it won't rattle you too much. It might still stress you temporarily, but you'll be able to read it, and let it go. It will pass. \n\nSo, to circle back, know yourself. Be proud of who you really are, and allow yourself to be flawed - we all are. It's okay.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h8sdcs/my_social_anxiety_is_so_bad_if_ever_i_make_a_post/fuun8cj/"}
