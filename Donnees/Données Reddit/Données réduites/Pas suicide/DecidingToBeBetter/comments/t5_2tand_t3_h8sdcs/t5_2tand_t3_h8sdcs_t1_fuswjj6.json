It sucks but they are still important. To boil this down, you need to have conflicts to have your own personality, to stand for yourself. If you are just condescending people will abuse you because they know you won't do shit about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know 2 people like that, and one of them is very close to me. Needless to say, some situations that have been happening make me very angry but ultimately i can't do anything about it because it's not really up to me. The best you can do is expose yourself: expose yourself online first. Debate, stand for your beliefs and then try to do the same IRL with your friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWithout it you wont \"matter\". People won't take you seriously. Have you ever been listening to the radio or watching tv and seeing high society people say completely stupid shit and still holding ground after they've been proven opposite.  If they do it why can't you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGet out here, good luck and fuck you, bitch", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h8sdcs/my_social_anxiety_is_so_bad_if_ever_i_make_a_post/fuswjj6/"}
