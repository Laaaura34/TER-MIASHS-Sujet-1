World is filled with competition and you are just another human being who needs to compete with others.\nWorld is not a utopian program which gets executed perfectly. It is filled with random programs interfering with each other and also competing endlessly.\n\nYou make this world a better place with your goodness by doing your bit. But being good is useless without having the power of goodness in you. Your goodness is shielded by your strength of mind. Real strength comes with being detached and accepting the reality of our environment.\n\nSo people are attacking you on internet? In what way are they causing you any real life damage with verbal insults? Realize that their insults are not meant to be digested and ruminated upon. Their insults are meant to be either ignored or replied in kind. Meaningful words are meant to be digested and not every garbage.\n\nBe witty and savage in your replies. Learn how to kick ass with words and be creative. Treat it as fun and not a horror movie scenario. Your job is to insult and not feel insulted. Remember... The world won't end with people insulting you and it won't get affected in the least... So should you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h8sdcs/my_social_anxiety_is_so_bad_if_ever_i_make_a_post/fuvsfni/"}
