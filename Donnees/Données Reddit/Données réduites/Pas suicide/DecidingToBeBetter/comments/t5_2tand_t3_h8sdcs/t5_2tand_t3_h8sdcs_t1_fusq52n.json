It sounds petty, but this is a controlled environment where you get to decide who can and cannot speak to you, and life is too short to deal with people who are only after a fight. If you\u2019re not feeling capable of dealing with them, don\u2019t, it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to just block them and put an end to the unpleasantness without worrying that they\u2019re going to keep coming back. No one wins any prizes for winning arguments on here, but I imagine plenty of people get stressed about someone calling them a retard for seeing things differently, so on a personal level it\u2019s really worth cutting those people out and making your Reddit experience as pleasant as possible.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h8sdcs/my_social_anxiety_is_so_bad_if_ever_i_make_a_post/fusq52n/"}
