I\u2019m proud of you for being brave enough to make such a long post. If it helps you to know, I kind of struggle with that too. I\u2019ll type up this comment and just never post it afraid of the backlash my opinion might receive. Way to go bud. \n\nSecondly, I combated my social anxiety type stuff by complimenting strangers. If I had seen something about someone that I liked, I would just tell them. It was hard and I didn\u2019t always do it.. but it did help when I did do it. Now I feel like I can talk to people, at least face to face, a lot easier. \n\nBest of luck to you Miss. You\u2019re braver, tougher and wiser than you think. Keep it up, and remember some people will always suck.. that\u2019s not your fault or responsibility.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h8sdcs/my_social_anxiety_is_so_bad_if_ever_i_make_a_post/fusy6t9/"}
