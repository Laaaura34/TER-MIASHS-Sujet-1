Can you try and separate yourself from it a little? In terms of looking at if objectively. Like, it\u2019s not *your* social anxiety, try to not define yourself that way but rather, sometimes I feel anxiety, here are some things I can do to alleviate this weight I carry on my shoulders, etc. \n\nI took this meditation course back in the day and one thing I took away with me was this: you should not say \u201cI am depressed\u201d because then that\u2019s how you define yourself. But if you say sometimes I feel depressed, that\u2019s okay. Your post reminded me of this. Whatever my comment is worth, I hope it allows you to create a new perspective about the anxiety you experience sometimes.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h8sdcs/my_social_anxiety_is_so_bad_if_ever_i_make_a_post/futjsck/"}
