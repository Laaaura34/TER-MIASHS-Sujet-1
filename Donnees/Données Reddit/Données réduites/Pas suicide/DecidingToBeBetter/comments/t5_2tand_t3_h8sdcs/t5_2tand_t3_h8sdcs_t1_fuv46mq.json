I figured if I don\u2019t take steps in the right direction now, I\u2019ll never be the person I wanted to be. \n\nAs for being a constant people pleaser: I think that what I figured out was not making everyone happy was a direct reflection of my ego. It was all about \u201cwhat will they think of me? Are they mad? Will they think I\u2019m lazy? Stupid? Do they like me?\u201d And the answer to all of those questions is who fucking cares. The world won\u2019t end. The sun will keep coming up. And just like all other moments, this one will pass as well. If you\u2019re worried about being a good person, do what a good person would do. Not what other people will think about. Hope things get better for you friend. I really do! Grab your life by the balls and beat that brain into submission! \u201cI am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul.\u201d", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h8sdcs/my_social_anxiety_is_so_bad_if_ever_i_make_a_post/fuv46mq/"}
