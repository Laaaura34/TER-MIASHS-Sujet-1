Youre a kind person but you seem too pleasing. Live your life for YOU. Don't get anxiety FOR other people. You can't do anything to change life, just your outlook. Reaching out for help is the best thing you could've done. I'm 29 and I used to be like you but now I honestly don't give a fuck what anyone thinks about me or what I have to say. If I have to stand up for myself which I do and I'll admit I stand up for other people more than I should i always tell myself that no one can realistically DIE from a confrontation or a difference in opinion. That's what we all fear, right??? Youre going to be fine. Stop thinkijg you owe anyone a damn thing esp as small as an upvote or a reply. Just life your life and be happy! \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h8sdcs/my_social_anxiety_is_so_bad_if_ever_i_make_a_post/fuuqmwu/"}
