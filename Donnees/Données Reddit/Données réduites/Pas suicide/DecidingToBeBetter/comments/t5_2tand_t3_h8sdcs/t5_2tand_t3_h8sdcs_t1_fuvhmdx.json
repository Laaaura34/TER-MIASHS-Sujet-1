Aside from the good merit of this commenters message, starting a response with an emphatic belittlement, though sarcastic, is very not helpful and likely a way-too-big a nervous-system trigger for the OP. To me, direct words of advice are so much more 2 dimensional and significantly easier to misinterpret when in an anonymous typed comment versus face to face in  an ideally chill, safe-feeling environment.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h8sdcs/my_social_anxiety_is_so_bad_if_ever_i_make_a_post/fuvhmdx/"}
