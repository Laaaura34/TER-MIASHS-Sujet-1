Social anxiety is a real thing. Finding a welcoming community will help your confidence. I used marijuana to help me understand and work through past pain in a more calming and trusting manner. I also found that I was really judgmental of others (even if I didn\u2019t say it out loud) letting go of my own judgment of others helped me realize that we are all just humans trying to have the best lives we can. For some people it makes them feel good to make others feel bad. You don\u2019t need to make space in your brain for those kinds of people. \n\nWhenever I\u2019m feeling really bad about the judgement of other people I try to remember this quote by Dita Von Teese \u201cYou can be the ripest, juiciest peach in the world, and there's still going to be somebody who hates peaches\u201d", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h8sdcs/my_social_anxiety_is_so_bad_if_ever_i_make_a_post/fut13o2/"}
