I don\u2019t know if the taper made it easier or my mentality changed but this is really not as bad. It\u2019s only been maybe 36-48 hrs so maybe it gets worse? \nThe last time I could barely do anything, I was throwing up all over the place and couldn\u2019t keep food down to hold my life.\n\nIt\u2019s also really hard to measure our dosages from these street bars, some are hot and some aren\u2019t. I was debating taking my night dose to alleviate some symptoms but I think I can get through this and if anything I always have a bar laying around somewhere. \n\nDoes this sound like a good jump off point to you?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hjpjtu/my_last_dose_of_xanax/fwos7ua/"}
