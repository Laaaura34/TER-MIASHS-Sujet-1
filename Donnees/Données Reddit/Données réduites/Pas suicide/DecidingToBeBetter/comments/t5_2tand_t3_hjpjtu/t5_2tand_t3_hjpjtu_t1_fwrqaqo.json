I\u2019ve heard of it helping with Benzo WDs but if a few sips of coffee made me jittery i can\u2019t imagine what Kratom might do to me.\n\nAre you taking any at all or stopped completely? When you say f-lam do you mean Flubromazolam? I heard that\u2019s extremely strong, I\u2019ve only ever shortly done alprazolam, long term flualprazolam with a sparkle of clonazolam, I got hooked on alp, then couldn\u2019t affect 7-10 dollars a pill so found cheap bars that turned out to be flualp, bought a vial of clonazolam which I quickly found out was sedating as a MFer and super easy to black out on because I drank a lot around this time. Wasn\u2019t a good combination, safe to say I stuck to the flualp 2-4 mg bars rather then continue to fuck up my life haha.\n\nI have no idea but hopefully something dark and painful, something that wrenches the emotions out of me into something I can be proud of. \n\nHopefully it inspires a body of work instead of just a single piece. I really feel stronger for going through this, mentally at least (sometimes ((maybe)), now just have to work on the physical side because I realize I became a skeleton over the past year after putting on a well needed 10-15lbs.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hjpjtu/my_last_dose_of_xanax/fwrqaqo/"}
