I should have faced them a long time ago but I chose the sweet bliss of ignorance. Not anymore. When I broke up with my ex I felt a huge wave of relief hit me and I\u2019ve been able to meditate through  reverse anxiety.\n\nDid you taper before you jumped? \nDay one was... different. A lot of forcing myself to do things I usually did just fine but I know that\u2019s the anxiety and the stutter-step from the withdrawals.\n\nFully aware withdrawals can kill me, tried to cold turkey after a bad night off the 2-4mg a day habit and my lord I have never experienced so much pain and stress. I could barely walk, my legs were stiff as boards and when they did move it wasn\u2019t by choice, my neck twitched like I had a condition and I just overall felt like a crackhead.\n\nThen I found the Ashton Manual and some days were good and I stuck to it and other days were bad but not 2-4mg binge bad because my tolerance was so low even a slight increase made me super loopy and I loved the stess relief of Xanax but I hated the slurring and the loopyness, I was completely lucid off my 2-4mg (or how lucid one can be!).\n\nAnd thank you, I will definitely reach out if I need any help.\n\nI\u2019m not going back!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hjpjtu/my_last_dose_of_xanax/fwosst8/"}
