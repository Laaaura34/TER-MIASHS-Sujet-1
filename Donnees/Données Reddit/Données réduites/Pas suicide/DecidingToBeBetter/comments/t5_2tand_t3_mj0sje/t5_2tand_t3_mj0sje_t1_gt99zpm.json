I\u2019m 7 months sober, and I\u2019m also working on a bunch of other personality/behavioral issues, and constant positive reinforcement is vital.  It\u2019s as if 24/7 I\u2019m building a LEGO house, and every minute somebody comes and takes a few pieces of it.  If I stop working on that house for even a day - it will be GONE.  So I have to be constantly diligent about reinforcing myself with positivity, or everything I\u2019ve worked on just vanishes.  \n\nOn a related note:  have you watched the documentary \u201cHappy\u201d?  It\u2019s on various streaming services, and I think it\u2019s free on Tubi  right now.  I HIGHLY recommend it.   It\u2019s all about the science of happiness, what really makes people happy vs what people SAY makes them happy, the hedonic treadmill, etc.  it\u2019s very in line with what you describe in your original post.  I think you\u2019ll dig it!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mj0sje/i_underwent_ego_death_without_even_knowing_what/gt99zpm/"}
