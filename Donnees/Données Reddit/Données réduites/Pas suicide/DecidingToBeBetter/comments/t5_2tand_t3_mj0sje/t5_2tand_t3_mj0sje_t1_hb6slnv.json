Monks do this by watching their breath, if you imagine the analytical brain (often referred to as the monkey mind) as an excited puppy that chases thoughts and drops them in your lap, then meditation is like throwing a ball for the puppy to chase (counting breaths, focusing on the breath) while you try to observe a mysterious force sitting in the chair next to you. The puppy will chase the force away if you stop throwing the ball or if you turn your head and face it directly, so you can only observe it through your peripheral unless you are a very advanced meditator or using high doses of psychedelics. A monk can essentially make the puppy go to sleep and then observe the \"awareness\" uninterrupted. Psilocybin acts like a tranquilizer dart on the puppy, which puts him out of commission for \\~30min (depending on how strong the tranquilizer was) and allows you to do what the monk can do naturally. The result is called \"ego death\" and the concept of being you, as a mammal, as a human, as a person will dissolve completely and you will feel the magnitude of the spirit. The term \"I\" will become as abstract to you as my description of ego death. And, no, ego death is not permanent, otherwise you would be in a coma or dead since you really can't function as a human without the analytical portion firing on at least a few cylinders.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mj0sje/i_underwent_ego_death_without_even_knowing_what/hb6slnv/"}
