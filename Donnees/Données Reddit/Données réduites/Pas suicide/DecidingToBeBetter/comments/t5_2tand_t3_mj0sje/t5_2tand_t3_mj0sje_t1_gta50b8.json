Nice! I went through a similar experience and it\u2019s definitely night and day compared to the old way of living.\n\nIf you\u2019re open to any more book suggestions I highly recommend \u201cthe power of now\u201d and \u201ca new earth\u201d by Eckhart Tolle. He also has a lot of free content on YouTube. \u201cThe four agreements\u201d by Don Miguel Ruiz and \u201cthe untethered soul\u201d by Michael Singer are also very good. All of these helped me understand and deepen the freedom that I experienced. Congrats and best of luck to you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mj0sje/i_underwent_ego_death_without_even_knowing_what/gta50b8/"}
