Sorry. My father had the proper medical training before taking psychadelics. He did not misuse them. You should not make assumptions that the people I know misused them. When I was younger (and his brain was still awesome) he asked me to let him know before I tried any drugs and he would tell me all the pros and cons about them. Then he would also let me try them in a safe place depending on wht they were.\n\nIt is now 40 years later and he (and our family) know what his drug experimentation has done to his brain.\n\nHowever, I also know that if there is a chance for a psychadelic drug to help someone then they should become educated and possibly try it.\n\nBut someone randomly saying \"Hey you can skip all this existential pain and growth you lived through by taking some psychedelics\" was off the cuff positive.\n\nSo, I added a cautionary tale to endure anyone reading it would do as you suggested... do the research. Find out if it is right for them.\n\nI also know someone who was diagnosed last year with schizophrenia. They did drugs (without the research beforehand) and it has exacerbated their condition.\n\nEveryone just please be careful. Beneficial or not... it is your brain. It doesn't always \"change for the good\".\n\nThank you for the dialog. The more info people have, the better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mj0sje/i_underwent_ego_death_without_even_knowing_what/gtcf8po/"}
