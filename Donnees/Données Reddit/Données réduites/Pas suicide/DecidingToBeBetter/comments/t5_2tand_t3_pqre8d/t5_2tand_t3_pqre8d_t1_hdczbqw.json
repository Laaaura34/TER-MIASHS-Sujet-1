Passions are things you do whenever you want to, while work is what you do to support yourself. I don't necessarily agree with it, but it does make sense for some people.\n\nPersonally, I found it helpful to look at different subjects outside of my passion as 'tools' to channel it. Two years of CS courses and projects probably equips you with the skills needed to create projects in other disciplines. For instance, creating services or pipelines in other industries that either benefit logistical efficiency or empower consumers. In that sense, CS is a really flexible degree and even if you might need to grind it out (especially ds and algs), you could try taking more courses outside of CS that you're actually interested in, whenever possible. That way, you can find its applications and hopefully find entry points into other industries you're keen on after graduating \ud83d\udc4d", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pqre8d/21_and_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_life/hdczbqw/"}
