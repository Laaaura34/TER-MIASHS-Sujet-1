To be honest, I am quite worried what others will think, especially when they are so far ahead of me, but I am most scared of not finding a job that will allow me to live on my own and one that will make me not hate it. I am going to take some career quizzes, like you suggested because that sounds like a good idea and will most definitely apply to some jobs, maybe not now, but as soon as I can get my shit together lol. Thank you for your wise advice!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pqre8d/21_and_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_life/hdgpz3y/"}
