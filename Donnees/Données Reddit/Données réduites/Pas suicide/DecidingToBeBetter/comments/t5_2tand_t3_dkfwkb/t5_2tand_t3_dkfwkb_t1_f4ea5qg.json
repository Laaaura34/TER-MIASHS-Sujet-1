I had the same issue and got no help from the endless people mimicking the useless (however well intentioned) advice in that comment.\n\nSome people just aren't made for the normal route, most of the people like us turn to freelancing and try to become masters at a certain passion until it can become their career, by whatever means necessary. Your 20's wont be fun and your friends and family will probably judge, or possibly distance themselves from you. Hopefully you can turn that into motivation, personally I use long distance running to get my thoughts and priorities in order.\n\nAlso it takes a while to accept that people like the ones replying to your post here aren't right and you're not just an incapable loser. Just like we don't have the same minds as them, the reverse is true and just like we can't understand how to live that life, they can't understand our perspective either. I find people often blindly repeat some shit their dad's told them in a smug stereotypical \"man's man\" type of way.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dkfwkb/help_im_terrified_to_get_a_job_im_almost_21_i/f4ea5qg/"}
