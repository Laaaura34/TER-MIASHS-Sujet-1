Don't take shit from others. If you don't like what's going on -- do something about it. Don't just give up. Instead, make a plan, and execute the plan. That plan might be \"I'll tell my boss *X*, and if I don't get a 'yes', I'll quit\" or \"I'll tell Adam that his behavior hurts me, and if he scoffs it off, I'll tell my manager we have an unsafe psychological workplace and that the union might want to hear about that.\" Prepare with a plan, so you know where your limits are before going into meetings/discussions/conflicts. This will be easier and easier as you practice it.\n\nIf you feel those younger than you didn't deserve having more power, claim that power for yourself. Show them that respecting you and your way leads to a better workplace. Explain *why* you want them to change, *then* how. Tell your boss you mentored those who needed. Make her respect you.\n\nIn essence, you're a blank slate, and you need to build your brand. Ages 18-25 profoundly changed who I am. I was shy, and while I could appreciate company, I don't seek out company. That changed, seeing that relationships is what life and business is all about. And relationships build on respect and mutual appreciation of each others presence. I'm still not a very social person, but I found a style I respect.\n\nRead the book \"How to make friends and influence people\" by Dale Carnegie. It's a great introduction to communicating and relationship building. Not one of those \"fix your life in 1 minute\", but one that changes your way of thinking -- if you let it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dkfwkb/help_im_terrified_to_get_a_job_im_almost_21_i/f4ept15/"}
