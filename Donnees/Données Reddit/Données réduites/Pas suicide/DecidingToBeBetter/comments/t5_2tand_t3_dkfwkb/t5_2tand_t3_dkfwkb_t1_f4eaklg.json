I would say step one is get to a doctor and try out some medication. You would be surprised what just a year of an SSRI can do. Step two would be to think about what you want to do and research how to move in that direction. While you are researching I would look for work in something that doesn\u2019t require you to be talking to people all day. Social interaction can be draining when you have anxiety. I worked at a golf course for a few years and while the pay wasn\u2019t great the people were super nice and I chilled mowing lawns and doing manual labor. Then save as much as you can so you can figure out what you want to do. At 21 you have tons of time. So just focus on getting comfortable in the workplace.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dkfwkb/help_im_terrified_to_get_a_job_im_almost_21_i/f4eaklg/"}
