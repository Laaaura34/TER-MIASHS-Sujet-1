I'd have panic attacks even thinking about my CV. So here's what I did: I wrote a list of everything I NEED from a job in order to work with my mental illness. For me, that meant accepting that full time work is too much for me, that I wasn't ready to move away from friends and family, and that I'd need a job that makes me feel like I'm making a real difference to somebody. Those were my terms and I only applied for jobs that met them. Applying was horrible. I could basically only apply for one a day, but hey, that's still better than nothing. And lastly, I had to separate being afraid from being frozen. You know the whole fight or flight response thing? Basically, I'd tell myself \"Yes, I am terrified to do this job interview/application. But that does not mean I cannot do it. I will be scared AND I will do my best.\" I hope some of this helps. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dkfwkb/help_im_terrified_to_get_a_job_im_almost_21_i/f4eqnxv/"}
