The thing about mistakes are they are one of the best ways to learn something. There isn\u2019t a person alive that has never totally f*cked up. Some handle their mistakes horribly, some admirablely but most of us do so somewhere in between. The old saying fall down 99 times get up 100 holds true to us all. Don\u2019t be afraid to mess up. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for advice and don\u2019t be afraid to not take someone\u2019s advice. When at all possible try to learn from your mistakes and try to look for ways to do better. Be kind to yourself and be kind to others.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdn6vv/how_do_i_learn_to_trust_myself_and_my_decision/hargd09/"}
