Besides that, the post literally tells us that there is no such thing as an actual definition in English that can quite grasp the same meaning. \n\nIf this post was like 2 sentences long and just dropped a word here then told me to look it up myself I would be with you on this, but to me OP made a decent effort to explain and discuss the topic. So calling something pretentious for not giving an actual definition when they literally gave you an explanation as to why they can't give such a definition..? Idk bout that one.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pz5wkq/the_japanese_philosophical_concept_that_changed/hezj4m0/"}
