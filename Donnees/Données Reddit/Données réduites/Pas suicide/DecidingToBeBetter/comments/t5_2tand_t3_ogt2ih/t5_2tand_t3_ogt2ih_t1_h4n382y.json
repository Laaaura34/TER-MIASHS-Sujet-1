This is why I share my story. I feel i just switched one high for another but it worked. Don't get me wrong, it was very hard. Almost impossible but having the other distraction helped to keep my mind focused. I was punished in new ways when I did drink. I went to a training session hungover and it was horrible, so I never did it again. Exercise started to improve my life and relationships, so I kept at it.\n\nI believe in you and I know you can do this. Life is amazing on the other side and it's quite a journey.
