If you envy anyone for his job, a trait or whatever, do your best to get what he/she has but don't ever make the mistake of comparing yourself as a whole person. You can change and become whatever you want to. That is the reason why I am getting things done, because I want to be a good person for my friends and family.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q559oa/im_26_years_old_no_permanent_jobstucked_at/hg4did7/"}
