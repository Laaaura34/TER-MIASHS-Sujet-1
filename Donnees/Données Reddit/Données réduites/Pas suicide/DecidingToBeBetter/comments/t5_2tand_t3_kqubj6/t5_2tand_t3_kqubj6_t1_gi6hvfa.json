So don't be afraid of work, even if it's washing dishes or filling out paperwork, these roles are necessary in one way or another. \n\nFind something to be passionate about. And I've found the best things to be passionate about are things other people are passionate about so you can share that passion, so get out in to your community and start figuring out what kind of things truly make you happy.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kqubj6/regretting_a_no_regrets_life/gi6hvfa/"}
