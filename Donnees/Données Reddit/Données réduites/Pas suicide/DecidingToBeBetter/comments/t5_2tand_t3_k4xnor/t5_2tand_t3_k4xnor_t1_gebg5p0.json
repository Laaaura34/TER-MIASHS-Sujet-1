I know that it's hard especially with depression to even sleep or sleep well for that matter. Kind of a catch 22, so I just stay up for as long as I need and when I'm ready to sleep it's usually after I've been up so long I can't physically stay up anymore, that's when I get the best sleep. I understand it's inconvenient for those who like to be up early or actually awake in the day, but I think it's worth it if it means improving your mood. It's not a magic bullet, sometimes I get my full rest but I still wake up depressed, it's not perfect but it helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k4xnor/take_back_control_of_your_mind/gebg5p0/"}
