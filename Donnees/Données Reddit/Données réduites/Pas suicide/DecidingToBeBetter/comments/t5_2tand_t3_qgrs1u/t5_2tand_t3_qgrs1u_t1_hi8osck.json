Starting over sounds like there is a reset button you can press and everything will be at 18, just now that you can't reset your psychological issues just like that. So after 5 years of mental health issues let me tell you what helped me in the end: Try creating a healthy routine step by step. For me the most important things are Fitness, Meditation, Reading up on Mental Health and learning guitar. Obviously the last one could be very different to you. For me it is just something I want to get good at that I enjoy which helps me build up my self esteem. And also very important do not socially isolate. That is something I did for a long period and now that I got back in social life I really do see how it positively affects you. \n\nStart slow. Integrate one healthy habit at a time. I would suggest to start with sport especially if you are lacking energy, this will be a good base to get back the energy you are missing. Then try meditation to clear up your mind. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't try to do everything at the same time, you will fail. Small steps are key. Wish you all the best in life :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgrs1u/advice_on_starting_over_completely/hi8osck/"}
