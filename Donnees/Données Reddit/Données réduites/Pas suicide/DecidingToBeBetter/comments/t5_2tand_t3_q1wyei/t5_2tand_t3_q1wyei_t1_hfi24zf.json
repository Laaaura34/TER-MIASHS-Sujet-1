Ever.\n\nNotice how you verbalized \"friends.\"  What is making you see them with quotations?\n\nWe all have a responsibility to ourselves and that includes caring, loving and being compassionate.  What you avoid doing for yourself, are you really expecting others to do for you?  What you're avoiding internally is only going to come out subconsciously in the real world.\n\nBut that's also the thing with friendship, it's not a selfish thing.  We have to open ourselves up and also be vulnerable to others in order for them to reciprocate.  Are there any people in your school who could use a friend like you?  I would venture to say there probably is.  The wonderful thing about that is you get to be the friend you never had to someone who needs it just as much as you.  There's an amazing amount of beauty in that picture.\n\nTake care of yourself.  The habits you have whether good or bad affects the person you present to others to love, care and befriend.  Lower the amount of tech usage, start exercising, eating right, reading books and get restful sleep.  Certainly take back your mind through mindfulness practices like meditation.  These are all good steps to take.\n\nNow you get to choose, if this is as important to you as you make it out to be, what are you willing to do about it?  I know you have it in you to at least try.\n\nBest of luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1wyei/how_can_i_stop_these_thoughts/hfi24zf/"}
