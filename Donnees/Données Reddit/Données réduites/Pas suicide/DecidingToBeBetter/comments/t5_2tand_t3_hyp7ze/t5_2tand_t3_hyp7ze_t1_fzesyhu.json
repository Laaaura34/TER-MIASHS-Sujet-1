The second one has a guide on workouts to focus on core muscles right in the middle, and workouts that can be done at home or at the gym.\n\nSome good habits that I find help my mental health, and especially with my diagnosis(schizophrenia) are:  \n - Drinking 5x 25oz of water a day  \n - Going on a 20-30 minute walk in the morning  \n - Doing either 10 or 15 minutes of yoga after my walk(sarahbethyoga is the channel I use)  \n - Working on a creative project almost every day  \n - Spending 10-15 minutes meditating to recenter myself at some point  \n - Taking a day off every now and then when I start to feel overwhelmed  \n\nI have an excellent google spreadsheet that a friend made, where we log our progress on habits we're working on to be beneficial too. It's a bit gamified, and provides accountability, and feedback on which goals are working out and which are not. Every month we make changes based on what worked, and what didn't, and realign, and I find this occasional check-in to review my progress a great help. \n\nOther than that, I've done some udemy courses on Unity that helped me improve my game making skills. I know that codecademy can help people learn how to program, but I learned before it was a thing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hyp7ze/question_resources_books_courses_practices_that/fzesyhu/"}
