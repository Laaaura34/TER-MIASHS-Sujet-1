I set mine 40 minutes early and snooze..... and I consistently wake up with 15 mins to get out the door. And it really is all about intention, because if I have to wake up early and on the dot, I totally can. But on most weekdays, I just don't want to get up.\n\nThanks for your response :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0dpqr/ive_decided_to_be_better_how_do_i_actually_start/h21acq1/"}
