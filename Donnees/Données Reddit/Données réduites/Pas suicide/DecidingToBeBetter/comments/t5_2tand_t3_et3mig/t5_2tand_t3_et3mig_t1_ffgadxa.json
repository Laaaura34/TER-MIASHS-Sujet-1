It\u2019s a blend of many many things, that was just one part of my journey to self acceptance and a better understanding of who I am. I\u2019m still discovering and working on myself all the time. I meant no insult, all efforts are valid.. everyone is on their own path, I just shared a very small snippet of mine. I am not judging others and wish every one the best and to find peace and happiness and the best version of yourself, you included. I genuinely want the best for you.
