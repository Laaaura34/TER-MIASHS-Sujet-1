You helped me to start seeing things as it should be and not whining for everything. A lot of people just need that portion of motivation to start moving and focus on something. I always thought people could not help me, even less some strangers. And here, an anonymous reddit user gave me the stimulus to begin, life is curious sometimes. People is very important in our life it doesn't matter if we are very introverts (like I am), because when we want to do all alone by ourselves our world might become so lonely that we would be missing very important positive interactions with 4839949 things, things that can lead you towards a life full of purpose as it has to be. Finally I wanna express my gratitude to you for taking the time to do this, even if it's just to start things, you've helped me :')", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dvlf9e/take_control_of_your_life_and_decide_to_be_better/f7hi82p/"}
