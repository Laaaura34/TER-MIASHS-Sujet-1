I wish I can just be helpful to others while remaining the way I am. Like that's how deeply rooted my mentality feels like, I literally cannot imagine myself experiencing a \"peak\" (where I'm feeling more positive) so I lose hope in trying.\n\nThe idea of letting everything go (suicidal ideation) and just stop existing feels so calm, being able to escape everything about myself. But not to worry, I can never go through with it because I could never do that to my parents and put more suffering on them. So a very small part of me thinks \"well, if you're not going to die, might as well make the most of it\" but it's easily overshadowed by other negative feelings/thoughts.\n\nBut I do appreciate you responding. You were very helpful. I just need to start helping myself, which I always doubt I can do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dvlf9e/take_control_of_your_life_and_decide_to_be_better/f7hs903/"}
