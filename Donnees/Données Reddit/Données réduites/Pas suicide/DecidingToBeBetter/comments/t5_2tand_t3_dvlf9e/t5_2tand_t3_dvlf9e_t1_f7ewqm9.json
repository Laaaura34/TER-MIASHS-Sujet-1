I've just sort of been accepting all the bad things I say about myself. And I hate it, but at the same time, it's become my \"comfortable\" situation and trying to take steps to improve it is uncomfortable. Basically, being uncomfortable (suffering, self-hatred, etc.) has become my default state and so I'm basically \"comfortable\" with being uncomfortable.\n\nI hate what it has done to me. I feel so guilty nowadays because I can't help those close to me (like you mention), specifically my parents. They're suffering too but I feel helpless/useless and I don't know how to help them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dvlf9e/take_control_of_your_life_and_decide_to_be_better/f7ewqm9/"}
