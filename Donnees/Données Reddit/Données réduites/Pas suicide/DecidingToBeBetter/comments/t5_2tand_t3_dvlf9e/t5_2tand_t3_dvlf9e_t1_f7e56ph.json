If you adopt the victim mentality for your whole life then you will truly remain the victim. I always felt like my illness and bad luck were in control my life and I blamed my parents for the genes, myself for allowing my brain to think in the way it does, and the world for  not caring enough about my sorry ass. But you gotta care about the world for it to care about you. You have to accept that for whatever beautiful, horrible reason, your parents created you and you are here. And you have to be able to stop blaming anything and everything that makes you feel shitty and take responsibility for your life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dvlf9e/take_control_of_your_life_and_decide_to_be_better/f7e56ph/"}
