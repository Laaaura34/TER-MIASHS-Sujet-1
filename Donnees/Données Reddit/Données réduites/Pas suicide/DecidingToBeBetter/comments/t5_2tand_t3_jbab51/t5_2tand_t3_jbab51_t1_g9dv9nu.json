I count opening the rubric, setting up my laptop, reading etc. so once I get over that hill it\u2019ll turn to 10 mins or more. I\u2019m not always consistent with this so what helps is planning my hours like at 2pm I\u2019ll start and set aside 5 mins to do that and if I don\u2019t want to continue I don\u2019t and if I have momentum I\u2019ll keep going. I\u2019ve noticed that breaking down 2 hours throughout the day is better than doing work for 2 straight hours.\n\nPS. \nGood luck! Give pep talks to yourself and congratulate yourself on small victories, the small things add up.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jbab51/procrastination_reflection/g9dv9nu/"}
