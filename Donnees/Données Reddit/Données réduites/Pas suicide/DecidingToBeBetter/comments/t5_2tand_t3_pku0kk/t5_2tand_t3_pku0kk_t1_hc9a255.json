I don't have alot of knowledge or experience, but I would say that \"it is impossible to find in another person things I want\" might be true, but it is not as important as you might think. Like journey over destination type thing, just pt yourself out there even with people you don't think are fully compatible with you and you might be surprised. I hope this helps :)\n\nBut in terms of the work, yeah it requires work, most good things in life do, and for me at least I have decided it is worth putting in the work, without being dependant on the result.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pku0kk/i_am_no_longer_afraid_of_being_alone/hc9a255/"}
