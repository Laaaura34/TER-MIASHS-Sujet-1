Sit down when you are in a moderately positive mood (don\u2019t want to be in a negative mood), and write down all the things that interest you. List off watching baseball, playing guitar, seeing your buddies, whatever. Then write down how much joy it brings you (not in-the-moment pleasure.. I mean true enhancing joy in your life). Then write down how much you are doing those things on a daily basis. I learned (even though it seemed obvious), that plying guitar makes me very happy, but I dedicated almost no time to it because it faded away. It was pretty clear that I needed to discipline myself to reach for the guitar pick instead of the lighter to smoke a joint. That is a concrete plan of action, not just a generality. Then you could write down the things you actually spend your time doing right now (or recently), and see if those things are making you happy or bringing you joy. The exercise just shows you on paper that usually we are not putting our time into things that really matter to us personally.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pik30k/i_need_practical_concrete_steps_to_better_myself/hbqehwf/"}
