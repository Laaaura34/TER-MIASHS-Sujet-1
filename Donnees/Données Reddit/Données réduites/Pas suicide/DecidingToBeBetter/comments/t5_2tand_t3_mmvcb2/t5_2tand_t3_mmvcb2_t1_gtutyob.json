Your worries of your past actions can be cured if you focus your attention in the now as it\u2019s happening live.  Practice mindfulness and meditate often to clear your mind of thoughts.  You want to gain the ability to identify when you\u2019re thinking so you can just be in the present moment without thoughts.  With stillness comes clarity.\n\nAs an example, where are you and what are you doing right now?  As you walk around, are you mindful of your immediate surroundings?  Take a moment to sense your environment.  Look up at the sky, you\u2019re inside of a planet within a gigantic universe.  The mind is powerful and often times we suffer from what we\u2019re imagining rather than what\u2019s actually happening in the moment.  It\u2019s a matter of focus and perspective.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mmvcb2/im_kind_of_a_bad_person_and_im_really_not_sure/gtutyob/"}
