Reading this really put a smile on my face. Really. You deserve peace and happiness and the world will never give it to you - you have to give it to yourself. \n\nI wish you so much love. And also I suggest maybe reading the Tibetan book of the living and dying. Just the first few chapters changed my life. I always remember that I am dying and also that the people around me are dying and it makes me appreciate life so much. I wish that for you also. This life is short and it is ridiculous - laughably ridiculous - to feel angry over little things that don\u2019t mean absolutely nothing. Good luck. I really pray for everyone to feel peace in their hearts\n\n\ud83e\udd0d\ud83e\udd0d\ud83e\udd0d", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gsuxvx/today_i_noticed_crazy_transformation_i_want_to_cry/fs88tmp/"}
