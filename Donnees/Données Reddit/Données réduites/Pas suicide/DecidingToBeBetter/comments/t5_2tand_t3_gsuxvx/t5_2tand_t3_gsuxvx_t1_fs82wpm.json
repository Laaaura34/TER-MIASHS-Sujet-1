I read it and that\u2019s one of my big issues at home. I lost my dad so I can\u2019t fix that relationship anymore but I still have my brother and mother and our stepdad. Honestly...I don\u2019t know where it came from. I got into the Guard about 10 years ago, was in college, and was in a pyramid scheme. I tried to balance it all but I chose the company over everything-I stayed in the Guard due to the fact I can now pay my auto ship. Getting out, I had a different perspective and more and more I found the company was scamming me. I would be mad all the time. I\u2019d get so angry over small things and not know the reasons why. I started smoking more weed and took phenibut to help but...I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s helping me anymore. I\u2019m not a vet nor will I ever consider myself as one however I will say it did change me in some way. I love my family but I\u2019m so goddamn jaded like I HAVE to be successful otherwise it was ALL for nothing. I left college twice and still failed so I don\u2019t know what else to do. I\u2019ve been in situations where my rights were gone so that is my biggest fear. Idk where I\u2019m going with this but you give me hope. They\u2019re all I have left and I don\u2019t want to fuck it up anymore. I give up being perfect.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gsuxvx/today_i_noticed_crazy_transformation_i_want_to_cry/fs82wpm/"}
