Firstly, congratulations on recognising the problem and deciding to improve yourself. Self improvement isn\u2019t easy but it\u2019s worth it :) \nSecondly, I want to encourage you to make as many steps into adulthood as you can while still living at home. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are a lot of great factors that come with moving out but it is hard. It comes with its own challenges. And roommates can be just as hard to live with as family. I recommend finding a form of transport that can get you to a job (public transport, bike etc.) and get you some freedom. And finding a job and sticking to it. Once you have some financial freedom and you can get yourself around I\u2019m certain you will feel a bit better. Thirdly, don\u2019t forget to be grateful for what you have. After reading your post I found myself feeling a little jealous. I\u2019m a couple of years older than you (24) and at the moment I\u2019m sick in bed with food poisoning. My closest family member is 4 hours away. I cook everything. I clean everything. It is hard. I would love to have someone clean the bathroom for me or cook me a yummy meal. I don\u2019t say this for you to feel sorry for me but to hopefully show you that you\u2019re pretty lucky to have what you have. So try to remember to be grateful for it despite the frustrations you have \ud83c\udf3b", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0i41d/ive_finally_decided_to_escape_my_parents_i_dont/hf8z55n/"}
