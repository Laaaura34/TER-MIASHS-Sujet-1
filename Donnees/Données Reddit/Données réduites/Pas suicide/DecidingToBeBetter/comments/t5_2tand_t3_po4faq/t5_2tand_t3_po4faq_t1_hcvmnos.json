I've been considering the same.\n\nI also agree with your comments, thank you for a well written and thoughtful post. I especially like what you wrote about the environment being a  huge contributing factor. i read an awesome book a while back, it was called \"Lost Connections: Why you're depressed and how to find hope\". It was really eye-opening. There was a lot of good information about meds (what they do and, mostly, what they don't do) and the author really breaks down the real reasons why people suffer from depression. It helped me a lot at the time. i think I need to give it a re-read! lol", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/po4faq/the_most_important_thing_to_understand_is_that/hcvmnos/"}
