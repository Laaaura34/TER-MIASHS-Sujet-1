A kind of boost that I needed. I want to believe that I am on this same journey you were when this started. I can see the similarities already: toxic environment and constant bringing self-down even when others aren't.\n\nLike you, I'm currently also separated from said toxic environment, and I am much more liberated at the moment. Sadly, not making much progress on the productive side of things, but I'm working on it. I am focusing on my health first (physical exercise and watching things that I eat). I am feeling the progress already, but still have a long way to go. I hope the toxicity doesn't creep back up.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/po4faq/the_most_important_thing_to_understand_is_that/hcugzsw/"}
