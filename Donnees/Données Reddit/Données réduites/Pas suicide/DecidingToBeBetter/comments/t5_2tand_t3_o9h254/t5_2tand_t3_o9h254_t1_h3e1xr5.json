But, my point is, there's no shame in those situation.  \nI can relate to that, first appartment with my gf and I had to let her pay like 80% of our bills, and for the first month, I had to ask her for buying a simple 20 dolls of car gas. In those moments we're all like... feeling ashamed, afraid about the relationship too. I don't know if you had that too, but I was afraid for my gf to hate me with bills and bills and bills...  \nI'm afraid some lovers can't resist to this kind of issues. Not all people can. And in those hard times, I was feeling already a bit happy with the only thought that my gf kept loving me and helping me.   \nThat helped through this moments, and I finally found a job. A bad job, for sure it's not my perfect american-dreamed-of job. A job like cashier or whatever, I respect a lot those people but we all know we're doing just because we had nothing else lol.  \nBut. The hard jobs that we found for paying the bills, are cool at the end of the month, after a long time being unable to paying a single bill, when you receive your pay and yes, can start a new and fresh life.  \nI don't know you and have been so long writing this, sorry, but I wish you the best, and I'm very happy for and proud of you.  \nHave the best day ! Much human love, with an apologize for my english mistakes, not my primary langage. ;)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o9h254/filled_the_refrigerator_and_helped_pay_rent/h3e1xr5/"}
