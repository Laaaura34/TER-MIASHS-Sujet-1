You'll attract people but that won't mean anything to you because you'd be better than them. Most of the people seek overall better people. IMO they're lost in life as everyone and don't want to lost in the dark. You understand trying to get people's attraction is not a good idea. So the first place to begin would be your actions right before your thoughts. At least that's what's worked for me.
