Girls don't act like that. Not many any ways, and the ones that do come with so much emotional trauma you can't be happy unless your in bed with them. So take a step back, stop watching face ramming porn, and under stand girls like a guy that wants to love them and be with them, every once in a while you get some hardcore sex, but not the porn hardcore. Understand you are just a normal dude, normal girls is what you get, normal sex. Don't try to make them do things they are uncomfortable with because you watched a video on it. What is better, decent sex with a decent looking girl or scaring girls off because you want to do crazy shit to them all the time. And I'm not sure what attention you are looking for but girls are people too, not just sex toys, they have lives and families and stuff to do. Life isn't about sex. Stop looking at every girl you pass as though they are a potential bed partner. I found that when you stop looking at girls that way, you will find the girl that is looking at you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oav6ix/craving_female_attention/h3jwpnw/"}
