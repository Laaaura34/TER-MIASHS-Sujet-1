You\u2019re 20 and you lift weights. Your testosterone is high. You\u2019re horny and you dont want \u201cattention\u201d, you want to sleep with hot girls that you like and you\u2019re wondering why they don\u2019t like you back.\n\nIt\u2019s simple. Looks aren\u2019t enough to get most women interested and most women are not going to come up to you & try to get your number. You have to do that.\n\nIf you like a girl stop peacocking and fluttering your eyes about like a damsel. Instead, make sure your breath smells nice, make sure your cologne is good, make sure your haircut is sharp & your outfit looks well and fits, and approach the girl yourself.\n\nBe calm, nonchalant and respectful. Ask her name, tell her yours. Ask her what she does in her free time. And then offer to take her out some time. Get her number and voila.\n\nThis process goes smoothly if she likes the energy you approach her with, if not or if she has a boyfriend that she really likes, she\u2019ll reject you. In which case you move on peacefully.\n\nGo approach girls & start dating them and you won\u2019t be constantly crying about their attention.\n\nLastly, value yourself more. A lot of women are great but your real value comes from within. If you work hard & contribute to society, you matter. Woman or not.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oav6ix/craving_female_attention/h3nn5ke/"}
