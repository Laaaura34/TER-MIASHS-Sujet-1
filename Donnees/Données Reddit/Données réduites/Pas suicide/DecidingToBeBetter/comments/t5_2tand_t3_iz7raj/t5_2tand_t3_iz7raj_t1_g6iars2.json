I have been dealing with heavy guilt for months now over things I did in the past, and I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the reason I feel guilty is because I am not that person anymore. Or more so, I\u2019m glad that I feel remorse because it means my character has changed and that as long as I am honest with myself and the people around me I will always act within my character now. And I know who I am and who I want to be\u2014a loving person. Someone who brings light.\n\nI also deeply resonate with the idea that if something is not perfect then I can\u2019t give it energy. But this idea of perfection stops me from even starting. It\u2019s so crazy. I wrote an Instagram post about this recently actually lol.\n\nLoved reading this. \u2661 In a biggg rough spot lately. Battling depression and anxiety and was just diagnosed with covid the other day. Needed to see this and be inspired to get back into my practice. But without the pressure, without the guilt. \u2661 Thank you deeply.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iz7raj/i_missed_meditating_for_a_day_and_instead_of/g6iars2/"}
