It\u2019s not always easy to choose what\u2019s good for us & to take aligned action but it is so so worth it and I can see how much I\u2019ve grown even though I thought I was super aware a year ago, 2 years ago, 3 years ago etc. it\u2019s a forever journey but I\u2019m grateful for what I\u2019ve learned so far and it\u2019s really nice to see progress even when it doesn\u2019t necessarily feel like something \u201clife changing\u201d.
