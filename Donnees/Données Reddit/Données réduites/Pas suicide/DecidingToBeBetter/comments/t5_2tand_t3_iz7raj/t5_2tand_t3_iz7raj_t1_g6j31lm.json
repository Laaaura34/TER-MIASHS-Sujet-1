I've been going through pretty much the same thing - learning to let myself love myself and all the issues that come with it. I've had the hardest year of my life since my dad died in January. everything that happened before and after his death spiralled into a horrific tornado of anger, grief and hatred this summer. But I started therapy and have been on this long, harsh but loving road of recovery and acceptance. And some days I get REALLy sad and angry and I feel all the work I've put into myself has failed me. And other days I take a step back and realise how much I'm improving and how proud I am of myself. \n\nDealing with past things I've done and people I've hurt/ people who hurt me was something that I struggled with, and still do. They can ruin my mood and my day if I let those thoughts eat at me. But learning coping mechanisms, and trying my best to just accept thoughts as they come, has helped me loads. \n\nI'm having a bad week this week, and OP your thread resonated with me a lot. Thank you.\n\nSending love and acceptance to everyone reading this today x", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iz7raj/i_missed_meditating_for_a_day_and_instead_of/g6j31lm/"}
