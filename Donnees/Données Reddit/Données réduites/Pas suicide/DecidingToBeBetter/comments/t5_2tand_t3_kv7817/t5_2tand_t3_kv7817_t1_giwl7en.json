I feel like one of the hardest things to do when you have anxiety is actually seek professional help. I've been aware of my anxiety for probably three years (I'm sure it's been going on longer than that) and throughout those three years it's been so obvious I could use professional help. \n\nHowever, my anxiety always made me question, \"is it that serious?\" Or \"what do I say?\" Especially, \"do i deserve it/ need it?\" Even though it's clear I for sure do! When we have anxiety, it's very easy for us to make excuses for ourselves not to go to certain things. I'm so happy you overcame your anxiety's persistence and spoke up about it. \n\nThese past few days I've definitely realized that COVID19 has made everyone's mental health decline. Everyone's on edge about everything lately. It's so sad, honestly. \n\nI'm happy to see that you are deciding to be better to yourself by seeking for help you need :) I'm currently trying to figure out my options, I think I'll try meditation first before trying online therapy services. Maybe you should try some guided meditation too :) I told a friend about the app Headspace and he said every since I suggested it to him it's helped a lot. Its taught him how to meditate without the help of the app when times call for such things. Check it out or something!\n\nI wish you the best of luck with your life, family, and these steps that are intimidating but very necessary! Congratulations on your pregnancy btw!
