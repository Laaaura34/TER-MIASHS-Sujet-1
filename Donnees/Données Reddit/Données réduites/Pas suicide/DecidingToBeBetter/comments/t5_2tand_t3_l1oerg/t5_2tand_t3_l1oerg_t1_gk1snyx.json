I did in person therapy as well as a workbook, and they were almost exactly the same. I used the Dialectical Behavioural Therapy Skills Workbook, which you can get on amazon (the cover is green). I also did a few group therapy sessions, and listening to other people talk about their emotions helped me shed some shame about mine. Their stories also helped me see how unnecessary and inappropriate some of my behaviours were, and the similarities between the problems they created in our lives. At this point I don't even feel like I'm fighting anger. There are very few things that actually rouse that feeling in me anymore.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l1oerg/to_all_of_you_who_overcame_severe_anger_problems/gk1snyx/"}
