She said, \u201cYou got to learn that you don\u2019t have to fight every battle. Pick and choose.\u201d \n\nI never realized that I didn\u2019t have to respond to every offense or argument with anger especially since anger tends to take a whole lot of emotional energy. Once she said that, I learned the power of simply walking away or not saying anything. I started to see my anger really fizzle out, but of course, naturally, the more you hold it in, the more random and dangerous your outbursts might be. \n\nSo, 21 year old me, took what she said and modified it into, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be ready to square up to every fight you\u2019re invited to, but definitely make your presence known.\u201d Basically saying, yeah you may not always have to have anger at situations you\u2019re upset in, but DEFINITELY let it be known you are upset.\n\nAnger is a natural and normal human emotion, when we process it (letting both yourself and others realize when you\u2019re slighted) and then let it go (solving the issue at hand if possible). \n\nSuppressing your anger won\u2019t do you good, but neither will always going to 100 at the slightest things. There\u2019s a lot of friendships I may never get back and words I can\u2019t unsay.\n\n However, as long as you\u2019re moving forward and keeping in control of how you proceed with your forever-fluctuating emotions, you should be fine.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l1oerg/to_all_of_you_who_overcame_severe_anger_problems/gk54ns2/"}
