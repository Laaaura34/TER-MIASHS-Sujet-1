Anything that is done in excess if bad for both mind and body\n\nI love great stories in any format.\nSo I play some some games that is story driven such as The Witcher 3, Alan Wake, Resident Evil 2 remake. \n\nIf you can get a console such as playstation 5, you can play God Of War, Uncharted series.\n\nAs a businessman I hardly find time for hobbies, but gaming is something that I enjoy the most. Even for 30-60 minutes a session.\n\nLike any other hobbies, do it in moderation, don't spend countless hours each day on any hobby and you'll have a pleasant experience.\n\nI do gardening, learning new things, reading books, I play batminton a lot in the evening.\n\nAnd now building a setup for content creation as a hobby too.\n\nHave some variety so that you don't get bored with one hobby.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qf9mbl/hobby_suggestions/hi2qtin/"}
