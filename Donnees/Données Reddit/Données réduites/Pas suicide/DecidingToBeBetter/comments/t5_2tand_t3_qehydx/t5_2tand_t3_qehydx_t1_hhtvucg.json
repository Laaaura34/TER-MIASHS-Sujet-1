I was anxious, dating an avoidant, we broke up, I thought relationships were the only way to be happy until a friend told me I can make myself happy. I started finding things to do that made me happy like going to the cinema solo, it was like the independence of moving out of your parents house only the happiness equivalent. Now, approaching women isn't like playing the lottery, hoping to win big and being crushed if I don't, it's like checking the opening hours of a shop hoping its open at the time I want to go there. There is less at stake now that the alternative to being in a relationship isn't bleak.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qehydx/how_to_overcome_insecure_attachment/hhtvucg/"}
