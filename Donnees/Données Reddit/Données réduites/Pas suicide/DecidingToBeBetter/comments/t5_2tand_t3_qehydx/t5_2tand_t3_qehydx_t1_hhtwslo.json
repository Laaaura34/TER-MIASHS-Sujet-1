Basically you visualize a set of ideal parents (read, NOT your actual parents but imagined ones) that are parenting you in each of the five arms that make up secure attachment. If done diligently over a space of 4 to 6 months, your attachment pattern transforms. \n\nThe IPFP does this because as you imagine being parented in secure ways your attachment system is actually activated at the same time, and those positive attachment experiences begin to get stored in your attachment \u201cdatabase\u201d, you could say. Eventually, over time, you have stored enough imagined scenarios of being positively parented that when faced with new relational scenarios, your attachment system automatically pulls from the \u201csecure\u201d attachment framework you\u2019ve laid down. \n\nYou can find versions of the IPFP by Dan Brown on YouTube, as well as find a fairly comprehensive Pt 1&2 on Google of George Haas of Mettagroup delivering the IPFP during a workshop he led.\n\nThere are individual therapists who will do this work with you as well. Additionally, Mettagroup also offers a several-week-class that\u2019s very comprehensive and covers the background of research behind attachment as well as offering mentor-support in rewriting your attachment style USING the IPFP. Jessica Fern, the author of Polysecure, also offers a several week course on rewriting one\u2019s attachment style. (You can find that info on her website.)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qehydx/how_to_overcome_insecure_attachment/hhtwslo/"}
