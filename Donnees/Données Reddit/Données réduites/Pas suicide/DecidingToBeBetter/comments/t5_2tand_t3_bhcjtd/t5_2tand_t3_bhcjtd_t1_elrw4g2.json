I used to run competitively, and one of the most rage-inducing things would be when I was mid-race, redlining myself, out of breath and exhausted with legs of lead, and someone would yell \"pick it up\" or \"run faster\" as it is were that easy.  That person was only able to speak from their current position of being on the sideline and sedentary, and were not considerate of the position I found myself in at the time. \n\nWhy do I bring this story up?  Because it is the same concept as someone telling you to simply \"be confident.\"  They lack the context needed to give you actionable advice.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bhcjtd/what_did_you_think_when_you_were_told_to_be/elrw4g2/"}
