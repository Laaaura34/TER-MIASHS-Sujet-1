Generally that's what I try to do, little things here and there but that means that I can't do it again for about a week. I have one cigarette left which is my \"emergency\" cigarette, which basically means that I'm not allowed to smoke it but it makes me feel like I'm in control enough not to go buy another pack. So I'm good on that, but the thing about me is I always feel the need to substitute it. So last night I ate a gigantic frosting cookie and now I'm still feeling like crap about it. I'll take your advice though, and no sweets maybe for another week.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7uxgmg/want_to_become_more_disciplined_as_i_have_a_very/dtodbpd/"}
