You have to accept that you may have an error from time to time and that your success chain might break. Its ok. It doesn't mean you failed it just means you made an error. Accept it and move forward.\n\n\nI recommend the book/audio book \"The Power of Habit\". It helped me understand why I was making some of the decissions I was making and how to \"control\"/\"direct\" my thoughts to create better habits.\n\n\nHang in there and try no to be so hard in yourself.\n\n\nSorry for any typos and spelling I'm on mobile.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7uxgmg/want_to_become_more_disciplined_as_i_have_a_very/dto0h30/"}
