Strongly recommend using that. Additionally, there\u2019s an app called \u201cgoodreads\u201d which is sort of a social book recommendation engine. Found plenty of interesting reads from there. YMMV from Libby based on which library you\u2019re a part of, some library\u2019s have terrible digital collections others have amazing ones.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q694r3/i_have_decided_that_i_want_to_be_wellread_and/hgene3r/"}
