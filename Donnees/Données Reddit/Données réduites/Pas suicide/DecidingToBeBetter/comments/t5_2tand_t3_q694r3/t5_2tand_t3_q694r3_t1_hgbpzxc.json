Henry you might also like Maupassant, Hawthorne\u2019s short stories (he has some really great creepy thought-provoking ones \u2014 \u201cministers black veil\u201d and \u201cthe birth mark\u201d and \u201cthe ambitious guest\u201d and \u201cEthan brand\u201d among my favorites), oh and. Cannot forget Herman Melville, he has some fantastic short stories and novellas \u2014 \u201cBartleby\u201d and \u201cBenito Cereno\u201d \n\nIf you have time I also highly recommend Henry D Thoreau\u2019s Walden, as well as his essay Civil Disobedience. Really a classic and so relevant during these times. \n\nMy recommendations definitely skew 19th century American since I\u2019m obsessed with literature from that time lol. \n\nHave fun!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q694r3/i_have_decided_that_i_want_to_be_wellread_and/hgbpzxc/"}
