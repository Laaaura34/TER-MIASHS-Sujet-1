The early morning thing is just one specific way of establishing a routine.\n\nIf you're a 9-5 office worker, your routine might look a lot like the OP's. Or maybe you start work at 7 a.m. and get off at 3 p.m. In that case, your routine would probably start closer to 4 p.m. \n\nOr maybe you're working 16-hour shifts and your routine is just taking a walk on your lunch break, doing some jumping jacks first thing in the morning or listening to educational audiobooks on your commute. \n\nI think waking up earlier gets mentioned the most, because it's the easiest way of carving out extra time for that routine. Because the time does need to come from somewhere and you do have to sacrifice something, whether it's sleep, TV time, or happy hour with your coworkers. \n\nI think the main takeaway from most of these early morning advice posts is that taking a little bit of time for self-improvement every day does wonders for your mood and energy levels. You can do that in any way and at any time that works for you, and will still probably see a massive benefit.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/9j1b9c/how_waking_up_at_6am_everyday_has_changed_my_life/e6p0pie/"}
