I **NEED** 7 hours to be at max functioning the next day. Doable with 6 but caffeine is required - also start crashing a lot earlier. \n\nMy nightly routine at the minute is, stop all form of cognitive brain work (college work for me) at 8pm. Doesn't matter what Im doing or anything - because I know I have that extra hour the next morning if I need it. \n\nThen just chill out for 2 hours, get a meal in and rail hail or snow I am in bed by 10/ half 10, then at that stage alarms go on and phone into airplane mode and I start reading (reading unlimited power atm - very good book).\n\nSo basically to answer your question, 11pm is my usual go to. I can do it with 6 and a half, but groggyness kicks in the next morning / evening - maybe its a mental thing but I can sure as hell tell the difference.
