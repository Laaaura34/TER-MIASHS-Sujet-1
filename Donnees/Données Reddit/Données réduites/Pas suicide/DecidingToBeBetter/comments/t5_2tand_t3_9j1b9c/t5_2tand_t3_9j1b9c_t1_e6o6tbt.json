I want to and have an alarm to wake up at 5:20 every morning to give myself an hour before I have to wake my daughter for school.  However, I haven't done it.  Every night I don't go to bed at 10:30 when I need to and have, eeks, been staying up til 2.  I'm not only not waking up early I'm not even getting 5 hours of sleep.  So, I gotta get that in order first.  I did wake up at 5:20 for a while a yearish ago when I'd go swimming before everyone woke up.  It was damn hard, especially in the dark winter, but felt amazing to be done exercising early and to see the sun rise as I left the gym.  Using you for motivation.  Thank you.
