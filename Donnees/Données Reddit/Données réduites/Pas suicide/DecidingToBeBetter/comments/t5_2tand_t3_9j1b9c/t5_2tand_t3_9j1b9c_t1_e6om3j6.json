If you want we can link up on some messaging service (whatsapp / snapchat etc) if you need that little push. \n\n\nI have read a bit on human psychology before, and have come across a principle called Commitment & Consistency (Robert Cialdini - Influence).\n\nSo I tried to tie it into my routine -  I love seeing peoples reactions when I tell them that I get up at 6 everyday as most of them think I have lost my mind. But what I have started doing is sending a snapchat video or whatever at 6.06 of me in my car with techno music blaring every time im going up. \n\nFor me it was that little extra commitment that made me want to do it more.
