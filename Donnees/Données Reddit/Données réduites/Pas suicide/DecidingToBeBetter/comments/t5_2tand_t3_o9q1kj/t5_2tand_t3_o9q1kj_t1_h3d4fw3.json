There will always be things some have and others don't, no need to dwell on them for too long. I think you should start seeing a therapist to talk these things out in longform to really address these stresses, and make a plan for a month, 3 months, and 1 year from now to work on yourself. You have earned a lot to put pieces together, I believe in you! Start small and work your way up. Talk kindly to yourself and forgive yourself. You've got so much awesome living to be done man, and thats exciting! Women will come along once you've got your shit straightened out, dont worry!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o9q1kj/seriously_behind_in_life_would_appreciate_some/h3d4fw3/"}
