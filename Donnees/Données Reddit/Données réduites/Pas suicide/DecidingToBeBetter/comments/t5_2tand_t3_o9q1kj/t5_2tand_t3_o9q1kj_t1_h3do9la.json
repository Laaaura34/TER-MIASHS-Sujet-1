And 40\u2019s.\n\nYeah but that doesn't mean it's good...most people are overweight and out of shape and that doesn't mean it's good.\n\n>If you want to travel more, start a separate bank account and set up a direct deposit from your paychecks of a certain amount that goes directly into that account, which is specifically set aside for travel.\n\nYep, this is a good idea for sure. I'm actually planning on doing this once I get my credit car debt down to a manageable level. \n\n>pursue your interests and you will meet people. Join a fitness club (there\u2019s one in my city that does the little workout stations in the public park), check online for classifieds looking for people to jam with, or better yet, go to Guitar Center and strike up conversation with someone looking for advice on what guitar to buy.\n\nThese are good ideas. I'm actually a member of a gym right now and I'm a regular and I've met some cool people.\n\n>You\u2019re gonna get your D wet, I promise \ud83d\ude02\n\nHaha, thanks.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o9q1kj/seriously_behind_in_life_would_appreciate_some/h3do9la/"}
