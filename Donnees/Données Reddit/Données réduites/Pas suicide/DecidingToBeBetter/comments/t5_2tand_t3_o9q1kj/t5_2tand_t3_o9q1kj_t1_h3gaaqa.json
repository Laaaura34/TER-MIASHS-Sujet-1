He\u2019s now 20. An issue in our relationship was always him lacking \u201cexperience\u201d and his body count being 1. I thought of him as ungrateful and immature. Honestly if you can find yourself real love rather than a one night stand just to get it over with you should. Remember to attract it and let it come naturally rather than seeking it. Be patient and you\u2019ll find the right one. Just make sure your focus is finding love rather than sex.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o9q1kj/seriously_behind_in_life_would_appreciate_some/h3gaaqa/"}
