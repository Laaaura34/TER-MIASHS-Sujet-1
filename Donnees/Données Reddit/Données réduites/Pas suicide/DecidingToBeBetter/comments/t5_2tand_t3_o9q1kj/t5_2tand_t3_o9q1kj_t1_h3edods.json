You mean the emotions involved in romance or sex?\n\nSex. There can be a lot of feelings involved (or none at all) and that can be a lot to handle when you\u2019re young. I know myself well enough to know I wouldn\u2019t have handled that well.\n\n>Yeah but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good\n\nSure, but to be fair you were worried about feeling behind in life, and in this area you\u2019re right on track \ud83d\ude02\n\nAlso, I\u2019m not sure how advanced you are at guitar or piano, but maybe you could give lessons? I started taking guitar lessons during the pandemic over skype, and my instructor is super cool. Don\u2019t rule out situations where you might not necessarily be making friends. Socializing can be fulfilling even when you\u2019re not getting someone\u2019s number or making plans to hang out again.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o9q1kj/seriously_behind_in_life_would_appreciate_some/h3edods/"}
