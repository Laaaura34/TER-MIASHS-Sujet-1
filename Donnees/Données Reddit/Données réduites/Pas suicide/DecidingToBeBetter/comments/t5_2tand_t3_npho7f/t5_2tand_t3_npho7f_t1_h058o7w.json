If you can do it, reach out to a psychologist for help would be beneficial. In the meantime, trying to think less negatively is something I still struggle with. I won't go into my backstory, but I will say it isn't as easy as flipping a switch. In my experience, it is best to gradually add in more positivity over time so that your negative worldview doesn't immediately overwhelm you. One thing that helps is to introduce more neutral thoughts depending on what you are experiencing in the moment. I'm sorry I can't be of further help on this since I am not a therapist, but I do hope what little I can provide helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/npho7f/i_have_a_bad_habit_of_thinking_negatively_and/h058o7w/"}
