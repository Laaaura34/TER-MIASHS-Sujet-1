Self control comes first from self-awareness, self-acceptance, and self-advancemement. And from self-control comes self-respect. \n\nOnce you choose to continue to forgive yourself and open to yourself unconditionally - allow yourself to move past past actions and live in the moment with as much concentration as possible, you will be in more control of yourself. Mastery of the self is the path towards success. But you cannot master yourself without first treating your past, current, and future selves as mere students who continue to learn and strive while accepting they may make mistakes and must hold themselves accountable to them.\n\nThis evolves from discipline. You must choose to develop the habits you seek to exhibit. And you must do so without arrogance or ego, but from a drive to not be the best, but merely to be better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8osyyv/two_questions/e06sxdp/"}
