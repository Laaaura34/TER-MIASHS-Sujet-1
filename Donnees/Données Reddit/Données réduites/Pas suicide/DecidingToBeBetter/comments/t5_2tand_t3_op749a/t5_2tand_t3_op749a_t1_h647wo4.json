So don't feel bad if you fall back for an hour, or a day or so, nothing is lost. Just realize you are a work in progress and you have a desire to change still.\nSet achievable goals, dont strive for perfection but for example, I will not smoke for 3 days. Then set another goal and move forward. It can be overwhelming to say to yourself 'I want to change everything at once'. This will set you up for failure and cause more problems.\nMaybe look into your circle of people, what unwanted behavior occurs with which persons? The crowd you hang out with has a big impact on what you do. Some people are really fun, but will keep you from improvement. Those are the ones you need to see less or stop hanging out with. This can be hard, but it will be worth it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/op749a/how_do_i_stop_my_self_destructive_behavior/h647wo4/"}
