That doesn't change. Likely you are very much of each. People who are very intelligent are also prone to boredom and risk taking. You're 19 - that's very young. I just turned 33 and I didn't know what I wanted to do in school until I was around 23 and I graduated late. School is often presented as what you should do but all too often it is not the best choice at a certain point in life. Is it what you want to do right now? What are your goals for your life at this point in time? \n\nI don't know about you but I didn't know what I wanted to do at 19 and I am glad I didn't commit to something I would have hated. If I had to choose at that age I'd have gotten my degree in computer science and been miserable. If you feel the same way, take at least a year to explore hobbies and just live. Work, hang out, moderate your vices to whatever degree you need to be happy(ish).\n\nAs for drinking and smoking, I don't know enough details but I think we all go through phases. I drank *a lot* in college and definitely started developing a problem but then moderated it and today I drink healthily with no issues. Really examine your vices and what they make you do and then see if that's in contrast with what you want to be. \n\nIf you need someone to talk to, feel free to DM me. I'm pretty knowledgeable about school/career stuff at least. \n\nBest of luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/op749a/how_do_i_stop_my_self_destructive_behavior/h64gbl9/"}
