Personally I don't see your actions (besides the deceit) or viewed genres as a concern, what I do find most concerning is your shame. It's clearly distressing you. I encourage you to talk to a therapist about why you are so painfully ashamed and yet why you seem drawn to it. I think it would be helpful to learn why you have sought out those subjects and learn to not be ashamed of what's likely natural curiosity. There's nothing malicious in your searches. Please don't feel like you're some kind of disgusting freak or whatever when it's just the way you are. And understanding the why's and how's will help you not longer be that way.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcdig2/porn_addiction_unloading_accepting_accountability/haih898/"}
