I had a long term relationship collapse spectacularly, and porn was a huge factor.\n\nMy ex's reliance on porn and the escalation of it meant it wasn't long before his tastes were things I could not fulfill.  It destroyed what sex life we had, and made me feel so unattractive, I nearly plastic surgery to get his attention, but opted against it because even if it meant he wanted sex again, it would mean I was just an object, that he didn't want ME.  We went to a sex therapist and he got so defensive about it that no progress was made before he quit.\n\nI felt ugly and unwanted for YEARS, my self-esteem run into the ground. I was starting to spend more time at the bar just so strangers would hit on me, because my ex couldn't even get it up for me, nor did he even try.\n\nPorn itself is not a big deal.  But porn that inserts itself into your life will fuck you up, as well as any intimate relationships you may want to have.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcdig2/porn_addiction_unloading_accepting_accountability/hakrfd3/"}
