Porn is still bad. It is an industry that has a major hand in human sex trafficking. It causes normal, ordinary things to be sexualised beyond belief. My Little Pony is sexualised for god's sake.\n\nIts racist, sexist, misogynistic (thats a part of sexism), hundreds of girls and women go missing daily around the world to later have their violated bodies put across porn sites. \n\nGo search up about Pornhub and the CP that used to be on it. \n\nThen there are the 17 year old girls who used to post on Twitter about wanting to be 18 to make an OF. They were groomed by online paedos and perverts. Most women on OF dont make a living off of it. Only the top percentage do. The rest screw the rest of their lives up because many firms will not hire ex sex workers. (Look at those teachers who get fired after their pasts are found by students).\n\nGirlsdoporn is a major example. It looked like a relatively legit porn company and then it turns out it's full of blackmail, rape, cp and coercion.\n\nPorn causes physiological and mental ssues on boys and men. And causes societal; physical and mental problems on girls and women. (Even the ones who dont watch it. These women are harrassed in the street, abused in the sheets and victims of murder and violence by porn addicted men). \n\n(India as an example. Porn has to led to high levels of violence against women in India.)\n\nIt has led to decreasing birth rates in Japan.\n\nLed to missing and/or dead women across the world.\n\nPorn is bad. Will always be bad. Has always be bad.\n\nUse your imagination. Why would you wank to strangers having sex? You wouldnt wank to a hot strangers you see on the street. Why would you wank to one on a screen?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcdig2/porn_addiction_unloading_accepting_accountability/hakx366/"}
