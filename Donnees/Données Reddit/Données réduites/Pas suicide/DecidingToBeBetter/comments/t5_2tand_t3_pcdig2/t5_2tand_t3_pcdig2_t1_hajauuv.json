You have a sense of what is right / wrong / acceptable and unacceptable. \n\nPorn addiction is no joke. I've been there. Sort of. What pulled me through, was to tackle it sort of like you would every other addiction through a 12 step program. One day at a time. I've relapsed after that, but I don't punish myself for it, and rather acknowledge the fact that I'm human and by no means perfect. But when I've relapsed, I've started the process again from scratch. \n\nAnother thing I did was to write down all the these thoughts floating around in my head, No matter how ashamed, embarrassed or disgusting I found them. I'd write them in a note app on my computer, and after I had read through them and gotten of them I chest, I'd delete it. It was my way of getting it out in the open, and off my mind. \n\nYou'll get through this.
