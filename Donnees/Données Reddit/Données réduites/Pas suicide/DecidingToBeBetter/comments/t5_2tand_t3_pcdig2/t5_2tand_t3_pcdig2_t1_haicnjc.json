Sorry, to clarify I'm not necessarily looking for help (although the words of encouragement are EXTREMELY helpful at the moment). I happen to have the greatest partner in the world, who has been talking me through all my bullshit while simultaneously dealing with the fact she is the victim of my lying. Writing it out here creates accountability, allows me to journal my thoughts (a lot of \"What was I thinking?\" moments at the moment...like, literally, WHAT WAS I THINKING? I DON'T KNOW!), and will *hopefully* stop someone from going down as far as I have. I've been on a few sites like NoFap, etc and the things some people are admiting to there are...they are very, very dark. It is terrifying. I am not a psychologist, I don't know how much of it has to do with porn addiction. But I don't want anyone getting to where I did, and I sure as hell don't want anyone to get any further.\n\nThank you for your post though! It's good to keep those points you have mentioned in mind.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcdig2/porn_addiction_unloading_accepting_accountability/haicnjc/"}
