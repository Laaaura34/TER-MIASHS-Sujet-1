I am happier now than I've been in years. But this doesn't have to be the end for your relationship.\n\nThe first step is acknowledging it.  You want to change, and you have realized that you have the power to change.    Talk openly with her. Maybe go cold turkey from anything sexual for a few weeks, or even months.  I firmly advocate a sex therapist if you are open to it.  My ex only agreed because I pressured him.  You need to do this for YOU.  You are hurting yourself, your significant other, and your future right now.  But put the work in. You can make it.  If you care for each other, you both want it to work.\n\nGood luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcdig2/porn_addiction_unloading_accepting_accountability/hamdfjr/"}
