I don't see how porn itself is always bad, the ease of access to it and desensitization of youth to sex is obviously harmful but it's out there whether you want it to be or not. It's the parents job to make sure their kids aren't watching it or explaining why it isn't reality and can be addicting and harmful. If you're consuming outrageous stuff then that's a personal issue on you. Once In awhile my wife and I will watch a porn together, I don't see that as a bad thing, or when I watch it alone when she's not there and I'm in the mood or vice versa.. I just disagree that porn is always bad. The problem more lies in our responsibility to use good judgment and properly educate our kids when that time comes.
