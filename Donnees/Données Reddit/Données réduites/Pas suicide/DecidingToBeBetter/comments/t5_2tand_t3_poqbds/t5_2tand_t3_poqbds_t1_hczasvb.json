They should have lots of helpful staff to look over your resume, help with interviews, and supply you with a list of places that are hiring. I understand how you feel. It's a scary time. You can also look for work from home jobs. There are still plenty of large businesses who are keeping their employees at home until things greatly improve. And to help you feel better, try guided meditations and listening to positive affirmations. They'll help your mind and body.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/poqbds/i_hate_looking_for_a_job_no_one_will_hire_me/hczasvb/"}
