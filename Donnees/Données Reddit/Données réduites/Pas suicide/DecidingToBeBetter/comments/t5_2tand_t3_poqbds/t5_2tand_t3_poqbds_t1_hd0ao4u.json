If your CV isn't that good, it might have a very low success rate, but sometimes it can lead to opportunities where you least expect it. \n\nMy CV is pretty crappy because I have rather limited work experience for my age and there are pretty substantial gaps between jobs. So normally HR deps won't give me the time of the day and I have a rejection rate of around 90%. And yet, one day I sent such an 'unsolicited application' to a pretty fancy hi-tech company in my area expecting absolutely zero. Three days later I was on a video call with three of the top R&D managers from that company, bypassing who knows how many screening calls/pre-interviews/assessment centers etc.\n\nI haven't gotten a job offer yet, but still this anecdote shows the (potential) power of this type of application.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/poqbds/i_hate_looking_for_a_job_no_one_will_hire_me/hd0ao4u/"}
