Know ur definitely not alone. Places keep complaining about workers quitting bc they\u2019re finally fed up with not being paid enough and then the irony is when you apply they make you jump through so many hoops that they can\u2019t even fill in their understaffed spots!!!! It\u2019s pretty ridiculous. If your not hearing back from companies and jobs, I\u2019m not joking when I say that you might hear back from some of them within roughly 2-3 months, bc that\u2019s what happened to me, I wanted a summer job so I could make money in between school and instead they contacted me this week as I\u2019m about to leave. If you want a job then I suppose the best advice is keep looking but judt know that it\u2019s all set up in a way to make us look lazy blame us for being lazy and then fuck us up just in so many ways. I recognize and see ur work ur putting into it and I\u2019m proud of you!! I hope it all works out soon", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/poqbds/i_hate_looking_for_a_job_no_one_will_hire_me/hcyraao/"}
