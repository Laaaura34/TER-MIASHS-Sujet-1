I know both readings are free PDFs on Google books. \u201cThe Science of Getting Rich\u201d is spiritual / metaphysical, but very short and easy to read. If you are not religious, you don\u2019t have to take it literally; just take it seriously. These will teach you how to reset and improve your orientation to the world and reframe the problem. \n\nI suggest these because what stands out most about your post is \u201cevery time I see a help wanted sign I feel\u2026\u201d This is probably your biggest barrier right now. You can retrain your unconscious mind to see every help wanted sign as an OPPORTUNITY. Changing our subconscious response to things like that can be hard, but is absolutely possible. I know it is possible in your case, I know you are capable, because you want to change and get better. The evidence of that is your post here. \n\n\u201cJust keep swimming\u201d is fine advice because perseverance is an essential part of survival, let alone flourishing. But it\u2019s not enough when someone is stuck in a rut. There has to be a change first. Good luck!\n\n\u201cEvery day, in every single way, I\u2019m getting better and better.\u201d", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/poqbds/i_hate_looking_for_a_job_no_one_will_hire_me/hczzb1y/"}
