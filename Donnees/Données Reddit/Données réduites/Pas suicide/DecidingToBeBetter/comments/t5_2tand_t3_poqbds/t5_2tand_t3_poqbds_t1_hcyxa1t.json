Factory work does not require much people-contact, and factories are looking. \n\nAlso - for every 100 resumes you send out, you get 1 call back. For every 6 call backs you get 1 interview. For every 10 interviews, you get one job. Don't let your family get you down!\n\nYou may want to join us over at raisedbynarcissists.
