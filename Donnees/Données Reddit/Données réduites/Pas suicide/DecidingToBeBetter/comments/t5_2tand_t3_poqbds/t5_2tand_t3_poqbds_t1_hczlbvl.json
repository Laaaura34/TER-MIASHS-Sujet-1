When the benefits ended, I thought well now I need to work, but I also wanted to do it for myself cus I was starting to go crazy not working for so long. Anyway, I hunkered down and, I shit you not, applied for at least 130 jobs in a day. I have a shitty resume, I\u2019ll quit a place after a couple weeks if I don\u2019t like it. I would go on Glassdoor and indeed and click literally everything. It took about a week but I got a gig at a doggy daycare place. It\u2019s not what I wanted, but something is better than nothing.
