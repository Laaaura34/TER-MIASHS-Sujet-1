I am just getting started after a year and a half off (Dying parent, couldn't work). Know that you're not alone in feeling that way. Prior to quitting, I was a cook for 3 years. I have a Bachelors degree, and about 5 years of corporate sales experience. Now i cant even get a phone interview. Even worse many of the jobs out there sound like what i hated about working sales in corporate America.  \n\n\nIn reality, getting a job is a grind, soo much bullshitting of cover letters and careful phrasing of your answers becomes second nature. Add to that people often ask, \"Well what do you want to do?\" I dunno man, it would be faster to say what I DONT want to do since post graduation i was pigeon holed in sales. Which I got fed up with to the point I took a huge paycut and became a cook/chef. Now i feel like I'm back where I started years ago when I got out of sales.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/poqbds/i_hate_looking_for_a_job_no_one_will_hire_me/hczlmjv/"}
