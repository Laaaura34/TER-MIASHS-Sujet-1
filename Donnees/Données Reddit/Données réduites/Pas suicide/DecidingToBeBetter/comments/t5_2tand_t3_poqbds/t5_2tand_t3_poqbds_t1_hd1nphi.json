The business could be inclined to hire you, because that would save them a lot of money and trouble by avoiding the whole hiring process. Even if the business doesn't need anyone right now, they might save your application and contact you in the future when they do need a new employee. \n\nSo in my eyes sending unsolicited application often have a higher success rate, and you don't lose anything by doing it. Sending unsolicited applications also shows that you're a person that takes initiative.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/poqbds/i_hate_looking_for_a_job_no_one_will_hire_me/hd1nphi/"}
