In my relationship I dedicated a portion of my time and energy to \"us\". Eventually I realised the break up was an opportunity for a fresh start and that I had all that time and energy back.\n\nI started jogging and also hit the gym. I got into martial arts which led to me meeting my best friend. I was single for six or seven years, and honestly it was great. I decided to pursue a new career, which paid off. I was in shape with a new job and a new life. I was in control. I grew to love it. Everything was coming up Milhouse.\n\nI met a few girls during this period, however when things started heading for a romantic path I backed out. It was hard at times, for a little while.\n\nOne day one of these girls stuck around in my life. We dated, married, and started a wonderful family.\n\nI can't tell you how to stop using sex as a coping mechanism. I can only point out a great opportunity sits before you, waiting for you to take hold of it.
