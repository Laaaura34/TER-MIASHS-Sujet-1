So it somehow worked lol.\n\nAlso I'm 19 so not that much difference, but im starting to work out this whole adult life thing and living on my own. Hopefully it won't be as hard as it feels.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nhn34u/i_feel_sad_confused_and_lost_i_feel_like_the_odds/gz24gc5/"}
