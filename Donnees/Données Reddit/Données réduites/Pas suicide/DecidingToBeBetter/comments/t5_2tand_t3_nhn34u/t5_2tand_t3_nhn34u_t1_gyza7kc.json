Don\u2019t cling too much in the future either. Do have goals though... use your almighty brain and set them. Start with easy ones like doing your bed every morning. Focus. Truly focus .. just sit there for two min and think of your breath. Find yourself and start turning the pages of this chat in your life. ( find inspirational videos on YouTube and listen to them) You can only do this. Believe in yourself. I believe in you my brother/sister.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nhn34u/i_feel_sad_confused_and_lost_i_feel_like_the_odds/gyza7kc/"}
