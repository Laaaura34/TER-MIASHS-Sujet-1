My second advice is to give yourself  and the people around you some grace, right now everyone is struggling and on the backfoot emotionally. This doesn't mean entertaining toxic people. I have issues with unstable and manipulative broken parents too, and I found that boundaries are essential. They will keep treating you like the child under their control/protection until you define your adult relationship with them for yourself. You can get close to your mother and understand her on your own terms, she is the contributor of half of you, after all. Nothing you've describe is insurmountable or permanent. Just get yourself in a gradually better position by working a little towards it day by day.
