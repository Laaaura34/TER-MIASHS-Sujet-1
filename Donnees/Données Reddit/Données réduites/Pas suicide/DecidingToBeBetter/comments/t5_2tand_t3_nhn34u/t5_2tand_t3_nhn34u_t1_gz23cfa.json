Growing up in a toxic household really sucks and draining. I hope that both of us will be able to move out soon. I do want to study abroad but that's really expensive (the process of getting the visa approved is expensive itself) but thank you for your suggestion.\n\nIt's good that you already have a plan considering that you're still a high school student. I hope that you get succesful someday. \n\nAnd don't worry, I won't give up!!!
