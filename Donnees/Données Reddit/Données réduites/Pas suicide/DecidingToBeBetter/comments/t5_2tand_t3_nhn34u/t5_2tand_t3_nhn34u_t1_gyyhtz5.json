But I think you\u2019re relying on others too much. Many people have to work to pay for their own schooling. I suggest continuing trying to get a job. The way the companies are treating you is how they treat everyone. They see a lot of resumes and have a lot of interviews, and they just don\u2019t follow up with most people. Keep trying until you find something! It might take dozens, or a hundred attempts.
