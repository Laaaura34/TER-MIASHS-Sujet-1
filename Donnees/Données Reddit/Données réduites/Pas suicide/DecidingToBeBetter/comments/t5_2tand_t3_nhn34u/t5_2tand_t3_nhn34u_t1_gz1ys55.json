I don't know what you and your wife are currently going through but whatever it is I know that you can get through it.\n\nI did try setting up an online shop before, it didn't end well. I realized that I don't have much connection and that I don't know much how to market my product. I currently don't have a startup money but once I do, I plan on trying again. \n\nApprenticeship is uncommon here in my country maybe unless you have a connection? Apprenticeship, afaik, is usually offered to college students.\n\nI am happy that you enjoy what you are currently doing!
