Whatever happens, you should know that I believe in you. \n13 Years ago, I was in your place. I had no job, almost no savings, and unsupportive parents. (I could have gotten free student \"loans\" if my parents had signed a paper showing their salaries. They refused. They signed it 5 years later when my brother asked them without any hesitation, though.) \nI applied at McDonald's and got a job. I flipped burgers and cleaned the bathrooms. I was always polite to customers and my managers. I came in on off-days when asked. That way, I was able to afford a small room. I washed clothes, bedding and anything by hand for months, and hung them dry. I didn't have a closet, but just a shelf and a curtain in front of it, after getting my first paycheck. Meanwhile, a lot of friends made good money. \nBut I realized soon that their time frame isn't mine. So I persevered and focused on myself rather than everyone else. If things go as planned, I will open my own law firm in a few months. \nI did it, and so can you. I believe in you. \n\nOpen your eyes to see. Open your heart and mind to learn. Open your arms to welcome the world. If you find your arms and hands tied up, holding you back, cut those ties. If it's a person who's trying to retain you, do the same. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nhn34u/i_feel_sad_confused_and_lost_i_feel_like_the_odds/gyyj0i0/"}
