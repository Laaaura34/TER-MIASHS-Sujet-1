It's just really hard for me in the past few weeks because problems kept on coming. I also don't have a good support system so I had to carry all these emotions alone.\n\nAnyway, I want to congratulate you for your career advancement. You deserve it! And it's never too late to learn something new, I am glad that you are learning and doing well at your 40's!\n\nAnd you're right, it's better trying and failing than not trying at all. My confidence is scarce lately but i am working on it. I am trying to look for a job right now, if I fail, I will just try again. \n\nThank you!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nhn34u/i_feel_sad_confused_and_lost_i_feel_like_the_odds/gz20e5k/"}
