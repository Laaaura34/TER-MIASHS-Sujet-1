It's not your fault that so many in your generation are missing out on work and study opportunities. \n\nMay I recommend that you try to recentre your goals around things that are within your control? Ei, if university is not possible right now, looking at independent learning opportunities (MOOCs, independent study groups, etc). I am not saying \"just fix everything on your own\" or downplaying your problems, but just looking for paths out of your current dissatisfaction. Good luck to you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nhn34u/i_feel_sad_confused_and_lost_i_feel_like_the_odds/gyx6ub5/"}
