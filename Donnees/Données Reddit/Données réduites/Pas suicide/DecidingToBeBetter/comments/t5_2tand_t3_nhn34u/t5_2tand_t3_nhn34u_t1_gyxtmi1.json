If we always rely on others to be supportive then we set ourselves up for being hurt. Not that we should not have a good support system but do not depend on it. YOU can do this, let that sink in. You do not need your family to help or be supportive. You have untapped strength in you, its right there. Take things one day at a time. You may have long term or large goals you want to complete but its really about the small steps.\n\n\"The more we value things outside our control, the less control we have.\" Marcus Aurelius.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nhn34u/i_feel_sad_confused_and_lost_i_feel_like_the_odds/gyxtmi1/"}
