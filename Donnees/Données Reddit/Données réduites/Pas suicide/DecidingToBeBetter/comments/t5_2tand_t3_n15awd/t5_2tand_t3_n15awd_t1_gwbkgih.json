One of the things I struggle with the most is recognizing the ways my parents contributed to my current struggles, because there is such an invalidating attitude of owning your circumstances and not blaming others.  \n\nBut, at its core, ownership is often not taught to us by parents, teachers, or authority figures, because that would allow us to question the effectiveness of their \"authority.\"  So, if something good happens, we internalize the message that it happened because we listened to authority, and if something bad happens, we internalize that it was because we failed to listen to authority.  \n\nThe result is terrible self-esteem, because we never get to own the good and always have to own the bad.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n15awd/if_you_have_trust_issues_and_a_bunch_of_toxic/gwbkgih/"}
