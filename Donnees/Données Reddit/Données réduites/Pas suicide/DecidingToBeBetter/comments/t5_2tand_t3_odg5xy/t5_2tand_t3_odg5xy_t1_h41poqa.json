If they choose not to attend, that should be on *their* conscience and not yours.  \nYou did your part by inviting them! You made it clear to your parents that they are welcome in your life, so they are the ones who decide whether to accept that or not. It's their loss and their mistake if they do not.  \n\n**Second, is it possible that your sister is wrong?** I don't know everything about your life so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. You didn't hear it from them, you heard it from your sister. Again I don't know any of you so maybe she's being honest or maybe she's mistaken or lying.  \n\nMy best advice would be to give them the chance to come clean. Tell them you want them to be there and share your joyous day, and ask them if there's any specific reason why they won't attend. Their answer may hurt you but at least you won't have to wonder forever. Then you can move on and live your life *with or without their approval*.  \n\n***Again I cannot stress this enough, it is not your fault if they choose to reject your invitation.***", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/odg5xy/parents_dont_want_to_attend_my_wedding_because/h41poqa/"}
