She's a real one.\nI'm sorry your family isn't on board, but it sounds like you knew this was coming.\nSend them a gift for your wedding, perhaps a book about being good, healthy, supportive parents. Let them know you love them, but you won't make the same mistakes in terms of turning your back on your children(if you choose that route)\n Congrats to you and your partner. I wish you both health, wealth, and luck in this adventure we call life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/odg5xy/parents_dont_want_to_attend_my_wedding_because/h41yfzy/"}
