The more you try or the more negativity you throw in this situation, it might make them dislike you more. You might give them more reasons to not accept you.\n\nStop caring about your parents approval.\nAnd just focus on improving your life. For you and only you. No one else.\n\nNot to sound cliche, but..\nLet go of wanting your parents approval. You really dont need it. You only need your approval. Not your parent's and not your partner's approval. Only yours.\n\nAt the end of the day, you only have you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/odg5xy/parents_dont_want_to_attend_my_wedding_because/h57x32t/"}
