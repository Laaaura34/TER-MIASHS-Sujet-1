Keeping the date in case they change their mind? They likely won\u2019t. N even IF they do, it\u2019s only because they feel guilty. Do you really even want them there if they don\u2019t even want to go? \n\nAlso, to say if they don\u2019t go, you won\u2019t even stream it for them, that\u2019s exactly what they want! You would be doing them a favor by not putting them in a position to feel like they have to/should watch it.\n\nDrop the sense of guilt you\u2019re feeling, wondering if any of this makes you a bad person. You\u2019re just trying to live your life. If it took a long time for you and your parents to get to this point, including them being physically abusive with you as you mentioned, and now where they\u2019re accusing you of being selfish and making everything about you and not wanting to go to your wedding, maybe you should just accept this is the best it\u2019s going to get.\n\nNo point in putting so much thought into spiting them (not streaming it, wanting them to carry guilt in their conscience forever, etc) because then that\u2019s what will be on your psyche that day, rather than focusing on what matters, and that\u2019s one of the most special moments in your life.\n\nFUCK EM\u2019.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/odg5xy/parents_dont_want_to_attend_my_wedding_because/h41m9mv/"}
