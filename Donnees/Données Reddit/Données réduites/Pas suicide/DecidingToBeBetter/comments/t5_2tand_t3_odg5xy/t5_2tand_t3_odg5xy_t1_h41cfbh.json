NONE. They have to earn your time and interaction. They are not owed it. If someone tells you \"here, carry this spiky iron ball for me\" and then walks away, how long do you hold it? How long do you sleep with it, take it to work, hold it in the shower, set it on your lap while you're working, all the while it digs and scrapes into you and causes blisters and wounds and exhaustion, before you realize that person is never ever coming back and there's no point to holding this damn thing that brings you nothing but pain?\n\nThey can have their ball back when they show up. Til then, leave it on the side of the road.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/odg5xy/parents_dont_want_to_attend_my_wedding_because/h41cfbh/"}
