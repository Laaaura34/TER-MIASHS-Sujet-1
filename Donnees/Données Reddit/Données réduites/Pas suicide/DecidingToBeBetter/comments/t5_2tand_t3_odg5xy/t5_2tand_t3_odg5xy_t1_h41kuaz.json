Having family or any other guests at a wedding is because they wanna be there to witness it, since your family has decided to opt out they\u2019re deciding they don\u2019t wanna share that moment of you and your partner being happy together and celebrating that love. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s bad at all for not streaming the wedding and wanting them to have it on their conscience that they decided not to come. Every action has a consequence and since they\u2019ve decided to not come to your wedding, which I would assume is no doubt a very important day for you and your partner they should feel bad about it cause they should at least support you as a person even if they\u2019re not coming cause you\u2019re gay. \n\nAlso wanted to add that I hope you and your partners enjoy your wedding day and the wonderful future that\u2019s awaiting y\u2019all.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/odg5xy/parents_dont_want_to_attend_my_wedding_because/h41kuaz/"}
