I think that's a totally fine decision. That said, I feel like streaming a wedding is just frikkin cool, especially if you have relatives or friends who are too far to travel. If you don't though, then it makes sense. My partner and I have discussed getting married in private due to our unpleasant families. I don't really care to hear anyone's input on the matter, at this point, and maybe that's where you're at, too. Just take a second to make sure that your plans include the people you want to include and that it serves your needs and desires now, and for the future(as well as you can predict). It might be nice to have some other records for your future anniversaries, even if you don't have a stream. \ud83d\ude0a", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/odg5xy/parents_dont_want_to_attend_my_wedding_because/h41xqad/"}
