They're keeping them to themselves because they love you and didn't want their struggle to hurt you. They may be struggling to accept your sexuality but they still cared about you enough to congratulate you. They obviously didn't want to take away your joy over the occasion, but aren't ready yet to be overjoyed with you. \n\nYour parents still have time to process this and decide to come. Give them space and time, and hopefully they'll come around. If they don't before the wedding, that's their loss. You should enjoy your day however you'd like. You don't have to stream it, but also don't not stream it just to spite them. Wishing punishment and regret on someone isn't going to bring the relationship closer. Maybe streaming it would actually help them realize how silly their hesitations are and would help them accept you and your partner so they don't miss out on other important events in the future.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/odg5xy/parents_dont_want_to_attend_my_wedding_because/h42xtv9/"}
