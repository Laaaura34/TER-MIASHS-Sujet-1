So we're keeping the date just in case they change their mind. But if they don't, I'm not even going to stream the wedding for them. If they don't come to my wedding, I want them to carry that in their conscience forever. Does that make me a bad person?\n\nA lot of people here are essentially saying that you shouldn't feel bad cause fuck em that's why. Which is not a way of thinking I agree with and suspect you don't agree with either. However if they have decided themselves to not come to your wedding then you shouldn't feel like a bad person for not showing them your wedding.
