If you are too tired to drive a car, dont drive into work.  If you stayed up all last night drinking or yelling at your dog, or throwing up from bad food, I would say the same thing.  I don't care why you're tired, when you're piloting a 1+ ton chunk of metal at 65mph, being tired is a problem that'll get you and/or somebody else killed.\n\nI'm not saying there won't be consequences to calling out.  I'm saying those consequences are preferable to having the fire department pull you out of the car in a spineboard.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt1ep1/my_phone_is_literally_killing_me_i_need_help/hdu6ojp/"}
