I have a similar problem and I\u2019m considering switching to something called the Light Phone 2. If you haven\u2019t heard of it, it\u2019s basically a smart phone stripped of all features except for the essentials i.e. calling, texting, maps, music, and some others, with more to be added in the future. It\u2019s a radical change, but I think it\u2019s something I want to eventually do, because I would rather not live the rest of my life worrying about being distracted by my phone. It\u2019s not for everyone though.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt1ep1/my_phone_is_literally_killing_me_i_need_help/hdvfa3b/"}
