Check my comment history. I definitely don't troll anyone. Your problem is having the same opinion as everyone else. I'm trying to be patient with you. I'm genuinely a really empathic person. The issue we have is instant gratification. We want everything now and that's been exacerbated by technology which causes addictions like this. However since they're not physical they're really easily combated, and people just don't do it. Can't you see that the logical steps that everyone has suggested to op are obvious? Sleep mode on the phone. Having it in a different room. Turning it off. But he doesn't want to do that. For any and every change, you need three things in place. You need to be ready, willing and able. If you're ready and willing, but not able, you won't do it. If you're willing and able but not ready, it won't happen. If you're able and ready, but not willing... You get my point. This person knows in their heart what they need to do, because they're really obvious solutions (don't keep the phone in the room etc). My issue is not wanting to help someone who clearly doesn't have a real interest in helping themselves. Why does that make me the arsehole? Please, honestly explain. I love nothing if not discussion. Especially where I could correct behaviours. Not a troll. Honestly.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt1ep1/my_phone_is_literally_killing_me_i_need_help/hdukl04/"}
