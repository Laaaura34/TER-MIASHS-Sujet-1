I read that some Silicon Valley workers turn their phone displays to black and white. It makes it more boring. I did it and I actually look at my phone substantially less now.\n\nIf you go into display settings there are options on iPhone. I\u2019m sure other phone providers have similar functionality. \n\nI also turned the ringer and text message alerts off completely too. I get a light vibrate if I have incoming calls and messages, but it\u2019s not too disruptive. \n\nI also moved my mum and my partners numbers to be my emergency contacts. I completely disable my phone from having any incoming messages or alerts or calls in night mode. I turn on night mode as soon as I go to bed. This way I don\u2019t get interrupted, but I know if there\u2019s an emergency I can be contacted. \n\nGood luck. You can take steps to reduce your usage.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt1ep1/my_phone_is_literally_killing_me_i_need_help/hdw27nq/"}
