But it is hard to do that when you are suffering from an addiction! So, make night time the time when your phone charges. Plug it in in another room and head to bed. You can\u2019t get up and take it with you now because it\u2019s charging, and if you don\u2019t let it charge you won\u2019t have it the next day!\n\nIf you have wireless headphones, I suggest sticking a podcast on the phone and then heading to bed. Wind down with the podcast and when it is over, if you are still awake, take your phones off and go to sleep.\n\nGood luck! This is a very common problem, good on you for getting on top of it", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt1ep1/my_phone_is_literally_killing_me_i_need_help/hdwt8ev/"}
