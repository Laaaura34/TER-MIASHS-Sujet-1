If you go on your setting sometimes it\u2019ll have the option to help with that. On my phone it\u2019s labeled as \u201cscreen time\u201d and I can do things like cut access to certain apps at a certain time. When I have to work, I try to stay away from my phone an hour before I want to sleep and do leisure things, like puzzles, writing, reading, drawing. \n\nAlso, watch this. It might help! \n\nhttps://youtu.be/bV_NdUZEmnE", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt1ep1/my_phone_is_literally_killing_me_i_need_help/hdtd1un/"}
