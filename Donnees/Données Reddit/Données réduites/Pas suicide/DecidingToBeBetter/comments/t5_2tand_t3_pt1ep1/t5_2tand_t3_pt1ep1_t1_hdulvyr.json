Are you capable of doing unpleasant things normally? Can you study an entire day if it's required, can you upkeep a routine to keep your physical fitness average? Are you able to eat healthy? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't want to sleep either, sure, it makes me feel better overall but it's boring as fuck, even more so with insomnia and sleeping difficulties, but I'm a worse being if I don't get enough sleep and it'll most likely lead to me dying earlier so I have to, which is why I do. I need to sleep 8 hours a day, if there's something truly important I've already fucked up because I should've scheduled better and will do my best to improve it in the future.\n\nI don't follow a religious routine, I go out on most weekends, but on weekdays I'm at bed eyes closed 10 pm. If I think I'd rather browse stuff on my phone for 3 hours before I go to bed then I go to bed 3 hours early and browse my phone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat you've described can't be normal, I'd suggest booking a meeting with some sort of doctor and explaining this to them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt1ep1/my_phone_is_literally_killing_me_i_need_help/hdulvyr/"}
