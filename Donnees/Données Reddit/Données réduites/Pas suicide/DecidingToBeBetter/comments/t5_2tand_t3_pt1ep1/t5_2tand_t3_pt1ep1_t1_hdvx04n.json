I disabled a lot of notifications and Do not disturb mode was my best friend. These helped but then about a month ago I lost my phone and had to get a really cheap one on short notice. Bummer at first but it's the best thing that's happened to me this year. \n\n\nIt's low on storage so I can only have two social media apps on it. \n\n\nIt's slow so I hate using it for long amounts of time. \n\n\nIt even dies quickly so I can't use it for over 3 hours at a time. \n\n\nI still watch Netflix but on my PC so I don't binge anymore. I'm reading books again. I'm sleeping better. Generally feels like my days are longer.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt1ep1/my_phone_is_literally_killing_me_i_need_help/hdvx04n/"}
