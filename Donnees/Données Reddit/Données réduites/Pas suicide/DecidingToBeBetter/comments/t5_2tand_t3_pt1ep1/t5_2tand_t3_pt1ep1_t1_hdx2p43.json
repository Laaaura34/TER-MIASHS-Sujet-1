However I too used to stay up past 1am just looking at things on my phone. I decided I had to stop because I got my first 9-5 job and I need to get up by 7. Melatonin REALLY helped me. That might seem like a \u201cyea, duh\u201d thing to say, but the melatonin makes me so tired that I physically can\u2019t look at my phone anymore and I fall asleep quickly. Just thought I\u2019d throw that out there in case it\u2019s something you haven\u2019t tried yet.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt1ep1/my_phone_is_literally_killing_me_i_need_help/hdx2p43/"}
