You\u2019d know that it doesn\u2019t matter that something isn\u2019t \u201cinteresting\u201d, you\u2019d know that its because of the dopamine it gives you. If you could block all the dopamine receptors when you did the thing you were addicted to, you wouldn\u2019t do it. (Unless it\u2019s meth or something due to physical symptoms) Anyways, the phone itself isn\u2019t addicting, it\u2019s all of the things that were engineered by teams of social scientists and shit to make it as addictive as possible. You\u2019re on Reddit making dumbass comments yet you say you don\u2019t see how it could be interesting\u2026 I think you\u2019re just a troll. Unfortunately it\u2019s worked but yeah fuck you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt1ep1/my_phone_is_literally_killing_me_i_need_help/hdufc5k/"}
