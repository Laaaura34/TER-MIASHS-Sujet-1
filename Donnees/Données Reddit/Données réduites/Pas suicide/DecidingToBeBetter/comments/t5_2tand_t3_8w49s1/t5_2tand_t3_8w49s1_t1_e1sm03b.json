I'm an alcoholic and just started working on my recovery and going to AA meetings, so I'm also working out most of this myself. Like other alcoholics and chronic worriers, things that are outside of my control...I obsess over them, too much. I have a committee in my brain that is constantly debating policy and sometimes I need them to just shut up so I can enjoy my life.\n\nI'm learning to just tell my brain no and force myself to mentally move on. It sounds simple, but it is working. Actually taking notice of my thought patterns and making a note of it in a journal or elsewhere, taking note that I while I have very little control over many things, I do have some. I identify the variables which are in my sphere of influence and focus on those aspects; evaluating the potential courses of action and outcomes. I make a decision about, then I check it off a list. Now I tell myself, I have addressed it, I can move on. I might have to repeatedly work with myself about it, but I can't tolerate giving any more of my life away to worry and obsession.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8w49s1/i_would_like_to_worry_less_about_things_out_of_my/e1sm03b/"}
