It can rob you of \"self\". If this was my friend I would tactfully request their help with fun ish things I'm working on. Planting in the garden on a nice day, trying a new recipe, a multiplayer game, checking out the new place in town, a wood working project or a volunteer opportunity. I wouldn't overwhelm them with requests, but ask them with some frequency. Be there with them so they can realize you're there for them. Social media can be particularly bad for this mindset but they'll need to decide to control that on their own accord,", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ovy2v9/what_should_a_person_with_no_interests_do/h7chbnq/"}
