If I have a big project, I will set a goal to work just 10 minutes on it.\n\nA sample to-do list for me is: 10 minutes of yoga, start a spreadsheet on house maintenance for taxes and floss.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fjkiv4/how_can_i_become_a_doer_rather_than_just_a_planner/fknlabl/"}
