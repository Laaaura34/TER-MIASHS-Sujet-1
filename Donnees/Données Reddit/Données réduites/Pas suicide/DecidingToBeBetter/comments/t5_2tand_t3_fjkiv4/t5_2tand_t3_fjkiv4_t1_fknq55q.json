Also making a \"To Do\" list makes me feel overwhelmed while making a \"Done List\" makes me feel accomplished so I'm more likely to get up and do more.\n\nI would think this is way more than you wanted to hear . . . showing that Yes Indeed!!!  I struggle with wasting time . . . .so I'm off to find the email address of someone I need to email, find my cell phone and eat some breakfast.\n\nBest of luck to you today in getting up and at em!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fjkiv4/how_can_i_become_a_doer_rather_than_just_a_planner/fknq55q/"}
