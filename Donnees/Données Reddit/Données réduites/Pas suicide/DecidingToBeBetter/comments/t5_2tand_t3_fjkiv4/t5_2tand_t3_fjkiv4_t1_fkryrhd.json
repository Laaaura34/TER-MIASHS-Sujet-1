I hope you are enjoying this time of your life.\n\nI don't mind talking about it publicly.   I should warn folks that because of my depression, I probably break things down into smaller steps, expect less of myself and consequently I write things down that might be inconsequential to others.\n\nBefore the internet and computers (yep I'm a crone), I bought Sierra Club weekly planners every year and wrote down what I did on each day in the calendar.  Now I just have a Pages Document that I write it in.\n\nI don't have one particular time that I input tasks on my \"Done List\". If I skip a day it isn't a biggie.  I do it to make myself focus on my accomplishments so mostly  I write task down when I'm feeling overwhelmed, discouraged or distracted.  I find it a bit of a pick-me-up.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fjkiv4/how_can_i_become_a_doer_rather_than_just_a_planner/fkryrhd/"}
