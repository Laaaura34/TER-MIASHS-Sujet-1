I know I push myself to do things when I think of deadlines rather than plans. Sure, I can think all I want about what I'll be doing on my next day off, but when will that day off be? When will I start doing the things I am planning on doing?\n\nPlanning things doesn't always mean they will actually happen, depending on what it is you are specifically planning for. Sometimes you need to leave room for improv.\n\nIf you want another example, I take improv classes every Monday. When I first started, all I did was think about a line I could say to take over the scene without ever actually tagging in. I would stand there thinking about a scene that could've been. When I do end up tagging it, it almost never goes according to plan.\n\nAll I need is one idea to start me off and to take the initiative whenever I can. I need to decide WHEN as much as the WHAT and the HOW. \n\nYou just gotta pick the right time without worrying too much over a detailed plan. You can plan because it helps you start somewhere, but you need to expect anything and everything. You need to take that risk.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fjkiv4/how_can_i_become_a_doer_rather_than_just_a_planner/fkod8iy/"}
