I am literally a reflection of this topic. My planning level is like I am a president of my country and I haven't got a minute to unplanned. I am not trying to exaggerate but I even thought of planning my toilet time for a sequence someday. But the thing I learned is you are not a clock or computer algorithm that can work out flawlessly. Flawless people don't live in Earth. So because of my problem with planning, I have failed always. Hence, I started to develop fail fear and it got me so hard. Luckily our community response was pretty helpful to me and I hope, to you.\n\n\"A Failing plan is planning to fail\"", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fjkiv4/how_can_i_become_a_doer_rather_than_just_a_planner/fm1nyuz/"}
