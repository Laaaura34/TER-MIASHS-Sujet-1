Make a plan/set a goal to do something completely trivial.\nGive yourself a reward when you do it.\nMake the next plan.\n\nMost of the time we set goals/make plans and fail at them it's because we make them too big and scary.   Make sure any plans you are setting are something that can be achieved easily in a short amount of time.\n\nIf your plan is to learn French, that's a terrible plan because it's not something easily measurable, and depending on where you want to end up can take many years.  Your plan needs to be something like 'practice your french for 10 minutes a day'.\n\nThere's plenty of good resources online about good goal setting (which is basically planning).", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fjkiv4/how_can_i_become_a_doer_rather_than_just_a_planner/fkq2n8p/"}
