I'm useful\" . . . .hmmmm . . . . this could be viewed as virtue signaling but I'm trying to be much more upfront than just signaling!!!!  (-;\n\nHere is my done list for the last hour or so:\n\n1. 10 min of yoga\n2. started laundry\n3. loaded and started dish washer\n4. tried to floss but out of dental floss (found more)\n5. started a spread sheet for house maintenance 2019\n6. had my Dad take eyedrops and made him drink water (he is 84)\n7. put the washed sofa cushion covers back on the cushions\n\nI did more than my actual list stated in the above post which makes me feel good.\n\nSomeone suggested to me to recognize the difference between a project and a task.  Making a spreadsheet on house maintenance expenses is a project; finding the checkbook so I can look up what what checks I wrote for maintenance is a task . . . . so I set out to just find the check book nothing more.\n\nLots of projects you absolutely can not finish in a day.  Beating yourself up for not doing the impossible is, of course, counterproductive.\n\nI'm really really appreciating you all asking me about this.  It helps me a lot.  Feel free to put on your Done-List that you supported a depressed old lady in quarantine to get things done!\n\nI used to have a group of friends I could email my done list whenever I wanted but one of them had trouble with my sexuality (pretty weird but there you are) \n\nSo . . . .off to find the checkbook, keep the laundry going and find that email address.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fjkiv4/how_can_i_become_a_doer_rather_than_just_a_planner/fknz7b0/"}
