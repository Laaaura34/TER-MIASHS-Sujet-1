Just do it. The issue comes when it\u2019s time to take action and we find reasons to justify inaction, like wanting to wake up early and then going back to bed. There needs to be knowledge of something you gain when you do these things. If I could explain it scientifically your gains would be attributed to thd fact that your brain is plastic and molded by your actions both physically and mentally, as well as genetics. Repetitive actions become wired into our being, and we can actually feel how it is wired into us as we feel a sudden sense of comfort when we, say, look at our phone when we should be studying, or when we play video games for hours. What you gain when you do something tough and power through it is that you kill your negative perception of the action that is hard for you take and replace it with the reality of the experience. Once you get out of bed early and just start your day you\u2019ll find that your perception of what it wouldve felt like is far worse than what it actually felt like, or starting a new hobby as well, it ends up not being as difficult a task as you made it out to be. The key is in repetition. The more you do anything the easier it becomes to do, like with people checking their phone. It is only easy to look at your phone impulsively if you repeat picking it up all the time. To build new neuropaths you have to repeatedly feel that discomfort so that it becomes more bearable and easier over time to deal with. It\u2019s legitimately like a muscle.\n\nThat said, you just gotta do it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fjkiv4/how_can_i_become_a_doer_rather_than_just_a_planner/fkpy54s/"}
