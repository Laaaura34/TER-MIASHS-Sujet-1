I went through something similar and got out of it by just doing that. Also, I broke down my goals into smaller chunks and just ensured that my today was better than yesterday. Make small progress each day. Take one day at a time and be patient. You'll get there and enjoy each day.\n\nAlso, keep off the antidepressants. They don't work in the long run. Workout / exercise or play a sport to get that extra rush of blood flowing through your body and you'll feel good. \n\nJournal things each day or two and take a weekly or a monthly check at it. You'll be astonished to see how far you've come.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fjkiv4/how_can_i_become_a_doer_rather_than_just_a_planner/fknxgyi/"}
