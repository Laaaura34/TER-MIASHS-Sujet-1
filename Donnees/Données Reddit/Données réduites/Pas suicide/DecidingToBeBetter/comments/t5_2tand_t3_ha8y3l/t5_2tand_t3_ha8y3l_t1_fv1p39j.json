The only answer is to write. Nothing is harder to deal with than an empty page. Put down a page of utter crap, and it is a world better than that empty page. Crap can be edited, but the blank page is death.\n\nIf you have been dealing with depression and a job you hate, you may have needed to heal. Give yourself that credit. And, if you still want to write the book, write the book. Pick a time, and write for 1 hour a day. If you can't think of anything to write, write \"I can't think of anything to write\" over and over. It works. How can I prove it? I have 5 published books, and I also have trouble with putting things off.  https://www.amazon.com/TS-Rhodes/e/B00FD66IL6?ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1&qid=1592336459&sr=1-1", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ha8y3l/im_so_fucking_lazy_i_wasted_this_whole_quarantine/fv1p39j/"}
