It\u2019s a precedent set in place at the beginning of a relationship. Personally I define cheating to be doing anything which I or a partner wouldn\u2019t do in the company of each other.\n\n\u201cPushing the boundary\u201d should only happen if both people are comfortable changing the boundary, not as an excuse after being unfaithful. From reading this post I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty clear the guy posting wasn\u2019t comfortable in having a more open relationship and that\u2019s fine. People are more than entitled to feel that their partner, not belongs to them but are \u2018theirs\u2019. Both of them sign a \u201ccontract\u201d to each other when they get together and either can break it.\n\nIn this instance she broke it by talking to someone else and the guy posting has more than enough reason to end it because he feels he\u2019s been cheated on.\n\nIt isn\u2019t one size fits all: \u201cwe should all love each other\u201d.
