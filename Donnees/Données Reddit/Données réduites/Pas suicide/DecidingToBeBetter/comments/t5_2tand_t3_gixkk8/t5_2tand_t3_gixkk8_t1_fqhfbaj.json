I've not jumped into a new, unhealthy relationship, when not fully healed and grown as a person - which will only cause further damage to her.\n\nI hope one day she realizes she needs to be alone for a while, to grow as a person and find out what she wants, rather than just clinging on to people to distract her from herself. Only then, can she find someone right for her.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gixkk8/girlfriend_of_25yrs_left_me_for_someone_else_im/fqhfbaj/"}
