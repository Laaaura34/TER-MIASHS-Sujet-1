But I was talking specifically about her - I don't think she'll be able to properly work on herself while in a relationship. She lets the relationship distract her from who she is, who she was and who she could&will be. I very much doubt that she'll be able to find herself while in a relationship - hence I said she needs to be alone for a period of time in order to do this. But who knows? Maybe this isn't the case and she can grow as a person while in a relationship.\n\nI don't accept our relationship not fulfilling her needs as an excuse for her to emotionally cheat. If she was seeing futility in our relationship, she could've just talked to me about it and we could try and work things out. She never did that. Cheating on any scale is immoral. It's kinder just to let the person go before getting involved with others.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gixkk8/girlfriend_of_25yrs_left_me_for_someone_else_im/fqhvmkk/"}
