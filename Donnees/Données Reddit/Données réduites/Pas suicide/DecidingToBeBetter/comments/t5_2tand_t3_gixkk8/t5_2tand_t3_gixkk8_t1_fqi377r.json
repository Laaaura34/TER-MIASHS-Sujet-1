Changing as a person is a long term thing and I completely understand why you're so enthused right now to improve yourself. More credit to you for taking the positive route out of this shit situation. I expect the sudden and urgent  motivation for you to better yourself will peter out over time into a more gradual sustainable personal growth and I think it's important you're not your own worst enemy when you're not making the progress you want to immediately.\n\nI hope that's not condescending this is really only from my own experience :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gixkk8/girlfriend_of_25yrs_left_me_for_someone_else_im/fqi377r/"}
