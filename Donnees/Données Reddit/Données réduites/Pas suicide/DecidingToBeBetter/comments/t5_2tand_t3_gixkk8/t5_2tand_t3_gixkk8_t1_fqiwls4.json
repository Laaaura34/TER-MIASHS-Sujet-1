You can't really prevent it and you have to make peace with that. People usually go off into the deep end at this point. Love is a lie, women are monsters. Don't do that. Let it go.\nInstead, think of things from a different perspective. Best case scenario, you're both happy in healthy relationships in the near future. And it's gonna be hard but forgive her because you loved her and hope the best for her.\nBut don't be a martyr. Don't sacrifice your own happiness. You've listed all these things that help you improve as a person. Find something that makes you happy. Maybe it's playing video games with friends. Maybe it's playing the guitar. Focus on your happiness as well as the self improvement.\nAnyway, best of luck my man. Life is tough, life is suffering, but also life is beautiful.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gixkk8/girlfriend_of_25yrs_left_me_for_someone_else_im/fqiwls4/"}
