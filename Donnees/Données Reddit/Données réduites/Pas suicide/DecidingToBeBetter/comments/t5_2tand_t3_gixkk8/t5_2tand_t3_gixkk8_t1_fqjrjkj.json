A goal should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time Based (SMART). \n\n'Exercise more\" should read as Run 3 times per week for five kilometers until I can do it in x minutes. What you have is more akin to wishes. \n\nA goal is the journey not the finish line. Make your goals something you can see progress in or it will always feel like you are never accomplishing anything.\n\nAnd most importantly, and this is one that a lot of people forget:\n\nRECOGNIZE AND CELEBRATE WHEN YOU ACCOMPLISH YOUR GOALS!\n\nYou know how many times someone loses fifty pounds only to want to lose twenty more without recognizing how far they have come? Don't be that guy! \n\nAlso don't read this as me coming down on you. I only want to lift you up. Your journey is just getting started and I am trying to throw you a map.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gixkk8/girlfriend_of_25yrs_left_me_for_someone_else_im/fqjrjkj/"}
