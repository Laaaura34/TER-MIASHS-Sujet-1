No, because that's physical cheating - the one most people think of when hearing the word cheating. To my knowledge, she didn't do that. But by having feelings for someone, texting them, flirting with them behind the back of their partner. That's emotional cheating.\n\nHere's a definition of cheating\n> Someone who is in a\u00a0committed relationship\u00a0and breaks the trust of his or her partner by getting physically or emotionally involved with another person.\n\nBy secretly liking him, texting him and flirting with him, she was getting emotionally involved with another person.\n\nPeople have different boundaries of what they would consider to be a faithful relationship. This was beyond our boundaries. She used to get upset if I followed girls I know on Instagram! I found that to be very ironic.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gixkk8/girlfriend_of_25yrs_left_me_for_someone_else_im/fqjibyu/"}
