I like it because you're thinking from the end point looking back, which can help put things into perspective about what matters to you and what doesn't. If death makes you feel uncomfortable, I would still recommend you think about it because it's very important in a general sense. Makes you realize that we're all human and come to reality.\n\nBut if I had to mention another way to find out about your dreams, I would use the ol' \"Where do you see yourself in 5 years?\" It's clich\u00e9, but it works great. Think about what kind of person you are in 5 or 10 years. Where are you? What are you doing? What do you look like? What's your social status? etc.\n\nWhen you think about the kind of person you want to be years later, you know the end result you want. Now try to break down those into goals and actionable items (things that you can do *right now* that can progress you towards your goals).\n\nI hope that was clear and helpful. If it isn't feel free to ask again!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/euly87/how_do_identify_my_dreams/ffr2oj4/"}
