But it's not any funeral, it's yours. What kind of eulogy do you want to be said? What do you want your family to say? Your friends? Your coworkers? Your community?\n\nThink about that. Write down what you think of, and try to edit it the next day. Worth mentioning that dreams don't have to be grand material dreams, such as building a multi-million company.
