I'm exactly in the same position and is sooo good to hear from someone else trying to overcome the same massive struggles. I too started therapy and will be a long way to change some of my traits which have brought me a lot of pain over the years. I've always been my worst enemy, overly critical and analytical, always looking for plans or solutions, considering myself at fault for most things. I know this is the perfectionist type (are you?), ambitious, driven, workaholic. I've spent a lot of time in my life expecting the same from others and struggled to let go of things outside my control. While I realise that my ex partner is not a good match is still very difficult to stop thinking about the good times and the love I felt (still do to a degree). This acceptance, letting go and make peace with yourself is a tough one to break. Are you still in contact with your ex? Do you mind if we would continue to chat a bit?
