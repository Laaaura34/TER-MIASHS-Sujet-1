On paper she was the perfect girlfriend, but there was just something inside of me telling me she wasn't the one. We had so many great times together and she really loved me and made sure I knew it. There was just something missing, so I ended it. It was hard at first and I still think about her often, hope she's doing well and look forward to a time when we can go back to being friends. \n\nOne month to the day after we broke up, I met another woman who I connect with in ways I wanted to but just didn't with my previous gf. Things are going fantastic with her and we just got an apartment together on Wednesday. \n\nI know it's rough now, but you will get past this and find the right partner for you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gp73ve/ive_decided_to_be_kind_to_myself_after_a_breakup/frllcwv/"}
