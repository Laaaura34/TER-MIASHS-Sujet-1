However, have you heard of the 5 love languages? People tend to feel loved when their partner speaks their main love 'language' - meaning either quality time, touch, gifts, acts of service, or words of affirmation. It sounds like your main love language is gifts - and your ex-husband didn't understand because he spoke a different love 'language'.\n\nI used to be a \"flowers are just going to die\" kind of guy because gifts didn't mean love to me. I felt that the way I expressed love (touch & quality time) was enough. An ex of mine leaned more towards gifts & words of affirmation. Neither of us felt loved (keyword ex)...even though we both expressed it often - she gave me so many gifts & much praise (but little touch & time), and I gave her so much touch & time (but few gifts or affirmations). I learned that love doesn't translate unless you speak your partner's language.\n\nHad I understood this, she would have gotten all the flowers, gifts and words I could gather up!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gp73ve/ive_decided_to_be_kind_to_myself_after_a_breakup/frm6lts/"}
