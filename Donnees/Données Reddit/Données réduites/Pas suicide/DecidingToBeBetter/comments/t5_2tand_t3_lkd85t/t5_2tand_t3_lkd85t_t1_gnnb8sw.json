Also, I would explore the theme of shaming yourself for having thoughts and feelings - I know for me I was conditioned to think it\u2019s bad to think certain things or feel certain things - and that\u2019s something I still have to work on. It\u2019s definitely something that contributes to self loathing issues, and that can like fuel some of these self destructive cycles. I have to catch myself constantly and remind myself it\u2019s ok to feel and think things, that doesn\u2019t make me bad - it\u2019s your choices and actions that define you and that\u2019s what you should focus on in terms of like, judging yourself (not that you should judge yourself, but it\u2019s not super fair to invalidate your feelings or condemn yourself for a internal experience). Like you really have to drill into your being that you thoughts and feelings are valid, they are ok, and that you should like - support yourself when that difficult stuff comes up inside vs beating yourself up about it. You want to monitor that part of you that beats yourself up and tell it to go away.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkd85t/i_havent_cut_myself_for_over_a_year_how_do_i/gnnb8sw/"}
