Near by your box of collections and among the drawer's of exchange: you must rationalize how important sharp objects are to the household. My personal opinion is to take an onion. Take an onion, and sink each sharp thing into the flesh of the evervescent vegetable. After dawning onion juice on the metal, store said utensil safely. \nWhat this does for your false sense of self actualization...\n1) your body will sting more if said household utility items pierce you\n2) your onion odor makes it apparent why slicy things are dangerous (okifactory and sensational afliction, that sort of thing)\n3) you feel dumb when you take it out to use. Because that thing reeks. Its smelly and it has every right to be. Because onions are smelly. But you are not. (: dont be smelly like an onion \ud83e\uddc5\n\nEdit: olifactory nervous system*", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkd85t/i_havent_cut_myself_for_over_a_year_how_do_i/gnko306/"}
