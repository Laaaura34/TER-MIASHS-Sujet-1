That is a big accomplishment and you should be very proud. :) I am self-harm free for over 10 years now. When I was in my late teens/early 20s is when I stopped. The urges were soooooooo intense and like you shared, alcohol made them worse. It was a double edged sword because getting drunk allowed me to escape my feelings but then I'd become distressed and threaten self harm (my now husband's best friend almost called the cops on me one time). As I got older/the longer I went without self harming, the easier it got. The feeling never really goes away though. When I am really down or distressed, the thought will cross my mind but I don't act on it. Now it's almost like the thought itself gives me comfort rather than the act.\n\nIf you haven't already, I'd strongly strongly recommend therapy if you can. It has been life changing for me, honestly. If you can't, I'd look into some workbooks or YouTube videos on dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). The principles of DBT have been so helpful, especially discomfort tolerance and emotional regulation. I feel like, for me, self harm was a way to escape discomfort and something I (mostly) did impulsively. \n\nThe urges will become less over time and you've really done the hardest part so far by getting a year under your belt! Just remember that self harm may make you feel better temporarily but it always always makes things worse and more complicated long term. You've got this!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkd85t/i_havent_cut_myself_for_over_a_year_how_do_i/gnjxa0p/"}
