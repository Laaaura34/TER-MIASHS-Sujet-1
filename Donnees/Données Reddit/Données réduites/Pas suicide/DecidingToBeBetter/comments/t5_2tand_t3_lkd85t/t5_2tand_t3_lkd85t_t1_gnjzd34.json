It sounds like you've done a lot of work to change your life and perspective for the better, and that's not easy. I've certainly struggled with echos of unhealthy behavior, and here's my two cents: just because something is in your head doesn't mean it's a reflection of you, or your actual wants. Sometimes it's just your brain throwing out suggestions, like your phone correcting something to your ex's name. It's not a part of your life, but it was for long enough that the memory lingers. For me, what helps is to recognize the urge, acknowledge that I am _actively choosing_ to be different and to make better decisions, and then find a healthy behavior to replace it with, keeping in mind that doing so is an act of self love. It helps me to remember that the unhealthy behaviors were me trying to feel better, and while they aren't actually helpful and no longer have a place in my life, they still came from self preservation. \n\nI would also encourage you to look into toxic positivity, not because I think it's necessarily what you're experiencing but because I think you might benefit from a more accepting view of negative emotions. You've made all this progress, but I get the impression you feel like it isn't enough because you still have moments of negativity. I've found that a lot of my life doesn't fall into clean categories of \"good\" and \"bad,\" and constantly examining my life in those terms can lead to imposter syndrome. \n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you the best of luck \ud83e\udd1e", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkd85t/i_havent_cut_myself_for_over_a_year_how_do_i/gnjzd34/"}
