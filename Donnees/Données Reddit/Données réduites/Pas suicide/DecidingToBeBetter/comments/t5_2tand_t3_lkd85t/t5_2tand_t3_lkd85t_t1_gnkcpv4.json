Whatever the trigger, stressed, angry, etc. When you see the signal, you can adjust your reaction.\n\nYour mind is seeking pleasure essentially, and you can give it pleasure in healthy ways. Workout, a good meal, a break, taking the pressure off of the situation, a walk. For my bad habit, I don't have a single self-care that I choose to go for, but it depends on the trigger. I find that work stress is best treated by talking to my coworkers. Relationship stress is best treated with journaling and medation to shift my perspective and help me develop better relationship habits. I have last chance habits such as eating a big unhealthy meal or playing video games if things are pretty bad.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkd85t/i_havent_cut_myself_for_over_a_year_how_do_i/gnkcpv4/"}
