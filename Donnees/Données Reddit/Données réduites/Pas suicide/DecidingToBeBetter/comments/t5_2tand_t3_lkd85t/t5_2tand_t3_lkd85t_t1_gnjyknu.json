I think one thing that could help is a perspective shift. Right now, you are kicking the shit out of yourself for having the urge - you are basically telling yourself it\u2019s WRONG to feel that. It\u2019s not wrong to feel that, it\u2019s expected. You are recovering, it\u2019s not black and white, it\u2019s a process. Recovery has up and down moments. You are setting this expectation that you CANNOT have urges in recovery, and I think that\u2019s unfair. I don\u2019t think you can expect to never have urges, and you are making the urge mean failure, and it\u2019s not failure, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not getting better.\n\nI would try to condition yourself to let that go, and to understand it\u2019s normal to have the urge, and really celebrate how far you have come because you can watch that urge come and go and not act on it. Put the attention on that, because you\u2019ve made amazing progress. You work so hard, that\u2019s amazing, don\u2019t discount that. I don\u2019t know that those urges don\u2019t flare up now and again but you watch them come and go, you can say - no I don\u2019t need you. \n\nFor example - I used to have serious eating issues - I was a compulsive overeater. I am much better now, but I STILL have my moments where it flares up. I no longer shame myself for that, because that\u2019s not fair or realistic to expect myself never to be tempted by past struggles (and the good feelings you get from eating is addictive, so it\u2019s hard not to crave that!). I just choose not to act on it and celebrate that I have come so far.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkd85t/i_havent_cut_myself_for_over_a_year_how_do_i/gnjyknu/"}
