All I have to say is that every year of my life ever since I was 15 i felt too old to start art, so i didn't, and every year after I regretted not doing it and felt even older. Now at 23, I know if I had started at 19 I would be amazing rn, but I also have the emotional tools and perspectives to be able to function better and actually do it. In the end it's all about emotional regulation, motivation and drive force. Push through being uncomfortable, learn to be uncomfortable. Know that there's always going to be amazing artists but that is irrelevant to your journey", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdxyz7/i_want_to_learn_and_get_back_to_making_art_but_i/hawgc95/"}
