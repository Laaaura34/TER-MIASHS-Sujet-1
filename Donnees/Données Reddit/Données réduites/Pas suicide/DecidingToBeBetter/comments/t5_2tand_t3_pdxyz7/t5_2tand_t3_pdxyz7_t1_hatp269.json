Even in 90 years you won't ever be too old. Remember this. If Picasso was 80 when he drew his masterpiece, would you even care? Age is irrelevant. If you're alive, you have time. \n\n**Demoralization:** It can be demoralizing when you feel like you're not as good as peers. That's when self-doubt sets in. Self-criticism. Self-loathing. Self-hate. At some point you're going to realize that THOSE are the demons you need to work at defeating, not your external \"competition\". Those are the demons that will make you stop, so you have to learn to ignore them. They'll probably never go away (pretty sure they're immortal), but at least you can get them to the point where they don't affect you too much. \n\n**Advice:** Do you. Don't worry about what other people are doing. Keep going. Silence as much as you can the internal critic. Remind yourself it's not a race, and the time is going to pass regardless. In five years, will you be happy that you spent this time getting back to what you love and getting better at it, or that you stopped? Remember that the time will pass regardless of what you choose. \n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdxyz7/i_want_to_learn_and_get_back_to_making_art_but_i/hatp269/"}
