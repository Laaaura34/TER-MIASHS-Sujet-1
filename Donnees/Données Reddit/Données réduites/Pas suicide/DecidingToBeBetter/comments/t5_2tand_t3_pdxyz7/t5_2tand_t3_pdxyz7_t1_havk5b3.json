Then I moved out of my parents house and realized that there was a whole lot more to life. My suggestion would be to be constantly considering your perspective on life and always strive to grow as a person and an artist. Comparing yourself to others is one of the most difficult things to break a habit of (in my experience). Look up something called \"the imposter syndrome\". It affects millions all the time. \n\nKnowing those things, I would suggest sitting down and drawing for 10 minutes and just doodling. Don't try to do anything in particular or draw something good. Just let the pen flow and have fun with it. Keep doing this until it becomes a habit, and then trying to draw things to look good will become less disheartening. Remember that you draw for you, not anyone else.\n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdxyz7/i_want_to_learn_and_get_back_to_making_art_but_i/havk5b3/"}
