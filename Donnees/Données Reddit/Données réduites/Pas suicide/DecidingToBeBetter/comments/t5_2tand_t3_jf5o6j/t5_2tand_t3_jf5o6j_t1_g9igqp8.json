Rather, it's the past and reoccuring issues that were not resolved that built up resentment, which is what causes small things to escalate into bigger conflicts. \n\nIf you are serious about saving your marriage, please seek marriage counseling. I would also recommend seeing your own separate therapist prior so you may work out some of your own bigger issues.\n\nBest of luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jf5o6j/you_know_what_im_gonna_get_my_marriage_back_im/g9igqp8/"}
