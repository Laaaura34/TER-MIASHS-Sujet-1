Rest assured, you're not the only one and though you probably hear it all the time, you're relatively young still.  Knowing more of who you are, your identity, and what you're good at/love doing, to find maximal alignment is the best advice I can give you here.\n\nAlso, something else for you to consider for your depression/anxiety, is the food you put into your body.
