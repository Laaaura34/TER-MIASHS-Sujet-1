The first step for me was finding a point of focus and excel and grow there before adding in other things. My focus was career first because like you, I was working two jobs and barely making ends meet. I networked, practiced my interview skills and even took a lower paying role because I knew it\u2019d be more attractive on my resume. Not everyone has that option but I wanted to share how it started. In 5yrs I have ONE job that pays all my bills and then some, and I finally feel like I have the mental space to work on the other stuff. Money is a stress point and it is SO MUCH HARDER to get everything else straight before that is. I struggled with anxiety, depression, past traumas, was in an abusive relationship, and dealt with disordered eating. I was as low as I felt I could be. And for me what worked was exactly this. Figure out your job/career path first and get better financially, and then start on the other stuff. Obviously make small changes on other stuff when possible but stop telling yourself you need to be superhuman all at once. Plus side ull also be in a better situation then for a future family. Hope that helps and best of luck :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1a4oy/how_do_i_keep_up/hfdk4cl/"}
