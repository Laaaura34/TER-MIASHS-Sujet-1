A lot of people struggle with seeking help. I'm no medical professional, but it sounds like you might benefit from seeing a therapist in addition to your psychiatrist; numbing a problem with a chemical bandage is different from healing. There is probably additional trauma that you haven't fully processed that is contributing to your need to self-medicate with food. I think you're so desperate to feel some sense of control during a very confusing time in your life, plus you literally don't have other coping mechanisms in your 'toolkit', so you rely on one harmful tactic over and over and over to distract yourself and feel in control just for a few moments. One other thing, 18 is *way* too young to be giving up on life. At least wait til middle-age for that (semi-joking).", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mzzm72/18_years_old_and_suicidal_i_dont_know_where_to/gw3y2ec/"}
