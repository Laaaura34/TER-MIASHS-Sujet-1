First and foremost! I\u2019ve had MANY ups and downs in my life... soon to be 34 and pretty down right now. But when I was younger, I had to quit \u201cself medicating\u201d which for me was drugs and alcohol. I ended up hiking almost daily and putting all of my focus into at home workouts like insanity. Get yourself outside walking with some sunshine. TRAIN YOUR BRAIN (google it), and I\u2019m currently experimenting with meditation and yoga and honestly, the science around it it extraordinary. People like us, we have to exercise our minds and bodies always to balance chemicals. Of course, medication is key. Zoloft worked wonders for me as well as Xanax. Find some support groups in your area? Try to make some friends during activities. And HUG ALL THE DOGS! Or cats, whatever your preference. My dog is literally my emotional support and I get extremely anxious without her- she\u2019s so calming for me. Keep your head up hun. I PROMISE, just keep pushing through, life is worth living when you find yourself.\n\nExtra edit- I\u2019ve started gardening.... it\u2019s just something to keep my focus. I\u2019ve also done puzzles. And I clean constantly. Little activities with a goal help me stay focused- sometimes too much but it gets you out of your head for a good while.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mzzm72/18_years_old_and_suicidal_i_dont_know_where_to/gw4ayke/"}
