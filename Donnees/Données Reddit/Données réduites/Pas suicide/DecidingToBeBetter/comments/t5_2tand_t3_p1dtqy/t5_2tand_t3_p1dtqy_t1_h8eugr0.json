I got a job as soon as I could, I hated being on unemployment and at home. I went from: work, gym, school 7 days a week to suddenly nothing at all. \n\nI did start some hobbies, one of which I'd like to expand on and another that I've scince stopped learning (Portuguese) but I'm extremely grateful for my job. \n\nHonestly, im in a whole new industry and have a ton of potential to really start my career and increase my earnings. \n\nI'll be 30 next year and was terrified I'd never earn enough to buy a home but, based on my current trajectory professionally, I can probably put a nice payment on a home in the next five or six years.  \n\nFor me, being forced into a new industry was a blessing", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p1dtqy/i_finally_found_a_job/h8eugr0/"}
