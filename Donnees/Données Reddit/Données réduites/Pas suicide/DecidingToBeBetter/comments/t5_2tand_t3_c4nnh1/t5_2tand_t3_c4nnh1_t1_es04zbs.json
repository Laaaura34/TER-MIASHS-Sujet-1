And point taken.\n\n\nLook, chances are I am going to falter at some point; some day, I will feel like I trust myself enough again to have a drink. I may fall way off the deep end, I may not. \n\n\nBut if I do *that is okay* because the action does not negate the number of days where I did not, the action does not denigrate the spirit, one action does not define me and it never did. It's the habits we form that do!\n\n\nI'm straying from your original point which was well-received and heard, thank you. I guess all I am saying is that a lot of people are scared to falter because they believe one slip-up and that's it! You're done, you're worthless. But I disagree; if I slipped up *tonight*, I would still have 50 days to look back on and remember I can do it all again, and again and again! \n\n\nThanks for your reply and I hope you have a great day.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/c4nnh1/my_50th_morning_sober/es04zbs/"}
