I definitely have found that the more details I can get the more it resonates. And youre right I think there is a component of consistency to it.\n\nI usually meditate on it through writing it down. Then the next day I\u2019ll re-read it and add more details or tweak things or update things based on how it\u2019s hitting me that particular day.\n\nIn addition to clarifying the details, I really think you also have to buy into it. You have to really believe it.\n\nI also like to cut it from different angles. Maybe one visualization will specifically be directly tied to me accomplishing that goal. For example, if the goal is to finish a book, then one visualization could be you at the book launch giving a speech to your family and friends. But then I also like to do more indirect visualizations.
