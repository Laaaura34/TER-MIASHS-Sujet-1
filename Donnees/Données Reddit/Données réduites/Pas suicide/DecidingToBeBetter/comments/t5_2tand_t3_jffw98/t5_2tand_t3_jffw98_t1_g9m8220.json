The cheat code for me is finding what it is I *truly* strongly desire (through mindfulness and personal honesty) and then consistently checking in with myself (mindfulness) to see if the steps I'm taking are bringing me nearer to what I desire (personal honesty). Perhaps the hardest thing is being honest enough with yourself to be true to what you really desire, and mindful enough to see through all the deception and false ambitions that society, our social circles and other external forces trick us into thinking we truly desire.
