I have had that. The vision needs to be clearer. I often meditate on my visualization for 10-15 minutes in a dark and quiet room when I lack clarity. I also ramp up the details of my visualizations.....how will others react when I reach this future success?.....what will they say?.....how will the look of pride on their face make me feel?.....what will the day feel like?......what things will I be saying in that future moment? More detail helps a lot. Also, stay with it. It's a long game that really build over time. Visualizations get clearer and clearer and help more and more over time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jffw98/after_25_years_of_procrastination_and_unfulfilled/g9o8h1m/"}
