And a lot of your goals are solid.\nComments on your Goals:\nHygiene: showering is excellent, it\u2019s in a form a spiritual cleanse. You always leave a shower feeling lighter and refreshed. May as well point out that you may get the same benefits from being showered in breeze or anything that runs over your body, washing off things you don\u2019t need and that weigh you down.\nBrushing your teeth - three times a day may not be needed, for ease of sticking to your goal twice a day might be better and you don\u2019t want to over brush either. I suggest trying a good thorough clean 1-2x a day. Technique over repetition.\n\nFitness: pm me to discuss fitness in more detail if you like - I\u2019ve been trained in natural health for over four years and while not yet fully qualified can suggest material for you to look at and share what I\u2019ve learned.\nAnd a lot of your other goals are great, if you can I suggest adding more specificity, for instance:\nA friend - not even sure what the goal is...\nSocial skills - a great goal but how do intend on going about it?\nAnd if you like, PM me and (hopefully) I can be a friend and introduce you to many new songs, films and books, share cool recipes as I love cooking, and have been into most of the other things you mention that aren\u2019t as necessary.\n\nAll up well done. Remember you\u2019re not likely to be able to get everything right straight away, be patient with yourself as you conquer more and more of your goals! Best wishes!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pe7gtw/i15f_decided_to_try_to_get_myself_together_again/haw08a3/"}
