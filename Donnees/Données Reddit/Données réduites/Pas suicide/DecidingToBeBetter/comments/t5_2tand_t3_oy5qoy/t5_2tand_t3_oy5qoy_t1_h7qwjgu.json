Im going crazy with all the free time I have. I do a bit of dabbling in stocks which helps but I've concluded that this time is probably the last time I'll ever get time like this until I retire. So, I've been working on projects I make for myself. Like this summer I started a garden. Now, I am working towards building some type of social media content creation/at least a social media advertising account or two. Anything I think I could relatively be interested in I just do. I honestly cant wait to get back to work but the pandemic caught me by surprise and I didnt withdrawal from my classes correctly so my gpa is in the gutter. Regardless, movement is the answer.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oy5qoy/been_unemployed_since_the_end_of_may_what_are/h7qwjgu/"}
