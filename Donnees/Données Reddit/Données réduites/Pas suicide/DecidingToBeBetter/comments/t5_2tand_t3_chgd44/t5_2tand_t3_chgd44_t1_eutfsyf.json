Just learning. But here are some tips. \n\n1. I realized that people have few funny stories. And they repeat it more often than they realize. So have ur collection and rehearse it. When a conversation moves to something remotely close to your story, then use it. \n\n2. Weather. Weird, but people love talking about the weather.\n\n3. Try making everything a story. Instead of - \u201cIt rained and I was soaking wet\u201d, say \u201cI was out for literally 10 seconds and the rain came crashing down. And then right after I make it back, it totally stopped. Stupid stupid rain.\u201d Definitely not super funny, but use the intonation right. \n\n4. Movies. Shows. Documentaries. Even if you watched a movie and totally hated, try telling it as a story as to why you hated it. \u201cI\u2019m never ever watching another Monty python again. I\u2019m pretty sure the writers were high on mushrooms.\u201d\n\n5. Make observations. Any thing interesting that you wanna know more about? Write it down in your own little note pad so that you can go back and learn more about it.  Right after I watch a movie or show, i think about funny moments or something that was worth noting. If you are talking to someone, be genuinely interested in what they have to say. \n\n\nI dedicate few hours on weekend catching up on things that I hear in conversations. I figured the reason I\u2019m not good at talking is because I lacked the material. \nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/chgd44/how_to_not_run_out_of_things_to_talk_about/eutfsyf/"}
