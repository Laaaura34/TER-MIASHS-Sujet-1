But it's hard to find such a group, that's the reason I made this post.\n\n> And maybe try using these websites \n\nThanks, I will check and give a try.\n\n> Tho I wanna say, your BF is quite lucky to have you, my family aren't even supportive of me in anything, neither were my exes and friends, but if his passion and purpose is writing he won't give it up, maybe just let him have a break from it and enjoy life, there's more to life than just writing and it'll definitely help him in the future if he decides to continue \n\nThank you so much <3 I hope I can support him this way forever...\n\nI hope you also find a support, thanks again :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kujxlc/help_and_feedback_need_to_for_improving_writing/gisjdlz/"}
