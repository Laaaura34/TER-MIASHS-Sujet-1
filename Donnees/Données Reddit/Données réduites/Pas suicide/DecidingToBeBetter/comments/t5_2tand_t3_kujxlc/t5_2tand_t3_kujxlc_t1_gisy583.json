The second post (pinned) was for writing critiques and self promotion. This might be what you\u2019re looking for. Unfortunately, without seeing some posts and responses, It\u2019s hard to tell the quality of the interaction. Many writers go to college to get a Master of Fine Arts (MFA). I\u2019m sure that a lot of their graduate degree time is spent writing, reviewing with their peer group/professor & editing their work. I have a close friend who is a playwright and did exactly this. It\u2019s great of you helping your SO work through the difficulties of attaining his goals.
