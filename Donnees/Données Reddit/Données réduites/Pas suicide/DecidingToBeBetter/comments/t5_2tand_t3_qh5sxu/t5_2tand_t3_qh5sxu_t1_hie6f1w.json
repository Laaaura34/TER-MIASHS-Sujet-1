All of the things you worried about as a teenager, stop worrying about (as long as you're safe). People aren't judging you. The likely won't remember you. If people do judge you, just leave them. Your an adult and can go anywhere you want. It's not high school. You don't have to be stuck in toxicity. Even if you're the toxic one, you can decide to be someone different.\n\nIf I could do my 20s again, I would have had more sex honestly. Once you hit your 30s, you start losing energy, sex drive, you get responsibilities like kids and it's just harder to do. But in your 20, especially after college, you can go have as much consenting sex as you want and no one else needs to know. Do crazy freaky things and find out what you like. Most people find their looks later in life and miss being able to experience them younger. Again, be safe but live it up.\n\nTraveling is another big thing. If you have a few years at s job you hopefully have some savings. Once COVID dies down, and before you buy a home and get kids, dog, job that you can't leave for months at a time, go somewhere, anywhere. Awkwardly try to learn about the world. Be nice and people will accept you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qh5sxu/how_do_you_live_up_your_20s/hie6f1w/"}
