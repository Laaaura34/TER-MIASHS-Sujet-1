I'm on the edge of turning 26 now but I've spent that time making an effort to get out and do more.\n\nCOVID was actually a big motivator. When we had a break last summer I went on a spontaneous trip with a friend and that really have me the kick in the arse I needed to accelerate doing more things and being more social. \n\nI met someone on that holiday, moved to her country, made friends and made an effort to go out, socialise, etc...\n\nIt's been really rewarding, and I still find time for just chilling at home when I fancy a break.
