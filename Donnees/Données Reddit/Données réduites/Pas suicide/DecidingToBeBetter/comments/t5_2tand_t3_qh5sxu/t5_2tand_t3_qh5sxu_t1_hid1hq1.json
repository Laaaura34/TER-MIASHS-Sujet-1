Literally anything that makes you happy and alive. I\u2019m only 21 but Ive done alot of clubbing and traveling pre covid when I was 18-20 and its only now that I realise I didn\u2019t do them for my self and my enjoyment but because its what everyone my age was doing. Don\u2019t think you are at a disadvantage to be happy because of your social anxiety it just means what makes you happy and alive is different to people who don\u2019t have social anxiety. Find something or someone that makes you really happy and just live and don\u2019t feel bad you didn\u2019t spend time getting shit faced its not as good as everyone on social media makes it out to be", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qh5sxu/how_do_you_live_up_your_20s/hid1hq1/"}
