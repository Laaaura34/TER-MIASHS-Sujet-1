The way I see it, is that I could guarantee id have a great time in my 20s, do all of the stuff while I can, fore went school, became a bartender, knowing that school was always an option. I'm now nearly 30 without a college degree, but why do I need one of those? The future of the country, the planet, international economies, and society at large is in such limbo, the future of millennials was never really a guarantee, so why put all my eggs in that basket? I already know that marriage and kids was never in my future, I would never bring a child into this world knowing that we are on the brink of collapse and their life will be mostly suffering. So I sacrificed a potential future for a guaranteed great youth. I have no regrets.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qh5sxu/how_do_you_live_up_your_20s/hicng4x/"}
