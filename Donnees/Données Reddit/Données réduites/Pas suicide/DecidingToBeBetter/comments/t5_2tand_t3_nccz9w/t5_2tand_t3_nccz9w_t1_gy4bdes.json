That being said your working on improving yourself as a person so be patient and allow yourself the time to grow. You mentioned your sister leaving the house in the next two years or so. Knowing when she will leave is great because it gives you a time to figure it all out before she leaves. I\u2019m sure there will be days when you will be stressed without your sister around, but you should be fine. Job hunting can be tough so keep searching! When your financial situation improves I\u2019d suggest counseling if your not already doing it. It\u2019s a great way to talk things out and work on skills for the future.
