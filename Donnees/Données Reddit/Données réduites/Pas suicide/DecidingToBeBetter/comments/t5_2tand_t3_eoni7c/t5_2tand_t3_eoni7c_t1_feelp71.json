This last bout was about 6 months, where I was renewing my high every hour or so, depending on the day. I was in a haze. The sweating and dreams kinda sucked for a few days, but there's not really any symptoms other than just kinda wanting to get high again. No different than trying to eat healthier. It was easy if you just stick to it and keep your mind to it. It too less than a week to feel normal. Lately, I went running, been more outgoing, and actually talking to people on dating apps (my crux being an introvert). Smoking constantly exponentially increased my introversion. \n\nSend me a message if you ever want to chat about what you can do to keep your mind off it, how I felt coming off it, or for any other reason.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eoni7c/deciding_to_quit_weed_heres_my_story_and_how_weed/feelp71/"}
