I've mostly kicked my addiction to weed bht but it was hard for a while. \n\nThere was a point where I couldn't enjoy anything if I wasn't high. Taking a nice walk? It's fine I guess but this would be so much better if high. Watching a movie? What's the point if I'm not high. Hanging out with friends? Better hit the one hitter on the way over.\n\nI wouldn't say I used a specific technique, I just realized eventually that I wasn't doing shit with my life and I was much more effective when sober. I used to call my sober self \"super me\" and I didn't get to see him often.\n\nDefinitely don't regret quitting. I smoke once in a while now and I regret it almost everytime.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eoni7c/deciding_to_quit_weed_heres_my_story_and_how_weed/fefeg0b/"}
