I was addicted to weed for a lot of years and it was exactly like you described, most of the time my only satisfaction was smoking, although my high tolerance didn't even get me proper high, which is what I enjoyed at the beginning, it was just the addiction toying with me.\n\nIn my case I quit once I couldn't find any more reliable dealers and also because of some health issues (lungs mostly). I haven't smoked in over a year and I don't miss it at all. You can do it too. Just stick to your regime, don't look for your dealers anymore and don't hang out with the people you used to smoke weed until you're really over it for good.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eoni7c/deciding_to_quit_weed_heres_my_story_and_how_weed/feehp50/"}
