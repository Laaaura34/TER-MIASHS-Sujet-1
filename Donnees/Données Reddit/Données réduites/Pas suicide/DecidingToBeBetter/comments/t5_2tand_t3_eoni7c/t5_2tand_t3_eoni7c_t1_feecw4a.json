It\u2019s def not easy I know this, as I decided to stop smoking a while ago, and it\u2019s def been difficult staying away from it. I live with my fianc\u00e9e so there isn\u2019t anyone stopping me from buying it and smoking whenever I want to, but I tell myself that this discipline will pay off for me eventually. I don\u2019t want anything to hinder me from making more money and reaching my goals. \n\nA few things, if you do want to quit and stay off of it you have to eliminate anything in your life that enables you. Delete your dealers number, and stop hanging around people who also smoke. Talk with your girl, this is big. You cannot be around anyone who smokes right now, because you\u2019ll get right back into it. If your girl doesn\u2019t want to stop I\u2019m sorry to say that you need to either spend less time with her or just end the relationship. \n\nYou can def do this but it\u2019ll be extremely difficult. It\u2019ll take a lot of disciple but will bring you so much freedom in the future.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eoni7c/deciding_to_quit_weed_heres_my_story_and_how_weed/feecw4a/"}
