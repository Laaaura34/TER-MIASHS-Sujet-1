I take numerous t breaks a year (usually 2-8 weeks). The best advice is just stop. It\u2019s okay to want something and not give in. \n\nBest advice is fill the time you would normally be burning with something else. My buddy and I would go hiking or running when we break or I\u2019ll pick up a new game or something. \n\nBeing busy with work usually helps so maybe you can pick up more shifts. \n\nAlso dude WTF drop off resumes?
