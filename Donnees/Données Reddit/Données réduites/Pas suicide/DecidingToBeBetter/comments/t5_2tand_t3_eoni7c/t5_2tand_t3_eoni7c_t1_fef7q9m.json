It is interesting what you have said, how weed has turned your life into \u201ca boring unfulfilling haze\u201d. When you do something that much, it kind of becomes your default setting. Can\u2019t have any *less* dopamine than that, unacceptable, maybe you can seek more from other things, maybe not. It is hard to keep that up. It takes guts to hit the reset button, and let your brain readjust the dopamine function to normal again. I suggest that soon after you stop, try and get into something new, maybe try some stuff you never did before? I think if you just quit and don\u2019t fill the space with anything, that could be really hard.\n\nI know it isn\u2019t the same, but I have been on antidepressants for years now, and the way you described \u201cboring unfulfilling haze\u201d really spoke to me. One of the things they don\u2019t tell you about anti-depressants is the numbness you can feel. I feel numb to most things, nothing really awakens a sense of urgency, even things that really ought to. I feel like maybe my brain is too used to these pills and I need to reset too. I think I have been drifting for years, too afraid to give up because maybe I will feel worse. But it is right, OP. *You* are right. Just remember \u201cIf it\u2019s meant to be, it\u2019s up to me\u201d - somebody said that to me the other day and it really stuck.
