Weed is really not the problem, the problem is you really like weed and you need more discipline with it. Some people have this issue with food, a lot of people have it with alcohol as well. Lots of people use food, alcohol, and weed responsibly; building discipline takes a long time and there\u2019s no short path to doing so. I agree your brain would develop best without any substances. I wish you luck and I hope you practice self love/appreciation during all this-don\u2019t be super self critical as it\u2019s probably counterproductive as it makes you stressed.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eoni7c/deciding_to_quit_weed_heres_my_story_and_how_weed/fefl46v/"}
