The only reason LSD and psylocibin are not addictive is because your body builds tolerance too fast for you to become addicted to it.\n\nI get what you mean. There isn't any evidence that it isn't either though. From my experience alot of people I know who are stoners act like full blown drug addicts. Maybe there not chemically addicted, but I don't think a sane person would tell them to try cutting back. They would tell them abstinence. I can tell you smoke though.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eoni7c/deciding_to_quit_weed_heres_my_story_and_how_weed/feg0wk9/"}
