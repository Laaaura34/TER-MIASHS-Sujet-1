I too, have been an avid smoker for some time now since I was out of high school. Only 22 now and want to pursue a CDL career and then later eventually become a police officer. I know more than anything that I am fully capable of stopping because I had taken breaks from the mjs for 3 months period when ever I felt I should stop but lately, I hadn't taken any sort of long break from it. What really got me was that last week, I was called by a trucking company to set an interview so I can start somewhere in the CDL field and I instantly looked up how far they drug test. Turns out I'd need to be clean for months on end to fully pass the reqs for their drug testing. That hit me hard, knowing that I cant even properly apply for that field because of smoking. I'm stopping for the greater cause which is my future. Almost all of my friends smoke and my gf does as well but it really is a mind over matter on stopping. Keep on with the progress my man. Get a calendar and mark off every day you get by without smoking.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eoni7c/deciding_to_quit_weed_heres_my_story_and_how_weed/fef01m3/"}
