I am so sorry to hear you had to experience any of that, you certainly didnt deserve any of that and neither did I, though I still struggle immensely with this as it's still very very recent and fresh to me. I could certainly use a support system. I'd love to chat more if you're up for it. Could really use some good people who know what theyre talking about and who want to be better people overall. Thanks for reaching out, and again go ahead and DM if youre comfortable.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p7wvi2/breaking_the_generational_toxicity/ha08vqk/"}
