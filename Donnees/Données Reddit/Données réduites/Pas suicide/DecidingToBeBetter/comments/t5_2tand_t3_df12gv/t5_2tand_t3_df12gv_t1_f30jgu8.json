If, for example, your parents didn't care for you in the way you wanted to be cared for, you seek this from a partner.  Similarly, if you are angry and seek out arguments or fights, you are really just having a proxy battle against your parents or some authority figure from childhood.  \n\nRelationships are built on two currencies that are often mutually exclusive - power or empathy.  When you approach things from a power mindset, you will always assume that you have to have power over others or allow them to have power over you in order to be cared for.  However, when you approach things from am empathetic mindset, you stop wasting so much time and energy on silly power games (and the people who play them) and gain the ability to laser-focus on meaningful relationships.  Perhaps the most empathetic thing in the world you can do is to simply learn to say and hear the word \"no,\"  which is consistent with your approach that relying on others gives them unnecessary power over you (which can be abused if left unchecked by a simple \"no\").", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/df12gv/i_saw_a_quote_on_how_people_are/f30jgu8/"}
