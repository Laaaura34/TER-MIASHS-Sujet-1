The story they tell says they are happy because they treated themselves better, but when you really look at it, they only stayed happy and fulfilled because they had relationships in their life. It's not intentional or malicious, but it's a double standard that the people who tell these stories are unaware of. Bluntly, it's saying, \"I turned my life around, made friends, fell in love, and I'm much happier. But you, guy without friends? You don't need friends and love. Just, like, be more confident or something.\" You wouldn't tell a starving person that they don't *need* food and they just need to believe that they're getting proper nutrition and they'll be healthy again. \n\nSimply put, life is objectively better with positive people to share it with, and there is absolutely no replacement for a sense of companionship and belonging.
