I\u2019ve been struggling with my mental health ( a lot of personal shit going on I don\u2019t have control of.) I deleted Facebook, Instagram is harder because I do use it for shopping and finding local places so I only removed it from my phone when I have occasionally checked in my web browser I regret it every time and close it pretty quickly. I see people posting about the good things in their life and these are people I like so I am happy for them but I notice I feel pain seeing it because of my current situation. So I will continue to stay off it it and honestly it gives you more time to work on things. I\u2019m finally reading the books I\u2019ve been carrying around and practicing new skills so maybe it can also help you just take that step into going to the gym or trying new things!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qevgo0/comparing_myself_and_my_life_to_others_feeling/hhw3u2l/"}
