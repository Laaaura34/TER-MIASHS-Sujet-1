We want to instinctually get in bed and never get out again. That\u2019s the worst thing you can do. You are literally making it worse by sitting around.\n\nSo sort your life out when you are depressed. Accomplish small tasks and goals and kick the day right in the nuts. I also find meditating helps, adding a little bit of mindfulness and cognitive behaviour therapy. I use headspace but there are loads of apps for it.\n\nOther than that just keep fighting it. Tomorrow will be better if you make it better. Allow yourself to be depressed and if there is a reason behind it, come to terms with that as fast as you can. This is why headspace was good for me, it allowed me to see when I was thinking emotionally and when I was thinking logically.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7xlv1s/does_anybody_have_a_depression_playbook_they/dubfh8f/"}
