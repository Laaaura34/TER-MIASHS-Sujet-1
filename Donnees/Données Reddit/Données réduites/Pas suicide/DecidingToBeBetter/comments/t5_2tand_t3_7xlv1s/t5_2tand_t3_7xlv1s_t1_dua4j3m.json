Such As::\n\n\n-loneliness is strongest when I'm not acting in ways that I can fully identify with as 'myself' \n\n- boredom is my calling to be creative and I force myself to do nothing for 10 minutes until I'm inspired to create something, especially if it's some terrible drawing ^_^ - \n\n- sadness and anger are usually from a gap in expectation vs reality and very often I'm too tired or otherwise under resourced to do what I would like to do in an ideal world (Naps are amazing but try not to sleep more than 9 hours a day unless you've been chronically sleep deprived for a while)\n\n\nI try and treat my sadness like I would of a loved one, supporting them but not the negativity, making sure fundamental needs are set and trying to engage them in games (I like making up the worlds worst rap/poetry on the spot or singing terribly - I find I don't have the mental space for negative thought when I'm having to create in real-time, just so long as I don't judge the results! ^_^)\n\n\nFor me the biggest thing has been finding out what I like and making sure I do more of that and trying only to do comforting things when I actively choose to do them (something super powerful about choosing comfort rather than defaulting automatically to it - I find the former is restorative and the latter is just distracting )\n\nFinally and maybe most importantly I heard some beautiful advice about 'being present' being the dream but that term is really unhelpful in getting there (either you are or you aren't right?) \n\nSo instead 'be noticing' your world, your experience, others and your thoughts but keep noticing new things (there's an almost infinite level of detail in just your sensation when standing still, if you can notice one new thing every day you're already waaaaay ahead of the curve)\n\nYou're amazing and wishing you all the best !!! \n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7xlv1s/does_anybody_have_a_depression_playbook_they/dua4j3m/"}
