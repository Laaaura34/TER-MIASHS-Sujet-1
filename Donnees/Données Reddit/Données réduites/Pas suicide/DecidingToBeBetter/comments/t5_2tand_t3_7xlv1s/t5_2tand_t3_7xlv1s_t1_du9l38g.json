Cardio and weight lifting.\n\nAfter that, meditation is a huge help. Start with 1 -2 minutes, work up from there. Try an app like Headspace or Insight Timer. \n\nSleep hygiene is huge. Regular schedule as much as possible. No bright lights at night. Try and get bright light in the morning. \n\nIf you get seasonal depression, a \"happy light\" in the morning for 30-40 minutes can make a huge difference.\n\nSocial interactions and being outside both help a lot. Get out in the world. Find an excuse to talk to people.  \n\nFish Oil helps reduce inflammation, which can help. It takes a few weeks, but makes a difference for me.\n\n... But I'd say the BIG TWO are exercise and meditation. If you exercise hard every day, and meditate as much as you can every day, you'll get better, one baby step at a time. \n\n(I'll add, even with all that, I still take medication too. So don't feel bad if you're doing everything you can and still struggle. You'll be ok. Keep going.)
