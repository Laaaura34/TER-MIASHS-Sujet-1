Take vitamin D pills, too, if you'd like.\n\nHangout with animals (if you don't have any, volunteer a couple hours at a shelter! Rewarding and joy inducing)\n\nListen to your favourite music (or just anything to get you out of your current headspace and into a new one)\n\nCook, eat and enjoy something delicious!
