I dont like to think that my feeling horrible one day equals someone's severe depression, but I can foresee that one horrible day snowballing into something much worse if I don't curtail the behavior that is making me feel horrible.\n\nI have a very very strict lifestyle set in place that pretty much guarantees that I feel good most of the time. Some of my daily practices include:\n\n- 10 minutes of meditation in the morning\n- lifting weights three times a week\n- not drinking out of habit\n- quitting tobacco and limiting marijuana use\n- getting at least 6-7 hours of sleep a night\n- eating super clean\n\nWhen I dont do any of those, or start playing too much video games or partake in too much of any indulgent behavior, I start to feel BAD. I never grew up in a household that taught me how to live a happy, productive life, and so it took me a very long time to figure each thing out. \n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7xlv1s/does_anybody_have_a_depression_playbook_they/du9rt9m/"}
