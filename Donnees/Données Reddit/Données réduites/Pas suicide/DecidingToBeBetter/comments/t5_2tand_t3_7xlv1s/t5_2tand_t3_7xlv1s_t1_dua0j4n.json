It would be best if I used it daily but I don't so I keep it where I see it easily so that if I am feeling bad I am likely to notice it and audit my thoughts and feelings.\n\nFrom there I can make a plan. Fortunately I've been in a place where that's usually all I need and I work on the next day. Other times I have to do some self-care like hygiene and exercise.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7xlv1s/does_anybody_have_a_depression_playbook_they/dua0j4n/"}
