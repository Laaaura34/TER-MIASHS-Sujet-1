By that I mean treat yourself like you're not feeling well and try not to attach any stories to it if it's just chemical cycles of depression rather than depression from grief, for example.  Feel your feelings and just take it easy.  Don't try to force yourself into doing unnecessary things you're not up to physically or mentally.  Drink more water and take your vitamins.  If you catch it early go for a walk or get some exercise you enjoy.  If not, get some rest but if you find yourself wallowing in bed tackle a few small things from your to do list.  For me at least, I've realized my depression comes like rainstorms and sometimes its intense, sometimes mild, but it always is just a matter of just getting comfortable despite the rain until the sun comes back.  \n\nAlso, try to stay in touch with positive people.  My self talk during depressive episodes gets like Harry Potter's dementors, just dark and confidence smashing, so even just asking a friend to come with me to do basic things like going to the grocery store for moral support can make a big difference.  It's ridiculous but I've realized it's important when I feel like I'm made of lead.  Keep some distance from people who aren't supportive until it passes.  \n\nI hope that makes sense and that some of it helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7xlv1s/does_anybody_have_a_depression_playbook_they/du9c7dk/"}
