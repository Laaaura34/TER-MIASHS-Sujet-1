Sometimes I'm hard on myself for not being positive enough, for not making much progress, etc. - but I realized it only lately that it's hard for me to change certain mindsets and thought patterns because they've been that way my whole life. And by you writing that this was always a struggle for you, I believe that you're in the same boat.\n\nWhat I do find helpful is to do or think something positive, even if you don't believe (in) it. To give you an example with the gratitude thing: start writing a gratitude journal. Yes, I know you're skeptical about it - I was too. But after a few days or a week of writing down 3 things/people I was thankful for on that day and expressing why I was thankful, I slowly started to appreciate some things and some people more. They don't have to be big things - like one day I wrote I was thankful for a person who showed up on my stream and chatted with me.\n\nI found that this \"method\" helped my overall mental health when I started meditating. People always recommend it to others, so I tried it despite not really believing in it. It took some weeks or a month, sure, but after some time I felt a slight change for the better. The important thing is to keep going with it, don't stop after a day or two, because especially with people like us, it takes longer time to shift our mood/mindset if it's that ingrained in us.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pykzwd/how_to_appreciate_the_small_things_in_life/hev59u1/"}
