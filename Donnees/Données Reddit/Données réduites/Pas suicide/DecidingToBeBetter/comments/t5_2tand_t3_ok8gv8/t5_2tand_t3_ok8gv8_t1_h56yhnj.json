If you were busy with tasks that you value, it\u2019ll become easier to discern what\u2019s a priority to you.  Are you trying to take responsibility for other people\u2019s responsibilities?  The only one you can control is yourself which includes your own reactions and what you decide to act upon.  Micromanaging or babysitting others is overstepping the boundaries of your control.  If it\u2019s not your responsibility, then it\u2019s ok to say no.  Sometimes you have to let people live and learn from their mistakes.  Finding a balance between serving yourself and others will become the challenge.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ok8gv8/how_can_i_become_less_of_a_pushover/h56yhnj/"}
