I'm sorry things didn't work out and you lost money and a friend, and then weren't informed about the sale.  That must have really sucked.\n\n I'm facing something that is life changing that I'm worried about, moving up the corporate ladder because my husband has lymphoma.  When I think about it, I get scared.  Then I go from anxious to worried and depressed, then usually tell myself I'll take it a step at a time.  I am only 75% sure I can handle it, and if I'm not careful, I'll be working very long hours and won't have a personal life.\n\nIt's nice to see you face the fear and triumph.  Best wishes!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qhhxgl/small_step_to_overcoming_a_crippling_fear/hidjpob/"}
