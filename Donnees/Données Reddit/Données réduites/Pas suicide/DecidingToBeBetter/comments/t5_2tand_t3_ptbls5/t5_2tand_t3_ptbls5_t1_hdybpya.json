It is EXTREMELY rare for anyone to be a \"saint\" from birth until death. We're all shitty. The better of us use it as a learning tool, create healthier habits, and treat ourselves and other with respect. For perspective: I had my \"aha\" moment at 27. My mom didn't have hers until she was in her mid 50's. My Father may never come around.\n\nI spent 3 months straight forgiving myself, and then immediatelyvreinforcing the more positive sides of myself. That's pretty much all it took to re-write all the self hate I'd fostered for 27 years. I talked to myself as if I was talking to my best friend. In traffic, in the bathroom mirror. Wherever. Spend some time with yourself. You can't have the dark without the light, my friend. It is a co-existance. Don't hide from it. Come to terms with your capabilities, and teach yourself more positive ways of living so you can by happy, fulfilled, and healthy. Seek therapy if that calls to you (most therapists have full Phd's on the literal human psyche) \n\nThere are plenty of people that will not wake up to who they actually are in this lifetime. Congratulations on making it to this place. It'll be a rollercoaster, but you will become someone you love even more. Oh! One last bit... Mistakes and misgivings do not make you unlovable or unworthy. After all... you're just a brain controlling a meat suit stuck on a living rock flying through space. Be kind to yourself, and good luck with this journey, my friend.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ptbls5/self_forgiveness/hdybpya/"}
