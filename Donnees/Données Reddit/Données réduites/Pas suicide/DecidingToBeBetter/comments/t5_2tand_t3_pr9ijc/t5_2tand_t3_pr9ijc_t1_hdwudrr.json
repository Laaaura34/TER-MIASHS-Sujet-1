Not many people can say that they\u2019ve done that in their life. Second, although the fact that your immediate family haven\u2019t shown how proud/happy they are, you need to remember that you got this job for YOURSELF and for YOUR BENEFIT, and not for the benefit of your family, or anyone else. Although it\u2019ll still hurt as they are the people who are meant to be closest to you, you need to make sure that you don\u2019t downplay the achievement(s) that you\u2019ve got. I live in the UK and come from an African family so i can somewhat relate. All in all, you just need to remember who you\u2019re actually working/making money for; is it so that your family can congratulate you or is it actually for yourself? I hope that all of this made sense \ud83d\ude2d", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pr9ijc/no_one_in_my_immediate_family_is_happy_for_me_but/hdwudrr/"}
