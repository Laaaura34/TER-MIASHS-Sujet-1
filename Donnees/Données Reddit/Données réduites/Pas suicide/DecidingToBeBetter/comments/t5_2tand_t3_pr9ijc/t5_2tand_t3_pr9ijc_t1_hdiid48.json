I typed \u201cnever tell\u201d and it autocompleted the rest. Even Google knows exactly what you should never tell. \n\nThe quote goes like this: \n\n*Never tell anyone your plans\u2026show them your results instead.*\n\nThis is not only to prevent their negativity from reaching into your subconscious but it\u2019s also for your own motivation. \n\nIf you talk about what you plan on doing, you\u2019re less likely to do it because your brain is getting an endorphin hit from just talking about it and it\u2019s less motivated to take action. \n\nHold your tongue and do your thing. Never give up.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pr9ijc/no_one_in_my_immediate_family_is_happy_for_me_but/hdiid48/"}
