Every bird leaves wether they flew , accidently fell or were pushed out.\n\nAlso told them you can see not the world from where we live and if you live some where else you can not see the world from there. My point go out and make your own life, see and visit as much of the rest of the world as possible and go live a full life.\n\nThen it's also good to have you back, this past weekend they came over and we went Dove hunting and went fishing yesterday. We had a great time.\n\nSo congratulations on leaving the nest and go live your life and experience and see the world around you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pr9ijc/no_one_in_my_immediate_family_is_happy_for_me_but/hdkv3xp/"}
