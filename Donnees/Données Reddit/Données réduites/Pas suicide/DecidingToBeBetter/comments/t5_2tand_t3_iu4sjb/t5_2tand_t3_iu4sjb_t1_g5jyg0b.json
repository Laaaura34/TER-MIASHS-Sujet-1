My goal was to refine my community and connection life by calling, texting, or emailing my good friends consistently each week.\n\nIt was very strange suddenly not logging into Instagram and Facebook every day. But it was absolutely a good choice for me. I find that I am much more compassionate than I've ever been towards other human beings, my volunteer and advocacy has become much more genuine and consistent, and my relationships with friends and family are in a good place. I feel way less depressed, and no longer place so much stock in what hundreds of other people ~~don't~~ think about me. It's so liberating to not feel like I need to \"brand\" myself!\n\nSometimes I do miss being able to easily share excitement about things, like pictures of bugs in my yard, my artwork, and local wildlife; I figure that I can always start a blog or send that stuff to people directly who I think will find it cool.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iu4sjb/lets_take_a_look_on_social_media/g5jyg0b/"}
