Maybe walking, but no strict workout regimens, because I found that everything together was too much. \n\nI also recommend not limiting the amount you eat at all at first, just changing the content and seeing what a difference that can make over a month or so. Fruit and veg for example - forget calories and eat as much as you feel like whenever you get hungry (not just 3 times a day). Tons of water is also great but tea can be almost as hydrating if you don't make it too strong. \n\nOnce you feel healthier, you'll find that the idea of entering a gym or setting out on a run becomes less intimidating, regardless of still being overweight or unfit etc. \n\nThe other thing I found that really helped was routine - specifically getting up early and having the same big, healthy breakfast and that bit of time in the morning to get your head together before work. \n\nI hope some of the above is helpful. All the best with everything!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n2jvhu/28m_successful_but_struggling_with_different/gwnhjya/"}
