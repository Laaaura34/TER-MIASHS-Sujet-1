I have a boyfriend and maybe 1 or 2 friends. My friends do most of the work when it comes to maintaining the friendship. Boyfriend works alllll the time. I am getting better about being more involved + social. Tonight I went out for my galpal\u2019s 27th birthday to the most crowded bar in town. Mostly because it\u2019s her birthday and I couldn\u2019t say no. I was not dying to put on a full face of makeup & drop $12 on a warm Miller Lite but I did anyway for her birthday. Honestly, you\u2019re not missing anything. It is sooo crowded that you have to yell for someone to hear you. You get stepped on & beer spilled on you. Random dudes try to talk to you and grab you. I go to bars like this once a year and that\u2019s enough for me to remember that even though it LOOKS awesome and cool on Instagram, the reality is that I\u2019d much rather be at home eating pizza with my boyfriend or having a drink with my dad at home. \n\nIf you\u2019re content with your life being a little more low key, I think you should own it and not let our world pressure you into thinking that you need a group of girls to go out with every weekend and you need to be social in order to have a meaningful life. Once I \u201clet go\u201d of this (took me yearssss) I was able to relax a bit and enjoy my life more. I\u2019m not a total jerk - I\u2019m still gonna go out for her birthday because it\u2019s her birthday lol but I realized that I don\u2019t need that \u201cscene\u201d to feel like I have a good and productive life. \n\nJust my 2c.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p8jm0z/iwtl_how_to_be_okay_being_lonely/h9r79ft/"}
