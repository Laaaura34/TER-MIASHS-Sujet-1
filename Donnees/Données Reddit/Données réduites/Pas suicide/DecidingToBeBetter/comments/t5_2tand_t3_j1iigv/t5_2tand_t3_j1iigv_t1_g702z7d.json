That\u2019s what Bren\u00e9 Brown says, and it resonates with me. I have found that it takes being intentional for me to make friends in adulthood, whereas in childhood it was very easy. I have decided to curate my life with people I love. What that means for me is that if I meet someone I like- I intentionally speak to them and connect and show interest.
