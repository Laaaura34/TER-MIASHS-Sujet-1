I am so so so happy and excited for you!!! Congratulations!!! Well done! This is a well-deserved victory!\n\nYour post was so inspiring to read, because, I am also in medicine. I graduated medical school (went to school outside of the united states) 2 years ago and moved back home to study for the USMLEs. Medical school was hard for me. I struggled academically, failing many exams and having to repeat a year. Recently, I've been in a slump because I failed a licensing exam (my STEP 2). But your story has motivated me to keep going and stay motivated in order to get into a residency program and become a child psychiatrist one day <3\n\nThank you for this, and, I wish you the very best!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qa9mld/started_my_20s_with_a_18_gpa_and_homeless_ended/hh2h6s9/"}
