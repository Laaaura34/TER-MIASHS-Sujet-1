Why medicine specifically? A combination of a love of science and a desire to help people. Coupled with the fact I discovered a love of teaching led me to choose medicine because it\u2019s a combination of all of my passions.\n\nAs to what inspired me to decide to be better? It was in part my professor, but the two things he managed to do were most importantly help me fall in love with learning again. Before him I only memorized, but once I began to actually learn I found myself actively looking for new things to learn which drastically improved me. I also surrounded myself with people who actively believed in me and actively pushed me to follow through with my goals. Finally, becoming a TA for organic directly made me responsible for people and knowing others were directly dependent on my being responsible and prepared to help them helped drive me to further improve myself so I could best help them.\n\nAre either of those the answer to your question? I love discussing this so please let me know if I misunderstood your question", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qa9mld/started_my_20s_with_a_18_gpa_and_homeless_ended/hh2qrwn/"}
