Sometimes, the medicine is very helpful. I\u2019ve been through that struggle myself, and I\u2019ve come to terms with this is what I need right now, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Also, give yourself the same compassion you would your best friend. I used to hate when my therapist told me that, but she was right! I\u2019m much more compassionate to myself now, and it helps me a lot!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lyex6k/i_hurt_my_mother_and_now_im_burning_inside/gpy12f7/"}
