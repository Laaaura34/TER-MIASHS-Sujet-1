I tend to not reach out and just think it was better to endure it myself. \n\nRecently, I\u2019ve been just telling my friends and family that I\u2019m having a hard time. I\u2019ve found that those who really care about you (of course there are exceptions for people going thru their own issues) will try to lift you up and support you. They are human too and will be understanding. \n\nI have lost some friends by doing this, too. I found out that they only wanted to be my friend if I was doing something for them. They didn\u2019t want to reciprocate. \n\nThis has significantly improved my relationships and weeded out the ones that were bad.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mfokox/how_to_stay_positive_and_treat_my_friends_better/gsp4df0/"}
