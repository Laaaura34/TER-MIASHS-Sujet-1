You had the opportunity to be defensive and you weren\u2019t.  I love this sub because you ARE deciding to be better.\n\nThe last thing I have to say is do not try to force this thing with Karr.  Unfortunately your behavior up to this point constitutes harassment, and because of this you have different options.  Any attempt at forcing a conversation is going to come across as aggressive.  Young women are really freaked out right now, and because of this you have to tread lightly.  Don\u2019t ignore her, be friendly, and if you have the opportunity to apologize please do.  Just give her space, it will give you an opportunity to consciously get comfortable with this type of situation. \n\nIf you keep up with this you\u2019re going to turn into a really good man, because all women want is respect, and you are trying so hard.  It will pay off.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/e4m97a/i_harassed_a_girl_in_my_school_last_year_and_now/f9eunmz/"}
