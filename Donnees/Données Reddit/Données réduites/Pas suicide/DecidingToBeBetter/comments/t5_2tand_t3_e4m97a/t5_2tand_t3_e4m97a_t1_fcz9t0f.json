I don\u2019t know if Karr and her best friend ever talked about me at all. It\u2019s possible her best friend doesn\u2019t even know that Karr blocked me and that Karr seems afraid of me. Her best friend actually seems quite okay with me.\n\nBesides, no longer do I feel so bad about it that it interferes with my daily routine. If I have the opportunity to apologize, I will. But I won\u2019t make that event my top priority because Karr will always choose to run away from me on any given day.\n\nI was in the wrong in this situation, but I\u2019ve actually moved on from this drama, at least for now I think I did. I don\u2019t see Karr herself that much these days so as long as that is the case, I\u2019ll be fine.
