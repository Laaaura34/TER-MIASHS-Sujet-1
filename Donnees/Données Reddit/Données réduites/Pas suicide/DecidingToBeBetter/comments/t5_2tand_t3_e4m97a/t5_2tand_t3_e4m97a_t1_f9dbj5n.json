Growing up means that you\u2019re going to look back at your life and see places where you\u2019ve made mistakes.  Does this suck?  Absolutely.  But it\u2019s also amazing, because you\u2019re not excusing yourself and you\u2019re developing into a better person because of this.\n\nYou\u2019re becoming self aware and this self awareness will keep you from making these mistakes in the future.  It\u2019s not going to fix the mistakes in your past.\n\nWill apologizing to Karr make you feel better?  Maybe.  But the more important question to ask yourself is will it make her feel better?\n\nWhen you were spamming this girl\u2019s Snapchat what were you trying to accomplish?  Were you trying to fix your mistakes or get her to forgive you?\n\nThe purpose of an apology should be selfless.  You\u2019re trying to address the things that you did that made someone uncomfortable because you don\u2019t want THEM to be uncomfortable.  Not because YOU don\u2019t want to be uncomfortable.\n\nSo keep growing.  Leave this girl alone.  If you find yourself in a position to speak to her the ONLY thing coming out of your mouth should be an apology, not an explanation, an apology.  If she accepts the apology and engages with your friendship again there will be opportunities to explain.  If she doesn\u2019t then you know that it\u2019s time to move on.\n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/e4m97a/i_harassed_a_girl_in_my_school_last_year_and_now/f9dbj5n/"}
