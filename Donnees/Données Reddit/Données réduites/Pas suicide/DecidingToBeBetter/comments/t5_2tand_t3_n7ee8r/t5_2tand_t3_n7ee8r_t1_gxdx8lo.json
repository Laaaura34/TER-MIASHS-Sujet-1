I read through some of your posts, and the amount of compassion I feel is huge. You've been through a lot, but it wasn't your fault. You are beautiful, inside and out. I love all the cute photos of your ducks. They are adorable! What happened to you happened because someone much older thought he could take advantage of you and that there would be no consequences. But there are consequences, and you know that. I hope you went to the police, and at the very least, made him repent somewhat for his actions. His actions don't define you. I know you're probably scared, but you can do all of this on your own. I know you can. I'm rooting for you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n7ee8r/i_almost_took_my_life_tonight_but_decided_to_not/gxdx8lo/"}
