You're acknowledging triggers and coming to terms with its effects and taking control and I'm so proud of you. I'm really sorry that you had to endure that intense pain and suffering. You did not deserve any of that. You are really strong and I'm very proud of you. Thank you for staying with us and sharing. That is a beautiful song as well and now that you've mentioned it, it might be stuck in my head all day! I love it though! Hang in there, and know that you're a warrior!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n7ee8r/i_almost_took_my_life_tonight_but_decided_to_not/gxeeox1/"}
