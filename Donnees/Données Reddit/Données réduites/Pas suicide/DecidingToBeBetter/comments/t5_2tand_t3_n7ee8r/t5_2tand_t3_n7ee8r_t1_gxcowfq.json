Your body tries so hard to keep you alive and holds on for you until your mind is in a better place and wants to join it in staying alive (whether that be from change in situation, change in perception/ mindset- whatever aids in starting your healing). I feel this is why learning to actually truly love yourself and practicing self care, whatever that may mean to you that doesnt hurt you, is vital.\n\nYoure so valuable and precious and important. Be easy on yourself, and do whatever you can to take care of your body and mind (take care of your inner child) and eventually you will see and feel the warmth in life again and have the big and small things that make you WANT to live again", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n7ee8r/i_almost_took_my_life_tonight_but_decided_to_not/gxcowfq/"}
