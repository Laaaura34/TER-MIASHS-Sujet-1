Take a trip without expectations. Just choose a destination and go. No plan, no schedule, just go where the wind takes you. It can literally change everything for you. \n\nI've got a good friend in the Pacific Northwest and I'd never been. I drove from Texas to go see him for a few days. When I got there he asked what my plans were and I said, \"I have none, let's do all the things you want to do, take me to your favorite places.\" We ended up on the San Juan islands and went to random bars and restaurants and ordered things like \"a shot of the cheapest whiskey you have\" or my personal favorite \"the cook's favorite dish to make\". \n\nI tried so many new things I never thought I would have and it was all because I had been feeling so defeated with life and everything in it that I was in 100% fuck it mode. That trip changed me. It changed everything for me. Just a few weeks prior I'd called the hotline 6 times in a week. A few of those times with a gun in my hand and a bullet in the chamber I'd carved \"4 me\" on. I got rid of that one.\n\nTake a break and get away for a bit. Drop some of your responsibilities and expectations for a few days and just take some time for yourself. \n\nI hope you feel better soon. I don't know what you're going through and that's not my business but I wanted to share [this song](https://youtu.be/dR3ccmWmLhk) with you. It's picked me up more than once and I hope it'll have some of that effect on you. \n\nAll the best,\nstp\n\nEdit: speling", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n7ee8r/i_almost_took_my_life_tonight_but_decided_to_not/gxd16fy/"}
