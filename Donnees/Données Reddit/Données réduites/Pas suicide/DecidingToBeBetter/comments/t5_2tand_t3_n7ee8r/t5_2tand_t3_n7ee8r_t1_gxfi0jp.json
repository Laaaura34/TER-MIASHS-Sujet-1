Yet we are here still going on, doing stuff.\nWe are the most complex thing created by a universe we do not understand and doesn't even understand itself.\nVsauce said once.\nWe were created by the universe to make the universe understand what he is.\nAnd even if you are just a farmer, or a mcdonalds employee, or a janitor. Let me tell you a story which happened in my country in 2016.\nWe had to select a government. Many people thought that whatever they did they will still get a shitty government, so they didnt vote...\nAnd guess what happened. They got a shitty government for 4 years.\nSo what is my point? To make a change you have to change something in what you do.\nDont expect to repeat the same things and something differnet to happen.\nSo go do something. Go for a walk outside and just listen to music to a podcast. Learn something. An instrument, how to draw, how to make your own videogame, a language. Read a book. Watch a movie.\nAnd if you tell me that you are too bored in a universe this weird is unacceptable. And if that happens i should probably start singing at the tuba while juggling tringluar squares in a wtaer fight.\nWe shall have bad days yes?\nWe shall have good days yes?\nAll to remember that most places in this universe dont even have days.\nSo go out there and do anything. But not nothing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n7ee8r/i_almost_took_my_life_tonight_but_decided_to_not/gxfi0jp/"}
