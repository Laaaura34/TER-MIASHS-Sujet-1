I\u2019m bipolar and we definitely tend to be inclined towards those kinds of thoughts, but whenever they start coming I can at least remind myself of everything I\u2019ve seen and done and understood while on psychedelics... to remember that life means *something* and that\u2019s incredibly against the odds that life, let alone me as a person, exist in the first place. That life can be beautiful, even in its hideousness. That I can\u2019t appreciate the good without experiencing the bad, and that the worse some of my experiences are, the better I will be able to appreciate the good experiences. And, most horrifying of all, what if killing myself just gets me reincarnated and I have to go through all the bullshit again with no memory of my current life?! Best to just ride this one out and hope for better times, because when I *do* inevitably die, at least I\u2019ll have a psychological safeguard against whatever, if anything, happens after death. \n\nMy quality of life is better for these experiences, but If I could have had these experiences under the guide of a trained therapist or a legitimate native/indigenous shaman, I am 100% positive my quality of life would be much better than it is now. Regardless of whether you take this path in your life, I hope you are able to find something or someone to help you through these difficult times.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n7ee8r/i_almost_took_my_life_tonight_but_decided_to_not/gxdojjg/"}
