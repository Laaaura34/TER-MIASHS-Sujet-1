Your comfort level with the place you\u2019re in and people you\u2019re around is super important, and so is your mindset. It\u2019s not for everyone. I *wish* I had the guidance of a trained therapist but I didn\u2019t... I just took it myself and hoped for a spiritual experience. I got plenty of that, as well as plenty of experiences that would scare the piss out of most people. I\u2019ve stared into a mirror and watch myself turn into a demon standing in front of the gates hell as flames appeared to shoot up all around me and all the lights went out... I can *totally* understand how that could traumatize many people, but I was still intellectually aware that I was standing in my bathroom, so my thought process was \u201choly crap, this is insane! What does this mean? Is this something about me, or just a crazy random hallucination?\u201d \n\nI certainly wouldn\u2019t recommend this to anyone who doesn\u2019t first read all about it and then think \u201cyeah, I think this could really help me. This is a good idea\u201d because any hesitation is bound to invite a \u201cbad trip\u201d even for a little bit. Although that\u2019s not necessarily the worst thing to happen if you can learn from the experience and better yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n7ee8r/i_almost_took_my_life_tonight_but_decided_to_not/gxdp7lr/"}
