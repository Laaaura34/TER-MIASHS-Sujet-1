And I say yikes to what you have been through, what you have endured, and as a survivor of rape myself, I see and understand the want for the suffering to end. But also as a survivor, the stronger feeling is a surge of happiness and gratefulness that you didn't take your own life. You didn't ask for what happened to you, and while I get that pain and wanting it to turn inward(it's way easier to assign control and some sort of accountability over something that wasn't), I also want to say this. And you may think it might not apply completely, and that is why I want to say it even more, is that It. Was. Not. Your. Fault. Period. I'm so sorry you had to go through what you did, but it wasn't your fault, no matter if you were drunk, were with this person in a romantic or sexually-forward context, or any of that. If you find yourself going \"I get that, but there was also x/y/z complex situation going on\" I want to tell you that all of that is secondary to the core fact that you did not want what happened to you to happen. Your pain is valid. Your story is valid. If you need someone to talk to, I am here regardless of being a stranger. Thank you for choosing life. If it's any consolation, I'm happy that you're still here. And I am here to talk if you need to. Please seek therapy, too, if finances make that possible. You deserve to see your worth.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n7ee8r/i_almost_took_my_life_tonight_but_decided_to_not/gxd754m/"}
