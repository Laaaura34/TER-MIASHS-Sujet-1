I was in the same situation, the only thing that stopped me from taking the leap was my family and friends. And the realisation that we're too young. I had a similar childhood like you where my bf would sexually assault me. It took me years to even open up about it to my friends. I won't lie to you, it's a time taking process. But trust me, you're gonna love every bit of it when you start healing. \nIt's the same for you, you have so much life. Focus on well being. Do things that make you happy. Be selfish at that I'd say. Take a vacation. And hey if you can't afford one, just take a break from everything that's going on. Watch a good movie. Read a book. There are endless possibilities. It's a beautiful world where nothing ever stops happening. Just hold on, cuz I promise you, it's worth it. \n\nAnd hey, if you ever wanna talk to someone you could always message me. It'd be my genuine pleasure to help you. Stay whole.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n7ee8r/i_almost_took_my_life_tonight_but_decided_to_not/gxd1pi3/"}
