Could also be a physical problem like sleep apnea or difficulty breathing. Have both and it had me living a life like that.  Medicine, therapy, and surgery (couldnt breathe) have been game changers. Part of ADHD is sort of getting frozen from doing stuff and also perfectionism keeps me from doing stuff.  Therapist was telling me that I am getting stuck because I am overthinking things and that includes beating myself up over things I haven't done. And I should admit sometimes you need SOME of that in your life, a break, a chance to regroup and think. If you feel guilty about that, then you wind up STILL not doing anything because you are upset about it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjd1mf/how_to_fix_extreme_laziness_brought_on_from/hbx93qr/"}
