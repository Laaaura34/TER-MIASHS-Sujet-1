Not one on your phone, but a physical one. Put all the stuff you need to do on it, big or small. Tell yourself to just try to do one or two a day.

A white board is really nice too(If you like this method) since you can erase and add stuff with ease.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjd1mf/how_to_fix_extreme_laziness_brought_on_from/hbydybr/"}
