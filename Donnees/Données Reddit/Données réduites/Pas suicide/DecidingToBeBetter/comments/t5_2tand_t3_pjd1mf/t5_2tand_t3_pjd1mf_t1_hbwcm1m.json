I struggled with this myself. I had every excuse to not bother to shower. I live alone. I\u2019ll just get dirty again. It\u2019s so much energy. But when I decided it was getting out of control, that I was making my life meaningless I found myself a reward system. If I took a shower, blue sticker on the calendar, if I did one of my hobbies yellow sticker, if I took my meds green sticker.  Eating healthy red. No alcohol\u2026no spend days, answering a phone call or a text and so on. Took about 3 months of really sticking to my stickers but it\u2019s pretty easy for me now to clean the cat box on a day I said I would do it. Not a fun task, no sticker needed.  The sticker method also helped my SO quit smoking. Might work for you too", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjd1mf/how_to_fix_extreme_laziness_brought_on_from/hbwcm1m/"}
