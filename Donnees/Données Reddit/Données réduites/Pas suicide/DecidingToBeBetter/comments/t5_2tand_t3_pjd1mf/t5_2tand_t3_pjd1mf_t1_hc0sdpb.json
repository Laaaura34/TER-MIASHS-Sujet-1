I'm honestly amazed by how many people felt as if they could relate to what I wrote, however unflattering it may have been- if it can help someone else it makes it even more worthwhile.\n\nThat's totally true though. And no you aren't stupid.  Even I in spite of having felt dumb for having allowed myself to get to the point where I've started to do out of character, spacy shit and slack etc, I know I'm not dumb, I'm just highly impacted by a bunch of nasty internal states to contend with all at once, which is why it's so frustrating that I'm noticing this sharp decline in my performance as a being on a whole because I used to be the polar opposite and quite on top of things. I'd suspect this may very well be the case with you too... hopefully you'll find soem motivation and tips of the plethora out of the advice to be found on here that can help you out too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjd1mf/how_to_fix_extreme_laziness_brought_on_from/hc0sdpb/"}
