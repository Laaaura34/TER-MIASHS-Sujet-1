My addiction ramped up after my husband passed away some years ago. However, I run away from any possible fights & refrain from posting anything political for fear of metaphorically getting my head kicked in! So the carefully-curated image I present is one of extreme niceness lol. I'm not pretending to be the Queen of Sheba, or anything - I'm still me, but I've grown uncomfortable with having to constantly \"work on\" this image - I can't just be myself. To be fair, I'm like this in real life too - afraid of confrontation & a real people-pleaser. Anyway, the long & short of it is - I'm trying to cut down on my social media use too. It served me in the beginning but it's gone too far now. It's not healthy. I liken it to becoming reliant on drugs for chronic pain - they are useful up to a point & understandable too - no-one likes to be in pain - but in the end they cause more problems (in terms of addiction) than they cure, so it's better to find the actual cause of the pain & treat that, if possible. But it's hard - I find it nearly impossible to just leave my flaming phone alone for any length of time!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h7meyq/realising_internet_points_dont_matter_every/funzazk/"}
