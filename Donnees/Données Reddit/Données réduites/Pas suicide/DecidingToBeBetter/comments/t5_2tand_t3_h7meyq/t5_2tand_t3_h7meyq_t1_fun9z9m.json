I compare some subs to others from time to time where the majority opinion is in opposition to the subs I regularly visit. You feel like whatever you're seeing is the truth, or the majority opinion, because it's all you're seeing. You follow the rationale and arguments and it all makes sense.\n\nThe second you venture out elsewhere the same thing happens but from the other side, from another viewpoint. Except most people don't venture and just stay in the one echo chamber because it's comfortable and its your community. And when you travel between echo chambers like i do, eventually you just get completely mentally overwhelmed from constant strongly conflicting views and emotions.\n\nIt's just exhausting. People are people and have many many sides, not whatever we reduce them to in our endless arguments.\n\nRegarding Facebook I have unfollowed almost everyone except groups I'm in and my family. So i still have my account but now it's a much more pleasant front page to look at. I also just did this today, coincidentally. I keep reddit subs strict to my interests for which it is very useful. And my instagram feed pretty much consists of rabbits. I must be following hundreds of bunny accounts on there by now, lol.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h7meyq/realising_internet_points_dont_matter_every/fun9z9m/"}
