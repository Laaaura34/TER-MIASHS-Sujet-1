My sister hates my brother's girlfriend, but she wastes her time looking her up on Instagram. She looks up her podcast so she can hate on her.\n\nI asked her why she looked up those things if she hates my brother's girlfriend so much. She knew the answer to that question and she didn't like it. In short, she got mad at me and told me to get lost.\n\nHowever, it is a valid question and many people spend hours upon hours nosing around in other people's social media just to find the bad things about other people that make them feel good. My brother's girlfriend is an awful person, but she isn't worth wasting your day.\n\nIn the same way, I know a ton of people that use social media that way. I think the purpose of social media should have been to bring people closer together in real life; that is about the only reason I use it. It is easy to find events there but social media really isn't for that. It brings out the worst in people and it is nothing more than a cesspool of narcissism and self loathing.\n\nFacebook is the worst but Twitter is also a mess.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h7meyq/realising_internet_points_dont_matter_every/funbz11/"}
