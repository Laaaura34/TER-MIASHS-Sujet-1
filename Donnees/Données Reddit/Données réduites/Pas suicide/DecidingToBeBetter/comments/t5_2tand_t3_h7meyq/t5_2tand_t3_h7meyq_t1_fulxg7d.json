Social media can be a damaging thing.  I don't have Instagram or Twitter.  I rarely use Snapchat.  I still have a Facebook account but I don't have the app.  I read one time where social media was compared to \"highlight reels\" of people's lives.  It's not real life.  It's posed.  It's fake.  \n\nReddit can be the same way.  You got sucked into the negativity of political subs.  I got caught up in the dark side, the porn side, of reddit.  That can damage a person as well.  I am working my way out of that because, one, it makes me feel crap about myself and, two, it's not healthy to look at that all the time.\n\nGood for you for unsubscribing to the subs that bring you down.  I'm only subscribed to a few subs and they are woodworking subs (a new hobby I'm trying to pursue).\n\nGood luck to you, my friend!  I wish you the best!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h7meyq/realising_internet_points_dont_matter_every/fulxg7d/"}
