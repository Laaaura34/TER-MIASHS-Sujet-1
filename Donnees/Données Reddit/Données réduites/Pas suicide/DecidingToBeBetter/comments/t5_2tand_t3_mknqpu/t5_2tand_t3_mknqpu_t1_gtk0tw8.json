I vaped for 5 years and was sucking on that thing 24/7. I quit cold turkey to prepare for a surgery. It was VERY hard and my whole day-to-day life changed because I was so used to vaping while I did everything. When I had really bad days I would wear a low dose nicotine patch. About a year after I quit, most of my urges were gone and I was able to fully enjoy my life again. It was probably one of the most hardest things I did, but it was worth it. I'm happy I committed through it. It's been a little over 3 years now and I never think about doing it again.\n\nI'm bad with anything addictive, so if I can do it, anyone can. Just accept this new life and look forward. You got this!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mknqpu/today_is_the_first_day_of_quitting_juuling/gtk0tw8/"}
