Started when I was 17, switched to vaping around five years ago. My wife has said that I will vape in my sleep, the fruity juices are just too tasty and they\u2019re better than air. \n\nI have had a bottle of disgusting, cough-medicine tasting juice that has sat in my drawer for a long time. In attempting to quit, I saved that awful bottle for last. \n\nWe just bought a condo together, we\u2019re moving a lot of stuff as well as painting, and every time I go to take a puff to de-stress I\u2019m immediately disgusted with the taste (and myself). \n\nIt\u2019s helped a lot to have that awful flavor, and I had slowly tuned down the amount of nicotine in my bottles for quite some time. \n\nWe\u2019ve got this!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mknqpu/today_is_the_first_day_of_quitting_juuling/gtgwytd/"}
