I've struggled big time with social anxiety in the past. If you can, I'd recommend getting a psychiatrist, to explore the possibility of starting medication, and a therapist, to get started with CBT. I'm not on meds yet and I've just started with CBT, but seeking treatment has already helped me feel more in control of my OCD, which is not something I'd ever though I'd be able to say.\n\nIf you can't do either, and are in the States, I've read good things about the app \"NOCD\", which provides online therapy for people with OCD. I know exactly how much this disease can fuck you up, but I also know that it is possible to take control of it.
