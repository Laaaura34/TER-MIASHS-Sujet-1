I\u2019m a 27 y/o college grad, unemployed, virgin, living at home, privileged mooch off my wealthy parents. I need brutal honestly. Don\u2019t worry about making me feel like shit I probably need it. \n\nAs a teacher I'll tell you one of the first rules of motivation: beating yourself up to do things might work in the short term, but you'll lose steam and self-love as you fail in the long term. Being kind to yourself and accepting that you can fail while working towards your goals is much better in the long term.\n\nThe first thing that could help you out: no matter your 'privilige', your feelings are real and if you feel bad you feel bad. Your feelings are valid, no matter where you're from.\n\nWhat I read in  your text is someone who craves more autonomy in his life. You want to start your own life, apart from your parents, with a job and a house etc.\n\nBut at home you're safe and supported, so taking those steps is scary. Handling uncertainty is scary, it'll always be scary. But going into uncertain territory is necessary to realize our potential. It's even harder in these corona times.\n\nSo what can you do now to get some autonomy? Try to find a job or find people to cohouse with somewhere. Ask your parents if they can support your rent for some months, as you look for a job?\n\nAfter gaining some autonomy, you can work on social skills by trying out new hobbies AND going to a therapist. They can coach you towards a healthier emotional state of mind.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nirfzs/im_not_a_good_person_im_a_27_yo_college_grad/gz3d9r7/"}
