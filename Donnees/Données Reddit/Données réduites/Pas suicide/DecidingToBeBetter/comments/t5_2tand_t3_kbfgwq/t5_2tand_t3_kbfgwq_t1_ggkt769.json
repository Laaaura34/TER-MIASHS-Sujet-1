I had so many years of living with parents and housemates I didn't always get on with during my 20's. I think that was another factor that was hurting my self-esteem. \n\nIt wasn't a great flat but at least I had my own little space. It was the first time I lived alone and boosted my confidence when I realised i could fend for myself just fine. Hope it works out for you and no it's not over until you decide it is.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kbfgwq/i_was_a_30_year_old_virgin_and_thought_i_would_be/ggkt769/"}
