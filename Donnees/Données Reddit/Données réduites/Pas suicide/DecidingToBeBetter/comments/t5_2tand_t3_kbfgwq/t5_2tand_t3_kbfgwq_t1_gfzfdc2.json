My advice to you is to focus on friendship. I have a lot of female friends. It\u2019s not so bad being in the friendzone. I love my female friends. Sex complicates things. I just wish I was seen as fuckable by someone. I know how you feel. But in terms of revealing that secret to someone special, all of the female friends I\u2019ve confided in about my lack of experience have been supportive. Most people aren\u2019t repulsed by your virginity. They might be shocked that you haven\u2019t done it yet. Which is a compliment.\n\nYou have to be comfortable in your own skin. Own it. Don\u2019t shout it to everyone, but the friends I\u2019ve revealed that to are comfortable with me being a virgin. I don\u2019t usually say it like that. I just say I\u2019m inexperienced, sheltered, or haven\u2019t had any girlfriends before. They know what it means. I even have a close friend who teases me about it. We have that kind of friendship.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kbfgwq/i_was_a_30_year_old_virgin_and_thought_i_would_be/gfzfdc2/"}
