Used to think about being forever alone. Hated my body. Had pretty bad self image. Confidence was below Marina trench. I had tried to workout earlier but never had any continuity to see any changes and then would self hate and loathe to the max for failing. \n\nOne day, I just decided enough is enough, if I can wake up daily and have breakfast then why can't I workout and change my body. Also had a pretty bad date experience. The girl whom I was with was eyeing someone accross the table. He was definitely smarter and well built.\n\n My body image was biggest reason for low confidence.\n\n\nI hit the gym like clockwork. Within 2 months, I started having positive changes. People were complimenting me. My self confidence improved immensely. This was evident from my body language infront of girls. I started going on dates again. And to be true every girl liked me. Few one, whom I may have thought to be out my league were falling for me.\n\nI think, being incels etc doesn't matter. It's the actual hardwork and backing urself up matters.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kbfgwq/i_was_a_30_year_old_virgin_and_thought_i_would_be/gfj0ull/"}
