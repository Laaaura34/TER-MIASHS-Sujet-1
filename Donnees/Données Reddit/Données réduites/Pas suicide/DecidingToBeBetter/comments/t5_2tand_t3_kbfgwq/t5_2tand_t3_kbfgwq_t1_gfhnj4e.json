There is a lot of racism and misogyny on reddit, for example, so I will consider that these may influence what is presented as fact in some of the posts/comments I read. If I care or am curious, I look into them for myself and seek out diverse trusted sources to form a more educated opinion that aligns with my personal values. I encourage you to consider this in your day-to-day life as well. Please be kind to yourself and refrain from speaking certain things as fact or making certain statements regarding things you have not personally informed about. You may say certain things that are not in true alignment with your values, you may get into unnecessary or unpleasant conversations and tbh if a person engages with you regarding a statement you made and you do not have much to back it up, it mat reflects poorly on yourself or lead you to the thought/belief that you are \"too dumb\", you're better than this, do not dismiss or diminish yourself and your agency. \ud83e\uddda\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kbfgwq/i_was_a_30_year_old_virgin_and_thought_i_would_be/gfhnj4e/"}
