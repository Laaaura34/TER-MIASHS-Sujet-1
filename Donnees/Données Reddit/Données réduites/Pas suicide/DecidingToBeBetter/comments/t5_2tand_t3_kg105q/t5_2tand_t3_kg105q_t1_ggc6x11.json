I can def relate to something you said, a lot of time our anxiety can create problems or viewpoints that aren\u2019t even there in the first place. Once you realize that and begin replacing the negative w the positive, life gets better. \n\nI\u2019m so happy for you! Keep being true to yourself and an inspiration for others. Remember there\u2019s gonna be good days and not so good ones, but what matters is keeping a positive mindset. Doesn\u2019t matter how many times you fall, it\u2019s how many times you get up again. You got this!\n\nPS. If you\u2019re a Star Wars fan, I HIGHLY recommend the Mandalorian on Disney+ ...I just finished watching the szn 2 finale tonight and it was SO good. You\u2019re def in for a treat!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg105q/im_starting_to_become_more_of_my_authentic_self/ggc6x11/"}
