Ask yourself before sharing it: Are you sharing it to connect with others or do you feel like you have to share it? I share when it\u2019s the former. If it feels forced, don\u2019t do it. Also these days, people have many ways to disengage with any content or posts you share. If they don\u2019t want to see it, they can unfollow. And if they unfollow, I\u2019d say they are not people you want in your everyday life. \n\nMerry Christmas to you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg105q/im_starting_to_become_more_of_my_authentic_self/ggezwfs/"}
