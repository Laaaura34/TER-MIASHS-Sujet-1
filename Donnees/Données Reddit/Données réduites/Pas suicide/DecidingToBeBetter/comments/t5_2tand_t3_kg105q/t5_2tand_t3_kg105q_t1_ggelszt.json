I went off social media completely for a while and now that I'm slowly coming back little by little, I feel rather antsy about sharing an album or podcast I'm listening to because I wonder if I'm even doing it for attention or because I genuinely like sharing stuff. I always tell myself it's the latter but then there's a voice in my head that asks if it's vanity disguised as non-conformity? I debate this in my head until I get tired+ annoyed and don't post anything hahaha\n\n\nBut good for you, OP. Have a wicked Christmas this year :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg105q/im_starting_to_become_more_of_my_authentic_self/ggelszt/"}
