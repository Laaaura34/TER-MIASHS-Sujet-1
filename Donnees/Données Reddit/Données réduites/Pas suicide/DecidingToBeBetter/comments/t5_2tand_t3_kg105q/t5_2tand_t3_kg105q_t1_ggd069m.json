With social media, it can be toxic and cause me to go down a rabbit hole. However, I\u2019m hoping by posting what I really love and sharing my true self, I\u2019ll attract others, maybe some new friends, or connect more with people I already know! Making new friends is one of my goals in 2021.\n\nFor example, I was afraid to share I loved Star Wars on Instagram. Now, I\u2019ve started to. I\u2019ve already had a talk about the franchise with one of my old classmates.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg105q/im_starting_to_become_more_of_my_authentic_self/ggd069m/"}
