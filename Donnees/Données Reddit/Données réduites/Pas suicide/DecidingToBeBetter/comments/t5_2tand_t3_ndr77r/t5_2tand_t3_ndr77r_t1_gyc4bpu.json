That's it. That's how this is solved. You can go further though. \n\nIf your son was really upset, this is a huge bonding opportunity. Ask your son how he felt. Tell him you are sorry for embarrassing him. Ask him to help you next time. That if he thinks you are acting bizzarre, to tell you so you can have fun with him instead. This teaches him that apologies are wonderful things that bring people together. And helps him feel like he has some power in the relationship to ask you to not behave in ways that he finds upsetting. You can reinforce this by reminding him next time you go to a party that he can let you know of you should stop drinking and eat something to sober up.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ndr77r/i_want_to_crawl_into_a_hole_i_need_to_be_better/gyc4bpu/"}
