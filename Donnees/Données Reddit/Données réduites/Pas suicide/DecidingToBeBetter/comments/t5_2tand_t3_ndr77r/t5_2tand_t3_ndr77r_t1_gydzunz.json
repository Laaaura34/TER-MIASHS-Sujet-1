I was going to suggest that maybe your mom might have been projecting some of her own embarrassment onto you, but it sounds like that isn't the case. \n\nYou sound like a very caring person and I hope you're not going to beat yourself up over this. I think you know how to deal with guilt, considering that you have already done everything you can to make it right. \n\nShame is trickier. It can almost feel like it's wrong to let go of shame, like shirking a punishment that you deserve. But the purpose of shame isn't to make us suffer so we can prove to ourselves how sorry we are. I think of shame as the rumble strip on the highway: its purpose is to rattle us, scare us awake. It feels awful so that it will work, not because we are meant to feel awful. Let shame teach remind you of the person you're meant to be, and focus on being grateful for the lesson.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ndr77r/i_want_to_crawl_into_a_hole_i_need_to_be_better/gydzunz/"}
