I have been in this position before and struggle with anxiety and depression but it no longer rules my life. Antidepressants take the edge off the intense feelings, but in my experience it is important to take a holistic approach to tackling these feelings. See a counsellor/therapist if you can or feel comfortable to. Look after your physical body; drinking water, getting outside in nature and moving your body through exercise can make a huge difference. Journalling your feelings without judgement can be a great release. Meditation is also an incredibly powerful tool, I would recommend the app \u2018waking up\u2019. Reading psychology books can give a good insight into discovering why you feel this way. Books I have found useful are: How to do the Work by Nicole le Pera, Good Vibes Good Life by Vex King (if you like a spiritual outlook) and The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck by Mark Manson is also a great way to get a different perspective on life.\n\nI wish all the best in tackling this. My greatest advice for you is treat yourself like a loving and caring parent would; show yourself compassion but make sure you do the things that you know are good for you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdivg6/how_to_stop_being_depressed_all_the_time/haqfuv1/"}
