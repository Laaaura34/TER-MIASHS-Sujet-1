The long walks are really helpful, especially if you do them without music or anything. Maybe take a seat in a grassy field at some point on your walk and write down some thoughts in a journal. \n\nHave you considered reframing being \"stuck\" as being \"free\"? As in, you are free to do whatever healthy thing comes to mind? You don't have to worry about bringing someone else, or asking their opinion. Grab something for dinner you don't normally get to eat, and it doesn't have to be complicated, like a type of pizza you miss. Or the spicy wings instead of the bbq ones. \n\nWhen was the last time you created something? A poem, a story, an essay, a drawing, a painting, a wood carving, a scarf, a card, an envelope puppet, or written a program?\n\nYou have the freedom not to worry about anyone bothering you, run with it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oiy343/the_next_month_is_going_to_be_a_practice_in_being/h4yfqht/"}
