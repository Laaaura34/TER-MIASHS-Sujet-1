I would start with why won\u2019t they talk to me and if you like the vibe check out the album. \nI found his music a few years ago and it\u2019s changed my view on everything. I am a loner because I choose to be. I have realised that there is nothing wrong with that and ever since I started owing it (internally) it\u2019s made me so much more confident. And also realising absolutely no one has all their shit in order has helped me too. People hide their suffering well but it\u2019s still there.
