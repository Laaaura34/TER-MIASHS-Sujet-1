The first time was the first time I tried getting clean, and found some perc\u2019s at my gf\u2019s that I had just moved in with (after 3 months only, dumb I know).  I didn\u2019t even think before I popped those suckers.\n\nThen this most recent time, about the same amount of time clean I stumbled across about a G of dope in a bag on the ground.  However, this time I simply picked it up, checked it out, walked 50 feet and tossed it in the trash.  \n\nWhen our priorities are in order and the desire and knowledge are there, it\u2019s crazy how much we can grow.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bomu9b/72_days_clean_found_some_coke/enib48a/"}
