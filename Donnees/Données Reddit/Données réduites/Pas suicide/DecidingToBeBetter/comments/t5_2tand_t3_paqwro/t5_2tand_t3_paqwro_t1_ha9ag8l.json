Don't be afraid, he's called a \"boy friend\" for a reason. He's also your friend, and a true friend wouldn't betray you that way. Normal people wouldn't condemn you for what you've been through. For your own sake, maybe focus on an event, or perhaps talking about why you have certain (unhealthy) boundaries or habits that you want to focus on making yourself better. That way when you're feeling overwhelmed he knows you have been triggered and that's why you feel that way.\n\nFor me, when I felt overwhelmed, it's a lot like the gaslighting. You have an old example A that has happened in your \"database\". Then maybe your boyfriend shows you kindness (example B) and it feels wrong because this is new. You take this data and compare it to A and you're overloaded with feelings. This is okay, and it is normal. That is why Mindfulness Meditation helps so much, because it grounds you in the moment by using breathing exercises and you focus on your breathing.\n\nI sincerely hope this helps you. If you want, you can ask more questions in my dm <3\n\nEdit: I forgot an important detail! My fianc\u00e9 was my friend for a year before we got together. Without knowing details, I would suggest to take it slow when telling him what you've been through. If you feel that you can continue with more, you can always ask him if he's comfortable with hearing more.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/paqwro/how_do_i_get_comfortable_with_the_kindness_of_a/ha9ag8l/"}
