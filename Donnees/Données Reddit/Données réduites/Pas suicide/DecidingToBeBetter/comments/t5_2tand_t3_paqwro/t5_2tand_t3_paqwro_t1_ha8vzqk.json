I don't believe in \"testing\" your significant other, it's either you trust them or you don't as far as I'm concerned. My relationship with my ex actually crumbled because I started to distrust him and found out he was lying to me about some things that had the potential to ruin my life. It was a huge wake-up call, and I left him about a week after finding out. I even told him (the guy I'm talking to) that I feel like trust in a relationship is more important than love to me.\n\nThis really helped, thank you so much!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/paqwro/how_do_i_get_comfortable_with_the_kindness_of_a/ha8vzqk/"}
