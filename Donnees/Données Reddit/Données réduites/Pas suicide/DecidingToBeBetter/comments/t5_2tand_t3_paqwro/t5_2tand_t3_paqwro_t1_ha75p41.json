Being with my partner at first was \u2026. scary. And felt unnatural and uncomfortable because it\u2019s not what I was used to. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop. 3 years later, and it still hasn\u2019t. I am in therapy (high recommend) and it\u2019s a process! It takes work, because you have to sit in these uncomfortable feelings, but I try to remind myself that if something comes up, we can discuss it and try to fix it. Stressing over it just makes me sad about our relationship", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/paqwro/how_do_i_get_comfortable_with_the_kindness_of_a/ha75p41/"}
