I've been teaching myself programming and music, but I've just gotten a little too 'static stoner'.\n\nI'm bilingual english-spanish but by no means focused specifically on the place i go including both or even either language. I guess I'm just saying that I know this part of a young man's life can be truly incredible, and there's an entire world of things to do and people to see, I just don't want to be one of those kids who wastes these years stuck in my shell, doing the same repetition. I know that alot of the things in life people want (money, cars, college education/career to some extent etc.) aren't even close to things that have *meaning*, and I've heard for years how rich older people would trade it all to be young and poor. So, say you got your wish, what would you do? Say you're almost there, what are your hopes and dreams and crazy adventure fantasies?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ar0tnl/what_would_you_do_if_you_were_nineteen_healthy/egjy1ne/"}
