As someone who has depression as well, I\u2019ve felt I\u2019ve lost my light too. The only times I really feel it are when i sing. Are there any singing groups u can join? I know that is easier said than done. I\u2019m looking for one now because I feel like I\u2019m going crazy without it. That is the one true thing that makes me happy and I can almost feel God when I sing. Taking the step to get counseling is great. I\u2019d say focus on small victories. It is hard to develop good habits... I am really struggling with that right now, but even just making it to a workout or eating healthy for one meal are victories. Wishing u the best. just know u are not alone! ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/89rm30/how_do_i_turn_my_darkness_into_light/dwun5n2/"}
