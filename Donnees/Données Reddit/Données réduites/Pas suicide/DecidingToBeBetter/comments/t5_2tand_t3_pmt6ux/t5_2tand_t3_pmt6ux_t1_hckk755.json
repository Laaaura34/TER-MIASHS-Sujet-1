My hobby (and hopefully future career) is 3D art too. It\u2019s probably a the epitome of perseverance. Don\u2019t be discouraged on that one, it\u2019s a huge learning curve. Difficult and buggy software, incomplete learning resources. Even after many years, I get to a problem that takes me a day to solve and it\u2019s very discouraging. Having people to go to for \u201cdumb questions\u201d is really important. I am pretty good at self-teaching but I take classes online just so I get access to their discord community of students doing the same homework as myself. \n\nAt the core though it\u2019s just knowing (trusting) that if you put in the time, you will get results. It may not be a finished project, even failed or discarded projects are results and part of the process. At CG school, we would call the mid part of a project (after the \u201cI\u2019m excited about it phase\u201d) The Valley Of Suck. More positive people call it The Awkward Adolescent Phase. Totally normal and it\u2019s just a grind. Schedule time, sit down, and put in the time.
