Narrow this list down to 2 or 3 things, and pick one of them to start working towards tomorrow.\n\nHold onto the expectation that you will need to put 1-2 focused hours in every day and will probably suck for awhile, and eventually, in seemingly no time at all, you'll find you have some skill built up in whatever it is you chose to pursue.\n\nIf you can't find the motivation, then try to reduce your focus & time spent on other things that aren't helping you do the things you want to do long-term.
