How did you feel? Did you workout, it is place to express as to how you feel.i was recommended this because i tend to bottle up emotions, not proud of it, don't bottle up emotions, have a let out like singing loud in the bath or heavy workout and another don't be a proud ass like me, seek for help to people close to you when needed, you're not a burden to people you love. I hope everything is good back home and you stay healthy\noh and another, eat vitamin d supplements, omega 3\nthey releave some symptoms of depression such as no sleep or excess sleep.\nHope this helps and all the best to your recovery", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o3d3lh/23yo_male_with_depression_and_anxiety_have/h2baz0t/"}
