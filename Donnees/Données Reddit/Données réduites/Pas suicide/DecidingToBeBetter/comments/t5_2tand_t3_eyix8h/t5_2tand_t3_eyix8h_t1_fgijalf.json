What are you more committed to - feeling great when you wake up nice and early in the morning, or always saying yes to your friends (or whatever else is getting in the way of your routine)? When I thought about controlling myself with discipline, I'd always end up saying \"fuck it, I deserve a break\" and doing whatever I wanted, which would lead to self-loathing because I felt I failed. But now when I think \"I deserve to put myself first, I deserve to feel happy and proud of myself\" and think about what I'm gaining from my routine, I go for that instead. This has worked wonders for me in my journey of changing my relationship with alcohol. While sometimes I still drink, I don't punish myself for it. But I do notice more in the morning that I don't feel as good, that I'm not as focused, that I'm not as productive, and the way that I feel about myself. And the following night I might think, instead of \"I deserve this treat\", \"I deserve that peaceful yoga in the morning, I deserve to enjoy my entire day.\" Forming a routine isn't an all or nothing idea - if you stay up late one night there's no reason to say you'll never get back to it again. You haven't failed. But try focusing on the benefits of keeping to your routine. Only you know why you want this, so focus on that. Hopefully this helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eyix8h/how_do_you_balance_life_and_routine/fgijalf/"}
