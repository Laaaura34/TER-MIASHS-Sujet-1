It will also drive away depression.\n\nEat more omega-3 foods like organic avocadoes and organic cashews. Include organic dark chocolate in your life.\n\nMix dark leafy vegetables in your diet with organic fruits in a smoothie.\n\nTry some mindfulness meditation, power yoga, and qigong to deal with any stress or negative emotion in your body.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dac5ai/this_is_gonna_be_a_long_read_im_sorry_but_i_need/f1ppffm/"}
