My mom is constantly on a diet, and I know that for many women whose body image is a huge and deep place of pain, they can easily take that out on others. Its clear that she has a lot of unresolved issues about how she felt at your age, and she doesn't want that for you. I'm certain that you can achieve peace and happiness with your body regardless of your size, and her pain is no your burden. I'm glad you are able to separate the two things. Perhaps in a calm moment there can be a way to help the two of you work together on this issue (for her). Healthy eating and exercise are important for overall health and longevity, but looking a certain way is not. If you both feel confident that you are sharing the goal of health, perhaps she can let go of some of the negative self talk and deep seated wounds that she has clearly suffered in her past.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kpooz9/f17_i_was_able_to_respond_to_a_negative_behavior/ghzlo8u/"}
