This melted me.\n\nI felt that the energy you put in your post needed to be matched, and I remember the times when I had growth in my relationship with my mom and all I really wanted was a motherly \u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d You deserve that so much right now.\n\nAfter I read your post I wanted to give you both a hug and a standing ovation. It\u2019s such a huge task to change the voice in your head, especially if it\u2019s telling a toxic narrative that\u2019s spanned generations; but at the same time, I also feel that it\u2019s one of the most important and impactful things a person can do.\n\nThere\u2019s one other thing I\u2019ve done that might resonate with you: I recorded myself saying affirmations in the second person, like I\u2019m talking to myself (\u201cletting go of memories and experiences comes naturally to you\u201d), and that really helps when the old inner voice crops back up. I made a long list from freeaffirmations.org. Also a quick little hack when old thoughts return is to mentally acknowledge then and let them go by holding the thought in my mind and saying \u201cI see you and I release you\u201d \u2014 and this works better for me than trying to suppress things.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m just so proud of you and excited about the joy and freedom you\u2019re going to discover.
