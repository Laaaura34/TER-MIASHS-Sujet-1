I've seen so many people, and I myself have come up from failure. We all make mistakes, and seldom are those mistakes life and death in regular life.\n\n\nSo in pretty much most cases of failure, there is a way to come back from it.\n\n\nTry to frame any mistake you make or any fear you may have as just being a learning curve.\n\n\nTry to remember a time when you were a  kid and you were learning something for the first time. You didn't get it right at the first time, you had to try and try and practice until you got it right. \n\n\nThis is what you have to do in life.\n\n\nCut yourself some slack, realize that no one is keeping score (except you!).\n\n\nIt's okay to relax the standards you hold yourself too. It doesn't mean you can't still be successful. But there is more to life than being more intelligent than other people.\n\n\nYou have to find joy in your life in other things as well. \n\n\nIt's okay to be smart. But obviously it's not making you happy to be fixated on it.\n\n\nYou are 17 years old, you have plenty of time to take some twists and turns in life. \n\n\nSo try not to fret so much if things don't work out exactly how you want them. There is always a path to where you want to go. It just may be different than you originally envisioned it :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7m82q8/realized_that_intelligence_has_been_obstructing/drxcmjf/"}
