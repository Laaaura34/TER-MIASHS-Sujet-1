Literally this is new for me... I havent gotten this angry  in MONTHS. In fact I'm the one who is the least angry of them all. I talk to them occasionally. I do the chores,  what bothered me is how am I insufferable for saying \"so now that mom is here you care about the kitchen's cleanliness, even tho i was the one who cleaned everything when mom was gone?\" (my mom went on a trip to Texas, I was the one who did most of the chores while my sister was always out)  Later I found out the white egg didnt even spill over the counter. I admit I was angry, I was cracking the eggs harshly because of those emotions stacking up from other experiences I had in the past week with her but instead of wondering if I'm ok or just simply leaving me alone she goes on and conveniently complains about the counter's cleanliness for the first time ever even tho she never cleaned it when my mom was away. Everytime I wanna express how I feel about certain things  they ignore me and talk over me on purpose so I sit there and shut my mouth and repress all of that shit. It seems like the only way for them to listen to me is yelling and exploding at them.  its like she saw that I was mad and wanted to make me even more mad instead of leaving me alone. why I have to repress my feelings and be the bigger person only to explode again in the future because no one else is willing to think rationally or fairly?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvbeqp/i_just_exploded_emotionally_at_my_mother_and/he9o4x3/"}
