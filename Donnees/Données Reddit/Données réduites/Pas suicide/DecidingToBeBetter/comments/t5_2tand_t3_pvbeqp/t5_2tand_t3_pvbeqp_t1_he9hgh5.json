Or maybe I'm just scared to live.  I'm a gay 24 year old guy living with my 26 year old sister and my 55 year old mom working remotely inside of my room. I feel like I have nowhere to go in my country, I hate it so much. (I'm from latin america) everything outside is such a mess. Never had close friends, never experienced sex,  never had a boyfriend. Idk if that's what I want tho or maybe I'm just predsured by society or I'm just not normal. I don't seem to know what I want. Hate my work, my career. Extremely socially anxious. Used to have dreams but lost interest on them. I went to 6 different therapists and a psychiatrist and it didnt work out .. what bothers me is not knowing how much I can afford and how much I need. Not knowing how long it will take until I can finally feel ok. Feel lost 24/7 dont know what the hell I'm doing. I also feel like I cant control myself anymore after exploding that way... so I can't trust myself. I think im just talking here just so I don't feel alone cause nothing seem to work. I get paralyzed and stressed out when I try to do something that could be beneficial for my future, I have lots of gray hair already and I'm not even in my late twenties... i hate myself so much that I dont wanna fight for this body anymore, i also feel like I cant love anyone else since I hate myself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvbeqp/i_just_exploded_emotionally_at_my_mother_and/he9hgh5/"}
