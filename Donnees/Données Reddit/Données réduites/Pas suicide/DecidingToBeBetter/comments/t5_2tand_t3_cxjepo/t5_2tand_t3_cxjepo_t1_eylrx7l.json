Start reading Aeon.co. That will be helpful in opening up your eyes to new topics. To hold long conversation either you need to be loaded with information and master at delivering it or powered by good questions with willingness to listen. While reading is one tool, talking to new people and strangers is another. As the strangers dont know much about you they will probably entertain at least once and even if they dont you wont feel bad. And yeah, you need to plan your conversation to an extent. For example if you ask about hobby and the reply is hiking then your second question can be : where did you go for hiking last time? How far is this place? Did you plan the hike or was it totally unplanned? If i want to start hiking what's your advice? All these questions are enough to engage the hiker for atleast 15 mins.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cxjepo/how_do_i_stop_being_a_boring_rniceguy_with_dumb/eylrx7l/"}
