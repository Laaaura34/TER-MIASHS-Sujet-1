It seems like you are being pretty tough on yourself because you want to change - I really get this. As someone who has struggled with depression throughout my life and had my first major episode of it at your same age, I want to say that even though I don't know more about you than what you have written here, that depression happens to everyone and it is normal (to an extent). It is okay that you are not where you want to be right now. It is so easy to mentally conjure who you used to be and compare yourself to that. I think that you are strong for having insight into what is going on with you, for writing about it here, and things can get really hard but don't lose hope. You may have no idea where to start and that is also okay, because you are navigating a whole new journey, a whole new version of yourself. You haven't lost the parts of you that had lots of friends or played these sports. Be kind to yourself, you deserve it!\n\nAre there any people that you can talk to about this who might be able to give guidance? People you trust? Are there any resources at your school to help with motivation/editing for college apps? I know it's hard to ask for help, but it's okay to do. Chin up, you've GOT this :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/icc6vg/ive_17f_decided_to_be_betterbut_have_no_idea/g22g4gn/"}
