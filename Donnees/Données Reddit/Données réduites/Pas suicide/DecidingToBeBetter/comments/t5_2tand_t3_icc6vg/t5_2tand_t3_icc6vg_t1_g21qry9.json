You\u2019re so young, with your whole life in front of you!\n\nSmall consolation, I know. \n\nThere\u2019s lots of reading you could do on self improvement, but I\u2019ll just say that *you need to set small achievable goals and complete them, and build out from there.*\n\nWrite a list of these goals down. \n\nCheck them off as they are completed. \n\nBegin exercising again, start small. Walking, biking on flat ground.  \n\nWrite down your daily exercise goal, check it off when done. \nI\u2019d suggest eventually working out enough that it makes you tired enough to help you get a normal sleep cycle, which is probably half of your issues-sleep deprivation is a common torture technique, and is prevented under the Geneva convention, so don\u2019t torture yourself!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/icc6vg/ive_17f_decided_to_be_betterbut_have_no_idea/g21qry9/"}
