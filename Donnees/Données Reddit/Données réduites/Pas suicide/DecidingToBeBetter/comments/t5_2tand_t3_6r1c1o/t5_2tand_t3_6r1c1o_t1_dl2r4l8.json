Also, thanks for reading my rambling post :)\n\nI experimented with going gluten free for a week or two but gave in because it felt like I was taking on too many challenges at once...but I've listened to Kelly Brogan talk about the effects of grain, and especially of the gluten in many grains nowadays and how harmful they can be, but you're right, I've got to step up and commit to going gf for a while.\n\nI like the idea of \"unfear\"...it's totally true. I get so bothered by the fact that I've walked through fire before and yet find myself back in teh fear place...but I guess that's just because i have an unrealistic, romanticized version of what \"stepping through fear\" looks like...\"stepping\" might not be the right verb...maybe \"trekking\" is better haha.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/6r1c1o/some_questions_about_brain_fog_purpose/dl2r4l8/"}
