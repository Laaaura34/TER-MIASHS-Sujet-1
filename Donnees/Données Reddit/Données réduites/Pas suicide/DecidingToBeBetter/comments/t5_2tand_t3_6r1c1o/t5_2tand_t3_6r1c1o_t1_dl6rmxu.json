It was actually a really solid episode to listen to. He recommended a book called Musashi by Eiji Yoshikawa based on a real samurai named Musashi. Tim Ferris is scheduled to come back for episode #100 and they will review the book. The book is amazing so far, I have just started reading it and can see why Tim Ferris recommended it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/6r1c1o/some_questions_about_brain_fog_purpose/dl6rmxu/"}
