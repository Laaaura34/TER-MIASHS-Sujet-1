I've written thousands upon thousands of rambling, angry, sad pages in to word documents or online mental health forums. Most of the time it just made me feel more hopeless and confused because my thinking would get so derailed by the heavy stuff I was trying to talk about and I would end up hating what I had written and even the act of writing as therapy. But inevitably the pain would get so bad and I would be so lonely and tired of the other forms of therapy I knew of that I would just come back to writing it all out. I've been trying to change this hatred of writing and force myself to think through my writings a little more so that they actually yield some greater understanding of life.\n\nThanks. I do feel like a fucking lion...but it's been muzzled and I've reverted to people pleasing behaviors when I'm around others, especially the bullies, and saved the rage for when I'm alone. It's been a major source of cognitive dissonance, having one side of me be this fuming beast ready to maul my problems, and then time and time again taking the submissive, \"safe\" route to avoid conflict because I have never been able to handle it masterfully or even tactfully. It's either I paint a big target on my forehead and get walked all over, or I explode and end up with the type of results that being a rage case brings you. \n\nI'm starting to build pride and the more I sense it the less willing I am to \"forget\" the importance of that mindset and let the old \"me\" drive.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/6r1c1o/some_questions_about_brain_fog_purpose/dl2snbq/"}
