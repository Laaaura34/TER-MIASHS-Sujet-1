I would say I've never really been in a \"mojo\" state for more than a few brief moments, say while snowboarding or when I'm running a pool table for example. But until recently I never really knew that I could actually live in a place of enthusiasm, contentment, passion, and actually being excited for things and feeling like a whole person moving through a fulfilling life and dealing with the slings and arrows that inevitably arise, as opposed to a chronically injured soul focused solely on the slings and arrows.\n\nActually, I shouldn't say I never had mojo...I remember sustained days of enjoyment and creative excitement and stimulation when I was a kid...stupid puberty ruined all that though.\n\nI always heard the self development crowd talking about living the life of your dreams and stuff like that but never really thought it applied to me. It just always sounded so foreign and pollyana-ish because my internal and external experience were so punishing and I was so weak that I just spent all my time reacting and putting out fires and didn't have the energy to fathom something greater.\n\nNow I'm learning to access that inspiration but not become overstimulated with excitement or depressed with self criticism and fear of failure...but just focused and continuing to work hard.\n\nMojo mojo mojo mojo mojo...this should be my mantra.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/6r1c1o/some_questions_about_brain_fog_purpose/dl2rla9/"}
