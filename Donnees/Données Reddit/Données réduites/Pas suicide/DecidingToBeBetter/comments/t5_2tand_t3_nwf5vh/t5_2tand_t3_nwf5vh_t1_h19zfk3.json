Some things i've done:\n\n- Listening to a 7 min song i really like so brushing its less tedious.\n- Got an rechargeable electric toothbrush\n- Got a waterpick (sometimes i don't use it very often, but helps cleaning the back teeth with some messy foods)\n- Using some good flavored tooth paste (there are charcoal mint, or those green / pink ones for kids)\n- Also having more than one brush in the house, one by the bed, one in the kitchen, so you always have one available.\n- Rinsing with water and eating a piece of apple after eating.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nwf5vh/hygiene_tips_for_when_youre_at_your_lowest/h19zfk3/"}
