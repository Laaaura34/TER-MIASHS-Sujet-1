You can lose the ability to feel pleasure and enjoyment entirely, it's called anhedonia. It is hard to describe if you've never experienced it. You can also lose executive functions like the ability to initiate actions, meaning you cannot physically make yourself do things. Maybe you lose the ability to feel emotions at all. Or maybe all you feel is anxiety so painful that people cause themselves physical injury to escape it. The symptoms can vary a lot. \n\nDepression isn't the same as feeling sad for a bit. It's a serious condition that cripples you. I'm sure you mean well but advice of the kind you just gave can feel, to a depressed person, like you just told someone in a wheelchair that getting up and going for a jog would help them walk better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nwf5vh/hygiene_tips_for_when_youre_at_your_lowest/h1a88rd/"}
