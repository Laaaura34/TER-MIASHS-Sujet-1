It was by picking up small habits like these, little by little adding more, that I was able to start clawing my way out of the pit and back toward some semblance of normalcy (and I've done quite well since then-- I went back to college to get my degree, started work as a self employed translator, learned how to knit, how to play the ocarina, and eventually developed a daily routine that helps keep me grounded and focused).\n\nAs many others have said here in the comments, OP's claim that \"anything is better than nothing\" is of vital importance! It is this general mindset that saved me from the hell I was in. And while I've learned how to better manage my depression, it hasn't gone away. It never will. So when it gets bad, I go easy on myself and just do the best that I can under the circumstances. In so doing, I've thus far managed to stave off anything even remotely close to the wretched episode I had years ago. \n\nThanks for sharing these things, OP. \u2764", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nwf5vh/hygiene_tips_for_when_youre_at_your_lowest/h1ajg8l/"}
