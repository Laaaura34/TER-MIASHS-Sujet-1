And the cycle will continue unless distractions and/or willpower come into the mix.\n\nUnderstand that this whole dilemma is in fact caused by depression. Think of these problems as side effects, not the direct cause of your low self esteem. You can do everything right, and0 your mental state still might not waver. It's a very slippery slope, when you take into account that these side effects will only make your depression worse.\n\nI urge everyone to please, listen to your body and start with eating something your body needs, healthy food. A healthy mind does not come without a healthy body. \n\nAlso find an activity that requires some form of exercise. Chasing your dog, taking them for a walk, parking your car wherever instead of as close to the store as possible for the extra walking distance, etc.\n\nJust like depression can be a slippery slope, confidence in yourself is an exponential climb. If you haven't spoken to a therapist or haven't used antidepressants, I strongly recommend it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nwf5vh/hygiene_tips_for_when_youre_at_your_lowest/h1ak57h/"}
