They need to be let out to the backyard, need to be fed, etc. They have saved me. \n\nThank you OP for this post, I love it. I struggle so much to shower when I\u2019m depressed. I overeat, and thus gain weight, when I\u2019m in a dark place, and it\u2019s SO HARD to see my body that way. I\u2019ve managed to add washing my face, brushing my teeth, and flossing back into my daily routine, but still haven\u2019t managed daily showers. Thanks for making me feel less alone.
