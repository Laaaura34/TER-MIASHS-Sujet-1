Just like leggings, T-shirt\u2019s etc. When I get up on a day off I change into these immediately instead of letting myself stay in pyjamas. When I spent all day in pjs it felt like a huge other task to then go pick out an outfit and change into jeans or whatever so this was a barrier to me leaving the house. When I\u2019m in comfortable but acceptable day clothes i feel I can just go.\n\n-if there\u2019s an overwhelming list of things I have to do but I\u2019m avoiding I tell myself I just have to pick one today. One today is better than none at all, I do this daily and now can get through my essentials. \n\n-if my mind is telling me to avoid some part of my basic routine I just accept that. Like some days I\u2019m in the shower and my mind is like \u2018don\u2019t want to brush teeth\u2019, previously I would have sat on my bed until I found the motivation to brush my teeth, now I just accept that and move on with the rest of my routine, I always end up with the energy to do it after.\n\nVocalising the immediate benefit of things. I\u2019m terrible with delayed gratification, for years this prompted me to just lie in bed for hours on end. I got into this habit of affirming the short term benefits I\u2019m getting from what I\u2019m doing and not thinking too much about long term pay off. I do my skincare routine \u201cthis feels so good and clean\u201d, I complete a task I didn\u2019t want to do \u201cI\u2019m so glad I can stop thinking about this now\u201d, I clean my house \u201cI\u2019m excited to get into bed tonight in a clean room with fresh sheets\u201d. Through time I do get instant gratification from completing these tasks now\n\nAlso if, like me you find you\u2019re drained and fatigued often I\u2019ve started combating this by first questioning \u201cam I really too tired or am I overwhelmed?\u201d, before returning to bed I drink a pint of water and see if I\u2019m feeling dehydrated also and for some reason this often helps. \n\nDon\u2019t push it. I committed to treating my mental illness like my physical illness and with that when I\u2019m having a really bad day I don\u2019t keep pushing, I rest, remind myself it\u2019s not forever and some down time won\u2019t end the world. \n\nOutsource if you have the resources. Have your work clothes dry cleaned, have a cleaner come in for a day per week, use a meal prep service, take your car to be cleaned. I have a friend who never washes her own hair ever, there\u2019s a training academy for hair dressers that offers services at a significant discount, she gets a wash and blow dry every Friday. If you have the resources there is no shame in taking the pressure off yourself and outsourcing tasks you struggle with that will significantly improve your quality of life", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nwf5vh/hygiene_tips_for_when_youre_at_your_lowest/h19n511/"}
