If you stop using again immediately you'll still have been sober for about 97% of the time. \n\nIt's always a good idea to look at the lead up to the relapse: what caused the relapse and how can you handle it better in the future. Can you take some steps to ameliorate your problems? Is there room for a promotion or additional education to improve your position on the labour market?\n\nI wish you the best!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o9ze3z/36_days_of_sobriety_and_i_relapsed_with_a_weed_pen/h3f3ltc/"}
