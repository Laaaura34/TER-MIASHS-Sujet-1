Now I don't know you personally, but you're *a lot better than you think, or even realize.* I'm so sorry you gotta deal with this shitty disease too, and that you're stuck at a job you don't like just so you can afford your lifeline, but be kind to yourself. So you stumbled a little bit, but now's the time to pick yourself back up and continue your journey to sobriety. Just wanna add, I'm proud of you! Quitting anything isn't easy, but you got this! :D", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o9ze3z/36_days_of_sobriety_and_i_relapsed_with_a_weed_pen/h3gnst0/"}
