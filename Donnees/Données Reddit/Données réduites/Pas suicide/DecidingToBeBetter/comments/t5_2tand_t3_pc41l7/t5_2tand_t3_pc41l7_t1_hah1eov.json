Capitalism says you should want to own things, society says you want success, which it defines as having money and a career, for example.\n\nYou don't have to want any of those things. You got lucky and get to exist for a while, you can do with that existence what you want. Evolution only cares that we survive long enough to procreate, wanting a reason for it is a uniquely human thing, I think. Many find answers in religion.\n\nPersonally I think that only you can say what the meaning of life is for you. You must choose it, and find that which feels meaningful to you. Some find it in enjoying the moment while it lasts, in hedonistic pleasures. Some want to add to the human book of knowledge, helping us understand the world. Many of us find it in human connection. In helping others, or wanting to leave good memories behind in the next generation when we die. In wanting to leave the world a better place, or at least not worse than we found it. Or in building something lasting, or making something with our hands that will remain when we are gone. When you die, what do you want to leave behind?\n\nImportant to note here is that if everything feels meaningless to you, that can be a symptom of depression. You don't have to feel sad to be depressed. Losing the ability to enjoy things is also a common symptom. If that is you, don't trust that feeling. It is the depression talking, it's not the truth. You don't deserve to feel that way, get help.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pc41l7/whats_the_point_in_doing_anything/hah1eov/"}
