So why bother with living? Stop wasting ressources.\n\nNah, but seriously. Remember when you were a kid? You playing outside and mom is like \"in 15 minutes you need to go to bed\". Those 15 minutes were awesome. That's life. We all got 15 minutes before we go to bed forever. Don't waste them on feeling sorry for yourself. Enjoy them while you can. You don't do anything for anyone else, so do what you enjoy. \n\nIf you like being fat and eatin 15 pizzas a day, just do it. It doesn't matter if you are consciously accepting the consequences. That's the hard part. Knowing what you want and knowing what it will do to you. Don't get \"fit\" because some internet fucks keep telling everyone to do it. Don't do anything that you yourself don't want to do. No one can force you. Just know the consequences.\n\n**Make conscious decisions.**", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pc41l7/whats_the_point_in_doing_anything/hakbefo/"}
