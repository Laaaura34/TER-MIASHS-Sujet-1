He decided to grab life by the balls and do as much as he possibly could before he died. He travelled, made love to many women, and took a lot of risks that most people would be scared of. Last I heard he was the head of an illegal motorcycle gang somewhere, sons of anarchy style. The point is he decided to make the most of his limited time alive. Yes, it's all pretty pointless given the scale of time, the universe, etc., but life is a gift that shouldn't be wasted.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pc41l7/whats_the_point_in_doing_anything/haho4ql/"}
