She asks me a set of questions that I would have to outright lie to hide stuff from her. My problem was that I hid an online partner from her. It would have been ok if I hadn\u2019t lied about it. For 13 years. We do the check in to build trust, and to help me remember to be honest, to disclose things, even scary things. I don\u2019t have to be perfect, just honest. Talk about feelings before they become actions.
