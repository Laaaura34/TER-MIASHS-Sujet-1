Way harder than you would expect. Good job on starting. Keep it up. \n\n People who say that if you were in love you wouldn\u2019t blah blah blah don\u2019t understand what it means to be an addict, to be damaged. We can love, and be fucked up. We just tend to screw it up. Saying you wouldn\u2019t do those things if you were in love is like saying a smart person wouldn\u2019t have a drinking problem, or an eating problem. \n\n  You aren\u2019t entitled to have your partner stay after the things you\u2019ve done. They may leave you when you disclose. But they might not. If that happens, accept it with gratitude and trust their feelings for you. Above all else, be honest with that person who accepts you. Truth is hard, but it\u2019s also the thing you have the most control over. You can always start being truthful again, right now, the instant you see that you have slipped.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ii4bmx/being_truthful_is_hard/g353odh/"}
