That feels great and deserves to be celebrated. I hate to be this guy, but keep the humility as you progress. It will keep you grounded and focused as things become more complicated and invested. The only thing worse than not progressing is progressing and then losing it because you got big headed. And on that note, you will actually find that the further you go, the mentality of \u2018fuck everyone else\u2019 will get your dreams kicked in the face. Everyone wants to thrive and grow. It\u2019s about knowing how to work with others, uplift where appropriate, while maintaining work ethic and independence.
