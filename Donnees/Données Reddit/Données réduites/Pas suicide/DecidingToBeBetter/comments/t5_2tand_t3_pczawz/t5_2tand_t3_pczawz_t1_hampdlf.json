I dropped out of college 3 times. I enjoyed learning sure, but I lacked motivation because I had no idea what I actually wanted to go to school for. So I picked up more shifts at work instead. \n\nI ended up taking about 2 years off to travel abroad, unfortunately that's near impossible in the current situation, but my clarity came from living out of hostels, meeting people from all around the world and hearing their experiences, and just enjoying life doing hikes in the mountains. \n\nI moved back to my home country at the end of 2020 with a fresh mindset and striving for goals.  I hadn't heard of gap years when I first came out of high school and didnt actually discover about them until going abroad talking to everyone that is taking a year to travel/gain experiences. \n\nNow 26 and about am now interviewing with companies in a field I'm passionate about. I'm personally glad I finally stopped bouncing back between work & school and finally told myself I'm taking a break to figure things out.\n\nThis is just my experience, it really comes down to what you ultimately want to do. That includes what you do NOT want to do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pczawz/23_and_might_drop_out_of_school_again/hampdlf/"}
