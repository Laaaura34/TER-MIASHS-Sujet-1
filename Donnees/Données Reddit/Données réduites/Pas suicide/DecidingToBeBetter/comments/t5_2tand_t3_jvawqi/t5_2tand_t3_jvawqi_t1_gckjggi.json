I had been so good with walking pre-covid.  I walked daily with a neighbor.  We stopped during the beginning of quarantine and just haven't restarted.  I'd love to walk with my husband but he walks at a much faster pace and when he walks at my pace, his backpain kicks in so that one is a no-go.  I really need to start again.  I think you've inspired me!   My route was only about a mile but it was lovely seeing everything as it changed seasons in our neighborhood.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jvawqi/how_to_hack_happiness_chemicals_a_guide/gckjggi/"}
