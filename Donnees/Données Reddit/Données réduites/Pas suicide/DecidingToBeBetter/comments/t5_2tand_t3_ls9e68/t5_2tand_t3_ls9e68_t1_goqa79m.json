The Manifesto my life and heavily impacted my views/understanding of class.\n\nI thought I was raised \"middle class\" but realized that was a lie. My parents were \"working poor.\" Four of us lived in a tiny two bedroom (parents in the basement), every home repair was done by family, my dad worked blue collar jobs, grandma babysat us constantly, my mom was an artist who grinded for money every single day, I got my first job at 15, etc.\n\nI currently work a well-paid, white collar, \"managerial class\" job but try every single day to be class conscious and realize just how lucky I am.\n\nGood for you, OP, for admitting a blind spot and working on it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ls9e68/unlearning_classist_views/goqa79m/"}
