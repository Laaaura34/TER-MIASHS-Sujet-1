That means letting myself stay inside when I'm exhausted, making sure I'm eating and staying hydrated, being gentle with myself when I fall short or feel I've failed, etc... I also try to remind myself of the mistakes I made, as well as the ways that they hurt me. And that helps me remind me that I need an upgrade.\n\nKudos to you for the reflecting and the committing to working on you. I really admire it!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ns3b6j/i_need_a_relationship_detox/h0m8jtp/"}
