We were already separated, sure, but I had just lost my younger brother/best friend 2 months prior to receiving the papers. So even though we had been separated for a long while, I wasn't expecting to deal with an actual divorce any time soon. I'm sorry you've been going through something similar. I agree that finding connection in other types of relationships is most likely the best route to take. This is what I've been attempting to do and it is very helpful for me. Honestly, I can imagine being completely content with life on my own with just a small group of supportive friends. It's just getting past this hump of feeling like the only way to have deep connections with people is to be in a relationship with them. I will take your advice though and make sure I'm very conscious about my relationships (friendships, intimate relationships, or otherwise) and ensure I don't jump into anything I don't actually want or am ready for. Thank you for sharing this with me!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ns3b6j/i_need_a_relationship_detox/h0lyogs/"}
