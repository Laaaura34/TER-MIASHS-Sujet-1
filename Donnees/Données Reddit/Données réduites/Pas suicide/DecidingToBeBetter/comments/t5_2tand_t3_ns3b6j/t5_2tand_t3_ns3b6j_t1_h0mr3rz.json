One of the reasons why it ended was because I felt like I had completely lost myself into it and my inner self was begging me to take a step back and heal my traumatic childhood before trying to make an adult relationship 'work'. I cannot begin to tell you how transformative these last 6 months have been. Don't get me wrong, there have been many days, weeks even of extreme pain and tears. But during this time, I tried as best as possible to work on myself by being as healthy as possible both physically and mentally - and I'm talking small things like making it a point to step outside every day even if for 5 minutes, taking the vitamin D tablet, doing yoga 3 times a week, speaking with my therapist once every 15 day, reaching out to friends etc. - and not only have I been able to see how wrong the relationship was that I'd been stuck in, but also started to heal my childhood wounds - which will pay dividends for the rest of my life and especially in close relationships. Though its hard to see most people my age begin to get engaged/married, I just remind myself that I'm still young (27F), and try to think of this time that I have to fully focus on myself as a gift. Continue the good habits you've adopted, without putting pressure on yourself if you don't meet your goals everyday. You got this!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ns3b6j/i_need_a_relationship_detox/h0mr3rz/"}
