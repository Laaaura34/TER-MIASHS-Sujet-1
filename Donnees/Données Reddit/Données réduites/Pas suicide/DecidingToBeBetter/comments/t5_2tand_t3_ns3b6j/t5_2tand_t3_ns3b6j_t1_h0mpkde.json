You clearly know yourself, as you\u2019ve stated a lot of self reflection in your post and responses. This is really good. Keep reflecting!! \n\nThe other thing you need to remember is that there could possibly be multiple people that come into your life you are compatible with. Some of them end up as relationships and some of them end up as great friendships. I know I\u2019ve got a few awesome friends who I would be compatible with, but I appreciate them as a really good friend who I can depend on and vice versa. \n\nWe are definitely conditioned to attach ourselves to someone who seems to \u2018fit\u2019 us. But sometimes a friendship is actually the best result to preserve that relationship longer term. \n\nFeel free to DM me if you wanna chat. I have a  tonne of Reddit pals I regularly chat to about life. \n\nI\u2019m studying psychology and counselling to find it interesting to hear all points of view!! \n\n:)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ns3b6j/i_need_a_relationship_detox/h0mpkde/"}
