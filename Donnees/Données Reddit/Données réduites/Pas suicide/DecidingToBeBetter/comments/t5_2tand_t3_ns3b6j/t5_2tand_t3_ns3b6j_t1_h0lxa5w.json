I miss things that I haven't even had since I got married. But it's as if I repressed wanting those things because I was a firm believer in never getting divorced (not religious, just saw my parents do it one too many times). But now that we've finally started the divorce process, it's as if all those things are catching up to me all at once? \n\nI created a dating profile the day I got the papers, but deleted it after about 15 minutes lol. I've not even attempted to pursue anybody because I truly do know that it's not what I want. I'm familiar with this lie you would tell yourself though. I've noticed myself doing it a lot. I tend to become attracted to my friends and now that I've had more time to talk to them and make new friendships, it's been like walking a tightrope. \n\nEverything that you've said really resonates with me. Thank you so much for sharing. I can feel myself at the cusp of really great things that I can build for *myself* but I think it's scary to do all of that for yourself, right? Like what if you put in all this work and you build exactly the life you've always dreamed of and then you're still not happy? I didn't realize that's what I am afraid of until literally this moment as I'm typing this to you. So thank you for allowing me the space for some self-reflection. \ud83c\udf3b", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ns3b6j/i_need_a_relationship_detox/h0lxa5w/"}
