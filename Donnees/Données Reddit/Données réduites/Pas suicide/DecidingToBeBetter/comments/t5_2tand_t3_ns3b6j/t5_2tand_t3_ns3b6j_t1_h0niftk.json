I also had a job that paid me well, but didn't give me satisfaction, nor my work peers. So both these factors combined made me very aware of why its important to take it slow, work on yourself, build a perception, build a routine, a habit, a little wealth.\nAs a man I believe its easier to stay single. For you, you just have to get over the constant feeling of finding another man for support and share. See, eventually you are gonna have a wonderful man. Why not wait a little?  Like I tried my luck with a few tinder/bumble dates, but nobody really clicked so much so that I could make them my long term partner. But did I have fun? Yes. Did I still want a partner? Yes. But I was okay with lving alone for the moment. Till I find someone whose vibe matches with me. Till then better no one, than the wrong one.\nPS- I broke up, from my three yr old relationship in the summers of 2016. Single since then.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ns3b6j/i_need_a_relationship_detox/h0niftk/"}
