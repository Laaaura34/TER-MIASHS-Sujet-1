But the strange thing is that at the time I've been single for 4 years and I didn't realize that I was treating my life as a \"relationship purgatory\", like I was just waiting for life to make sense again, and that was dependent on me being in a relationship. I was entering another one and my therapist asked me \"*are you sure it's important for you to be in a relationship right now?*\" and I realized I've never asked myself that question before.\n\nI wasn't ready to *really* think about it at the time, so I hesitantly said \"yes\" and it took me 2 years of frustration and passively cruising by my life as a secondary character to understand that I was the only person capable of validating my choices and values. It wasn't a traumatic experience, but it was a big detour of what I wanted for my life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ns3b6j/i_need_a_relationship_detox/h0mfhhk/"}
