She said she lost attraction but also that I wasn't affectionate, two contradictory things. We had a loving, super close, passionate relationship and had rewarding, connective sex regularly. She left so suddenly that I wonder now if she has BPD (she was abandoned as a kid and has ADHD, and those factors link to this condition). She's always been all or nothing, black or white about life. She decided over the course of a day or two that I wasn't worth fighting for. It's been the shock of my life. The woman I loved is dead and gone, and it destroys me. But her doing this so impulsively and heartlessly shows that she was probably never right for me. I need strength, maturity, and stability in a partner. However, I will say there's a lot I could've done better. I'm learning now how detrimental comfort and familiarity are to intimacy. We were too close, I think. I was her only friend and we lived in a rural area so we could make music and art. It felt suffocating at times. So independence is so crucial.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ns3b6j/i_need_a_relationship_detox/h0n8zuj/"}
