You need to find other small things that do that.  Going for a walk, taking a few moments of mindful meditation, taking a minute to read the news or a chapter in a book.  When I worked at home I kept freeweights at my desk and would do a set occasionally.  I know that sounds like \"work\" and not \"comfort\" but your body interprets it the same way.  Listen to a song to clear your head.  Watch an ASMR video on YouTube.  Pet your cat.  Text a friend you've been meaning to.  \n\nI like to chew sugar-free gum also, really helps with the oral fixation, and you get a dose of flavor.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q41v09/how_to_find_non_food_based_treats/hfvpnlm/"}
