It\u2019s equivalent to being stranded on a boat in the middle of the ocean with just the people in your immediate life. That\u2019s either a good thing or a bad thing in itself. If I could go back and give my 15 year old self some advice on how to cope and excel, this is what I\u2019d tell him: \n\nYou need two things. You need to search for something you love to do, love to be apart of or love interacting with. A hobby, a craft, etc. For me, it was the guitar. I loved playing the guitar and after 26 years of playing it, I\u2019m pretty damn good! Use this to focus your mind and inspire yourself. It only helps if you truly love it. Doing this will also inject you into a community of folks that love doing your thing as well\u2026 maybe even help to find you someone special.\n\nThe second thing is you need to commit to the things that are required of you. That continues to be one of the hardest things for almost everyone in this world but there is definitely a difference between forcing yourself to do what\u2019s needs and fully committing. Commitment means you are all in and in with a smile/ of your own free will. Having a reinforced attitude will have a major impact on the results you have. Your grades, your interactions with people, even your self confidence will benefit from your commitment.\n\nNone of this is easy but it\u2019s not supposed to be. It\u2019s supposed to be challenging and you aren\u2019t meant to achieve all of this over night. The very first thing you have to do ready your mind and heart and then go for it, but according to this post, it sounds like you\u2019ve already made that choice.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for the long post. When I read it, it went straight to the heart and I wanted to offer something. Idk if it will help or not but for what it\u2019s worth, I wish you the best of luck and really do hope you find your way through this funk. You\u2019re very young and have a future waiting to fascinate you. You just need to be willing to make it there and allow it to.
