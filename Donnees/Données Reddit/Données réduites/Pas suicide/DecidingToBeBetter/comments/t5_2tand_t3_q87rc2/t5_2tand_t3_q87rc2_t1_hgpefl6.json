The beginning of my senior heart I was talking to a person Id gone to school with sobe 3rd grade,  but had just really gotten to know him. \n\nHe told me one day he was surprised how nice I was. That he'd always thought I was stuck up because I'd never really talked to him.  \n\nI was horrified.  I decided that day that I'd rather be uncomfortable than have people think I didn't want to talk to them.  It was literally one of the top best decisions I've ever made.  My senior year was the best.\n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q87rc2/im_15_and_deciding_to_take_things_in_my_own_hands/hgpefl6/"}
