If/when someone yells at me for something I did:\n\n-if I just say \u201cokay\u201d \u201calright\u201d etc it makes it seem like I don\u2019t care.\n\n-if I say \u201cI won\u2019t do it again\u201d it sounds like an excuse, and I really DON\u2019T want to say \u201cI won\u2019t do it again\u201d because like OP said, saying that is a PROMISE that you won\u2019t do it and if you do it again now you\u2019ve broken that promise.\n\n-if I say nothing and just stand there then it either makes me seem like I can\u2019t stand up for myself OR that I don\u2019t even care enough to respond to them. \n\nSo...maybe asking how I can fix it IS the best way to go:)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mhc0wg/what_is_the_appropriate_response_to_someone_being/gsyj7lc/"}
