If you agree that you messed up, then yes, it sounds like a good idea to apologize, ask how to make it right, and make a plan for changing that behavior. If you don't agree with them, then I think you should voice that, because then you have no intentions of changing the behavior and agreeing with them or saying \"okay\" just feels disingenuous. In that instance, don't attack them being angry (people are allowed their own emotions) but explain calmly why you don't agree with them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mhc0wg/what_is_the_appropriate_response_to_someone_being/gszs5yu/"}
