Unfortunately too many people just let themselves fly off the handle and it is never a good outcome, I think. \n\nThat said, if you've made a mistake then the appropriate response sometimes is apologising. But first, let me say that someone yelling at you or telling you off is almost never appropriate. So in that situation I would calmly let them have their say so long as they aren't being disrespectful. If they are being disrespectful I would ask them to stop doing that, and if they continue I'd end the conversation and tell them to talk to me when they are ready to calmly discuss the matter. \n\nOnce you are both ready to calmly discuss the matter, you own the mistake (don't make excuses) and tell the person you'll work to do better next time. If you've done something that warrants an apology, then you apologise, and then own up to the mistake and tell the person you'll work to do better. So for instance, say you forgot to do something important for someone:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Other person:** Hey! Why didn't you do X!? I was counting on you to do that and now I can't do Y. Why can't I ever count on you?  \n>  \n>**You:** I completely forgot to do X. That's on me and I apologise for that meaning you can't do Y. I know this has happened a few times, and I am working on it so I can do better. Next time I'll set a reminder or something so I don't forget. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope that helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mhc0wg/what_is_the_appropriate_response_to_someone_being/gsyy6fl/"}
