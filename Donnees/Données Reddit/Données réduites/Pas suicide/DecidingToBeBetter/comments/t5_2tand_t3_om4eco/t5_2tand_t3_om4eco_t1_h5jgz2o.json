I almost didn't survive my last depression, which I landed in when I sacrificed all my time and effort to land a job that was simply never going to have me. I developed an eating disorder in sacrifice of having less people harass me personally for something I wasn't fully in control of. I sacrificed the one dream that mattered to get a sensible degree in a field that never landed me a job either. It's not always about comfort, a lot of the time it's as much about the comprehensible gain in relation to what exactly you're leaving behind.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/om4eco/you_will_stagnate_and_fail_if_you_are_not_willing/h5jgz2o/"}
