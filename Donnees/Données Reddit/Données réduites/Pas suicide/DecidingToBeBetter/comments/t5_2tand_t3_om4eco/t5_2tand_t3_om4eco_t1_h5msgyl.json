Parents have an awesome TV, I get cooked meals whenever I ask, I have an xbox to take my mind off from the shit they force me to learn in university.\n\nBut, i\u2019m ready to leave all of this to leave in a small dorm/studio and struggle to the point where spending even a dollar would make me poor (currency differences). Yet what i\u2019m sad about is not leaving the comfort/luxury. Yes i\u2019m sad to leave my parents but that\u2019s a sacrifice i\u2019m willing to make. I worry more that my parents life will be empty when I leave (i will definitely visiting them at-least once a year) because they will have no one to annoy them after two decades. They will go into debt to send me there but I will know I am the reason for their emptiness and this is the part I cannot seem to find a solution to.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/om4eco/you_will_stagnate_and_fail_if_you_are_not_willing/h5msgyl/"}
