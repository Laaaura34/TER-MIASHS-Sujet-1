Comfort is what our brain tries to direct us toward. Discomfort is what makes us excel. The discomfort of getting up and starting for the gym or that run. The discomfort of signing up for that new certification in IT to advance your resume. The discomfort of turning off the social media to do yoga. All of these things--seeking discomfort are what send you on the path of advancement. You make yourself go to the gym after work to advance your career. Why are the two related? Because the discipline you build in exercise and clean diet transcends over to the career. And that is what most people miss---you don't seek discomfort just on one area---you strive to sharpen your sword in every plane of your life. Hope that helps---Charles", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/om4eco/you_will_stagnate_and_fail_if_you_are_not_willing/h5jtrig/"}
