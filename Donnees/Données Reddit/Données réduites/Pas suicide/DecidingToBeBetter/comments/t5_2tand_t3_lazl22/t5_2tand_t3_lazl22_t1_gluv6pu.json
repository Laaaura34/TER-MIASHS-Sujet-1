I moved back to my parents after uni and due to my nan living there, my sister having mobility issues and my mum getting cancer I've been doing an inordinate amount of housework. I'm actually moving out to my girlfriends today, very nervous about whether they'll cope without me despite recent improvements in their health but I know it's something I need to do, I've barely seen my friends or girlfriend in a year and been out of work for 10 months because of covid. It's been a big challenge. \n\nYou might be interested in a concept in philosophy  known as the primary and secondary qualities of an object. Grass is in fact perceived as green but some would argue it's not green. What it is, is made up of molecules with a certain texture and density that absorb certain wavelengths of light, however none of these wavelengths of light inherently would have names or would be perceived as colours without eyes to do that perceiving. Therefore the texture and molecular make up of the grass are primary qualities, inherent in the object itself. The \"green\" however is a secondary quality that doesn't exist in the grass but only in the space from our optic nerves to our brain stem. \n\nFeel free to DM me I'm super busy later today but I'll be around during the rest of the week.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lazl22/25m_finally_kicking_my_worst_habit_to_the_curb_so/gluv6pu/"}
