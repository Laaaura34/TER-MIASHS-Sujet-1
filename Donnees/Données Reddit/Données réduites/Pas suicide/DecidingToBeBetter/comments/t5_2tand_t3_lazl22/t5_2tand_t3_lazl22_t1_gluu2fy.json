There was a lot of emotional trauma. Not because my parents were bad parents or abusive, but because they had health issues and so our home fell to shambles. I was constantly stressed and always felt like in my later years just cleaning a hoarders home. I can't blame my parents, but it hurts. When everything happened with the law, my parents felt so much guilt and shame like they'd failed me while other family members tried to say I tried to kill them doing stupid things (my manipulative grandmother.)   \n\n\nI do look for the science a lot. That's something that concretes ideologies, motives, theories, etc. If you say \"Grass is green.\" I'm going to ask you \"Why?\" and you'll say \"It's because of chlorophyll.\" That's the answer I want. \n\nI would love to dive deeper into conversation and may PM you if you'd be up to discussion. I'd love a deeper insight if that is possible on these matters.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lazl22/25m_finally_kicking_my_worst_habit_to_the_curb_so/gluu2fy/"}
