Fall off the bandwagon? That's ok get right back on, don't fall into the trap of thinking \"i lost my streak so might as well indulge for a while since it's already broken.\" It's not about the streaks, rather the pure number of days you're feeling healthy and accomplished.\n\nI also want to add in here that I think the majority of healthy relationships have room for masturbation as well by both partners in addition to sex together. Our partners shouldn't bear the burden and demands of being our sole outlet, right? Nobody wants to have a sexually frustrated partner in bed mad when you're not feeling up to it or vice versa. So in general I would advise moderation rather than black and white abstinence, but if you feel you're truly facing down real addiction, sometimes total avoidance is the only route available.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lazl22/25m_finally_kicking_my_worst_habit_to_the_curb_so/gltubkn/"}
