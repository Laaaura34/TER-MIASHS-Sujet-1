My two cents:\n\nYou are 100% going to relapse. \n\nYou will almost certainly relapse multiple times, even if it's several months between. \n\nBoth of those things suck, but *they are natural consequences of addiction and THAT IS OKAY.*\n\nYou and your partner should both understand this--if you have the expectation that you're going to magically 180 your habits in a day, a week, or even a month, you're just going to disappoint yourself and your partner. It is a *process* to overcome addiction, and that's why people go to AA meetings for their entire lives to make sure they stay sober. \n\nYou got this man. When you fuck up, **own it** and keep trying to be better. That's all you can do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lazl22/25m_finally_kicking_my_worst_habit_to_the_curb_so/glrzzhg/"}
