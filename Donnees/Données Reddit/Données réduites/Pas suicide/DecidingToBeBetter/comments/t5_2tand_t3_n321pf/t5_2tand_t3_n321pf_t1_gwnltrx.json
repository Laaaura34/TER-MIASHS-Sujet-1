People always wonder how someone who seems like they have everything commits suicide. Like \"They were rich and famous! How could they possibly be unhappy?!\" Because people seem to think having x thing = happiness. So, a lot of people think that if x happens I'll be happier. Having more money, losing weight, getting a different job, etc. While possible it's not always true and putting a lot of stock into something that could lead to feeling even more down. You got what you thought you wanted, so why aren't you happy? Happiness is way more complicated than that and something I've struggled with for years. I even fell into the thought that I'll be happy if I'm in a relationship, which put way too much pressure on the guys I was dating. Then when they broke up with me I was devastated because I revolved too much of my life and happiness on one person. It was really toxic and unfair of me to do, but I realized what I was doing way too late. The struggle is to find things every day to be happy about so when that big goal does happen if it doesn't pan out you don't sink even lower and feel like a failure. Maybe I'm making sense, maybe not lol.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n321pf/happiness_is_where_you_are_now_or_nowhere_at_all/gwnltrx/"}
