I\u2019m 33 (I think. Time means nothing anymore lol).\nThe Rona semester was absolutely soul crushing. \n\n\nHowever, and maybe it\u2019s just the type of person I am, listening to the 18 year old kids in basic GE classes at the beginning of my journey get excited about the curve the professor uses and knowing that I am now an \u201cI\u2019d like all the extra credit so if I fail the final I still have an A\u201d student gives me massive amounts of pleasure. \n\nIt\u2019s easier and harder when you\u2019re older. You don\u2019t connect with the kids and don\u2019t want to party with them but destroying the curve makes it worth it. Fuck curves. \n\nI also found that the teachers held me to a higher standard but were more willing to chat with me about assignments or grades. They took me more seriously. \n\nGood luck! It took me many tries to finish college. I needed to be older to finally plow through.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ih1ufb/im_35_and_finally_going_back_to_school_on_monday/g2yxpfe/"}
