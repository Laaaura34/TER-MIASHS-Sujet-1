She said she waited for me to learn how to take care of myself, prepare my own food, commute to school and excel in my studies before she decided to take up Elementary Education.  She's been selling fruits in the morning, school in the afternoon and studying and doing chores in the eveneing when we were already asleep. \n  A decade later and now my mom is the school head and we, her children had reached all of our dream professions too. She didn't give up or give in to others people's criticism. When I asked her what made her go to school again, she only tells me that before she had us, it was always her dream to teach. So I'm gonna say that you can do too, there's no age or time limit to reach your dream.  :) hoping for your happiness and success too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ih1ufb/im_35_and_finally_going_back_to_school_on_monday/g2ym61h/"}
