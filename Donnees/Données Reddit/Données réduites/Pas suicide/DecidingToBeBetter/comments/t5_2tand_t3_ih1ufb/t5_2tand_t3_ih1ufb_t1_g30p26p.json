I believe this is my 4th time trying to complete school because my first partner was a complete asshole! He wasn't supportive at all. Now I have a 4.0 (something I've never had!) And a supportive fiance. I am 33 and a mom to 2 girls. Had my first at 18. You got this woman!!!! Kick ass and take names. You are more than a mother. You are a human who deserves to have everything you could ever dream of!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ih1ufb/im_35_and_finally_going_back_to_school_on_monday/g30p26p/"}
