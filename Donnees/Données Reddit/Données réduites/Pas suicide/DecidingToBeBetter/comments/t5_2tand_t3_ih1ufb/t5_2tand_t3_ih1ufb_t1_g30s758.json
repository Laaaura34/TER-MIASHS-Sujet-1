That may seem like a long time but it's really not, and if your fiance is in a better time schedule that I had with working and perusing a degree, she could do it much quicker. \n\nThough I did receive my degree, I stopped short of getting my PE stamp. So I while I can engineer mechanical systems, I have to have another engineer review them and stamp them, and for that service I pay them a fee. And at this point in my life, that works out fine for me. But I would encourage your fiance to go the extra steps while you guys are younger. You never know what the road in life reveals as you get older.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ih1ufb/im_35_and_finally_going_back_to_school_on_monday/g30s758/"}
