You may find something that excites you and becomes a hobby.  Even if you don't, you still will have interesting things to talk about, e.g. last weekend I did X, or I'm taking a class in Y next week.\n\nOff the top of my head, here are a few things I have tried in the past few years:\n\n- Rock climbing\n- Surfing\n- Hiking\n- Back Packing\n- Yoga\n- Kayaking\n- Parkour\n- Ariel Silks\n- Running Obstacle courses /Mud runs\n- Puzzle Hunts\n- Locked Room Escapes\n- Glass Blowing\n- Encaustics\n- Candlemaking\n- Stone Carving\n- Cheese making\n- Bread making\n- Chocolate/candy making\n- Board Game Design\n- Playing a Psaltery\n- Archery\n- Knife Throwing\n- Stain glass window making\n- Community Emergency Response Training\n\nSome I might only have tried once, others I did or do regularly.  But any one of them can provide for an interesting conversation at a party.\n\nLook at your local community ed/rec center, REI store, or just google a topic for a class or meet up.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3g75it/what_are_some_cool_hobbiesinterests/ctvk4ys/"}
