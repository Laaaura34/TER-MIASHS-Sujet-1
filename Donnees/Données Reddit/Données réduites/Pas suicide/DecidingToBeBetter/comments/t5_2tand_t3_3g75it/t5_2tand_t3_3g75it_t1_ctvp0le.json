But as a bonus it's a hobby that costs negative money, increases your health, makes more efficient tasks you were doing regularly anyway, increases your self-reliance and has a very flexible level of commitment. If you don't know what to do with your time may as well invest time in something useful.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3g75it/what_are_some_cool_hobbiesinterests/ctvp0le/"}
