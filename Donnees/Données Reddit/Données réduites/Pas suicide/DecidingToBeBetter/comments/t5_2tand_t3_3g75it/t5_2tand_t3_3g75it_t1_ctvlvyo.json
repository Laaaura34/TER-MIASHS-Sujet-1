Ride it to a park or to a nearby body of water. If you like, get Strava and track your times and see if you can beat them. See if there are bicycle meet up groups in your city (there are). Try commuting to work. There's a world of bike adventures to be had and you can come at them fast or slow. Check out r/bicycles and r/bicycletouring.\n\nFor a different kind of challenge I recommend trying martial arts. Even if you don't see yourself as a \"fighter\" you'll find tremendous value in training and you'll meet a lot of people. I'd suggest Brazilian jiu jitsu r/bjj, r/judo, or r/kickboxing. \n\nYou can start both both cycling and and martial arts at about any age or fitness level. Both are capable of changing your life.\n\nEdit:splelling ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3g75it/what_are_some_cool_hobbiesinterests/ctvlvyo/"}
