Art, dance, sports (tae kwon do, soccer, rock climbing, etc.) -- something where the end result of your hobby can be easily shown to other people. Reading is awesome, but not something you can show other people; this also goes for gaming, tv, movies, and so forth. Sure, you can talk about it, but I always find action more interesting than speaking. \n\nArt Ideas:\n\n* Sketching\n* Painting\n* Sewing (can be a surprisingly attractive skill for a guy to have, if you're a guy)\n* Ceramics\n* Glassblowing\n* Play an intrsument\n* DJing\n* Producing\n\n\nDance (takes a while and a lot of hard work to get to a good level, but very much worth it)\n\n* Popping\n* Bboying\n* Locking\n* Krumping\n* Waacking\n* Hip-hop choreo\n\n\nSports\n\n* Rock-climbing\n* Boxing\n* Kickboxing\n* Tae Kwon Do/other martial art like aikido, Wing Chun, judo, \n* Soccer\n* Tennis\n* Running\n\nMisc\n\n* Woodworking\n* Cars! (learn how to fix your car, do body work, etc.)\n* (other stuff I'm not thinking of right now)\n\nDisclaimer: Some of this stuff might not be 'cool', but is certainly interesting. And I'm always partial to artists, even if they're not stereotypically considered cool.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3g75it/what_are_some_cool_hobbiesinterests/ctviuvb/"}
