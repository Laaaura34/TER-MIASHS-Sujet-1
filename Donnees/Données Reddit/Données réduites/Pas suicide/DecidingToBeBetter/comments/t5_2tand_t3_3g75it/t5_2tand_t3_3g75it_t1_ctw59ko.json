Lots of really friendly people and plenty of eye candy if you're looking for a date or something like that. You get the mental stimulation of figuring out a problem with the physical stimulation of yoga, body weight training, and crossfit.\n\nAnother good hobby (albeit a little harder to get into) is programming. You get to create something with your hands and engage in abstract thought. I started at www.codecademy.com and now am gearing up to make my own watch faces with the Pebble watch and automate the lights in my future apartment. \n\nIf you're not super physically minded or really motivated in the computer world, I would STRONGLY suggest visiting art galleries. You can meet people and look at some breathtaking photos/paintings/sculptures. I'm basically planning a trip to Oregon based off of a photo gallery I went to. Occasionally the artist will be there and you can learn about how they made themselves into who they are. \n\nHope this helps!
