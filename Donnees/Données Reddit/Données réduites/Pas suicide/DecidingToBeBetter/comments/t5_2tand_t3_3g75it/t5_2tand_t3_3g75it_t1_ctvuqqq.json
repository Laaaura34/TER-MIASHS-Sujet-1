I did the same thing, just started attending various classes and get togethers of things and gave them a shot. Even those I didn't follow through taught me something.\n\n\nStuff that weren't mentioned that I tried: Beach volleyball, Ultimate frisbee, acroyoga.\n\n\nI also play footbag pretty regularly, go for jogs and walks, write (comics, stories, diary, thoughts), learn a language.. There's plenty to do. It doesn't all have to be a physical activity, but those are usually easier to find a group of and join in.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3g75it/what_are_some_cool_hobbiesinterests/ctvuqqq/"}
