I also love to cook.\n\nAdditionally I love beer. My goal is whenever possible, whether I go out to a restaurant, or make dinner at home, is to try something I've never tried before. So for example, I'll have head cheese appetizer paired with a beer that was aged in bourbon, and then rum barrels. I never thought of it as a hobby until recently.
