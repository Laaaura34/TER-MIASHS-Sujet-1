I have a bunch of hobbies but don't use it to get validation, I enjoy it for myself and people seem to be interested in my hobbies as well.\n\nI collect arcade games/pinball machines, have a vintage Honda motorcycle, cooking, photography, craft beer, camping, 3D printing and music/records. \n\nOut of all of those - cooking is the best one. Babes love it, tons of resources online, cheap, and also a good life skill! Get off Reddit, go out there and do something cool that makes you happy.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3g75it/what_are_some_cool_hobbiesinterests/ctvzcph/"}
