Thank you. It\u2019s an incredible pendulum. He swings between \"I love the fact I have a great relationship with my brother as we grow older\" to \"You were a sh*t person with our parents as we were growing up and I hate you for it. Oh but I love you.\"it is complicated by the fact that he has my mom\u2018s caregiver and so I do visit her and have to see him. At this point I think I\u2019m just focusing on my mom what time she has left but I am saddened by the fact that, frankly, once she passes there will be no connection between him and I.\n\nEdit: I do believe he\u2019s a generally good person and he takes great care of mom which I am completely thankful for. I just wish that whatever it was it was driving him to these extremes would get resolved because it just makes it so much more difficult.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nc8od0/the_people_that_hurt_us_the_people_that_empty_us/gy5j5ra/"}
