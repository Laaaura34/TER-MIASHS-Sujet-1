Right now I\u2019m sitting in my room at moms at 40 years after traveling 1200 miles to get here.  I\u2019ve managed to destroy my life again.  I tend to do this from time to time.  I used to feed off it.   Proving to myself, I guess that I can swim after burning every fucking bridge.  But I\u2019ve changed.  That\u2019s for young men not grown adults and this hurts. Some days are better then others I guess.  And I guess I needed this.  I miss her but.  Life goes on and since my relapse and my son passing I lost myself.    Today I\u2019m starting to understand who I am.  Again.     I\u2019m a fighter.  This is where my best moments in life have come from.
