I\u2019ve always felt like I\u2019ve left the door open for him to talk to me anytime he\u2019s feeling stressed or in a position where caring for our mom leaves him in a place like that. Ironically, this particular episode came during a time when I\u2019m trying to come to see my mom (since we\u2019ve both now been vaccinated) and give him and his wife a weekend away. I know that stress can cause all sorts of reactions and I\u2019m not expecting anyone here to be the key to unlock such a complex relationship but I guess I just feel truly baffled by this periodic need for him to denigrate me based on history. I\u2019m no Angel to be sure but I\u2019ve always felt we both have mom\u2019s interest at heartAnd I wish we could just get together on that. I do appreciate the conversation and there\u2019s no need to reply because frankly I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ultimately any answers.
