I have no friends or family where I live. They are all the next state over, 6 hours away.  I work from home, so I am always here.  I can't get a hotel because what's the point?  I'll just come right back here to work.  My actual office is 4 hours away.  And with a pre-teen, I can't exactly leave them home alone.  Ive tried the things that bring me joy, and they were working.  Then all that changes over the weekend.  I can't stand to look at my yarn and hooks.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nc8od0/the_people_that_hurt_us_the_people_that_empty_us/gy5jerq/"}
