I found that what has kept me off it is finding new destressing, coping mechanisms that I enjoy. I play video games, read, stretch or just sit on the toilet contemplating my life decisions while browsing through Reddit and calling out to my son for toilet paper; all of these things over time have made me feel better than a cigarette ever has. Plus you\u2019ll LOVE the way you smell. One thing I absolutely hated and still hate about anything smoking related is the scent. I don\u2019t like smelling like my habits. \n\nI hope you\u2019re able to discover and engage in new hobbies, even if it\u2019s something as simple as watching all six seasons of BoJack Horseman. You got this bud :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hjxhva/been_able_to_stay_away_from_nicotine_for_10_days/fwplac3/"}
