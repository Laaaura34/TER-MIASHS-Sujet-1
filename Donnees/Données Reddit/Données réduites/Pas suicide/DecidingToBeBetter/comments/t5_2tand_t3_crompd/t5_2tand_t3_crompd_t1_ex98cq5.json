I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m blameless in how things worked out. But there is a difference between trying to maintain a dialogue and receiving nothing but someone being closed off and being complacent. I truly think the people I was with just weren\u2019t the right people for me and there were signs since the beginning. \n\nTotally agree relationships are a two way street. I have seen men be more secretive and unable to express their emotions more than me but that\u2019s just my experience. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a men vs women thing, just a human thing where people don\u2019t interact in a way that promotes healthy relationships and interactions. I have, however, tried to facilitate more dialogue and was shut down in my previous relationships. I don\u2019t think my post was a stab at men in any way shape or form because I\u2019m with someone now who is completely different than my previous relationships and it\u2019s not a definition on men, just my situation in general. \n\nSorry if you took this offensively as me trying to put down men because I am not at all.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/crompd/dont_settle_for_less_than_you_deserve/ex98cq5/"}
