Same thing happened to me with the dream haha, when my ex started walking towards breaking up, I had a dream where she went ahead and did it very bluntly and told me exactly why. In real life I never got that closure she just sort of ghosted me. Just cause somethings over now doesn't mean it is for forever, people fade in and out of our lives. I'm happy you have some kind of closure, even if it was just in a dream.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iegeg2/a_friend_broke_up_with_me_and_asked_for_no/g2jw8kz/"}
