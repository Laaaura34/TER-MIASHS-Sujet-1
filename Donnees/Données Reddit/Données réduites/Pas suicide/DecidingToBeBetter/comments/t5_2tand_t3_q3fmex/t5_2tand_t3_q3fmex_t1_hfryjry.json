But it helps to visualize yourself as if you were your own younger sibling, or if you were your own best friend. Nobody is \u201cperfect\u201d and that\u2019s totally okay. We are who we are, and everybody has the capacity to be the best version of themselves. It\u2019s a process, figuring oneself out, but try to be your own best friend through the process. \n\nHow you treat yourself is the foundation for how you treat your friends, family, and eventually your kids, too. You should treat yourself with admiration and compassion \u2014 it\u2019s not easy to make it in the world! I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done a good job of it so far. \n\nKeep going :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3fmex/i_feel_sincerely_inferior_to_others/hfryjry/"}
