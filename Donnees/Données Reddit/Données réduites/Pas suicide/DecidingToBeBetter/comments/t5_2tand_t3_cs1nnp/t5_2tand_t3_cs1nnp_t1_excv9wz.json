My logic behind that is mostly \"How does that influence my life? Is the judgement of any stranger in any way important in my future life?\" The answer is mostly \"No\".\n\nI'm nearly never judgy about random strangers I see on the street, but I know people who love to laugh/judge about others. I hate this because I experienced it in my youth a lot, but even more because I know that others really suffer from it and it's just so pathetic to laugh about random people to push your little ego a bit. The point is, they make bad comments on others and than what? They feel better, they get a laugh from their friend, or whatever, but in 99,9999% the person they laugh about is in no way depend on their judgement whatsoever. There will always be people laughing about you, no matter how what. Be a standard dude and everyone on the alternative side could laugh. Be a goth and everyone laughs. Be a Christian and the atheists laugh... you know what I mean?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cs1nnp/how_to_be_comfortable_in_your_own_skin_and_stop/excv9wz/"}
