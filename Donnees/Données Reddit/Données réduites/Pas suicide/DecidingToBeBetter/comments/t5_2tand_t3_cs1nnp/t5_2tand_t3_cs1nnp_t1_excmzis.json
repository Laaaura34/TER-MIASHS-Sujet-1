Just rock it and it'll be water off a duck's back.\n\nAnd side note, keep in mind a lot of people are probably looking at you in a positive way:  cuz your tall and some degree of handsome, because you possess traits they want, or because they're old and remember when they were young and looked good.  Beautiful women get looked at more than anyone but they know why.\n\nLastly, confidence smoothes over a lot of blunders, and most people genuinely respect it (again, assuming you're not an asshole).  And that may sound like an impossible suggestion, but that is something you truly can fake until you make.  The positive responses you get from people will instill actual confidence gained from experience.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cs1nnp/how_to_be_comfortable_in_your_own_skin_and_stop/excmzis/"}
