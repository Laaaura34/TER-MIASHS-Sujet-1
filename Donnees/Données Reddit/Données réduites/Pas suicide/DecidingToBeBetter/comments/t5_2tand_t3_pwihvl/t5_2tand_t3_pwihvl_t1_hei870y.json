I know there's more to being introverted or extraverted than how shy or outgoing you are and there are different levels of both. However, I do see many people use that kind of language, so I figured it would make a good example even though the terminology isn't correct.\n\nA full 180 from one to the other isn't going to happen, but I've found myself to shift quite a bit more towards the middle after I stopped referring to myself as an introvert. For me at least, it was an excuse to not face my fear or intimidation of social situations. I've become way more outgoing since that time and enjoy it, which is what a lot of people want as well.\n\nThanks for sharing your insights and I'll check out the article you sent as well.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwihvl/if_youre_deciding_to_be_better_start_with_this/hei870y/"}
