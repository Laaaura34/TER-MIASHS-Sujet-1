The thing you describe as refusing to believe compliments or contradictions is called cognitive dissonance. It goes for everything. A flat-earthener could read 10 articles proving that the Earth is round and dismiss them as propaganda. And then read 1 that says it's flat and they're like \"See, I knew it!\".\n\nYour unconscious doesn't like its beliefs to be contradicted. And so it defaults to automatically acknowledging what you think is true and refusing things you don't. It's your job to correct this and challenge those, which is not the easiest thing to do. When you notice you dismiss a compliment, stop and tell yourself that it is true and that you deserve to get it.\n\nIt's not gonna change overnight, but you'll get better in time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwihvl/if_youre_deciding_to_be_better_start_with_this/hekpkl4/"}
