I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with enjoying my alone time. I get less enjoyment from crowds and parties than one on one time with a close friend, crafts and solo bike rides, etc. \nI agree with everything else, but just wanted to say,  there\u2019s nothing wrong with introversion vs. extroversion.  They are both fine. Do what you enjoy, wether it\u2019s meeting new people at a concert or reading a book alone at home. I\u2019m not shy or awkward with people, I just enjoy my alone time or one on one better. \ud83d\ude0a I really vibe with the rest, nice post. Words do matter. Self talk is important.\nEdited for clarity and run on sentences.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwihvl/if_youre_deciding_to_be_better_start_with_this/hejxzga/"}
