(NOTE: I\u2019m using the universal \u201cyou\u201d not you specifically @MooneEater). If someone hasn\u2019t developed social skills and is shy or socially anxious/awkward, I don\u2019t think that changes what they are, but does make it more difficult for them to determine who they are. But isn\u2019t life a journey for all of us to find out who we are? \ud83d\ude0a \n\nBasically, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with changing how you describe yourself because I don\u2019t believe that it means that you\u2019ve actually changed from being an extrovert or introvert to the other. It was just hidden. That\u2019s just my opinion though. Not based on any research.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwihvl/if_youre_deciding_to_be_better_start_with_this/hej4lxq/"}
