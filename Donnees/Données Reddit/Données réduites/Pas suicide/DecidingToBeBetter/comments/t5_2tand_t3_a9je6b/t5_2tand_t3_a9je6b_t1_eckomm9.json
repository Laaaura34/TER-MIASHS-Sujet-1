I also get those comments a lot, add to that being \"the one who look serious all the time\". As for smiling, It only felt awkward and benumbing for the first few hours, after that it will get much more comfortable. Learning to smile has actually been one of the easiest goals I forced myself into completing. And you can feel and see the difference so fast that it is almost instantly gratifying. My next challenge would be to apply it when school resumes, where I will not be surrounded by strangers anymore. Good luck to you and me both! We can do this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a9je6b/its_been_one_week_since_i_decided_to_smile/eckomm9/"}
