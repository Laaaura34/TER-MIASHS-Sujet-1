I was diagnosed at age 8 as obese, due to no fault of my own. I was immediately kept on diets my whole life. I continued to gain weight until I got to 350lbs. I had gastric sleeve surgery 8 years ago. Since then I haven't consumed more than 1000 calories a day. And 2 years ago I started having severe GI issues, causing my intake to drop to 0-400 calories. This caused me to gain 60lbs. Yes, gain. I have hypothyroidism. And a tumor on my thyroid. Yes, my sleeve is still in perfect condition. I've been on a liquid diet for 2 years. There's no emotional help needed. Just medical treatment.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwecwq/why_i_was_fat_how_i_dealt_with_my_unprocessed/heiu7yy/"}
