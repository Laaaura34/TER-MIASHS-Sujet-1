If I can be open and vulnerable with myself and others, then I can connect and help them with their vulnerability.\n\nThanks for reminding me why doing stuff like this is important. I'm really glad that you have gotten out of the cycle and seem to be in a better place.\n\nCreating community and connections such as this is so important. I love the saying that \"the high tide raises all boats\". Together we can all lift each other up.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwecwq/why_i_was_fat_how_i_dealt_with_my_unprocessed/heiabbq/"}
