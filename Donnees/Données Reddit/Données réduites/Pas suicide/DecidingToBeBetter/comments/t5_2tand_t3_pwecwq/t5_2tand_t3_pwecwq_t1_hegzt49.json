I remember that I was carrying shame that exploded in me whenever I have recalled some silly event where I drunkenly made a fool of myself in front of few people. It took me years after the event to feel confident and face the memory (without any toxic feelings) and to be able to tell about it. I can't recognize what made me feel at ease with this memory though.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwecwq/why_i_was_fat_how_i_dealt_with_my_unprocessed/hegzt49/"}
