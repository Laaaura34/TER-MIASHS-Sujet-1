Time will pass whether you use it well or use if poorly so you might as well use it well. Also the return on investment from healing is quantum. the 8 years that it has been from my lowest until now has happened regardless and knowing what I do now and feeling what I do now, 8 years is a bargain and I have so many years left now to enjoy life (hopefully haha).\n\nIn my experience and understanding there will be a reason that you are experiencing anxiety or depression. Yes, there are some prenatal and biological/neurological factors that can cause some people to be more predisposed to experiencing negative mental health but this doesn't contribute more than your experiences.\n\nIf you just pull out the weed then the work is easier but it will grow back.
