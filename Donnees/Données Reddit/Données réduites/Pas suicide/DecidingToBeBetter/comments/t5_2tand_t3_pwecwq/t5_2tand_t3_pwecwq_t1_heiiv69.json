Identical story, except i went up to 118kg \ud83d\ude04 I'm a 33yo 5'9 woman and it was not pretty. Luckily it's almost all gone. I try to meditate regularly as well but i have been steadily losing since the pandemic made me get brave and try LSD lol. My emotional issues with food are still around but it's like i physically can't eat nearly as much of it, been over a year and a half. Also quit smoking, went celibate and moved to Europe but that's neither here nor there.\n\nThe addiction cycle is so real. I would stuff my face with like the worst shit on earth (a few Mcd burgers, for example) and then AS SOON AS I'M DONE feel like the lowest, most pathetic, weakest, lamest person on earth. Which would only make me eat more tomorrow, lol.\n\nLearning to be much, much gentler and more realistic with myself as well as getting to know my trauma have helped me immensely as well.\n\nCongratulations!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwecwq/why_i_was_fat_how_i_dealt_with_my_unprocessed/heiiv69/"}
