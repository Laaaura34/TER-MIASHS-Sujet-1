I\u2019m studying CS and my classes are hard as fuck, so after a huge study session I play the piano to procrastinate doing anything more. It\u2019s just a completely different mode of being to go from coding or doing proofs for hours to playing the piano, so it\u2019s incredibly rejuvenating. In a way I made playing the piano kind of like any other unhealthy habit, something I do to escape. If I ever found myself relaxing on social media, I would just be like, why not play the piano? It\u2019s a bit perverse, but it worked really well for me. This half of it is about discipline\u2014you need to put in the work. This is a good trick for that, imo.\n\nThe other thing is just to get there when you get there. I still have to work on bringing Arabesque fully up to performance level for probably a few more months, just getting everything as close to perfect as I can. That\u2019s fine, because once I have it, I intend to keep it for the rest of my life. That is a gift only you can give yourself. Once given, it is a joy you can always return to, so long as you have a piano to play. That was motivation enough for me, which is what you were originally asking about. But staying disciplined is just as important.\n\nEdit: I will add, don\u2019t ever put yourself down if you\u2019re struggling with some part of a song or an exercise. That struggle is not a weakness in you, but a strength for taking on the challenge. Relishing things like that can help you push through.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/krxu7s/i_started_learning_to_play_the_piano_earlier_this/gidxgy8/"}
