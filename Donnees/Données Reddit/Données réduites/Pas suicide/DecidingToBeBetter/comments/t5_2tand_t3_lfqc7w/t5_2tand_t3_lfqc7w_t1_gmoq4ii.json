I think about it everyday and it feels like I won\u2019t do it until the situation gets to a breaking point. My wife knows I\u2019m unhappy and constantly tells me to apply to new jobs but it\u2019s still an unknown if I\u2019ll even be happy at a new spot. I\u2019m glad your dad was able to make the change tho. It sounds like a weight lifted from his chest. And you\u2019re right, we spend so much time working that people should be able to find even a sliver of happiness while at it. Thanks for sharing!
