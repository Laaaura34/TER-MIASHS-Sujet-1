Our disconnect was so weird but he cheated on me so we called it. I found it really hard to get over him and I don't think it was because we were deep in love or anything but we were super best friends and just got along so well. I talk to him very rarely now (been apart for little over 2 years) but still think about alot of his good qualities and find it hard to not compare other prospects to his good parts. I was lucky enough to find a guy who was patient with me as I was open with telling him I wasn't ready to move on but I also didn't want to lose out on a good opportunity to build a relationship with him(new guy) and I would take it really slow. It became much easier over time and we are still together now. He's amazing and I wish I could have been there me earlier on. Sometimes you guys go out of your comfort zone and know when to move on romantically because the last relationship wasn't good for a reason (cheating or what have you). It must be really difficult adding a kid to the mix but know you deserve happiness too and you should get a shot. Show the ex what he missed out on by living your best life and (trying) not to live in the past. Good luck! \u2764", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mwmf72/can_i_hear_from_ladies_who_found_it_rely/gvjd8ro/"}
