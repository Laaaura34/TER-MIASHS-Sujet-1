You cutting people out is not the solution but the cause of your strife. Human beings are part of a community, we all depend on one another. Your pride says dependence is wrong when in fact  it is the most human you can get.\n\nWe all need each other.  Even now you look to strangers for help because deep down you don't want be alone.  Its scary.  and thats okay. \n\nWhen people feel this way,  they do it out of fear.  They don't want to expose the ugliness inside of them to others  so they cut people off. This only makes that fear grow. When you connect to that inner being within you, and accept it truly. You will find yourself a more open and loving person. That I guarantee.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdq6ug/can_anyone_please_help_me_make_sense_of_this/hhphz8g/"}
