I kinda wish I spent my 20s going to night clubs every week. I think you're right that I should take a break. I have regretted spending all my time working and studying but at the same time I never stop or slow down. It's hard to feel comfortable taking a break because I feel like I am being lazy and losing all my progress. I am going to take a day or two to myself after I graduate and just try to remember that a couple days won't mean anything in the long term. I appreciate your response a lot, thank you again.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/owkdca/fumbling_in_the_end_zone/h7l6sm5/"}
