Guys, this is deep shit. We are \u201ctrained\u201d to shut our feelings up and being honest and vulnerable are precious skills.\n\nDon\u2019t be rude to yourself. By now, write it, save it, whatever... but no meed to treat yourself less than kindness.\n\nIncompatibility is a real deal and it\u2019s sucks. It can appear by cultural, belief, social status... some girls will love us, some girls will not even look or respect us. Don\u2019t take it too personal.\n\nDo not compare yourself and your relationship with anyone else. We try to bring other\u2019s money and lifestyle to the table. Just. Don\u2019t.\n\nIknow it\u2019s already said: focus on your life. Go to the gym, improve your hobbies and develop skills. Study hard in some area you like. If it can bring you some money, that\u2019s cool! But don\u2019t forget to do and improve your likes. And take care of your health. Please.\n\nThere\u2019s A LOT of girls and it\u2019s a big, big world with internet here to give us a little hand. Have in mind that people have different choices and likes: you can\u2019t be Superman to a girl without being a pitiful shame to another girl, right? Girls in surf/reggae festival probably/usually won\u2019t fall in love for the most popular Death Metal Headbanger in your underground scene... ok, you got it.\n\nAnd the last one: everything changes with the time. Good times, bad times. Everything changes.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o9w0xl/12_dating_principles_for_young_men/h3erduz/"}
