I'm glad I could help a bit.  \nIt's such a shame we humans tend to be so stressed about our humanness and covering it up so others don't discover our 'deficits'. I really hope we can make a difference in this generation to not only show to othrs with compassion that we're not that much different. But moreover that we can freely discover and experience in honesty what works for our body and mind and what doesn't. Without the shame and guilt that sets people apart.  \nI really hope you can make a good start with that. And you seem to have already done so by putting an effeort in cleaing for your friend.   \nI made real progress with the job hunt. But to be real with you: if I hadn't asked a friend whether I could send her a message when I finished this task, I would have let all the reasons to not do it convince me to postpone (too tired, did enough for the day, my head is clearer another time, etc.). Social pressure can be a good instrument to use.  \n\n\nBtw, any of those reasons can be legit. Most of the time that nagging voice in your head does know wheter it's really better to postpone or whether it's avoidance. I'm not advocating pressuring yourself into being a robot that ticks of all the boxes on a to do list. I know some people pursue such a lifestyle, but speaking for myself, I think that misses the point of life. Do your tasks so your life feels more fulfilling. Do not substitute life for a list of tasks.  \n\n\nAnd being your favorite person right now, sounds really delightful. :D  \nI hope you have a great couple of days with your friend.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q35ayu/i_suck_at_being_an_adult_please_help/hgjtk02/"}
