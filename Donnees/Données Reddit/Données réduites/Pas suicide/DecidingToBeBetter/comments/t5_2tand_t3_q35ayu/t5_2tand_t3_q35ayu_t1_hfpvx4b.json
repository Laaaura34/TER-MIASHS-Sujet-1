They get distracted too easily and so everything feels like a mountain. His course essentially teaches you how to focus in order to make the things you want in life become material.\n\nHe's a former Hindu monk but his teachings have nothing to do with religion/God/Hinduism.\n\nWatch a few of his talks online and see if you like him then sign up for the course.\n\nHere's his TED Talk ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O2JK_94g3Y)) 18 mins.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q35ayu/i_suck_at_being_an_adult_please_help/hfpvx4b/"}
