Just don't put too much on it.  I have a daily planner; on the left-hand side of the space for each day, I put \"timed\" things, such as 10:30 Haircut.  On the right hand side, I list my things-to-get-done that day, such as laundry, floors, banking, pick up prescription, and so on.  I check off each to-do item as I finish it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q35ayu/i_suck_at_being_an_adult_please_help/hfqfg8k/"}
