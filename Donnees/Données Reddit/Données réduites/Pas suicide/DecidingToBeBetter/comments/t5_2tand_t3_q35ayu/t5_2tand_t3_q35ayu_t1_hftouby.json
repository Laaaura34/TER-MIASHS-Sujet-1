He is the author of Think Like a Monk and has a podcast. He has an episode ( on 9/17) where he talks about\u201d  9 ways to get comfortable doing Uncomfortable things. \u201c it\u2019s really good and is almost the same thing mentioned. \nI also agree with other users to write down/journal what you feel outside of therapy. I know it\u2019s hard to open up to others,  but hopefully once rapport is built you can express more. \n\nAnother thing , regarding the \u201cdaily stuff\u201d , have you heard of a Brain Dump? Make a list of all the things you have/ want to do, and categorize three of those chores/ activities in the following : Very Important, Important, and Quickly Completed.  So each will have three out of your list, you can make different categories as well such as : Personal, Work Related, school, etc. But just don\u2019t make too many categories. And just focus on those for the day/ next two days/ or week.  Nothing past a week though.\n\nPs, what is your definition of someone having their life together, because I can assure you- no one really does and we\u2019ve all kind of have a different definition of it-which may have to do with overall satisfaction with life, but that\u2019s more of an attitude towards life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q35ayu/i_suck_at_being_an_adult_please_help/hftouby/"}
