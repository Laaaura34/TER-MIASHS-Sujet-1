One thing that prompted me to write this was actually walking around a local grocery store the other day. Most of the people shopping were, to put it nicely, not people making the best decisions with their health and wellbeing. Even being around these strangers who lacked any sort of self-motivation was sort of affecting me on a low level. Recalling walking around cities/towns in states like Colorado, California and even parts of Texas (Austin), I felt more surrounded by people of the same mindset as myself. You could hear them talking about important subjects, not just gossip. Some even were coming in their workout clothes after a run/bike, you never see that here. Working in the tech industry, I'd also like to attend more tech meetups. We have one here that meets once a month. Its a good start for my town but I'd like to be apart of more of these things. \n\nIm also just looking for excuses to move more north, my dream situation is being able to go on hikes on the weekends with my dog and take landscape photos. At the same time, I want a realistic justification to move more north in an area like this (Denver, Portland maybe). \n\nExcuse my rambling, its sometimes helps that I just type stuff out to make sense of everything. Rather than deleting I'll leave it all here hah.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bmneji/my_city_is_complacent_and_i_think_its_stifling_my/en0it12/"}
