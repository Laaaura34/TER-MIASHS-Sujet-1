While she definitely sounds like a messed up person and you shouldn\u2019t be friends with her, I think \u201cgroomer\u201d doesn\u2019t fit here. 3 years is not \u201cmuch older\u201d (I was 12 in 7th grade and we had 14-year-olds in the same grade). You made some bad decisions but expect her to have guided you in a different direction because she was 3 years older than you and should know better...? Again, bad influence but not a \u201cgroomer.\u201d Good job for not being friends anymore, but none of this fits \u201cgrooming.\u201d", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kz1k07/at_age_17_and_after_6_years_of_abuse_i_cut_off_my/gjlhp2y/"}
