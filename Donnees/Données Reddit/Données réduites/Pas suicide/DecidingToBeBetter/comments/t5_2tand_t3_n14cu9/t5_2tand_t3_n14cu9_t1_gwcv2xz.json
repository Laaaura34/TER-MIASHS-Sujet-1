It doesn't even need to be twice a day. My average 10-16k steps generally looks like this:\n\n\\- Morning walk into work: 25 mins (3.5k)\n\n\\- Walk at lunch time: 50 mins (6k)\n\n\\- Incorporating 10 minute walks through the day as part of my work tasks (i.e. running a pack of documents over to another office rather than internal posting): 2k\n\n\\- Walk home: 25 mins (3.5k)\n\nMy lunch walk is my only set exercise time, the rest of it just feels incidental. It's really easy to start to increase your step count if you think through your week schedule and how you can take small efforts to get a bit more walking in. Honestly, you won't feel the difference - but you'll see it!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n14cu9/why_you_should_aim_to_walk_10k_steps_a_day_and/gwcv2xz/"}
