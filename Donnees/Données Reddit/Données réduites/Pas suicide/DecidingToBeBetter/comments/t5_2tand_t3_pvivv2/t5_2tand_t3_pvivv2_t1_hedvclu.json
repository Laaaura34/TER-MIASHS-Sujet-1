A ton of work then a ton of partying which I assume means lots of alcohol will catch up to anyone.\n\n1. Stop drinking alcohol/smoking weed for a bit.  A week or two minimum, really.  You are in Miami, there is plenty of stuff to in that area that doesn't involve drinking.\n2. Start exercising a bit to get help shed some of that anxiety energy and to clear your head.\n3. Consider seeking professional help if things get real bad.\n4. Consider trying some sort of meditation, even if it's just 10 minutes a day.  When really hyped up the before and after difference can be quite astounding.  \n5. Spend some time doing stuff out in nature.  It's probably still hot AF in south FL(I'm a FL native).  Chilling at the beach, renting a surf board or if the waves are tiny then a stand up paddle board.  Head over to the Everglades and rent a canoe or kayak.  Maybe an airboat tour.  Basically anything outside and in nature.  Our brains seem more wired to be more 'in the moment' when in nature.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvivv2/i_feel_like_i_cant_calm_my_mind_down/hedvclu/"}
