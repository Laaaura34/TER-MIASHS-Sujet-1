I don't have my notifications set to my phone and I don't post often but I'm *constantly* on FB and Instagram. I flip back and forth, scroll, go to the other in an almost endless loop. It's highly unproductive and for what I know is no real benefit. I guess it's FOMO but even that doesn't make sense because it's not like the posts aren't going to be there in a few hours. \n\nI don't want to delete the apps because Instagram is wonderful for me to track the occasional picture. I like photography and Insta allows me to share what I do have. Facebook is the go-to place for events so I want it just for that.\n\nBut I definitely need to limit the use of the platforms. Just way too much time lost on essentially nothing good. The same can be said about video games, both mobile and console, where I spend way too much time gaining achievements that I can't take to the bank or pay bills with.
