In the same vein of not buying junk food so you don't have the option of eating it, I also don't have reddit or instagram on my phone - so I won't use it on my phone. I check reddit during breaks or slow times at work or in the evenings on my laptop. And then for FB (being to valuable a blackbook to just delete), I use Folio on my phone, don't have the messenger, and unfollow people I'm friends with but don't really care to see in my feed. Also unfollowed and unsubscribed to a lot of pages I had \"liked\" before. Maybe that helps? Craft your FB feed how you want it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/71spvo/i_quit_snapchat_two_years_ago_earlier_this_week_i/dnhck33/"}
