Pick a topic and it will have a plethora of resources to dive into after. \n\nAlso, the free app 'Libby' lets you link your local library card to an app on your phone (or website on your tablet/computer). You can link multiple cards (share libraries with friends). \n\nMy suggestions: \n\nMarcus Aurelius - Meditations\n\nH.G Wells - The Time Traveler\n\nJostein Gaarder-  Sophie's World \n\nIF you're an American (USA) or are interested in the USA: Howard Zinn - A People's History of The United States (really drags on but informative) \n\nAnne Frank - The Diary of a Young Girl\n\nCharles Darwin - The Origin of Species (a real slog but worth it) \n\nStephen Hawking - A Brief History of Time (this will make you look into many other books to understand it, but each a valuable building block)\n\nRobert M. Pirsig - Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (a great and entertaining read that references many books and authors, most worth reading)\n\nShakespeare - Hamlet\n\nWalden - Henry David Thoreau \n\nYuval Noah Harari - Sapiens (speculative at times but give great perspective)\n\nHomer - The Odyssey\n\nLao Tzu - Tao Te Ching\n\nPaulo Coelho - The Alchemist (might not make you more well rounded but this a personal favorite that I think everyone should read).\n\nFredrik Backman - A Man Called Ove (same as previous)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ppei57/list_of_books_to_become_a_well_rounded_self/hd501al/"}
