Also you could get maybe like an abridged version of Greek mythology and ancient history.\n\nThe reason why I say this is bc this stuff is referenced and alluded to so often in other works of art that when you come across it you\u2019ll understand the references. I took an ancient history class in high school and afterwards was amazed how much that stuff came up. Not to mention a lot of the classics are on high school reading lists so mostly they are easy to comprehend and are often really good. I personally think this is a good place to start.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ppei57/list_of_books_to_become_a_well_rounded_self/hd7ee5f/"}
