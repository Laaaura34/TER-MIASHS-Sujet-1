I literally just Google \"Reading list X Subject Y University\" then have a look at the top bunch of links for a couple of different universities. If I don't get good answers I'll switch to \"suggested reading\" instead of reading list, try a different university, try looking for students' reading lists instead of actual university websites, or look at Open University or adult A-level courses in that subject. Checking what the university actually calls the degree first can save some time (some will have PPE instead of politics, for example, or just won't do a certain subject).\n\nA couple of go-to pages I keep bookmarked for this would be: [https://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/reading-lists](https://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/reading-lists) and [https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses/suggested-subject-resources](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses/suggested-subject-resources), although the amount of use they are really does vary between subjects.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ppei57/list_of_books_to_become_a_well_rounded_self/hd6j5bc/"}
