I cried everyday for the first month+, just gotta accept that its okay to feel sad, but try and take away 1 thing after you cry. \n\nThe other thing that helped me a lot was wim hofs breathing method, you saturate your body with oxygen and literally get super high from the effect, but you can find some serious meditation from it. Highly highly recommend doing 3 times a week. \n\nLast, flavored toothpicks and a pocket toothpick holder for that oral fixation. Hope some of those ideas can help ya! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k9g9hr/quit_smoking_pot_lost_40_lbs_left_a_6_year_toxic/gf4fhaz/"}
