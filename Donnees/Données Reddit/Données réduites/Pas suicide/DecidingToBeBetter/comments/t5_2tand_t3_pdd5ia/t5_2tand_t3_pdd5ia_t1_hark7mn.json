It takes time. We are unintentionally taught to beat ourselves up and to not feel worthy.\nYou ARE worthy. No matter what you have done. Seriously, NO matter. As long as you are determined to feel better and YOU make the choice to do something, you WILL find your light!\nYou will find it! It's there. \n\nTry some motivational videos, inspirational music, uplifting podcasts, anything that builds you up! Stay away from anything negative, including the news, especially the news! (That's another topic lol)\n\nYou have to find it, sometimes it is hiding in plain site. YOU ARE ENOUGH! Build yourself up, others can assist, but you have to do the real work.\n\nStay encouraged", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdd5ia/how_to_not_be_negative_all_the_time_how_to_not/hark7mn/"}
