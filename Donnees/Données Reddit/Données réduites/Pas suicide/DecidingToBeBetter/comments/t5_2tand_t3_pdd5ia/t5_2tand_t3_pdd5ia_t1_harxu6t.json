I actually had been reverse engineering this for awhile which worked for me in my own twisted way where I created an alter ego for myself and this alter ego is a person I admired to be. Strong, confident, speaks her mind. Every time I would feel worried or anxious, this voice that belongs to the alter ego would speak back to me and because I idolise her so much I would do exactly what she said and felt better. This has been working for me and I hope one day in my mind I realise that person is exactly me. That I do not need to idolise anyone but do what my heart says and own up to it. One day I hope", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdd5ia/how_to_not_be_negative_all_the_time_how_to_not/harxu6t/"}
