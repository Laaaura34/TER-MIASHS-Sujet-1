Exercise for the happy chemicals. And everytime you think negative thoughts catch yourself and try to change it. Even if you don't believe it at first and feel silly. If you are thinking about how much something sucks for example start saying out loud things that are good. If you can't come up with something good for you just start with something good in general. \nI definitely recommend watching what you read, listen to, and watch. Comedies, upbeat tunes, and happy endings only. It really does make a huge difference.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdd5ia/how_to_not_be_negative_all_the_time_how_to_not/haptw6r/"}
