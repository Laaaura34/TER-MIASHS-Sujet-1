I'm so glad you are taking charge of your life and are moving toward making a positive change for the future. Being in a situation where you have hit rock bottom can make you feel helpless, but if you bounce back up, you can make a difference in yourself and others.\n\nFrom experience, I know the road won't be easy, but keep putting one foot in front of the other. Keep fighting for what you want in life. Never give up on yourself. Stay resilient!\n\nI'm rooting hard for you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdine1/i_feel_so_much_better/hhmr5pv/"}
