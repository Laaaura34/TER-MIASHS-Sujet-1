Know that you have made the best choice for you; stick to it. \n\nFalling off the wagon isn't good for health or forward progress. \n\nI was at 6 months sober, but that was 10 years ago.   Feels like the last decade has been letting anxieties grow by not facing them and smoking* my troubles away.  Life was reduced to sleep, smoke, work, smoke, eat and repeat. \n\n*this only postpones dealing with the issue and add more anxiety about not having done anything and the guilt/shame/smoke cycle ensues\n\nGreat work & Discipline; kudos to all of you who have broken free of abusing your mind and time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mu1tq7/10_months_sober/gv4xvdz/"}
