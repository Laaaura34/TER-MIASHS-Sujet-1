You won't do yourself (or anyone else) any favours by doing so. You are not a bad person. Repeat: You are NOT a bad person. Admitting you act this way is a huge step so thumbs up for that. You know it stems from how you feel about yourself. Might sound clich\u00e9 but we all have crap and admitting your faults isn't easy! There are so many people that haven't come close to reaching self awareness is this regard.\n\nHave you ever talked to anyone regarding this? Not one to automatically jump on the therapy bandwagon but given the right therapist (for you) CBT can be a great tool in understanding our behaviors and how to make healthy changes.\n\nI have been guilty of being a negative Nancy. One thing I remind myself is that no matter how I feel there is really no good reason for it. It doesn't make a situation any better. My personal tip for you is next time someone annoys you and you feel the drive to put them down in a salty way think of something positive instead. It could be about them or if you don't know them well enough something else. Do the same for yourself. Try to replace these needless negative thoughts with positive ones. I'm not saying be all happy go lucky and burr your head in the sand regarding everything but I really think when you are overcome with negatively it becomes almost impossible to deal with the deeper issues causing it. It's hard and takes effort but little by little you can get there.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cmvpr1/how_can_i_less_hypercritical_and_negative/ew5jlf6/"}
