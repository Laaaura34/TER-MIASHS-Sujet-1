I had my first child very young. I knew nothing about the importance of focusing our energy, the benefits of meditation, or how our mental/emotional states can harshly affect the body. \n\nI suffered screaming, crying, and thrashing around in pain for 9 long hours before my daughter was born. Had I birthed her in front of those who never experienced or understood the pain of childbirth, I would have looked just as crazy or possessed as you felt or seemed to those standing outside of your experience watching you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/phdjvk/well_today_i_finally_did_it_i_finally_let_go_of/hdtt65w/"}
