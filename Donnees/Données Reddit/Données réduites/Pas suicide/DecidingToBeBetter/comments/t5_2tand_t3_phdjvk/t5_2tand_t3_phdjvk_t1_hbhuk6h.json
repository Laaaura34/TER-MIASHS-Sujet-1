I wish things could've ended better for us but I can't force someone to heal. I still feel the guilt and pain of loss, the sanity I quickly abandoned and regained. It truly was something divine and unexplainable but alas, not everyone can believe in the truth nor would they want to. I don't blame them nor do I think I am some sort of air head with a fat ego. I just wish I was given the same compassion, patience and understanding I tried so hard to give in the end but failed to properly seal. I genuinely did fuck up but it's a hard lesson I unfortunately have to live with now. All I wanted was forgiveness and understanding of the pain I was in but I came across as a narcistic psychopath. I never intended to hurt anyone nor abandon them, all I wanted was more patience and understanding. A trust I sadly lost, a pain I sadly caused and endured yet here I am once again- sad, alone but free from the trauma I endured. I still wish they would reach out to me but I can't make them", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/phdjvk/well_today_i_finally_did_it_i_finally_let_go_of/hbhuk6h/"}
