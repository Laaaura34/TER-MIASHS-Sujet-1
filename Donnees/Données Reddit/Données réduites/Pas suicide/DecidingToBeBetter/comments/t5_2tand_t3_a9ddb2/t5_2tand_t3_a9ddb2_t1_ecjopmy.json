You can definitely do it but if you do some drugs even after you\u2019ve decided not to anymore, don\u2019t beat yourself up about it. Deciding to be better doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re expected to immediately become a little angel. Nobody else would expect it if you, so don\u2019t put that pressure on yourself. \n\nOne day at a time. Being able to say no even *once* is a fucking triumph. \n\nGood luck.
