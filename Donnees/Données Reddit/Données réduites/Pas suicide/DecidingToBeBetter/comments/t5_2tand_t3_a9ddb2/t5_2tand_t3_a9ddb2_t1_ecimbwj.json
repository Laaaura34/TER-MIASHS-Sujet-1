I've been in a similar situation with heroin, it's not the same I suppose, smoking heroin sneaks up to on you, you're hooked before you know it, not instantly. I was lucky to notice before I got in too deep, was smoking several times a week for half a year, kind of like you described in your case. \n\nThe best call of my life was to get out of that setting. Lost some friends, who were in se very good people, with a good heart and not meaning evil. Most didn't make it out and me being with them wouldn't have helped either them or me.\n\nKeep on as you are, this is a good call, a great decision and although it may take some effort and pains, please keep at it. Future you will be grateful and it is very doable I think, although meth isn't in my experience. The challenge to me wasn't to not do meth or heroin, it's to stay away from it and people having it.\n\nFeel free to pm, it you need a kind word or a kick.
