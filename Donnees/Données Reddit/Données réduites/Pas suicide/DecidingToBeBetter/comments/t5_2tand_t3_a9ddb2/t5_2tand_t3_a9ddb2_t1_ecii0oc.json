I am sort of in the same boat. Was clean for 2 years and 3months. Tried to replace the meth with gambling and an odd drop of alcohol in the last 3 months. Not a good idea for someone like me who is all or nothing! \n\nEnded up relapsing. This was 2 weeks ago and still beating myself up over it. I guess I just have to reset the clock. \n\n11 days clean and counting. Giving it all up! Meth, gambling and alcohol. \n\nI wish you all the luck in the world mate. Stay strong.
