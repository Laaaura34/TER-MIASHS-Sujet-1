When I quit 3 out of 4 of my other buddies quit as well. The fourth has been in and out of jail, had a child born with deformities from the mother shooting dope while pregnant, lost custody of said child, basically is responsible for the death of another friend of ours who he dragged down with dope and lost most of his friends. The rest of us are married with kids and good jobs. Just wanted you to see the possible differences in outcomes between quitting and continuing to tweak your balls off staying up for days on end. Also just an FYI but meth can really change your body/mind after prolonged use. It really fucks with your brain chemistry. For example I\u2019m now hyper reactive to caffeine and more than a cup of coffee makes me almost physically ill. Hope this helps!
