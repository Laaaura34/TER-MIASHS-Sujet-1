No, no. I wish you the strength and will power to focus on being happy and your over all well being, brother. \n\nI don\u2019t know your situation intimately; however, I can understand the struggle of turning to a vice when things get hairy. It a simply form of instant satisfaction. \n\nEven if it\u2019s not drugs, it could be something like food, alcohol, porn, ect. \n\nBe proud of how far you\u2019ve come and don\u2019t ever EVER compare yourself to the success of others. Just know that every decision you make can improve where you were yesterday.  Be better. Much love, bro\n\nMerry Christmas \ud83c\udf84", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a9ddb2/day_1_of_quitting_meth_wish_me_luck/eciuw2l/"}
