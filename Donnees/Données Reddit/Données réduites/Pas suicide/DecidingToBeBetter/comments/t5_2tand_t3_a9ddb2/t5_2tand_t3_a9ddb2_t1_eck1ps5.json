I need to quit as well but when I tell myself I will, I just fall asleep wherever for days at a time. I have a decent job and my family depends on me to not lose my job. I sleep almost every night and go to work everyday. But I\u2019ve noticed in the last few months that things I used to enjoy just don\u2019t seem fun and instead of spending time with the family I hide away in the garage working on one of my many unfinished projects. Keep it up Dave! \nI wish you the best!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a9ddb2/day_1_of_quitting_meth_wish_me_luck/eck1ps5/"}
