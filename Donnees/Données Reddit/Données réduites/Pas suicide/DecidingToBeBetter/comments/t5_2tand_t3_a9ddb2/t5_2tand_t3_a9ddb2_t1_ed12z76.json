I know it can be a hard one. Ive witnessed the struggle. \n\nMake sure you keep reminding yourself of why you want to quit.\n\nThink how much nicer it will be not to waste days in bed coming down.\nThat you'll start getting back appetite and energy. This will lead to feeling able to get out for exercise and sunlight.\nYou'll probably start to feel motivated to pick up projects you left unfinished.\nYou'll be less tense and anxious.\n\nIt can mean some pretty hard steps, probably the hardest being not going and hanging out with your friends when they are getting high. I certainly don't think you need to ditch them, but make sure the times and places you catch up at don't have associations with using and aren't likely to lead to caving in to old habits.  This usually will mean only catching up during the week, somewhere neutral like getting a meal or seeing a movie.. And nothing around Friday night or the weekends..at least until you are a few months in.\n\n\nSpending some time fleshing out why you want to change the world, and imagining as vividly as possible what making real progress towards that goal will feel like, will likely help a lot.  The better you understand why this goal is important to you the easier it will be to fight temptation because you'll have to acknowledge that while you will have some short term pleasure it will come explicitly at the cost of progress towards your goal and the deeper pleasure which that progress will give you.\n\nGood luck ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a9ddb2/day_1_of_quitting_meth_wish_me_luck/ed12z76/"}
