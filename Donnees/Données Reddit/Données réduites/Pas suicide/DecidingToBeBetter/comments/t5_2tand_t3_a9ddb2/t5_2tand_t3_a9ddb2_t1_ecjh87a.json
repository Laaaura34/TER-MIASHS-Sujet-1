Hope you don\u2019t mind me dropping a few suggestions you can take or leave! like u/freecooching said above and a few others throughout this thread as well, take a good look at your support system and stack the deck in your favor! Unfortunately this sometimes means stepping away from people still actively using but maybe think of how you can fill in those new social gaps..some suggestions: \n\n- AA or NA (AA because they tend to be more readily available, depending on your location NA/CA can be harder to find. All groups develop their own culture but many are open to people who use substances other than alcohol)\n- there are also a number of non-denominational 12-step support groups like Celebrate Recovery and SMART recovery (there\u2019s more out there! These were the first two that came to mind for me)\n- don\u2019t be afraid to look into getting a therapist! Psychologytoday.com is an easy way to find someone in your insurance network, zip code, and with a verified license. No insurance? Still go to psych today, look for ppl who offer sliding scale fees who may be able to work with you in a manageable out of pocket payment.\n- they may also recommend a psychiatrist evaluation for a number of reasons...there\u2019s some relapse prevention meds available, not specifically for meth but should you find yourself trying to abstain and struggling in other ways like with alcohol which could threaten your overall sobriety. But also there\u2019s a very high rate of mental health issues that go hand in hand with substance use, that probably both drive some people to use but also can develop through the recovery process. \n- last thing I\u2019ll say, if you\u2019re a reader or audiobook fan, Allen Carr and Annie Grace are two authors who have books on dealing with addiction (written towards alcohol and smoking but I\u2019ve had people say they\u2019ve found them helpful for other addictions as well). Both get really strong reviews and offer practical skills and approaches. Carr\u2019s books are \u201ca Easy Way To Control Alcohol/Smoking\u201d and Grace\u2019s is \u201cThis Naked Mind.\u201d\n\nAlright, this got way longer than I anticipated, I guess I\u2019ve had a few too many days off work already for the holiday. \u263a\ufe0f Best of luck to you!!
