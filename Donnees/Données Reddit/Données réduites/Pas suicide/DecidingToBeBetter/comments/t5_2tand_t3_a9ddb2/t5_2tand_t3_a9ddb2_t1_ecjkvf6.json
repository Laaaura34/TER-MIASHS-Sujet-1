In some way, you are participating, so you influence all the situations in some way.  Anyone spend the rent money on junk? Helped with that I did. Have a friend loose their kid to dss? I did.  have a friend go too far and pass? I did.  All my fault.  Even the guy I took out, droped him off, wouldn't pick up again, asked keys from his mom, she said no, he blew his face off. Yep my fault too.  These people all made choices and lost. I helped them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a9ddb2/day_1_of_quitting_meth_wish_me_luck/ecjkvf6/"}
