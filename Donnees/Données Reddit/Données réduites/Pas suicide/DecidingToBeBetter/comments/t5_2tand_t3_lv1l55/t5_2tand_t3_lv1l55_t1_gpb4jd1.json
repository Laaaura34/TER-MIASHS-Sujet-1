There\u2019s a clear theme of manipulation and emotional abuse coming from the girl and her family. \n\nDid she get hurt in an accident? Yes. Was it directly his fault? No. He even suggested she ride with him to begin with. The coercion and lying about insurance thing is messed up no doubt, but he didn\u2019t do it. If she was so recklessly endangered maybe she shouldn\u2019t jump on the back of an ATV with a kid driving..\n\nThe worst part about all this, and you seemed to completely miss it, is the craziness that is this girls father. He\u2019s autistic, controls her life, threatens to divorce her mother over actions the girl is making. It\u2019s fucking crazy. The whole family. Not to mention she blames the feelings she gets from the decisions she makes on the BF. Like I said this dude dodged a bullet.
