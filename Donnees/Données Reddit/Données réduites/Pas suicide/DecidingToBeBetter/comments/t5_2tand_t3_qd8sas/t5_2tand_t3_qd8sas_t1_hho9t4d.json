But my father absolutely refused to let that happen. He always said that medicine like that is a shortcut and not going to fix me long term and would actually make things worse long term and possibly get me to have a drug/medication dependency and addiction.\n\nSo we never went through with it and ever since then I\u2019ve been very anti medicine. I try not to any medicine at all unless I feel like it\u2019s absolutely necessary.\n\nFast forward into my early and now mid 20\u2019s (I\u2019m 26 now) and I have definitely experienced lots of depression. I\u2019ve gone through many ruts just like OP and other commentators have mentioned.
