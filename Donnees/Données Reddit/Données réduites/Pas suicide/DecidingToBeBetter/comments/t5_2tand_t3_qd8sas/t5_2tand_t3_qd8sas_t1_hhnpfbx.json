I understand what it's like to be depressed, and that's what it sounds like is happening to you. \n\nI would definitely talk to a doctor about it, but also do some self-reflection and try to find what it is that's forcing you into this place. I know it's *really* challenging working a job that you hate but don't have a choice to not work. \n\nWhen I get into depressive cycles, I do things that I know will give me energy, regardless of how difficult it is to get started. For instance, exercise is one of the *first things* I forgo when I'm stuck in a depressive cycle, but I ALWAYS feel better, happier, and more energized when I'm exercising, and for days afterward.\n\nOften small steps are what you need first. In my case, I start by committing myself to just going for a walk around the neighborhood for a little bit of movement. Then Cooking myself dinner. After that I try to push myself to get to the gym, and the energy and happiness slowly start to build back.\n\nI know this isn't \"One-Size fits all\" and what works for me might not for you, but overall it's breaking the vicious cycle of depression and doing something that you know you like, and gives you energy. \n\nAnd I know it's hard not to succumb to negativity (especially if you're living with your super-active parents and they're judging you), but try to break that inner monologue of labelling yourself a \"lazy pos\". That's not what you are, you just need to give yourself a chance to start building up towards being active.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qd8sas/why_am_i_such_a_lazy_pos_and_how_can_i_change/hhnpfbx/"}
