The hardest time to get motivated is when you have none. People who have many goals throughout the day have tons of motivation because of the feedback loop. To start, figure out what motivates you. Try doing 1 goal per day whether that\u2019s getting out for a walk or applying to jobs or paying off a bill. The easiest and best time to do an errand/goal is first thing of the day. \n\nFor people like me, putting off the things I need to do let\u2019s me sit in anxiety and my brain is comfortable there. Breaking out is hard but possible with little steps. \n\nOther routes are finding people to motivate you. This could be reporting to a job or a therapist or career coach. Bring responsibility into your life and help create structure. \n\nStructure is also crucial. Schedule your day out and stick to it. The saying is, follow your schedule not your mood. It doesn\u2019t suck as much as it sounds haha. \n\nOther alternative is do a todo list of different priorities. Write down what do you need to do in the day and then colorcode it by red yellow green. Red being I need to do today yellow important and green general.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qd8sas/why_am_i_such_a_lazy_pos_and_how_can_i_change/hhnbqb6/"}
