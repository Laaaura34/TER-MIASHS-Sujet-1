I was a 23 year old medically retired Army Military Police Veteran.... Then I was a 30 year old heroin addict.\n\nNow, I'm a 32 year old associates degree holder, seeking a bachelor's and Masters degree in social work. I'm not going to go as far as to say this video saved my life, but it's really put things into perspective for me, and I watch it about every month to remind myself of my goals and to solidify my mind on what I'm doing and focusing on.\n\nIf nothing else, it's pretty funny, and you'll at least enjoy that much. https://youtu.be/arj7oStGLkU", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qd8sas/why_am_i_such_a_lazy_pos_and_how_can_i_change/hhpbzto/"}
