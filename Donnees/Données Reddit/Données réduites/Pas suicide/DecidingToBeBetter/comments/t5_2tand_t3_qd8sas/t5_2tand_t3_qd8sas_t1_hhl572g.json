I was pretty severely depressed and felt very \"stuck\" for a long time. Finding the right medication was a huge step forward and I found it much easier to find motivation to improve my life because my brain actually rewards me and I feel significantly less apathetic. Talking to a professional to find out what medication will work for you will be very helpful. Also sometimes it's trial and error and if one medication doesn't work for you it doesn't mean all medication will not work.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qd8sas/why_am_i_such_a_lazy_pos_and_how_can_i_change/hhl572g/"}
