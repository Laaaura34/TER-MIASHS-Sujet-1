I live with my partner but have worked from home for the past two years.\n\nI could literally feel myself zoning out and losing attachment/responsibility with my job over the past 6-12 months. I\u2019d wake up sometimes and could feel the grip of \u2018you\u2019re not going do anything today\u2019 and although I felt the pressure in my chest/somehow (deep down) understood I was literally fucking this career opportunity up, I flipped some sort of switch and could sit there playing a game or zoning out forever. It was an endless cycle of feeling too low to work/having constant anxiety attacks about doing badly at work. \n\nI never told anyone because it just sounded like laziness, which is still hard to fathom that it isn\u2019t. Like you, I didn\u2019t (and still don\u2019t really) know how to break out of it. When my partner left for work and I was alone, I would sink into such a shit routine. My parents are also super work-orientated as yours are - I don\u2019t know when this happened to me or how to talk about it.\n\nI know how hard it is to actually do this, but getting outside helps SO much. If I start my day eating something (anything) and take my dog for a walk, I\u2019ll usually have a much better day. Accountability has also worked wonders - I\u2019ve never shared the full extent of my \u2018laziness\u2019 with my partner, but he knows that I\u2019m not having a great mental health week, and therefore work week, if I haven\u2019t been outside. It really helps that sometimes he\u2019ll encourage me to do something active but enjoyable with him. You might not feel comfortable sharing all the details with your parents, but it\u2019ll def help having someone to share a lunchtime walk with.\n \nYou\u2019re not lazy, and you\u2019re already actively trying by posting this. I\u2019ve only recently started talking to my Doctor about it, but he\u2019s advised this motivation rut is likely dissociation stemming from depression. There\u2019s lots you can do to keep the brain fog away, but I\u2019d suggest talking to your doc and seeing what feels good to you. I really hope ANY of my above ramblings fit your feels and help in some sort of way.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qd8sas/why_am_i_such_a_lazy_pos_and_how_can_i_change/hhlk9t8/"}
