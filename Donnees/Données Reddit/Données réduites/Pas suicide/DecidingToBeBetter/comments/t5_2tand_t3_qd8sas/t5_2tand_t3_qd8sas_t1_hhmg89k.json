Trust me on this.\n\nWhen you feel the urge to call in sick or skip a shift, ask yourself what it is that you are trying to avoid. Are you feeling tired? Burned out? Anxious? Depressed? Is there something else going on? Allow yourself to feel these things and accept that they are real and valid, not just a product of laziness. You're allowed to feel them.\n\nThen focus your energy on addressing those feelings. If it's physical tiredness or grogginess, lifestyle changes might help. If it's emotional, consider reaching out to a therapist or someone you trust for advice. It might be a combination of things. Maybe it's your job itself - maybe you can start looking to change paths if that's the case. It probably won't be an easy, quick fix, but the more you can get to the source of your habits, the better you'll become at changing them.\n\nFinally, allow yourself to take a day off every once in a while. Life is stressful and of course you don't want to be skipping work all the time. But if it happens occasionally, it happens. Take it easy on yourself. Give yourself the time and compassion to feel better and you will find the energy to work harder.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qd8sas/why_am_i_such_a_lazy_pos_and_how_can_i_change/hhmg89k/"}
