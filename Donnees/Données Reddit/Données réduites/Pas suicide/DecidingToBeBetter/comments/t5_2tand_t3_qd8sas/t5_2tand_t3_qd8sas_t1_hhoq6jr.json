It looked like depression and i was terrified she would kill herself. She insisted she wasn\u2019t sad, just \u201cevery activity is so miserable and boring that there\u2019s no point to it\u201d. We moved to a legal state and now she smokes weed all day, is learning the bass, does chores, makes dinner, never stays in bed all day long, is energetic in conversation, and actually holds down a job\u2026. It\u2019s night and day!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qd8sas/why_am_i_such_a_lazy_pos_and_how_can_i_change/hhoq6jr/"}
