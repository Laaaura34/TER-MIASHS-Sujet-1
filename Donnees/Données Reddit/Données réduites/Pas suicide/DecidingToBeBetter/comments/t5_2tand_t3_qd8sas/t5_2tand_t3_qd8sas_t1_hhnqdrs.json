I always thought that I was lazy or addicted to video games but the truth is I\u2019m not. I\u2019m just unmotivated. I started running almost two years ago and I\u2019m still obsessed with it. It\u2019s really hard to be lazy AND run. I\u2019ve learned that I work really hard for the things that catch my interest, the trick is to find something that really interests you.\n\nEdit: I also have ADHD so bless my heart.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qd8sas/why_am_i_such_a_lazy_pos_and_how_can_i_change/hhnqdrs/"}
