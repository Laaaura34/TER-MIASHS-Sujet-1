But I don't recommend waiting until that actually happens, because even after that I was beset with a shit-ton of regret\n\n\"If only I had started when I was 20, or even 30, instead of when I was 40\"\n\n\"What if I had worked on this just 15 more minutes a day, six days a week... imagine how good I'd be now.\"\n\nPlease don't do that to yourself.\n\nInstead, use your imagination. Sit quietly, close your eyes and put yourself there **now**.\n\nImagine, you're 50 years old and all you have to show for it are the comforts. Maybe you have a family to take care of. Maybe you're sick or physically weak, and you're stuck because all that time you could have spent building options for yourself you spent creating momentary comfort.\n\nSo you're stuck, and I mean STUCK. Dead end job with no options if you don't want to be homeless. No money so you can't go back to school or get training or build a new business to get out of that trap.\n\nAnd this is your life. Every fucking day til you die. Put yourself there NOW, and I mean right now. Feel how painful that is, day in and day out.\n\nAfter that, ask yourself: what do I wanna do now, I mean RIGHT NOW?\n\nIf you still want to do the comfortable thing, well... good luck to you.\n\nIf not, then take that baby step and create a new path.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lvkota/avoiding_discomfort_has_defined_much_of_my_life/gr0dvct/"}
