I also did the dating myself thing for several years and I get that sometimes certain activities just have a couple vibe even if not explicitly so. \n\nI just reminded myself that no matter if you have a partner or not, you deserve to do cool things. And doing something lovely alone is so much better than with a person you feel horrible with. Get out there and do them! \n\nAlternatively, If it\u2019s an experience you\u2019d really like to share or requires another person, bring a friend or family member. My single friends and I went on \u201cdates\u201d a lot because we wanted to do the stuff and didn\u2019t have partners lol. And why not? Friendships are also important relationships to nurture.
