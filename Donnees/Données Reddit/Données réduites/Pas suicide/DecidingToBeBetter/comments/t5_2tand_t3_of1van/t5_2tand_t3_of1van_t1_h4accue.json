I went on a few long weekend trips by myself that I loved. I still try to make time for that every year even though I\u2019m all couples up now. One time I flew to DC and did only the things I wanted to, spent money how I wanted to, went back to my hotel at 6pm to watch crime docs just like I wanted to. I could go into a museum just to look at the one painting I wanted to see and leave. I could sit on a bench and people watch for an hour because I just wanted to. The entirety of planning and executing a trip entirely around myself and what I wanted to do was an absolute luxury. And it made me feel weirdly empowered. Even though it was just to a city in my country, it felt good to know I could do the while shebang by myself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of1van/sucking_it_up_and_dating_myself/h4accue/"}
