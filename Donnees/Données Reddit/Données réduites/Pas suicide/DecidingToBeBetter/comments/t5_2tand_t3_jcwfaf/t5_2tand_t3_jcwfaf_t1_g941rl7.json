Remember to always drive safely tho. \n\nI didn't take any driving test so I crashed my car the first day it was given to me. And another crash in a few months, but hopefully those two would be the last. Those experiences were hard to recover from, but I guess since you have equipped and participated in a proper test, you'd do great! I'm happy for you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jcwfaf/i_passed_my_driving_test_today/g941rl7/"}
