I have a few things to tell myself and to reflect on when it happens though.\n\n1: Everyone is different. I didn't graduate high school till I was 22, and that's okay because it really doesn't matter to me. I'm not playing their game, I'm playing my own and enjoying almost every second of it.\n\n2: Anything is possible given the time and dedication. For the longest I was terrified of doing anything creative, and I still kind of am. But here I stand studying music theory and shopping for my first piano. Yeah I haven't been playing since I was a child, but that's fine. I don't want to be the best I just want to be me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pkc48s/me_being_envious_of_literally_everyone_in_my_life/hc3ngck/"}
