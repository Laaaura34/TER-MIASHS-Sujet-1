Either you stop all laziness and start working on yourself to be even more competitive. It will go away through pain and hardworking. When I was in my early 20s i was sporting hard, working hard and studying hard. This meant that most of the youngsters around me were jeliealouse a bit jealous. Or note that there is a big flaw in the competitiveness of our society and this is the selfishness, greed and vanity of having more and more. You can get trained as a social worker, look after disabled or eldery people for instance. No one would ever do better that you. Trying to have more will never compare with someone who is trying to share the little they have. So start sharing then.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pkc48s/me_being_envious_of_literally_everyone_in_my_life/hc5kmgs/"}
