I was once the same, even re-thinking if I chose the right career. \n\nTiming is everything and for some people, things just work out a little bit quicker. Take the time to focus on yourself and you'll be amazed at how much growth occurs.\n\nThings will work out and one day you're going to be able to look back on this time and appreciate the road it took you to get to your end goal. Plans don't always go the way we want but it's the struggle along the way where we all learn and grow the most as people. \n\nLife is too short to stress! Easier said than done but enjoy everyday and always remember that things could be worse. Love those around you and treat everyone the way you'd like to be treated. We all need to get back to that golden rule. \n\nGood luck with everything, I hope these words helped!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/po2fuk/how_do_you_stop_comparing_yourself_to_people_your/hcvuhh4/"}
