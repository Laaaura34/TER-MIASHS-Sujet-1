I found smoking early in the day destroyed my energy for the day though so I learned to smoke at night when I\u2019ve done my duties of the day.  If you want more sex drive & energy then drink more water daily, eat healthy, and workout.  Physical health translates to mental health.  I think weed in moderation can be very beneficial but when it\u2019s your lifeline, it\u2019s no good.  I think most importantly you should just know your body & how it reacts and work with weed, everyone\u2019s different, make yourself a healthy decision of when to smoke or don\u2019t smoke at all if it\u2019s not worth it", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mn7dpg/recently_quit_marijuana_and_seemingly_reverse/gtytl61/"}
