I seriously doubt that weed was the reason you were depressed, I\u2019m guessing it was a coping mechanism. You were depressed, therefore you smoked more. It\u2019s natural for that depression to come back after a week of \u201cnatural high\u201d from your body burning through your THC stores (it stores in your fat).\n\nFor me, weed has the opposite effect. I\u2019m depressed as hell when I\u2019m sober, but taking the edge off makes me a completely different person. Suddenly I\u2019m content and smiling rather than hating every moment of being alive. \n\nYou should see a doctor and get actual treatment for your depression. If exercise, daily sun exposure for vitamin D, and decent sleep aren\u2019t helping your symptoms, then you probably need meds.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mn7dpg/recently_quit_marijuana_and_seemingly_reverse/gtyw6k6/"}
