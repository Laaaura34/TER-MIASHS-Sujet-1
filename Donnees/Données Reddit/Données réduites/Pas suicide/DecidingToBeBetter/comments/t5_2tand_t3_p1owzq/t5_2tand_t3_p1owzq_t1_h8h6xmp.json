I didn\u2019t have a great support system growing up and I spent a lot of my life looking for external validation.  I wish I had believed in myself more and believed that I deserve everything I wanted in life. I think I missed out on a lot in life by not pursuing things I assumed I would never be able to get anyway, like a huge promotion at work.  \n\nMy other advice is to save money!  I really regret not building up my savings more when I was young.  Money = freedom.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p1owzq/advice_youd_give_to_a_18f/h8h6xmp/"}
