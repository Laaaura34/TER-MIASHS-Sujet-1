Having someone who can walk you through things you\u2019re struggling to understand or can\u2019t have an unbiased understanding of. Growing up with a therapist, I had so much guidance with the social situations I couldn\u2019t figure out. Even now, I find them incredibly difficult and stressful. Not like you, I have not improved with age. However, I do not feel uncomfortable with myself. I learned how to be appropriately direct. I feel comfortable saying things like \u201cI do not understand what I should do, please help.\u201d \n\nI work in a pediatric ICU. Talking to parents is the hardest thing I have ever done. I practice difficult conversations during procedures, in the shower, and even in the car! I\u2019m not ashamed of it. Where my brain lacks in helping me understand the social aspect, it has empowered me to understand the physical aspects, and therefore we save lives. \n\nAnother career I considered and was passionate about was anything to do with animals and animal conservation. After my bachelors degree, I spent a gap year working as a CNA in this same ICU. During this year, I built up anxiety about taking exams to get into medical school, and about doing well in interviews. I very nearly dropped it all and became a zoo keeper! I love animals, and I find that they are much more understandable than humans. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve found something you love, each step you take towards that will build your confidence and passion. \n\nMy advice is don\u2019t worry about your mistakes, don\u2019t over analyze your interactions. Be honest and say you have a hard time with some situations. Move on and learn as you go.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lzfdlr/how_do_you_come_to_terms_with_having_a_mental/gq1t7av/"}
