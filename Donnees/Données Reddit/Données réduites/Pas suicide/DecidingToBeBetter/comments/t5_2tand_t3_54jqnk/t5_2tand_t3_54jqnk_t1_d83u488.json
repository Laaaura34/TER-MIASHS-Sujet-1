Now a new version of the test is online and this has been fixed. The 6 most unsuitable questions for females have now been modified. 3 three of them have completely been removed/disabled from those who select \"gender='female'\" at the beginning of test. The scoring logic for females has been updated to account for these changes. For the other 3 the question text has been modified so that you don't have to have a penis anymore to answer it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/54jqnk/with_this_inventory_you_can_test_your_mental_and/d83u488/"}
