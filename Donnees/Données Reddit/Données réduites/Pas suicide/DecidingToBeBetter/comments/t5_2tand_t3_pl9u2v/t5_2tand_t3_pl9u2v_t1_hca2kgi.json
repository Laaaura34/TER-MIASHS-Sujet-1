For example she got all A's and one C. The C was in math. When someone would ask her mom how is \"Allison\" doing? her mom would say \"oh she has to work on her math.\" After a while of this when someone would ask Allison how school was going she would say \"I have to work on my math.\" Guess what happened, next report card math was a D. \n\nThe words of others were heard so often that she began hearing them in her head as her own thoughts with her own voice. \n\nHere is a best kept secret. The two WORST words that you can ever think are \"I Should\" - anytime you began a sentence or thought with the words \"I should\" or the deviations of it such as \"I'm supposed to\" or \"I ought to\" - you create negative energy.  This is because the words imply that you are NOT doing what is RIGHT and therefore you are in the WRONG and you are a BAD PERSON. Eventually when enough it occurs where you overflow your mind you end up with a panic attack.\n\nHere is the good news. The two most POWERFUL words that you can ever use \"I want\"\n\nWhen you begin a sentence or thought with \"I want\" it is 100% YOU. You own the thought. Then when you act on the want and get it, you own reality. \n\nSo anytime you hear yourself \"I should\" stop and then replace it with \"I want\"", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pl9u2v/my_life_was_just_shit_on_and_im_finally_hearing/hca2kgi/"}
