I would like to add one thing I learnt in my own journey to self love. To be able to find that intrinsic self love that does not depend on any body's approval, it is important to understand where the self love deficit comes from.\n\nFor me, and a lot of people, it started with my childhood, where I received only conditional love from my parents. Even as a small child I learnt that my parents are happy only when I achieve something great, or I am doing things to make others happy.\n\nThis was internalised as a belief that I am inherently not worthy, and my worth depends on achieving things and making people happy. This lead to my co-dependancy, and lack of self love.\n\nI was able to start loving myself, just the way I am, only after understanding this, and working through this in therapy. Until then, self love was just an abstract  concept, that I thought I understood, but never  actually achieved. But  once I managed to get past and  resolve the childhood experiences, self love came automatically.\n\nI would love to suggest that people should watch this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVpbsZaef8Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVpbsZaef8Y) by Ross Rosenberg. All theme  of all his videos is to heal the childhood attachment truama to achieve self love abundance and break out of toxic relationship patterns.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fjj8a3/never_forget_that_selflove_is_critical/fkned1e/"}
