The mission itself doesn't have to be a grand, lofty, noble or heavenly sort of aim; it can be as simple as \"I wish to be a better friend to those around me\".\n\nI personally feel that once you have that kind of purpose in mind, you'll find it's easier to draw the lines between self-care and indulgence, and between healthy critique and berating. Once you have that kind of mission in mind, you can ask yourself the following simple question: does this help the cause? \n\nIf the only thing that your self-criticism does is to make you feel terrible and thus less able to fulfil your objective, then you've probably crossed the line into berating. If the only thing your self-care does is to make you too comfortable and thus less willing to face the fears associated to your mission, then you've probably crossed over into indulgence.\n\nI suppose it all depends on what you're aiming for. Also, please take everything I say with a healthy dose of skepticism. I'm no guru. I'm just an ordinary person clumsily trying to deal with the same issues.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fjj8a3/never_forget_that_selflove_is_critical/fkoqnf8/"}
