You don\u2019t have to go through this alone, let your gf know if you haven\u2019t already, explain what\u2019s happening to you and how you\u2019re feeling it will make you feel better taking that off your chest. When your hearts beats fast it\u2019s your body in fight or flight so you have to tell yourself that you\u2019re safe and it has no reason to be in fight or flight try to just keep telling yourself \u201cI\u2019m safe, this is just my body adapting to not having weed and nicotine, I will just let this pass\u201d try taking deep breaths and hold an ice cube and focus of the cold feeling to help ground you, plus you\u2019re young so your heart is healthy and your heart goes up way more than that when you\u2019re running or exercising and nothing happens to you.\nYou\u2019re 18 so you\u2019re legally allowed to be with the doctor alone, tell your mom you\u2019d feel more comfortable being alone with the doctor and it will make you less nervous and help you explain yourself better.\nAlso, I know you don\u2019t have an appetite but you have to force yourself to eat\nAnd again distract yourself, don\u2019t stop your everyday life for this because it will keep you from moving forward.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p35mko/quit_nicotine_and_thc_cold_turkey/hd7h4ig/"}
