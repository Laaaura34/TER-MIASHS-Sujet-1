When I\u2019m laying in bed it feels like my heart is just pounding through my chest, and I\u2019m not hungry one bit, I am a male and sorry if this is weird but I\u2019ve tried to get aroused from my gf but I\u2019m just not in the mood. What day will my anxiety and everything go away. Like I said I\u2019m on day 4 and when I wake up it\u2019s day 5 but this is killing me like I feel like I\u2019m gunna die. Also I am 18 but I have a doctors appt for Friday and my mom will be coming with me. She doesn\u2019t know that I have vapped and smoked weed for the past 3 years so I basically have to lie to my doctor but I don\u2019t want to cause I need help. I just don\u2019t know what to do and I\u2019m all alone going through this", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p35mko/quit_nicotine_and_thc_cold_turkey/hd03bjh/"}
