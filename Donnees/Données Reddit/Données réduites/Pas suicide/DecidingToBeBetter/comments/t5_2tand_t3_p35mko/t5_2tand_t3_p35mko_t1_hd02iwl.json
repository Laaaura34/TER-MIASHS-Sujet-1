So this is what I found helped after trying a bunch of things, try this and let me know, this should help you get over this as soon as possible: \n1.everyday wake up and eat a banana as soon as you wake up then drink coffee (if you\u2019re a coffee drinker), have breakfast (I usually eat eggs for breakfast but you can eat whatever) right after breakfast take omega 3 and vitamin D (only supplements I found to make a difference without side effects), then go on about your day\n2. try to be around friends and family or work to keep yourself busy\n3. Go to the gym or for a run/walk, I work all day so I usually go in the evening around 6-7pm and it helps calm my body down for the night\n4. Make sure you eat enough food throughout the day and drink plenty of water\n5. Have a light dinner and include a banana before bed as well (helps with sleep)\n6. SLEEP GOOD, can\u2019t stress this enough! Getting enough sleep at night helps A LOT\n7. Last but not least, this only applies if you\u2019re a guy, try not having sex or masturbating for a whole week, by the end of the week your testosterone levels would be higher which would help with energy/confidence/self esteem which intern helps you over power the bad feelings. Depression/anxiety tend to decrease testosterone levels which makes you feel more tired and when you abstain from orgasm it boosts your testosterone levels", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p35mko/quit_nicotine_and_thc_cold_turkey/hd02iwl/"}
