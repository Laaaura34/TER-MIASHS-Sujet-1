I've been there too.  Do not listen to The Liar of ALL Liars that just wants you to harm yourself or others.  Seek out a supportive group like NAMI.  There are national hotline numbers that can help support you too.  If able also talk to your doctor for appropriate referrals to qualified professional counselors.  Never Give Up on you.  I struggle with ptsd and horrible grief.  It is hell some days.  The hell in this temporary life is just that, Temporary, but suicide is permanent.  I lost family members and other loved ones to suicide.  That is that f'in devil telling you bullshit lies to hurt you and others.  Do Not listen to lies.  I don't even know you and I love you because you are a human being with a heartbeat.  Your illness is not a choice so get the proper help.  It's responsible to and although hard work it will make a difference in your life. There are people out there trying to eliminate the stigmas of mental health issues such as the NAMI, Nostigmas and Medcircle organizations.  NAMI, Nostigmas are support groups, educational both online and in the community and Medcircle member is an educational program online that will help you and family and friends to become educated to also eliminate the stigmas.  Prayers for you.  HUGS \ud83e\udd17", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/noqyj0/i_am_a_useless_mosquito_vampire_person_who_has/h04ff4z/"}
