I am feeling so stressed. I have an assignment to submit on 17th. On 18th I have a presentation. And on 25th and ,26th I have presentations. I should be working my ass off but I am sitting here crying. \nI had a poor GPA in my bachelor's because of abusive household, step mother. \n\nI wonder what I did wrong to have an abusive partner as well. Why did this happen to me? Is this the cost of being born in a broken family? Will my son go through the same?\n\nI am so uncertain about finding a job. It's such a long struggle, masters, then finding a job. \n\nAnd you were right about A's. I got A's in the first semester of my masters, but I had a poor GPA in my bachelor's.
