Will be graduating college next year, after dropping out back in 2010.  Suicidal depression, multiple hospitalizations, electroconvulsive therapy. To say it was a bad time would be something of an understatement.\n\nFound the right medication 4 years ago. That's what started my journey to getting better. Small, incremental changes in habits also helped, but nothing would have been possible without the meds. Less time on Facebook, Reddit. Exercising, eating better. Forcing myself to socialize. Don't push yourself too hard; like lifting weights, you don't don't start by squatting 500 pounds. You do what you can and increase gradually. If all you can do is get out of bed and brush your teeth, celebrate that shit.\n\nSince school started I've maintained a 4.0, am planning on going to med school, maybe even doing a joint PhD (I'm older but fuck it). I have gotten to know my professors better than I ever did before, and no longer procrastinate all day and then cram like I used to. I'm not perfect, but things are worlds better. I've also stuck with Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu for and am learning how to handle myself physically, which makes me feel a little badass. \n\nDon't compare yourself to others. Do what you can, and celebrate those accomplishments, even if no one else can see how big a deal they are. Do it long enough and you'll see your life starting to change. Sometimes you'll get it wrong, but trial and error. You're moving in the right direction.
