But to summarize it was a combination of hitting it off with the interviewers on a personal note, passing their technical test and during the conference interview i handed them an xbox controller connected to my laptop. The controller was what i worked on the week before to make it easy to play. You need to stay positive and have something unique to stand out.\n\nTo survive in CA i started in a motel6 in Orange. Theres lots of jobs from LA to san diego in games. Orange county has a lot. People are pretty friendly, one of the motel6 workers gave me a discount and invited me to a concert. You never know what will happen. Good or bad. Thats the best part, to me, it actually felt like living. I doubt the worst you stated you fear will come true but many great things could happen.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7xb3cq/anyone_have_any_true_comeback_stories_that_can/du7m4ib/"}
