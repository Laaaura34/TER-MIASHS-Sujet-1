The goal was simple, get to 100 points. In just a few hands, this stranger had me. It was 99 points to zero mate. I was losing bad, but I just wasn't going to let this guy beat me. I really didn't like the idea. I knew I could beat this guy. So next hand I give it everything I have and with a little luck I finally win a hand and eek out a handful of points. Ok, still alive and at least I didn't get skunked. Next hand, I win a few more points. More beers come. Next few hands had me breaking fifty points. He couldn't get an opening edgewise and complained about it. Now we have spectators. He gets serious. Hand after hand I barely beat him, scoring inch by inch. More beers. We've been at this for what would be considered an incredibly long time for a single game. And we've arrived at the point where I'm within striking distance. Just about any win, just a few points guarantees me the match. Neither one of us could really believe what was happening to us. We took a moment to look at each other and then we burst out in laughter at our situation. The small crowd that had ambled over from the beach bar laughed with us as the game began. It came down to the last domino. Beat him by two points and he paid for the beers. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7xb3cq/anyone_have_any_true_comeback_stories_that_can/du7v8wv/"}
