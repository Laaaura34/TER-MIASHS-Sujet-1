Ain't nothing wrong with that. Also, maybe college isn't for you. It isn't for everyone. I didn't think I was going back, ever, until I realized I really wanted to be a doctor. \n\nDon't impose artificial timeframes. \"I have to do this before I'm X years old\". Like the muscle building analogy, just focus on pushing yourself a tiny bit further than you did the day before. Half the time (okay, 90% of the time) you'll fail. That's okay. But the inch you moved forward will have made the next inch you try just a tiny percentage of a percentage point easier. \n\nIf you decide to go back and you feel you're ready, it's okay if you're scared. I heard this quote a little while ago which has been banging around in my head: \"Everything worth doing lies on the other side of fear\". Don't feel like you have to completely eradicate your fear before attempting something. \n\nAgain, I don't know your situation, so I'm in no way saying you should go back to school-- now or ever, for that matter. If you gotta get some other things together in your life-- your biochemistry, daily habits, family issues, whatever-- then go ahead and focus on that. School will be there when you're ready. Take it easy on yourself. Life's not a race. \n\n \n\n\n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7xb3cq/anyone_have_any_true_comeback_stories_that_can/du7g91t/"}
