I graduated at 28 with a bachelors in Social Work, which took me 7 years to complete. I was bumming around, focusing on lots of things but nothing that required commitment. \n\nI moved to Thailand to \u201cteach\u201d but basically ended up partying for 4 years, until I was flat broke, I had about 500 Baht in my name. Being broke, in a foreign country with just some party friends isn\u2019t something I can recommend. I was borderline depressed and had no hope.\n\nThrough a freak coincidence I found a starting position as a recovery coach in a local (internationally orientated) rehabilitation clinic. Stopped partying, started saving money. Invested in my professional development. Stopped cheating on women. \n\n1 year later I become an addictions therapist (big moment for me). 2 years after that I was promoted to Clinical Director. I earn a competitive Western salary in a developing country. A life I could only dream of a couple of years ago. \n\nI\u2019m 36 now, married to a beautiful person, in an intellectually stimulating environment, I feel I have deep meaningful friendships, I am finishing up my MA thesis and I\u2019m fairly certain I can continue straight into a PhD program. \n\nHow you feel right now, is not forever. Trust me. \n\nAll the best. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7xb3cq/anyone_have_any_true_comeback_stories_that_can/du7wwzl/"}
