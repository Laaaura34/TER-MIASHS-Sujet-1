And what did you do better with the game? What made them accept you? \n\nI also want to live in CA, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll lose a job I might end up getting and go broke with no pay, starve, get sick with no health insurance, and...just bad stuff. \n\nWhat cheap places are there in CA to live?
