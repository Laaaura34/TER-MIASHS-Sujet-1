That may be fine for someone more mature but at 17 it messes with me. \n\nI ended up being admitted to a psych ward where I received a misdiagnosis of having bipolar. I was on psych meds for years and struggled HARD. I attempted suicide twice and called an ambulance for myself both times. My life spiraled out of control and before I knew it I was doing harder and harder drugs. I ended up 19 years old addicted to crystal meth and homeless. I was a drug addict to the core and hit absolute rock bottom.\n\nNow for the comeback - after I spend 4 months in rehab I rejoined society. I was 20 at this point and started working as a barista, I was timid and anxious and kept what I had been though a complete secret to everyone. I met with a doctor to told me if I wasn\u2019t clean for 2 years from illegal drugs I couldn\u2019t be diagnosed bipolar. So I stopped taking the psych meds and I haven\u2019t for the last 6 years.\n\nI stumbled across a personal development book called \u201cAwaken the Giant Within\u201d by Tony Robbins. I decided to purchase it on a whim and applied some of the concepts. Book after book I read i didn\u2019t see anything changing at first... all I knew I made a CONSCIOUS decision to be better.\n\nI quit my 5 year pack a day smoking habit, starting lifting weights and got promoted at my job. A year or two later I got promoted again and my confidence started rising and rising. I kept reading personal development books and applying the principals.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m 23 and have been lifting 3 years and it shows. Being consistent has really paid off. I meet the love of my life and we move in together. I\u2019ve never been this happy in my entire life and I know I\u2019m on the right track.\n\nFast forward to today. I\u2019m 26 and I am completely independent and make 140k+ as a mortgage broker. I live with the woman I\u2019m going to marry and love with my whole heart. We live in a beautiful apartment on the waterfront in the city. We have a puppy and I drive a new sports car. \n\nLife can be crazy but one thing I know is if you decide to be better and commit you can do it!\n\nTLDR - Went from a homeless crystal meth addict at 20 to a young success at 26.
