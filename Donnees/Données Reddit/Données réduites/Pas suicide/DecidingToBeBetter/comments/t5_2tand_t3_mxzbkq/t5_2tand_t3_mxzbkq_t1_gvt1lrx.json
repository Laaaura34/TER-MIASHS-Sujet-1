I got my GED when I was 16 years old thinking it was the only option besides starting school from scratch.\n\nCongratulations OP, you'll do amazing and you'll be able to succeed in college with the additional wisdom that life has given you.\n\nMake sure you apply to every \"first year\" scholarship and grant out there. I made the financial mistake of thinking my GED made me ineligible for scholarships. \n\nIf you have any questions about entering college as a nontrad, feel free to Pm me.\n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mxzbkq/so_torrowow_is_the_big_day/gvt1lrx/"}
