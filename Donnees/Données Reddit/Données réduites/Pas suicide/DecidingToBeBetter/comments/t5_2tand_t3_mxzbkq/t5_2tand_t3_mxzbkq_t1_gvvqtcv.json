I\u2019m from Mexico, so I\u2019m not aware of the US system of education. Here we don\u2019t have anything that it isn't the high school diploma, so if you finish high school you get a diploma regardless of the way you are finishing (more on that on the edit). Also, I don't think Mexico has the same option of loans regarding college. Here only banks give you loans, and the schools give you maybe a scholarship, a discount on your payments. But in any case, thanks for your kind wishes, and I hope you are doing great :3", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mxzbkq/so_torrowow_is_the_big_day/gvvqtcv/"}
