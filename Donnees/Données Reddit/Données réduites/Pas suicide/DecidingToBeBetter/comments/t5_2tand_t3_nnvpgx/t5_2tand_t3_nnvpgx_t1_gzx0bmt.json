You can dm me on here and if you wanna we could use discord, Instagram, or text. Just dm for my contacts. \n\nSorry you've been going through all this I know how hard it can be having no one care about you and everyone who is supposed to love you unconditionally has conditions you simply can't meet. I remember being terrified at 6 years old I wasn't going to eat that day because my mother was either too depressed or angry and my father didn't really have a full conversation with me until after I was 18 despite living in the same house with me all my life. \n\nThere are a lot more examples of how little they cared but those particular ones just stick out to me and I can talk about it more if it'd make you more comfortable I don't mind but I figure that's enough for you to get a general idea. I don't know if anyone will ever genuenly care about me or be there for me but I made a promise to myself I would care for others the way I wanted to be cared for. Because everyone deserves to feel loved and cared for. Humans are humans and deserve to be treated as such. \n\nSo if you wanna talk feel free but if not don't feel pressured. I really hope everything gets way better for you. \\*hugs\\*", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nnvpgx/my_life_has_been_turned_upside_down_since/gzx0bmt/"}
