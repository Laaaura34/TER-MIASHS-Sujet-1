I deleted my social media about a year ago and it\u2019s been great for my mental health bc I\u2019m not comparing myself to random acquaintances or stalking their profiles at 3 am feeling bitter about my own life. But at the same time I feel like I\u2019m just,,, avoiding obstacles instead of strengthening my mindset to handle jealousy and insecurity? I can\u2019t avoid other peoples successes forever just to feel better about myself right? And I\u2019ve definitely felt more isolated now. Don\u2019t really know what others are up to and without ig dms I\u2019m not really talking to a lot of people either. Next year I\u2019m moving abroad to study so I think I will reactivate my accounts again\u2026 feels like everyone will actually forget my existence if I don\u2019t have an online presence then :(", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qehakp/getting_rid_of_social_media_might_be_hurting_me/hhtrixr/"}
