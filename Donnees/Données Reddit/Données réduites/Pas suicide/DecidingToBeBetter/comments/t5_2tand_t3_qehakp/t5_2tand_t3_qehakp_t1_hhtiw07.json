If I\u2019m looking / scrolling (Instagram is my best example) it\u2019s at self help and positive mental health accounts. If whatever app you\u2019re using makes you sad bc you\u2019re comparing yourself, maybe change who can show up on your feed! I hope this helps just a little bit, you should be proud of yourself for taking these steps to work on your mental health <3", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qehakp/getting_rid_of_social_media_might_be_hurting_me/hhtiw07/"}
