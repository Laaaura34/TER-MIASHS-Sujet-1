It was really hard at first cause when you spend years pushing those feelings down and covering them up with substances, you only numb them for so long. Once you\u2019re forced to feel your feelings every day, it\u2019s painful but over time you learn how to cope a bit better, at least I did. \n\nI still have pretty bad anxiety honestly, I\u2019ve been looking into therapy for it. Some days are worse than others, when it starts to consume me I\u2019ve found that acknowledging it is helpful. Allow it to exist, acknowledge its there but remind yourself it\u2019s not rational and it doesn\u2019t have to control you completely. It\u2019s hard, and sometimes it still wins but most of the time it helps to almost \u201ccoexist\u201d with it instead of allowing it to run the show, if that makes sense!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lw2ftp/ive_done_a_180_and_didnt_even_realize_how_bad_a/gpg3zbs/"}
