You could have all those qualities and still be deeply unhappy.   \n\n\nI think the process of this kind of thinking is... \"If only I had X, then everything would be grand\" but X is seldom \"it\".  \n\n\nWhat good is charisma when you're struggling to put food on the table? What good is confidence in social situations when you hate your career? What good is it to be seen as cool if you can't sustain relationships? What good is it to get the girl if you can't keep her?  \n\n\nMy point is none of those qualities in isolation mean much without a well balanced life. Be careful of placing so much emotion into the ethereal, chances are the people you're comparing yourself to have a whole bunch of self hate of their own.   \n\n\nIf I were you, I'd focus on the intensity of your emotions, no one wants to be around angry people, let go of the virtuous anger. It took me years to drop the chip on my shoulder and I still have to watch myself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bqlcrk/i_just_want_to_pull_all_my_fucking_hair_out_i/eo5n1sp/"}
