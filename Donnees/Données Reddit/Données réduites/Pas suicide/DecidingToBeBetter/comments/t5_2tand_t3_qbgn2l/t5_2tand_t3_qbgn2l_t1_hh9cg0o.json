So take those ideas and start tiny, but start. You gotta give yourself a fighting chance. Walking, getting some sun, setting a decent sleep schedule, cooking yourself meals, journaling, etc. can all be small and easy things you do to give yourself a fighting chance. It's easy to get caught in a self-reinforcing cycle of negative habits. They build on each other and if you don't tend to the garden suddenly it's all weeds! So start small and pull one weed a day and water one flower a day.\n\nAnd among all the things you work on, spend the most energy being kind to yourself!\n\nThink about what you would say to a dear friend of yours if they came to you and just told you everything you posted. What would you say to them? Would you berate them for not being good enough or not trying hard enough? You would probably show them kindness and try and build them up! So try that with yourself!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbgn2l/how_do_you_decide_to_do_better_when_you_have_no/hh9cg0o/"}
