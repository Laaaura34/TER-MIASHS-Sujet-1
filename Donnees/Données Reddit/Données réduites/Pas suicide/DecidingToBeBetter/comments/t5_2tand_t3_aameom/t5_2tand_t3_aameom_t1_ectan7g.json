Your advice makes sense, it really is very good. Sadly it is impossible, since the social worker is his social worker as well he has responsibilities to both of us, under those circumstances I do not believe he is allowed to offer advice. I am not able to leave the area, my job, addiction counselor, social worker and therapist are here. I am going to rehab in 1 or 2 months, that may help. It really is nice of you to respond, it helps to know someone cares a bit. Thanks so much again, I hope things are good with you, and that your day is so beautiful.
