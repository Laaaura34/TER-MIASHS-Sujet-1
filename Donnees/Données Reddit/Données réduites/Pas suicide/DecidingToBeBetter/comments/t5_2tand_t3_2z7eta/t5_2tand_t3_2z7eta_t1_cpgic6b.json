Exactly as I like to read, or as I like to do fitness.  \nSomething that bothers me in this subreddit is, that there are few general things that people take as \"good\" (fitness, books, clean eating) and they try to do them no matter how they like it, with blind hope, that when they will follow these things, they will be happy.
