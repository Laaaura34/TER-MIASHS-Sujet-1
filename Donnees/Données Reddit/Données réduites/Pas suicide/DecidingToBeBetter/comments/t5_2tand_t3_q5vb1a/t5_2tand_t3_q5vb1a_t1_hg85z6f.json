I can\u2019t imagine how heavy it all feels. \n\nIn my opinion it sounds like your mindset is incredibly dictated by what others think of you. A big indicator is how you focus on your parents opinions of you. No one else will have to live your life- only you. So if you don\u2019t like what you are studying or simply aren\u2019t good at it- then switch to something else. \n\nThe hardest part about all of this is that you live in New York. That\u2019s a lot of pressure- living expenses are crazy high. My advice would be to get a degree in a job you can do competently- then think about moving somewhere that is cheaper to live that you can get a job at. \n\nThe only caveat I would mention is to ask yourself  how disciplined you are and how much effort you are giving to all these problems. If you truly feel like you are giving your all- and it\u2019s still not working- choose a different path. If you feel like you aren\u2019t trying you\u2019re best- start now.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5vb1a/any_advice_on_how_to_change_my_life_for_the/hg85z6f/"}
