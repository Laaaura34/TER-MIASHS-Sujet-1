I\u2019ve recently found that things like embroidery and crocheting are the best for helping me relax since I still get to stay a little active but it doesn\u2019t require too much brainpower. Once I\u2019ve outlined my embroidery design or done the first few establishing lines of my crochet pattern I can kind of go on autopilot and just chill out. I also like to fidget but don\u2019t like a lot of the toys available so crochet keeps my hands busy during lectures, meetings, or things like podcasts where I\u2019m listening but my hands need something to do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jq0wfe/how_can_i_teach_myself_how_to_relax/gbizu7n/"}
