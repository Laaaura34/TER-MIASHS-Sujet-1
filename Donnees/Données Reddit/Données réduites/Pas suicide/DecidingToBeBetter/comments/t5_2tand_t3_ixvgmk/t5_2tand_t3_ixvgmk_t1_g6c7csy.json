Basically to learn to say 'no'.  \nThough it may seem like in some situations it's going to ruin your relationship with your parents, it's actually going to do the very opposite.   \nEvery human being is able to pick up on the soft cues of self-respect. An individual with healthy boundaries shows a certain amount of self-worth and self-respect. Your parents will react aggressively to your new found respect because they'll be afraid to lose control ... at first. After that, they will almost immediately start treating you nicer, more appreciative. This attitude works 100% of the time, I guarantee it from my own personal experience.   \nTested and approved ;)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ixvgmk/how_do_i_keep_from_despairing/g6c7csy/"}
