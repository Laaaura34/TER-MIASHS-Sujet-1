I don't seem to get that \"feel good\" feeling after exercise that other people get. Part of why I got into this mess is because the only real physical comfort/pleasure I get is from eating junk food. \n\nBut I have noticed that when I exercise, I'm a little bit more relaxed the rest of the day(never fully relaxed, because GAD) and I've been getting higher quality sleep. Like, I've been naturally waking up much earlier but feeling more well-rested. So I'm trying to focus on those things, but I still feel stuck in the sense that better physical fitness, being more relaxed, and getting better sleep aren't going to make me any less alone.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nxv7hz/i_feel_like_im_about_to_hit_that_wall_that_i/h1iawoa/"}
