Set some goals and you can seriously make some big changes/improvements in one year! I made that promise to myself last year when I turned 40...\n\nOver the last year I got a new job with a better /regular schedule, covered up an old tatoo I've hated for 10 years, got another tattoo I've wanted for a long time, got braces, have done 5 months of therapy, and I started seeing a specialist neurologist to manage my headaches. My relationship with my husband is way better, my kids are happier, and I feel better. Unfortunately, because I've had so many appointments and have been so busy, I've been working out less. And because of the stress with life and covid, I've been drinking more....so better in some ways, but still a major work in progress. My goal this summer is to cut down on drinking (I'm not an alcoholic by any means...), and get back into exercising regularly. \n\nGood luck on the next year's journey!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n7wgql/im_determined_to_spend_the_next_year_of_my_life/gxgcnhu/"}
