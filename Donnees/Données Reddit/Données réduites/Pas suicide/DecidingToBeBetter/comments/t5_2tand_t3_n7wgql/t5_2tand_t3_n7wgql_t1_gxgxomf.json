I turned 36 last month and am on a similar path. I left a boring, energy depleting ft job so I could land a pt job within the same organization. I'll be making a lot less money, but that's only temporary. The bonus is that I now have the time to get well and kick ass on so many different levels...I have neglected my health and other life goals (aside from working 9-5) because I didn't have time. Well now I do. I'm committed and there is no turning back. \n\nThe ft job also didn't align with who I really am. It was constricting me - making me someone who I recognized less and less each day. \n\nIt's very comforting to know someone else my age is making a  personal sacrifice for the greater good and for self-preservation. Thanks for sharing. \n\nLet me know how it goes if you're up for it. Take care.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n7wgql/im_determined_to_spend_the_next_year_of_my_life/gxgxomf/"}
