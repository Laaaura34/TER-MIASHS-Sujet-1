But you\u2019re allowed to think that. If it does you good, then so be it. :)\n\nI would argue that you most likely *act* as if though there is meaning in the world, even if it\u2019s one you subjectively create. If not then you would literally do nothing or everything at random. Go to work today? Nope not feeling it. Shower? Meh. Got a date, okay maybe I\u2019ll shower. Develop better habits, what\u2019s the point? Sure it might make life temporarily better - if I can put up enough discipline to accomplish the habit - but I\u2019ll die anyway so why not stop the suffering now and just do nothing instead? \n\nIt\u2019s not a very healthy spiral.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oyk4or/what_is_my_purpose/h7tgltj/"}
