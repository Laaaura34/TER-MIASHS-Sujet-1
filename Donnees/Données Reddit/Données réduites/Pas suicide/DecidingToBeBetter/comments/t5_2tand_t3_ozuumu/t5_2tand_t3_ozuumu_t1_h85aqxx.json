I have always observed a strong connection between my self talk, emotions and actions. But then when I try changing my thoughts - I have to keep monitoring my thoughts, consciously change them and then keep practicing this. You\u2019re right - it\u2019s really exhausting. Like all my living energy goes into this. At the end of it I am immersed in my inner self so much that I can\u2019t see anything else. A metaphor that makes a lot of sense to me is that our thoughts and cognitive processes are like a water turbine which is made of water. Because emotions are both ways we perceive the world and channel of effecting change in ourselves, it\u2019s such a huge mess at times. When it comes to my self talk I can see that there\u2019s so much that comes from my subconscious. If I try to unravel all of them in the middle of a crisis, it\u2019s like repairing the engine of my car as I am driving it. It\u2019s not just crazy, it feels impossible!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ozuumu/are_you_a_slave_to_your_thoughts/h85aqxx/"}
