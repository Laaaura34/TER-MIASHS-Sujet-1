It really puts into perspective the idea of what being in the moment really is and how we view our lives through a lens of memories. The tricky part for me is associations. I remember experiences like I remember songs. I'm a musician and if I hear a song I know I think about the trajectory, where it's going and how it gets there all at once. The same happens with my memories of events with my ex gf. I see a path we walked in the city and I remember the whole event in an instant. The important thing is how I react to those memories.
