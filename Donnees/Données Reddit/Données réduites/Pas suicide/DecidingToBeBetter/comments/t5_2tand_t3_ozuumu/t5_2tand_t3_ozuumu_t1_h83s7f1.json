I can't change the situation now and even if I had the chance I wouldn't change it . So there no reason to be thinking wether something could change or not . Yh I know you make scenarios in order to be prepared if something similar comes to you again but you have to understand that this is just a survival mechanism and there is no reason of recalling the past as nothing will change , learn from your mistakes and past don't live in them . Etc I learnt that I can't really trust anyone but I don't recall of them all the time or how things ended up . \n\n\n\nOur life is a history book and we are the writters. Don't spend the pages of your book witting about the exact same event again and again . Go on and create new happy memories .
