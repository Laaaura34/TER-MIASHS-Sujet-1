I was addicted to smoking cigs, weed, porn, and vaping all at once. I first stopped smoking cigs, and while it was hard at first my dad quit with me, so I had motivation.\n\nThen, I stopped smoking weed. I just didn\u2019t like the lifestyle it brings with it, so I wanted to change that. Finally I stopped vaping, because it was getting too expensive and people wouldn\u2019t hang out with me. \n\nNow, I\u2019m working on quitting porn and video games. My reason for this is because I want to have a family one day and be successful at my job. \n\nTL;DR : Always have a reason for quitting something, whether it\u2019s intangible or tangible. And make sure that\u2019s a reason you can look forward to every time you have an urge to go back to your ways.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mz5c9y/using_avoidance_to_cope_with_stressvaping_weed/gvz1r46/"}
