But I think it just comes down to how one's parents raised them, regardless of wealth, and if they taught them any good money habits before they got old enough to make huge mistakes like yours. I have a friend who's grown up pretty poor their whole life, moving to another place every few years, divorced parents so a single mom with 4 kids, the works. But this guy is absolutely terrible with his money, constantly spending it on more clothes or wanting to go out to nice bars or places that cost a lot of money in general and he's left with scraps after saving up a few weeks of paychecks. He received the stimulus checks and has been collecting unemployment $ pretty much since our state opened it up to just about anyone with a pulse and I know that he's burned through the majority of that money on consumer shit, invested some in cryptocurrency, but who knows if it'll pay off (I hope so). He admits that neither of his parents taught him any financial literacy and he still hasn't fully learned that lesson imo.\n\nOn the flip side, another one of our friends grew up veryy well off, but his parents taught him good spending habits as soon as he got his first job in HS and he's making a killing reselling shoes and other clothes online while we're still in college and is also a shrewd spender, when we all go out you'll only see him maybe 25% of the time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p204ui/after_5_years_i_paid_off_70000_of_credit_card/h8hgcq9/"}
