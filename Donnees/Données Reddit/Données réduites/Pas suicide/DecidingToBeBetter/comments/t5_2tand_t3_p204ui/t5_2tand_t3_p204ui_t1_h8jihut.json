Ya, OP's parents bailed them out, but guess what? They could've easily got a personal loan just for the cash to survive, and the outcome is the same (I did this with an absolute shit credit score, someone will always lend you money).\n\nThe main take away is that OP worked their ass off, and learned from their mistakes. They made their own luck by continuing to improve and push forward. People can bitch and complain about how someone is lucky and how you shouldn't of gotten that job or whatever. It happens ALL THE TIME in the real world. Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.\n\nVery proud of you OP, I can tell you're a high achiever with an entrepreneur spirit. Keep doing you and don't let people who are deep down envious of your circumstances affect your mindset.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p204ui/after_5_years_i_paid_off_70000_of_credit_card/h8jihut/"}
