I\u2019ll admit though every part of this story as a financially responsible person made me cringe lol. I\u2019ve always been a money hoarder though and hate hate hate having any debt and hate using credit cards and pretty much solely have them to build credit not to use for my wants. I\u2019ve never had more than $800 in total between my credit cards and that felt like a lot. \n\nI think it stems from growing up watching my parents be poor but also not make great finically decisions that I just got completely turned off to the idea of being so financially irresponsible. By high school I was working having to help my parents pay their rent and was doing my own taxes and applying for any federal aid I could get. \n\nMy husband on the other hand grew up very comfortable financially and as such was terrible with money when we first met. Didn\u2019t know how to save and spent money on things that were way too expensive and unnecessary. \n\nIdk maybe it\u2019s because he saw his parents able to do it he didn\u2019t realize it takes a lot of effort to get to a place like that, but from everything I\u2019ve witnessed and read it\u2019s always the people who grew up with parents that had a comfortable amount of money that turned out to be the worst at money themselves", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p204ui/after_5_years_i_paid_off_70000_of_credit_card/h8gxit5/"}
