It starts off slow and then it takes hold and like any addiction you need bigger and stronger hits to feel satisfied. I think a lot of the more violent fetishes stem from that because the first reaction to that type of porn isn't going to be arousal. But once it's normalized then it can start to become arousing. People intellectualize their fetish but really it's not difficult to understand these cravings. Cigarettes taste disgusting to a non-smoker but it becomes an acquired taste after a point.\n\nBut just like smoking I don't think telling people about cancer risk is what gets them to stop - our brains don't operate rationally like that. It's just something that has to be detoxed out and once that's done the cravings go away too. And the fact is any addiction persists because it is filling some need, so finding out what the need is and what might be healthy coping strategies will probably make the most difference.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o4dvrf/deleted_my_200gb_porn_folder_leftunfollowed/h2h87hh/"}
