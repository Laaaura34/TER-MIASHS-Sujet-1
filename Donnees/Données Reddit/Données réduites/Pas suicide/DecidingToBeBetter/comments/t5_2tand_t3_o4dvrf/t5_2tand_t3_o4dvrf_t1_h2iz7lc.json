Cut it out. Whenever you feel like going back, remember the average age of entry into the \"business\" is 16yo and 60% of all pornography online is unvoluntary - either straight up created under coercion, or now hosted without the permission of the actors. It fries your brain, fucks up your perception of sex and of women, and gives you nothing but an erectile disfunction. I am a woman who got (like most of us) into watching it at extremely young, we never got a fighting chance. I quit. One of the most rewarding things in my life. My perception of self, of other women, of sex, all went back to normal and I am now only appalled whenever porn is mentioned. My sex life was good before, but it is perfect now. You'll start enjoying everything so much more, and explore what you're actually into, not what you're into in porn. Best of luck to you chief. You'll get there, and it will feel damn awesome. And if you fail at first, try again. Fail again. Fail better. Don't stop until you get there, because it is worth everything.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o4dvrf/deleted_my_200gb_porn_folder_leftunfollowed/h2iz7lc/"}
