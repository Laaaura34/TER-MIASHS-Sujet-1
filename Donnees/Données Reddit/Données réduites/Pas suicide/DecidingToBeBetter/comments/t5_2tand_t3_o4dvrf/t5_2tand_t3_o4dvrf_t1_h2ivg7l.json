I totally understand that these habits are formed early because let\u2019s be honest a 12 year old doesn\u2019t usually have the same options as an adult man when it comes to exploring sex.  I just wish we had more education about how we form habits and what effects they can have.  Let people have the opportunity to make informed decisions.\n\nI\u2019m so happy your relationship is doing well and I hope together you can shape it into something even better as you each make choices to live happier and healthier.  Relationship goals!  I hope some day I\u2019ll be lucky enough to be in a mutually supportive relationship \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o4dvrf/deleted_my_200gb_porn_folder_leftunfollowed/h2ivg7l/"}
