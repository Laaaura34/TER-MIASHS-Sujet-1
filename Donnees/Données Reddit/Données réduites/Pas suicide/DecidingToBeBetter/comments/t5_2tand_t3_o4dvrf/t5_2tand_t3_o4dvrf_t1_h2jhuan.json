I think part of the theory is that our basic life strains us, simply existing well takes energy and focus, so why have porn apps, pre rolled fatty blunts laying around half smoked, tons of liquor laying around, etc. if there are issues with will power in those areas? Sure it\u2019s \u201cnoble\u201d to say you can simply resist.. but is it efficient to create an environment in which you NEED to constantly fight yourself? If it isn\u2019t good and you don\u2019t want to do it, why not simply remove it from your life\n\nAnyway I see your points", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o4dvrf/deleted_my_200gb_porn_folder_leftunfollowed/h2jhuan/"}
