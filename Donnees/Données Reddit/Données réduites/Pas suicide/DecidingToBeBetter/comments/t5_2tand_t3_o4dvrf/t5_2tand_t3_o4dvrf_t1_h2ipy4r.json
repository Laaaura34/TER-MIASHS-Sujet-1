Thank you thank you thank you guys.  You give me hope.  Honestly got to thinking I\u2019d just have to be in lesbian relationships (I\u2019m bi so thankfully I do have a choice to avoid men if I want).\n\nTo be clear: I am not against sexual images in principle.  I\u2019m happy to make them!\n\nMy issue: I\u2019ve encountered so many relationships that have suffered terribly because of habitual (potential addiction) porn usage.\n\nMost recent partner claimed that no man these days doesn\u2019t masturbate to porn. Also considers sex not very enjoyable and from the day he lost his virginity over 20 years ago he\u2019s been disappointed.  Masturbation and his porn collection are sacred and he\u2019s absolutely fine with losing his relationship with me, who he still maintains is \u201cthe one\u201d he wants to spend the rest of his life with.  Just not as important as porn.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o4dvrf/deleted_my_200gb_porn_folder_leftunfollowed/h2ipy4r/"}
