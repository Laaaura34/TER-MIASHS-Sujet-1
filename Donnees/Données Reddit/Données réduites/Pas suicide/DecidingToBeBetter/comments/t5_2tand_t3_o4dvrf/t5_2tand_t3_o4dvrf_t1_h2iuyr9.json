Either way; luckily, we are still happily together and recently celebrated 8 years.\n\nFunny you mention you happy to make them, I am off the belief when done is the right circumstances, sharing nudes with some one you trust;  I imagine it\u2019s the heathiest porn out there; it\u2019s realistic and personal.\n\nThat\u2019s awful to hear your experiences with men, speaking to my friends we are all seem pretty addicted to it happens at such a young age; talking 12 years old or so.
