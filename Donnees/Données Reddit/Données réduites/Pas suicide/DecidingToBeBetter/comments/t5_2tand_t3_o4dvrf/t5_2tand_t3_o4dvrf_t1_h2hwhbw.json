I\u2019m proud!! I\u2019m 28 days clean of porn, weed, and beer, and I can say that it gets better. Just stick with it.\n\nI was on a date with someone the other day\u2026.and for someone that was completely sober, I had a blast and was honestly surprised that I could have fun without substances.\n\nI\u2019ve always been a little self conscious about my \u201cequipment\u201d and the fact that I shoot off in 5 seconds flat, but I\u2019m really good with oral. So when it came time to \u201cseal the deal\u201d, I started with some oral and moved to penetration, and as expected, I came in 5 seconds\u2026..but she didn\u2019t make me feel bad about it\u2026.she just told me to go back down on her and wait for round 2!\n\nRemember that porn is a show, and for someone to just be drilling and drilling for a half hour straight is unrealistic\u2026..that scene probably took a few takes to finish.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o4dvrf/deleted_my_200gb_porn_folder_leftunfollowed/h2hwhbw/"}
