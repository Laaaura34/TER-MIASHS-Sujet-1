I do feel like i\u2019m pressuring myself but still i can\u2019t get it out of my system. \n\nYoga is okay? Compared to those intense exercises that I can\u2019t for the life of me do those actual stuff. That\u2019s why i settled on Yoga for at least some sort of fitness i can do because my immune system these days isn\u2019t as strong as before I can feel it. \n\nWhen i meant study it\u2019s more on self study not an actual degree. It\u2019s not necessary to my job or anything but I\u2019ve tried to analyze how my career and salary progression in my field would be and it\u2019s quite small. I know someone with 2x the years of experience but i earn higher in the same position, i don\u2019t want to be that person in the long run and the only way i can see solving that is shifting to a different work altogether. I know i\u2019m not going to be happy where i am now because i find myself never having money for leisure stuff. I literally work just to pay bills and that\u2019s not a life that i want. And there\u2019s so much responsibility that i\u2019ll have in the next years that i don\u2019t know how i\u2019ll afford it. \n\nI\u2019m 24. Which i know is young but it always feels like i\u2019m running out of time you know? It\u2019s just there\u2019s these people who seem to get their shit together and can do all these things so why can\u2019t i?\n\nValorant the first fps game i\u2019ve ever played so not good with comparison but i\u2019ve been enjoying it since the start of the year.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oyfix8/how_to_instill_discipline_or_get_out_of_research/h7t85cx/"}
