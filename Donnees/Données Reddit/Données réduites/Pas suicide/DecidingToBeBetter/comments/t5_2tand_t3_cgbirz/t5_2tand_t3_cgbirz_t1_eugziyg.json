Let alone $200 a week. I\u2019m guessing OP comes from a wealthy family and doesn\u2019t really have the same need for saving money as most other people. I.e. OP\u2019s saving will probably go towards a fun trip rather than a rainy day fund for when they can\u2019t meet this month\u2019s bills or their crappy car breaks down. Still a great habit and OP doesn\u2019t seem like a bad person by any means just maybe a bit unaware that a $200 dollar a week allowance is quite unheard of and a privilege I\u2019m sure we all wished we had.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cgbirz/i_started_saving_100week_every_week_since_june/eugziyg/"}
