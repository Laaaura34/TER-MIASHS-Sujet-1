The capitalistic work culture and the \u201cbenefits\u201d from working all the time are bullshit (besides not having to worry about money, but if you\u2019re balls deep, working hard and making money in the system, you\u2019re probably already addicted to the money and that sucks). I think we can all agree on that. \n\nAs far a as fame goes, people like to be recognized and praised for their achievements. Fame is the ultimate recognition, which basically says you have mastered what you are passionate about and people love your work. Everyone wants that to some degree, whether it be on the international level or from friends, family, and acquaintances. We are a species who wants to be accepted by others. With that said, there seem to be many, many consequences of fame, but that can be said for anything in life (there\u2019s always something). \n\nWhat I want and I think most of us want is recognition for the work that we care about, and enough money to never have to work a piece of shit job ever again. I don\u2019t really care about fame, but it does seem nice, as long as it\u2019s not some over the top superstardom where I can\u2019t go out without being recognized. That would suck! but I want to be praised for my passions and I don\u2019t want to work shit jobs anymore because I finally realized, my life is pretty good. The most depressing thing about my life right now is going to \u201cwork,\u201d which is really just a distraction from doing work I want to do for myself to become who I want to be for better or worse (hopefully for better, but again, there\u2019s always something). \ud83d\udc4d", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nv7r3j/dont_want_to_be_rich_and_famous_anymore/h128e6z/"}
