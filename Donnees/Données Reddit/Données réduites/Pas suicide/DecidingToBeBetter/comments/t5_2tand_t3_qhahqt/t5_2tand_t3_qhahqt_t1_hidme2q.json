I could relate to some of those feelings you described, from my undergraduate years, but as none of our experiences are entirely the same I am sure I cannot fully understand how've things been for you. Nonetheless, let me share a few things that helped me.. I know not all tricks work on everyone the same way, maybe you will come across something which works better for you.  \n\n\nOne of the problems I had at the start of the Uni was that I didn't socialise enough. That meant that I spent a great deal of my time in my room watching a lot of TV shows. That didn't particularly help me being productive at home. Another problem I had was that I didn't schedule in time for me to relax. It could be as simple as going on a walk or just grabing an ice-cream or a cup of tea listening to some soothing music. The absence of that meant that I always felt on edge with work and exhausted with very little motivation.  \n\n\nSo what helped me was having some sort of a plan for the day before the day starts. In my case, a lot of it was in my head, I hardly ever wrote it down. The important part is sticking to it. Also, the schedule doesn't have to be a burden. If I need to take a nap in the afternoon, sure I can put that in my schedule. If I need some time to do the most random thing that come to my mind on that day; sure I could allocate some time do that too. What's important to note is that we have to give ourselves something they desire in order for ourselves to have the energy to do daily not so exciting but crucial tasks.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qhahqt/university_consuming_my_life_how_do_i_manage_my/hidme2q/"}
