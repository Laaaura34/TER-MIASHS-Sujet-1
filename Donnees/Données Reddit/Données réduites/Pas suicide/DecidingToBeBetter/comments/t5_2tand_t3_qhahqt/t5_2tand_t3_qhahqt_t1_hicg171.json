I think of something the night before and say I have to be out the door by 10 or I won't have time to do it. I limit that time to less than one hour.  Then when I get back I say I will work for a half hour and see what I can get done. Usually just getting started helps and leads to a lot more than 30 minutes of work. If you can keep the routine up for 4-5 days a week you will be productive and hopefully feel like you can take some time off. Mental breaks are important.  Exercise may help as well. Doesn't have to be a lot. Just walking and fresh air helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qhahqt/university_consuming_my_life_how_do_i_manage_my/hicg171/"}
