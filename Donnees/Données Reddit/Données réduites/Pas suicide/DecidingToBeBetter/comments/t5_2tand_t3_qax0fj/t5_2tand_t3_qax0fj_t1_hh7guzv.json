I'm imagining it's something you wrote a few months from now.\n\n***My whole life I\u2019ve always had jobs that I never really cared about that I took just to be able to pay the bills. I\u2019ve always been living paycheck to paycheck for as long as I can remember. There\u2019s even been a point where I was making less than what I owed for rent and bills. I\u2019ve applied to hundreds of better paying jobs and I\u2019d get interviews but I\u2019d never get far enough to get a job offer.***\n\n***Until now! I found a job that I was actually excited about. I read a book on how to improve your resume and interview skills. I got the interview AND the job!***\n\nYou're around books all the time so you'll have easy access to books like the one she mentioned.\n\nThe path forward is...\n\n1) read up on improving your resume and interviewing\n\n2) apply for better paying jobs where you live and also outside of where you live\n\n3) interview for jobs\n\n4) decline job offers \n\n5) accept a job offer\n\n*...I'm scared of trying....* I know what you mean which is why I'm making you a guarantee.  While you're doing 1-4... I guarantee you'll be able to go back to the life you had before you started trying.\n\nI'm going to comment on the post I just quoted so you'll be able to find it if you care to read the whole thing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qax0fj/i_feel_like_ive_wasted_my_time_and_my_skills_how/hh7guzv/"}
