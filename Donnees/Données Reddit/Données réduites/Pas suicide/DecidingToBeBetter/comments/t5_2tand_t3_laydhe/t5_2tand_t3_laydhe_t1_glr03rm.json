It's almost counter intuitive, people say the you'll be happy if you learn to detach yourself and live in the moment.\n\nMaybe that works for some people, but working towards an almost unrealistic goal has made me much happier than detachment. It's less about achieving the goal and more about the process of working towards it every day.\n\nStarting is by far the hardest part, but once you notice progress, it'll become addictive. Scientifically, people with more dopamine receptors need things to work towards. Dopamine is released every time you make that bit of progress, without that it's easy to turn to drugs and other addictions to compensate", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/laydhe/never_stop_learning_always_seek_continual/glr03rm/"}
