It's mostly women in the organization. I feel that they have alot to teach me still. The job isn't my dream job but it's a huge hospital which would look great on my resume. I also report directly to the VP of Corporate Services so having a VP as a reference is huge. I agree with all of your points. I eventually will forgive him for my own personal growth anyways so the memories will not be as painful. My sisters are a 4 hour drive which I don't mind making down there once a month.
