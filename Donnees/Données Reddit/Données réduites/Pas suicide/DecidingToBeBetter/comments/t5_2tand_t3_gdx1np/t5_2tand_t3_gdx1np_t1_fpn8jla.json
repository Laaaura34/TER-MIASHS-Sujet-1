It completely changed how I view alcohol. It's a hormone that is released when we drink. It's sole purpose is to dull the alcohol high - your body wants to return to a sober state. When we drink often, dynorphen builds up in our system and dulls life. Natural highs are harder to come by because you have all this dynorphen in your system. But alcohol gives you that high, so we only enjoy life again while we drink. It took me months, it seemed, to return to a point where I enjoyed small things again as I worked the dynorphen out of my system. The prospect of drinking is far less attractive when I think about losing the joy I feel snuggling my 9 year old or feeling sunshine on my face. I wouldn't trade that contentment for anything.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gdx1np/officially_a_year_sober_today_from_alcohol_this/fpn8jla/"}
