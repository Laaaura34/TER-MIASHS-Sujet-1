One night outside the 99c Store I'm starving haven't eaten in days and the store's about to close. I approach this elderly gentleman and just hit him up for food. He was so amazingly cool about it. I told him I'm not asking for money I'm just asking for some broccoli and hummus. And he takes me in the store and buys me a bunch of greens and totally blesses the hell out of me. We had this super long conversation outside the store. Anyways, he's one of those Christians that don't speak about it. The rare ones (maybe they're just low-key and so you don't really notice that many of them) that just live a life of humble service and refuses all doctrinal disputes and chooses only to see the similarities. Anyways, we had this soul dialogue and the things he said to me were exactly what you said. Reconnect with the religion of your ancestors. Seek out the elders of your church and approach them with your story. They'll tell you what to do. Reconnect with your people. I'm doing good these days and I still call him on the phone every couple weeks and check in and let him know I'm doing alright. He tells me I'm the best grandson he's ever had. One in a fucking million I tell you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gdx1np/officially_a_year_sober_today_from_alcohol_this/fpqne9f/"}
