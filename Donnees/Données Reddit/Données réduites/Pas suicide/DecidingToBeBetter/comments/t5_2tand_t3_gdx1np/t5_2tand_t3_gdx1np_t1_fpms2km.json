It broke me in a way and made me reevaluate a lot of things in my life, one of them being my drinking. Not to say that was the one and only thing that made me wake up but it was the straw that broke the camels back for me so to say. The thing that kept me clean was finding religion again and reconnecting with an old friend of mine who was getting sober at the time as well.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gdx1np/officially_a_year_sober_today_from_alcohol_this/fpms2km/"}
