My husband and I tried to quit and relapsed countless times.  Would have died or been arrested at any point.  In between binges I was drunk and asked a neighbor to sponsor me.  Saved our lives.  I just hit 6 months and it's just now FINALLY getting a bit easier - the fantasies aren't present every second, I'm starting to have natural emotions like \"slightly happy\" now and again.  Anhedonia is a bitch!  Best wishes to you, stay strong, make that call before you use next time.  You got this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n2oegt/relapsed_n_sober_again_from_ice/gwmzap8/"}
