I loved my job so much, I ate well, my body was amazing, I worked out and saw friends all the time. I was veryyy happy. All that was lost to me, started drinking daily to cope with the sudden changes, then gained and lost my happiest relationship yet. Basically I have a sh*t ton of material for review in therapy lol. Im just focusing on one thing at a time. Being alcohol free, eating well, caring for the relationships I have. Exercise comes next. Just one ingredient at a time. So! I know the feeling youre describing intricately and I promise you can do it too! Just aim for adding back in one thing each day, whether its five minutes or two hours. You absolutely can do this!! Youve already proved it, so why not prove it a second time just for fun? \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc9c", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ot3vxn/i_want_to_be_the_me_that_i_know_i_can_but_im/h6sty56/"}
