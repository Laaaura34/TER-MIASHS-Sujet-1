Noone knows 100% that God exists whether they say they do or not.. it comes down to philosophical reasoning, way of life, and faith that God does exist. Faith is not some end all conclusion. It is a personal decision to weigh the options and conclude there is something more. If you put faith in something, you aren't believing there is proof of an outcome but rather that you are surrendering to the belief the outcome will be favorable. Where religion comes into the mix is in your practice. How you choose to live and honor what you believe to be the way a higher power would want you to. \n\nI'd suggest with reading and learning as suggested by others here. Learn everything you can and let your beliefs take form through your learning. You can't just flip a switch and believe in something.  It has to come naturally through study of theology and philosophy (excluding blind faith and life altering experiences). \n\nWhen it really comes down to it though, we all have our own views and thoughts on the matter and while you may be able to take advice or learn some here, it is ultimately up to you to put in the work.
