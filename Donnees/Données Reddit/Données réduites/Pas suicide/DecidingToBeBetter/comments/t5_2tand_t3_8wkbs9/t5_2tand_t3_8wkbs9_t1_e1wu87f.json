Religion is super comforting: you'll get to see everyone you've ever loved who has died, you won't have to die (die being used here as a synonym for not exist), everything is leading to a purpose designed by someone vastly more intelligent and benevolent than yourself or anyone else. Not to mention there's a ton of social benefits that come with being religious.\n\nBut I can't make myself unsee everything that doesn't make sense about it. I've actually tried and for me there's really no getting past the things that either don't have supporting evidence, have strong contradictory evidence, or that are just plain inconsistent.\n\nWhen it comes to the brevity of life and finality of death, I just try not to think about it (far easier said than done). When it comes to lack of extrinsic meaning, I try to make my own. I'm still trying to figure out the social things though.\n\nIf you want something that hasn't really been explained by science that might give you some comfort, look into qualia. Qualia is one of the things that I can't really make sense of in a completely materialistic worldview. If the mind and the brain aren't synonymous then there's a chance that they can exist independently. This doesn't give positive evidence for life after death and it also may just be that we aren't thinking about qualia correctly and it really can be explained materialistically. But if nothing else, it might help with the discomfort because at the very least nothing good comes from worrying about something you have no power to control.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8wkbs9/hard_time_trying_to_find_religion/e1wu87f/"}
