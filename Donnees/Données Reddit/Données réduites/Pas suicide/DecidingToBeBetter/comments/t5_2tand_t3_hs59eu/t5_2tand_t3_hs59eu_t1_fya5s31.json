I left S. Media 2 years ago, no apps on phone, no log ins from computer, laptops, deleted accounts and trust me life is so much better without it. There is way too much information thrown at you, too much emotions happiness, sorrows, envy, jealousy in FB, IG etc that make a common soul sick and depressed. There is nothing as controlled usage of SM. Life without it altogether is better. \nTo go after it, live your real life to the fullest.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hs59eu/minding_my_own_business_has_brought_me_so_much/fya5s31/"}
