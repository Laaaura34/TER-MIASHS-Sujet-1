Snap chat just started feeling empty because all you do is see what others are up to along with too many ads and click bait. Instagram just got exhausting to get on along with it feeling like a drug like you have to be on it so you dont miss out. Its not going anywhere.\n\nTwitter can get toxic alot as well but I still like it. I'm more on Reddit than I use to be because its just a different feeling using it and you can filter everything unlike the other two. Its just more civilized here. Theres no drama or anything or people who just think completely irrational and ignorant which really pollutes twitter. As a result I spend more time on here than being on twitter and ig all day. I like all of them still but I don't find my self on them much as I use to (everyday) because it's exhausting since you're always gonna run into ignorance or someone's irrational mindset.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hs59eu/minding_my_own_business_has_brought_me_so_much/fy9wopg/"}
