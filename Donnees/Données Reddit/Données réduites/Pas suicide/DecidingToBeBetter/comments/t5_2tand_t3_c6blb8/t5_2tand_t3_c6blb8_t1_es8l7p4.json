Make sure you're calm whilst doing it. (You don't want to be thinking 'do I look weird right now' while the other person is talking) (not easy)\n\nFocus your attention more on staying calm and actually focusing on and retaining what they're are saying, rather than tripping yourself up in your own head. (not saying it's easy. Takes work)  maintain the eye contact, slight head nod or even a smile after major points to let them know you're retaining the info they are giving you. \n\nThose small body language confirmations every 5-10-20 seconds (head nod, smile) will also fill in some \"just standing there\" time. \n\nPractice with one of your friends you trust. Apply this and allow them to give you pointers. Takes practice like anything, but you got this!\n\nBest of luck", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/c6blb8/eye_contact_additional_exploration_thanks_to_the/es8l7p4/"}
