I\u2019m drunk af rn, sad and alone. It\u2019s the best I\u2019ve felt in a week lol. I just know if I get drunk tomorrow it won\u2019t work the same, so I\u2019ll workout instead. \n\n(Sorry if im rambling) I always feel like addicts who choose to completely quit are giving in to their addictive tendencies and deciding they cannot beat their addiction, but instead they change their addiction to something worthwhile like religion or family or their job. You feel happy being addicted to a \u201cpositive\u201d thing instead of drugs. Is this accurate? Sorry if I\u2019m being offensive I honestly don\u2019t mean to be, please be sober if it helps you be better!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g5lq6z/seven_months_off_booze_today/fo5vult/"}
