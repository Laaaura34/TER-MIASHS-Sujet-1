It\u2019s funny because truthfully the whole point is that through acceptance, letting go comes in certain ways. But I\u2019ve also found for me that I\u2019ll never really let go of grieving my dad, and I don\u2019t want to because it\u2019s part of my life and I just learn to live alongside the grief instead of rejecting or repressing it (which i did on the passing of my first dad). It\u2019s the heavy focus on letting go that always trips me up.\n\nThis is also my own experience and advice based on my own perspective but it might not work for other people :). Not everything is one-size-fits-all which is the hard part about sharing my own antidotes & realizations. \n\nThank you for reading and for your thoughtful comment!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l8bdje/instead_of_focusing_on_letting_go_focus_on/gldc6iu/"}
