I\u2019m speaking on feelings mostly. \n\nAnger is always the easiest emotion and it\u2019s our job to sort out where the anger is coming from. This annoying and painstaking practice is lifelong but becomes easier with practice. For instance, living with trauma and reacting in the mindset of trauma is comfortable because it\u2019s sometimes all we know so falling back into past anger patterns is comfy and becomes almost exhilarating but in the end is exhausting and it\u2019s just playing the victim complex. It\u2019s a constant struggle with your own mind but honestly gets better and easier to deal with with time and practice. \n\nSorry if this was totally off the mark but I needed/wanted to say that. Glad you\u2019re doing well and hope we can all learn something from each other\u2019s journey:)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l8bdje/instead_of_focusing_on_letting_go_focus_on/glcpntu/"}
