I think there are several factors but most notably 1. We as humans tend to have a problem with losing something, ending something, \"letting go\" 2. Its kind of a paradox because if you want to get rid of something, you throw it away, ignore it, something like that, and its gone. But by focusing on what we want to get rid of we do the exact opposite.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt works with trash because you can focus on the bag, put it in the bin and then its gone. But if this thing is stuck in your brain, you just do the opposite: Fixating on it with no option to get physically rid of it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can only confirm that the more you think about stopping or quitting something, the harder it gets. The day i just did everything to not think about cigarettes is the day i was able to stop, because it just didnt cross my mind anymore and if it did, it was just for a short time and i could brush it off by doing something else.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l8bdje/instead_of_focusing_on_letting_go_focus_on/gldkhh3/"}
