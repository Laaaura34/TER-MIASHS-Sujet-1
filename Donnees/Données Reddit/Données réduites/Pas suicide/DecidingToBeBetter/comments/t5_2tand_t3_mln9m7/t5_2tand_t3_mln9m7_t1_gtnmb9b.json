You can't just sit around all day being negative about your situation. If you do something wrong, you shouldn't say things like \"oh I wish I could go back\" or \"I'm so stupid\" you should try to change it to things like, \"I may have failed, but that dosent make me stupid, everyone messes up.\" And when you do good on something, even of its small, congratulate yourself.\n Its really about believing in yourself and changing your mindset. It may sound like what a lot of people might say, but it really does help. \n For awhile, I didn't use any coping skills or try to change my mindset because I thought it was childish. Then when I got sent to the ward, I stopped caring about what they thought because I was going to live with these people and they were going to see me at my worst. So I finally started doing it.\n When I got home I just continued to try to not care about what others think. It's a little harder when you're not constantly around the same people, but its so much of a relief to do what I'm comfortable with and not do something because I think someone else will like it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mln9m7/after_getting_out_of_the_psych_ward_im_doing_a/gtnmb9b/"}
