I have one of those, too (25M), and I don't think is less manly than a rude, bearded one, just a different kind of masculinity.\n\nRoutines are hard, so I would recommend you trying some stuff you wanted to do before, or you find interesting. Maybe the first one or the first ten ones doesn't work for you, but is a good way to explore yourself: maybe catch on reading, trying to learn some language, start working out (or just going for walks); those are just some ideas.\n\nAnd finally, about love... Love is hard, in all is forms. And I don't only mean loving itself, but understanding what love is depends on the person. You can love a partner, your family or your pet, those are different ways of love. If you're talking about romantic love it could be even harder. Keep in mind some people are aromantic (don't experience romantic attraction), or are in that spectrum (rarely experience it).\n\nThe second best advice I could give you is this one: don't be too hard on yourself. Right now you've reached for help, and that's a great step! Now try to go on, little by little, and I'm sure things will eventually go better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hu7i42/ive_recently_deleted_almost_all_my_social_media/fyle2sa/"}
