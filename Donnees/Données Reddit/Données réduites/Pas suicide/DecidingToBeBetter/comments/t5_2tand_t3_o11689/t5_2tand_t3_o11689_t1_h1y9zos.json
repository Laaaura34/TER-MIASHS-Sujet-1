I think it's good to ask your therapist for advice on this, but there is 1 tip that I find very useful that you can try out yourself: \n\nWhenever I have triggers or thoughts that I know are not beneficial for myself, I sometimes remind myself that they are not relevant or true, but this doesn't always help because it can get me to analyze the whole situation. What I like to do instead is to take 1 or 3 deep breaths in and out instead. Telling your body/mind to calm down can be difficult for me, but if I just focus on the actual physiological processes, it helps. Your body will naturally calm down a bit more, and our body & mind are obviously connected. \n\nJust set an intention to try it out for a day or so, and then reflect on whether that helped or not. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o11689/is_there_a_methodworksheet_similar_to_journaling/h1y9zos/"}
