Because right now my anxiety might be a lot worse than usual because I just finished uni and don't have a job yet, so I'm basically home all day everyday (except for occasional shoppings, walks and short trips like these), and I'm even alone for half of the day because all my family is working.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o11689/is_there_a_methodworksheet_similar_to_journaling/h1yclub/"}
