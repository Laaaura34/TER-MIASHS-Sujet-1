You are living proof  of what it\u2019s like to push through limiting beliefs and excel to your fullest potential. Congrats friend!  Your progress is incredible!! \n\nI sometimes oscillate between thinking I can get to my greatest potential and being slapped with reality that I just don\u2019t cut it. I know you mentioned that anyone can succeed if they put their mind to it.  But do you think that there are some people who just are not able to, even if they do try their hardest?  \n\nI envision myself succeeding higher levels in my career but when I encounter people are at a higher intelligence than I, I rob myself of that belief in myself.  I work in a hospital laboratory by the way.  Even though I have a burning energy within me to reach higher levels (managerial/business reaches), I look at those younger sharper coworkers (they in their 25s, me 35) and think to myself \u201cI\u2019m not as cut out as and such, my comprehension isn\u2019t as shaper, Im too slow to arrive at understanding.\u201d Obviously, I surfer form of limiting belief syndrome and the awfulness of comparing.  Would welcome some feedback. \n\nIve was always been the hard working type, which is why your post resonated with me. I went to to community college, transfers to a university, did post bac education in medical lab science.  Everything was hard studying.  I\u2019m good at the doing and get challenged with more thought provoking stuff.  Pointers please!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfd9y7/a_decade_ago_i_was_kicked_out_of_college_with_a/fpuxwle/"}
