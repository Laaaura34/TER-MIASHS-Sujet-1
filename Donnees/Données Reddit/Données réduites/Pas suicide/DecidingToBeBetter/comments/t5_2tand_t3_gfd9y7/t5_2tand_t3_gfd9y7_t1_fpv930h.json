Just put your  head down, put the work in, and stay focused. It\u2019s so clich\u00e9, but I now  firmly believe that anyone can accomplish anything if they put their  mind to it.\n\nYou had a lot of good opportunities line up for you which you took advantage of and it turned into something good to push you forward. What bothers me is that I try and constantly hit walls and it is hard to build the confidence needed to get me where I want to be when I keep hitting walls. I think when I finally get to succeed I won't tell people that because I succeeded they can too because everyone that tries hard doesn't necessarily succeed, there are many hard workers who didn't ever get to reach where they wanted to in life because things didn't align to their favour even though they might have tried hard.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfd9y7/a_decade_ago_i_was_kicked_out_of_college_with_a/fpv930h/"}
