I'm in the same position trying to fix my shit too, excuse my language. But I honestly wish nothing but the best for you and your future. I currently don't have a degree at the moment, but I will, and I promise that to myself. This is my 1st semester and I thankfully will pass 3 classes out 4. It's not the best that I did but I tried, and that's what's the important, I believe. Once again, good luck out there.
