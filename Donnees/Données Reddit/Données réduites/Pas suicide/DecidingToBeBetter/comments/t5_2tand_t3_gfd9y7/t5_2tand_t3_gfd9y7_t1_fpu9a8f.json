Congratulations and thank you for sharing! This gave me hope just when I needed it.\n\nI'm in a pretty similar situation, just on different timelines. \n\n\\-Party/weed centered since I started college in 2016. \n\n\\-Continually missed opportunities and squandered classes due to fear of failure. Like you were saying, subconsciously, if you didn't try you couldn't fail. Meanwhile you know from the 100s of self-improvement threads that the failing = the learning.\n\n\\-I was just crying this morning reading my gpa (lower than 0.9 with 2 failing classes to be graded). I promise I'm not trying to have a reverse pissing match with this one.\n\n\\-Let myself go after working really hard to lose 75 pounds a few years ago. |P.s. holy cow 130 lbs in 10-11 months??? You're a beast\n\n\\-Vaping addiction with cigarettes sprinkled in the span of the past 5 years.\n\n\\-Read all of the emails I should have read for the past month and some change. Didn't even bother to open the outlook app until today.\n\n\\-Haven't drank alcohol in the past 2 weeks though.\n\nSorry for the length, but I felt touched by your story and had to comment. Thank you again kind sir. You're a true inspiration!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfd9y7/a_decade_ago_i_was_kicked_out_of_college_with_a/fpu9a8f/"}
