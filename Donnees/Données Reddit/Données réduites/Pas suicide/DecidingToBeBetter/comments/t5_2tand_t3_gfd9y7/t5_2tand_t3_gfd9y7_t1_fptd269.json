The US Patent and Trademark office has a special \u2018patent bar\u2019 that you have to be approved to even sit for. It requires a significant science-based background, like an EE degree. After you pass, you can prosecute patents before the USPTO (or be a USPTO Examiner). \nInterestingly, you don\u2019t have to be a lawyer to sit for the patent bar\u2014passing without being a lawyer makes you a \u2018patent agent\u2019. Those people often but not always go to law school. On the other side, there\u2019s no \u2018trademark bar\u2019, but you do have to be an attorney to prosecute trademarks before the USPTO (or be the trademark owner, which is rare and often doesn\u2019t end well).", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfd9y7/a_decade_ago_i_was_kicked_out_of_college_with_a/fptd269/"}
