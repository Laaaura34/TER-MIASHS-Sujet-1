I barely passed high school, failed out of college...... twice, and changed my major 6 times. I took some time to get some experience, something, ANYTHING that can give me a sense of direction. I started sweeping floors for an automotive supplying company. After 4 years of my best, I got my biggest promotion to have higher pay and a job in the office, which opened up a lot more options and curiosity. During this time, I got diagnosed with ADHD and once I started to cope with it, it changed everything. Improved study habits, prioritization, time mgmt., and focus. Finding systems to implement to make life easier and more organized helps a ton, too. I\u2019m a huge believer that it\u2019s never too late, however, I also realized that I better take my first step soon at 26, because I know this would be a lot harder later in life when I have a family, and life simply still has to happen. So, at 26, I took my first step and enrolled. To some, this is terrible, but to me, I\u2019ve never had above a 3.0. So receiving a 3.2 my first year felt amazing and I can only improve from there! \n\nRemember people, our cerebral cortex doesn\u2019t fully develop until 25. Your past does not define you. It\u2019s never too late!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfd9y7/a_decade_ago_i_was_kicked_out_of_college_with_a/fptlriz/"}
