My story feels similar to yours. I am giving myself the next year to make it into med school. Otherwise, I am unsure of what endeavors are available for me in life. I am 26, always thinking it's too late. Perhaps because I'm always comparing myself to other people; I've always inherently done that due to my upbringing. However, I'm slowly learning that it's a personal race, and not one against others.\n\nAt the same time, the personal race is dreadful. Your story will be a reminder to me to keep pushing forward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCoincidentally, cold turkey-ed cigarettes today myself.
