I'm finally getting out in December, have applied to a great program (aerospace engineering) at a great school (Embry-Riddle Daytona) that I'm not even sure they'll take me, but I've always wanted to go there since I was a kid and study this and go into the space industry, so I figured why the hell not. My fianc\u00e9 dumped me 6 weeks ago, saying he didn't really love me when he proposed, and that completely changedvmy plans moving forward in my life.\n\nI've decided that he's more of a slingshot to me at this point. He dumped me and pulled me back for a few weeks, but now I've got this motivation in me to finally chase my dreams, and that's him letting go of the slingshot and me shooting forward, no matter what. I can do whatever I desire now. \n\nI have over 200 credit hours, no degree, loads of debt, but I've got the motivation and study skills now. \n\nI'll be 32 when I (hopefully) start school again in January, and in a couple of years, I hope to finally graduate with a degree at 35...16ish years after I started.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfd9y7/a_decade_ago_i_was_kicked_out_of_college_with_a/fptvh6e/"}
