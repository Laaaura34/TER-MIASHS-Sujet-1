I graduated college a year late with a drug problem and a 2.5 GPA, went straight to law school, and ended up dropping out in the middle of my second semester after a series of panic attacks and being diagnosed bipolar.

Your post reminded me that anything is possible so thank you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfd9y7/a_decade_ago_i_was_kicked_out_of_college_with_a/fptzy4n/"}
