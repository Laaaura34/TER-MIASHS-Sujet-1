I've been really freaked about leaving my job before five years and losing out on amazing vesting rights in order to get a master's and travel a bit before I wanna have kids. And going to school again terrifies me since I'm terrible at most testing. I also gained weight during covid and have never looked like this in my life. Thanks for sharing your story. I don't really know what's in store, but Im gunna start just going for it and talk to my boss next week about an education/career plan. And I'm trying to run more. Got a Fitbit and that shit is motivating.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfd9y7/a_decade_ago_i_was_kicked_out_of_college_with_a/g8v9iro/"}
