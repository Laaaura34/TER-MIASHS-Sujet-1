Currently trying this myself. But went to college twice when I was 20 then 21. Failed out both, kept partying. Became an alcoholic, lost a girl, got kicked out of a house me and my best friend rented. Found a girl. Kept drinking. Joined the guard thinking it'd set me straight, kept drinking though Went awol, left the country for a month, drank the whole time. Came back, had a child with a girl that is still with me to this day. Finally quit that shit, deployed, ets'd a couple weeks back, now starting college this summer at 32 years old. Never to late dude. Keep it up. We got this buddy.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfd9y7/a_decade_ago_i_was_kicked_out_of_college_with_a/fptze5h/"}
