I had the same issue as you said, afraid of failling. I was so afraid that I didn\u2019t even try. For 2 years, I skipped all my classes and lied to my family and friends about it every single day. I was so depressed. All I can do is hiding in my room and eat. I couldn\u2019t sleep at night because I don\u2019t want another day to come. Eventually, I just couldn\u2019t do this any more and I finally came clean to my parents and friends. I have to return home because I have spent too much money on this. Although my parents were obviously upset and disappointed, they didn\u2019t give up on me and I was very fortunate that my uncle offered me a job in a small local company. Today, I still do not hold a degree but I finally have a career. I am making decent money. I can pay some back every month to my parents and I can afford myself. Looking back still aches my heart but I have learnt to accept and forgive myself. Thank you for sharing your story. I hope there are many fun and exciting adventures await you in the next decade. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfd9y7/a_decade_ago_i_was_kicked_out_of_college_with_a/fpu0bbu/"}
