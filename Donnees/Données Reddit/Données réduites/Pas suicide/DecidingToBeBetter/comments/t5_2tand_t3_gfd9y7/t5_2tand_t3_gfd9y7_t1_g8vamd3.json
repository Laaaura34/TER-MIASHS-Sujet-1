But you being unhappy is not going to keep her happy. Take some steps to either patch it up (couples counseling) or move forward on separate paths. You feel stuck but it doesn't have to stay that way. It's a hard thing to do and you're a good person for not wanting to abandon them, but it sounds like the relationship is going south unless you do something about it where you both can be happy together or apart. So go have an honest convo with them and figure out what path you want to try. And then try to focus on you. 40 has a lot of life left. Like a lot.

You got a shit load of time left. Spend it wisely and take steps to make yourself happy. Even if their small ones at first.
