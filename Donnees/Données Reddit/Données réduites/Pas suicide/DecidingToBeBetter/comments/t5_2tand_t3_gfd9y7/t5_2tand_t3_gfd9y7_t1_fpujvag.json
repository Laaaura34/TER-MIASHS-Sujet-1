Other problems would have risen, and the grass might seem greener, but it likely is not. you are ready to do the challenge ahead of you now, so focus on that, and ultimately if you have got through that stuff that was holding you back you must really want it - congratulations, that is a lot of drive waiting to be used.\n\nLastly, the experiences that are tempted to be seen as a 'waste of time' were not. you learnt something from having been through them, they have given you a wider perspective that will help you in your future, and hopefully help others around you. To help understand what i mean, we can put it in college terms; i spent 1 - 2 years doing comp sci stuff, i change degree, was my learning in comp sci wasted? no, its really helped give me a mathematical knowledge, a thought process that is concept driven, and more. So too were your experiences readying you for what you faced next. you ll be okay, be in the present, learn from the past, look to the future, but most importantly be in the present.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfd9y7/a_decade_ago_i_was_kicked_out_of_college_with_a/fpujvag/"}
