You don\u2019t have a clue.\n\nThe money you make after going to a top tier school is easily enough to pay your *student loans*. Are you joking? Most pay them off in a year or two.

There is a reason people pay this much.\n\n> Not sure why you think people from Harvard don't hate their jobs. I mingled with plenty of HYS grads at my clerkship and most of them were as miserable there as the rest of us were.\n\nThe difference is they will retire when they are 40 and you\u2019ll be lucky to retire at all. Also they could have literally any job they want, and they likely just chose one that is super high paying but unenjoyable.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfd9y7/a_decade_ago_i_was_kicked_out_of_college_with_a/fpu2u1g/"}
