I was attending a university for computer science, but due to working vast amounts of overtime and having a baby I took a hiatus. That was in 2017, I am planning on returning to college this fall!  I don\u2019t think people understand how hard it is to work a laborer job and go to school part time.  I go to work at 6 am, work ten hour shifts 4 days sometimes 5 days a week.  This gives me so much motivation thank you for your post!!! Can\u2019t wait till I\u2019ll get out of this shitty circumstance!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfd9y7/a_decade_ago_i_was_kicked_out_of_college_with_a/fptzkmt/"}
