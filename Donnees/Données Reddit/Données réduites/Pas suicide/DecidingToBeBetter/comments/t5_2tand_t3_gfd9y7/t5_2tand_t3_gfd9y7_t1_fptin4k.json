I decided to go back to school after being academically disqualified from engineering school several years ago. I love my new school and have straight A's (except Python, damn it). I wish more people talked about how maturity can change your outlook towards schooling and being in the right program at the right school can change everything. Congratulations!!! You did it!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfd9y7/a_decade_ago_i_was_kicked_out_of_college_with_a/fptin4k/"}
