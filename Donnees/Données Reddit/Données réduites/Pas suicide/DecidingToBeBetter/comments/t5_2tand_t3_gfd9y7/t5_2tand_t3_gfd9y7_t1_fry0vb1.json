Although I can\u2019t compare my situation to yours, I\u2019m really stuck in regards to personal and career growth. All thanks to God, I do have a loving family and a loving partner, but I\u2019ve botched up my studies and career. It\u2019s taken me five years to complete a three year bachelor degree, and I\u2019ve failed a total of 7 out 12 subjects. I\u2019m currently on my last two but I fear I\u2019ll fail them too.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to get out of the rut I\u2019m in. I can\u2019t bring myself to do it.
