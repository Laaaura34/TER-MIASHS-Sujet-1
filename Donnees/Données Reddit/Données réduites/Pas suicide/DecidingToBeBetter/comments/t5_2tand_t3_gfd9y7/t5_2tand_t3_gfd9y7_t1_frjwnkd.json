Age discrimination, regardless of what laws are in place or how much a company claims they do not discriminate based on age, does still exist because of reasonable concerns about longetivity. It may be wrong to believe it's too late, but it is definitely not stupid... Especially when you know age is a factor. I would agree that any person should continue to better themself by continuing to expand upon their knowledge, but pursuing a degree in the hopes that maybe it \"isn't too late\" definitely does not seem wise. Especially if you're going to be putting yourself in more debt without any guarantee of seeing a return on your investment. If someone can find and afford the time and financing for it, then I say go do it. But if they are going to be putting forth massive effort and making sacrifices (some, or most, of which are not going to be small) then they better be sure it will pay off. I'm not trying to put a negative tone to this post. I think it is a very positive notion. But as someone who is speaking from experience, it is also important to make life decisions such as this based off of practicality, good planning,  and reasoning. I would wish anyone luck with their endeavors, but I would also tell them that they shouldn't just do it because someone else had success and said \"it's never too late.\"", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfd9y7/a_decade_ago_i_was_kicked_out_of_college_with_a/frjwnkd/"}
