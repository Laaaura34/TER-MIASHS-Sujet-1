After school I started making $17k/year and it was a life changing figure. I had enough extra money I could subscribe to some cooking magazines and dive back in to hobbies. I was down to working working one full time job and one part time I was keeping for food discounts. Way better than working 110 hour weeks. \n\nGetting in to the real world and not feeling like my life-essence was being leeched out of me by my university and unpaid internships was a turning point. Over the years im doing better, bought a new car, making enough to treat my friends to dinner. I had the opportunity to drop below 50 hours a week but I kinda like my jobs. The fulfillment helps. \n\nI hope you find something fulfilling!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfd9y7/a_decade_ago_i_was_kicked_out_of_college_with_a/fpt2noe/"}
