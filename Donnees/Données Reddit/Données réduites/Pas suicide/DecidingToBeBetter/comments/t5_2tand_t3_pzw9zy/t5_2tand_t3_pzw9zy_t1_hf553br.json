The repetition creates learning through forming habits. Our habits stay with us our whole life unless we recognize them and put forth the effort to change them. \n\nAs kids we are explorers. We explore the world we touch everything, put things in our mouths, get dirty.  We hurt ourselves and our parents come and comfort us through our pains until we feel better. Then we go try again. When we succeed we look back at our parents and they smile and cheer us on. All habits are formed to achieve either comfort or reward. Our routines to get us to a reward or comfort.\n\nIt seems like when you hit a block or messed up as a kid your mom comforted you by simply doing for you instead of saying it\u2019s ok and letting you try again. You learned this pattern. Then it formed a thought of not wanting to mess up because you knew you would only get one shot then game over. Eventually it grew to just not wanting to even try. \n\nGo fail my friend. Fails again and again. The only path to success is failure. You knew this as a kid. You just taught yourself to stop doing it. Go back to being a kid and try try try.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pzw9zy/i_think_i_might_have_identified_my_biggest_flaw/hf553br/"}
