The reason why so many people fear failure is the environment we are in, there is the social stigma that if your good at something then it will be easy, which simply isn\u2019t the case. Failure can also be seen as weakness but its not weak whatsoever, as long as you\u2019re putting forth an honest effort, that\u2019s what matters. I could go to the gym & not be able to lift a lot & feel like a failure around the rest of the gym-goers but at the end of the day, I\u2019m doing it, I\u2019m the one getting up, making the conscious decision & deciding I\u2019m gonna go workout. You\u2019ve already done more than someone who hasn\u2019t done anything or taken initiative. Failure is natural, in fact, promote failure! Failure means growth, hard times means growth, falling to get back up & try again is growth. Good things don\u2019t come easy, notice how it\u2019s super hard to build something up but so easy to tear it down? It\u2019s like dominoes, spending hours to set them up & if one domino goes down, your hours go down in seconds. Welcome failure, invite into your life, then you will experience true growth. Walt Disney was fired from Kansas City Star because they said he \u201clacked imagination & creative ideas\u201d look at him now. Stephen King, his first book Carrie was rejected 30 times, then he threw it away but his wife told him to resubmit it & it turned into his first book deal. Everyone fails, if it has a pulse, it\u2019s failed before. However, society doesn\u2019t highlight that, it highlights the good thus giving everyone the preconceived notion that \u201coh he is a natural, it was so easy for him, why is it hard for me\u201d when in reality that person failed many times to get where they are at today. \n\nLong long paragraph, apologies but I love stomping fear out. Keep your chin up, fear is your friend, not your enemy. Welcome it & learn from it & you\u2019ll be unstoppable.
