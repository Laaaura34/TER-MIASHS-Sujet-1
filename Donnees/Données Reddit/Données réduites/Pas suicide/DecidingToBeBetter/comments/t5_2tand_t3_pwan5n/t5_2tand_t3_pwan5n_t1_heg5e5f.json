My boyfriend has been a great support to me. I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis 2 years ago when I was 21 and then gained 30kg due to comfort eating and medication. All of that has made me a bit depressed and I know it is impacting our relationship. I don't have the same \"zest\" for life and I feel really bad that my partner has ended up with this version of myself. I've tried therapy and losing weight many times but I have not made a genuine attempt at weight loss. I always find it odd how I haven't changed my habits despite how much it upsets me. Keep fighting and take care.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwan5n/at_what_point_did_you_decide_enough_is_enough/heg5e5f/"}
