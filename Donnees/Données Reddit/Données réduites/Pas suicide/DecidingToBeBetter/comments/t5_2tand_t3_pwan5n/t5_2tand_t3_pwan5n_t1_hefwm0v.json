I knew I needed to change my life, because it wasn't the first time I'd let it get that bad. I took time to make a plan, using bullet journaling and konmari method. Basically I took some quiet time to figure things out and made a promise to myself that I would be in control of my life from now on and improve it. Motivation will only get you so far, because improving gets boring/hard real fast. So figure out your why and find a way to make your life work. Noone else can do that for you. There's plenty of books and YouTube videos to guide you, but eventually you gotta do whatchu gotta do.
