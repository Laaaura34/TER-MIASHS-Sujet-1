Made me realize I was lucky she had even stuck around with me at my worst. I decided that I was not trying my best and that she deserved me to try. I was being an inconsiderate asshole. Not for being depressed and an addict.. but for coasting when I knew I could try harder. After that it\u2019s been a journey of ECT, rehab, meds, more psychologists than I can count.. but here I am, still alive and much happier. The fight continues but I\u2019m winning. May the gods smile down on that woman with favour for saving my life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwan5n/at_what_point_did_you_decide_enough_is_enough/heg31in/"}
