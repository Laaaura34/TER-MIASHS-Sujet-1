I\u2019ve been working on this in therapy. I\u2019ve always compared myself but in the end I trusted my judgement. I was a junior in high school when Instagram first got popular. I used to love posting about fashion and sharing my outfits. I was unapologetic about my views and I was attracting people I wanted to be around. It was good, until I lost myself.\n\nShortly after hs graduation, I just lost all creativity and I completely depended on approval. I\u2019m still struggling. I deleted Instagram in April. I just remade a new one and I feel the same fears lurking on me. I just want to be myself again and talk about the things that I think about.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kiug3z/stop_depending_on_others_to_define_your_worth/ggw0k4c/"}
