No give up.  Not allowed.  Look at it like this: say you're building a house.  The concrete truck is there and you're pouring your foundation.  The truck runs out of concrete (this is not a thing I just made it up)  Your foundation is 72 percent poured.  Are you going to say F*** it, this house is never going to work out, and just walk away?  I'm guessing you will wait a bit, take some deep breaths and then around the corner, here comes another truck.  They finish pouring your fondation.  Yay!  Now, you still have to frame it up, run all the wiring, do the plumbing, put a roof on...\nAnd then it's finished.  But it's not really finished because things need attention, or you decide to renovate.  It's never over, and its little hiccups like this that will stop your afternoon maybe, but not your life.\nIf that doesn't work for you, i recently heard about the\"5\" rule.  As in, will it matter in 5 minutes?  Will it matter in 5 hours?/Days?/weeks?/years?  Sometimes maybe, but it's really not the end of the world.\nAlso, just get outside and go walk around the block, then take a shower.  Go see if your neighbour/aunt/friend needs help with anything.  Helping others works wonders.  Ok that's my 5 minutes, I'm out.  Chin up", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qc8h0n/i_need_some_encouragement_today/hhedb0f/"}
