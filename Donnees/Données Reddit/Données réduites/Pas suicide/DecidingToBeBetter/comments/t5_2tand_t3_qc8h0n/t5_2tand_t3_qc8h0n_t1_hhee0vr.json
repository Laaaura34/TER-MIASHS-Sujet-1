DO NOT GET UPSET OR  MAD AT ANYBODY. The person at the other end of the phone call or email is just doing their job. *Remember, they aren't responsible for whatever the problem is.*\n\nIf you can relate to the person on the phone as an individual human being, the interaction can be positive for both of you.\n\n *IMPORTANT: Ask them what they recommend you do.* \nThey know how the bureaucracy works and can give you valuable advice.\n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qc8h0n/i_need_some_encouragement_today/hhee0vr/"}
