Everything is role play. Scripted reactions make the interaction predictable which will help your emotions recalibrate. \n\nYou go there, you wait to get a feel. And when someone pays attention to you you just say: \"Hi, I'm really shy :)\" If you don't know how to answer you say: \"I don't know how to answer that.\" If you feel pressured you say: \"I'm feeling insecure, can you ask me again in 5 minutes?\" \n\nAnd you trust them, because you chose them. \n\nThe issue with insecurity is that kind people give you space and rude people take your space. So unless you start approaching people, you'll mostly interact with rude people. That's what's meant by 'putting yourself out there'. You choose  who you want to interact with before someone chooses you. \n\nAnd that's why I'm sending you to amateur theatre. Because it's you choosing to go there. It's you picking another group if you didn't like this one three times in a row. And it's easier to get into one than finding a fitting therapist. Which is definitely something you might want to start looking into, now, to realistically have a spot in 3-6 months (if you make it your mission).", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfk0h3/how_do_you_speak_up_for_your_self_without_causing/hi0p96t/"}
