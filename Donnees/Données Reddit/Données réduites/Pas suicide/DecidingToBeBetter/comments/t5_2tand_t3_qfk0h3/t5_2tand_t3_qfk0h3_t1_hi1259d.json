I say this because I was similar although for different reasons, and going to therapy really really helped me become more confident in myself. I also learn random tricks there, like if you have trouble making eye contact or facing someone when you need to be assertive, look at the space between their eyebrows if you can't look at their eyes. I would really really consider finding a therapist, because they can help you work through a lot of the things you mentioned and you will naturally become more confident I promise. most people do virtual too if you don't have time to go to an office. if you are in usa I can pm you a few different therapists I know have great standards, but you can research in your area ofc. best of luck, you sound like a lovely person and I know you have a beautiful life ahead of you! <3", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfk0h3/how_do_you_speak_up_for_your_self_without_causing/hi1259d/"}
