I would advice trying out all the things you want to try while you still can. Don't listen to your mind giving you reasons not to do things. In particular, be open to meeting new people and taking risks with relationships. It's okay if some of them end in heartbreak or do not go anywhere. Everything is a growing opportunity. If you never try things, you'll be safe in your comfort zone but you'll also never grow. Oh, and ask for what you need, always. Set boundaries and trust your own values and reasons for doing things. Trust yourself to overcome challenges.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/po8pe3/what_advice_do_you_have_for_someone_whos_turning/hcuw746/"}
