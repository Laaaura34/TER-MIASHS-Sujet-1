It only took me 23 years to realize that there's more to life than just working and just being miserable. I'm just slowly improving myself day by day... I know it's only been a few months but I am really focused on being myself. \n\n-Learning and picked up investing in stocks / crypto and TSAs. (Started this back in early in 2021) \n-Picked up a new hobby. I am in shape but never focused on exploring my options. Picked up Bouldering / Rock Climbing which is helping my mental health. \n-Stopped working too much overtime. There's more to life. \n-Just let it go and be in control of my life. So many repressed thoughts boiled over. Gotta stop beating myself up for my downfalls. I'm learning to take risks, slowly be more confident and be both stronger mentally and physically. It's been difficult however as I've been struggling with my mental health since I was a kid.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/po8pe3/what_advice_do_you_have_for_someone_whos_turning/hcywoum/"}
