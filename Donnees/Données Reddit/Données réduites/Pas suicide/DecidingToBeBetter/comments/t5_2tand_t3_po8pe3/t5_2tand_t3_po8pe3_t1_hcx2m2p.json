If you drink, try to limit it or stop. Avoid drugs at all costs. Not only will this hurt your health, but also your wallet as well. I\u2019m glad I never touched any of those. \n\n- Focus on your health (exercise frequently, eat healthy, take your vitamins)\n- Make sure you are financially stable or work towards it. Save up, don\u2019t spend your money unless you have to. Priorities come first!\n- Educate yourself! Continue your studies or if you\u2019re not yet in college, go after it. A good education is important in order to survive in this world and make something of yourself. Of course you don\u2019t need education, but I personally think it\u2019s important. Also educate yourself in everything else - read books, brush up on your history/politics, read about current events, etc.\n- If you have mental health issues, seek help and get it fixed immediately. Depression and anxiety (as well as other things) could seriously slow you down and could get worse if not taken care of. I kinda wish I was treated for my anxiety sooner.\n- Travel. Explore the world and learn about their culture and history.\n- Build your confidence.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/po8pe3/what_advice_do_you_have_for_someone_whos_turning/hcx2m2p/"}
