Your bank can usually do this. If not, find another way. But what\u2019s critical here is this: you need to pretend like your income is whatever you make MINUS whatever you can comfortably afford to take out of your paychecks. Meaning you literally never see this money. And NEVER say, \u201cwell if I fall on hard times I\u2019ll take from it\u201d. You\u2019ll be smashed by tax penalties worse than you think. \n\nOne day you\u2019ll have the job you\u2019ll most likely be at forever. Start a 401k there. Learn how they work. NEVER BORROW FROM YOUR 401k. It\u2019s basically you robbing your retirement fund. Yes, it\u2019s always an option. But you should budget like that money does not exist. \n\nThis does involve making sacrifices that your peers won\u2019t be making. But if you do it now, you\u2019ll be living the true dream of early retirement that they\u2019ll be begging for. \n\nA lot of people attempting to do this around your age are usually contributing $200 a month in total to their retirement fund. You can do more or less, that\u2019s fine, but whatever you do, live within your means.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/po8pe3/what_advice_do_you_have_for_someone_whos_turning/hcyy0n9/"}
