I had a therapist I used to love going to and she helped me a lot. Unfortunately I had to stop going to her because I couldn't afford it. My health insurance doesn't cover therapy at home and I was often having to choose between eating or going to my therapist so I just stopped going. I want to start up again but I could only afford one lesson every other month and my therapist doesn't think that would be beneficial and she says I should wait until I can go more consistently.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i1wasv/i_think_ive_become_afraid_of_feeling_good_about/g04d1ya/"}
