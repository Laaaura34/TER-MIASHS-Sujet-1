After my failed attempt with aviation at SUU, I considered going to ASU online and getting a degree in Organizational Leadership (the topic I have the most passion for). But I felt like the degree was too general that it wouldn't give me much choice in any occupation in the military (I can honestly say I'm downright terrified of being in another job where I don't feel I belong). Then I thought about going for the Aviation track again, but after research I found out it will cost me about $2-3K and up to 18 months to see the people I need to and get my FAA medical cert, which I need to even begin taking classes. After doing the math on how much time it would take (could be 6 years before I'd be able to say I successfully made it and became a military pilot), and how something as simple as my eyesight could disqualify me from the entire thing, I decided it was too big a risk. Then I thought about being a SERE Specialist (basically the guys who train aircrew and special forces how to survive behind enemy lines and/or captivity). But then after research I found out over the next year they're only allowing 50 prior service Airmen to rejoin into seven different career fields (so roughly seven per field). And with not the best track record on the enlisted side of the Air Force, I no longer consider that an option. \n\nSo part of it is situation, and part of it is me getting cold feet so quickly.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pyazq4/the_paradox_of_choice/hex1334/"}
