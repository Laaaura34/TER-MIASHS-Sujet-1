Whenever you feel like you should get back on it, do exactly that. \n\nNew habits take a while to stick, and it's NORMAL to drop off once momentum drops.  What makes that habit stuck is doing it again another day. When you remember, aw shit I'm supposed to be drinking water. And sometimes you'll have that thought and you won't, but try to keep coming back to that habit. That's what turns it into a sincere and genuine habit where you miss  doing it. \n\nWhen we revamp and reboot every time, instead of setting habits to be stronger we're putting ourselves back at square one that's entirely momentum dependent and not sustainable. \n\nSo go back and look at the old things you wanted to start doing then and do them now.  \n\nThe distance between your resets will start to shrink eventually.\n\nAlso be KIND to yourself about making mistakes and falling back. It actually helps habits stick better. Plus it's a pandemic, be nice to yourself. It's not business as usual. You need extra self loving.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pulmwd/need_advice_i_feel_stuck_in_a_pattern_of_bad/he3r5rg/"}
