This is how depression manifests for me, sleeping and being unproductive. Try creating some habits, some rituals, around certain things. Like maybe when you come in after work or school, do 5 min of something you want to accomplish, like gathering your laundry, or study for 5 min. or read a book for 5 min. And it's OK to only do it for 5 min., then your goal is accomplished. If you want to do more, great if not, no problem! Then create a night time ritual for yourself, a winding down routine that helps you get into a nice state for sleep. I like to shower a night so I get into bed nice and clean. Also as your body goes from the heat of the shower to your room temp. it makes it drowsy, make a tea, meditate for 5 min, get clothes ready for the next day etc. (there are lots of youtube videos to help you create nighttime or anytime routines). If you need to watch videos to fall asleep use ones you've seen before so it's more like a bedtime story and the intrigue of a new video won't keep you awake. I watch old series that I've seen hundreds of times to fall asleep to. \n\nDo your best and don't be hard on yourself \u2728\u2600\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nscr4a/i_dont_know_how_to_actually_be_better/h0m5bfk/"}
