Everyone can relate to life kicking you in the face in one way or the other. Everyone has had struggles. Just be honest yet don't make a huge deal about it. What's important is to let this be a thing of the past, shit happens, and let your interviewer know that you're determined to focus on the future now. Perhaps this experience has tought you some unique skills? Perhaps you consider yourself wiser, more empathetic and more self aware than if you hadn't gone trough this? Every bad experience can be turned into something positive. It's just how you choose to see it. Don't go to an interview feeling ashamed about your past. Go to the interview and be proud about your determination and that you got trough it! There's so many inspiring stories about people who've shared your experience.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kgl55y/i_feel_like_ive_messed_up_ill_be_32_by_the_time_i/gggm7fw/"}
