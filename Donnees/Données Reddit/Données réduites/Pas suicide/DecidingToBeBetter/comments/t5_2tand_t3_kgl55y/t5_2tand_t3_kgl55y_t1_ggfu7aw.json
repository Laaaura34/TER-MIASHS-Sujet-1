Several of my coworkers are nearly a decade younger than me and it's frustrating as hell when I'm treating them as competent coworkers and they seem to think I'm treating them poorly because they're younger. (No, you're just contradicting a memo we literally got Monday and I'm discussing it to figure out where we're at so I'm not misremembering.)\n\nBut we have to have some grace for ourselves. Honestly? I got this job about 7 years out of college, so you're in WAY better shape than I was! Your college is likely better than mine was, and you've gotten further in writing/pitching than I ever did.\n\nDON'T UNDERSELL YOURSELF AS AN INTERN. Your work interested legit producers? You're a creative that I'm assuming is paying for something in media, be it as a media seller, PR specialist, ad creative, or designer.\n\nYou should tell yourself: \"I was working on my own projects for a while, but realized that I could strengthen my own skill set by furthering someone else's project since I can look at it more objectively. It'll help with my own perspective and get me interacting with others to fuel my own abilities, passion, and work.\"\n\nObviously this is too internally focused for an interview, but this sort of thought process helped me immensely in trying to break out of the freelance rut I was in and get on track at a corporate position that was a rough transition. I'm finally settling in after a year or two and it feels like my trajectory is way more concrete now.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kgl55y/i_feel_like_ive_messed_up_ill_be_32_by_the_time_i/ggfu7aw/"}
