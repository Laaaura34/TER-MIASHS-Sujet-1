I spent better part of 35 years living in these shadows, wondering what people thought about me and it all influenced how I acted and responded in every situation. Two years ago I surrendered my life to Jesus Christ and with that came a freedom and a peace I have never experienced elsewhere. I learned what it felt like to be loved unconditionally and what it meant to love unconditionally. We are all in this never-ending loop of chasing mirages of worldly contentment and bliss until the end of our days unless we earnestly in our heart want to align to God's will. There is something very beautiful \"hidden\" there. It actually isn't hidden though. We just choose not to see it. We are all born blind. If we ask Him, He WILL reveal it to us.
