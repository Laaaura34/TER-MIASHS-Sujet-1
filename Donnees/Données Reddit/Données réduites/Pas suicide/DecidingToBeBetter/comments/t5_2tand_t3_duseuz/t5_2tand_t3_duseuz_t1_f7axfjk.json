That's really rough. Some things aren't meant to be.\n\nI went through the same (granted, this was 3 years ago) and wasted a hella lot time brooding over it. Looking back, I really wish I hadn't wasted all that time. I wish I had just moved the fuck on. I would have been in a better place in life today had I just focused on myself instead of living with the hope that my ex's mind would change.\n\nYour ex isn't coming back, friend. Pick yourself up. You need to pass these exams. The world doesn't care about your relationship status. Can you start today by trying to read/learn/revise for just an hour? Just do 1 hour today and then do whatever you want after that for the rest of the day. During that 1 hour, no phone, no browsing, no distractions, take a 5 min break at 25 minutes and resume to you have done 1 hour of sitting your ass down and learning. Pick the easiest topic and work on it. \n\nThe remaining 23 hours are yours to fill. Feel free to ponder about the break up. Voice your thoughts. Record them or write them down (whatever you do, don't send it to your ex!). It will be painful. Revisiting old memories will hurt and there will be tears. It's alright to cry. We're all human. But it's truly cathartic at the same time.\n Once you've done this, guess what - you've revisited what you dread most right now. You've faced your biggest fear. You're telling your stupid heart that it doesn't control you. You're telling yourself that you're taking back control of your own life.\n\n\nFeel free to DM if you need more help with this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/duseuz/50_days_till_the_end_of_the_year_make_it_count/f7axfjk/"}
