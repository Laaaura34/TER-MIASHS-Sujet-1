I opened a brand new journal book and made the headline \" How 2019 will be my best year ever\" and started to write down everything I needed to add AND subtract from my life.  I'm 48 y.o. and 2019 so far has been the best year of my life. I'm the happiest and in the best shape that I can remember. \nJust a couple more ideas you may want think about adding to your daily habits (habits are really what it all boils down to) would be start a daily meditation practice and everyday in your journal write out 3-5 things you are grateful for in your life. All the best to you friend.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/duseuz/50_days_till_the_end_of_the_year_make_it_count/f78pot2/"}
