I will say that again.  A better life is ALL (100%) ABOUT HABITS. I was stuck on the hamster will of \"self improvement\" \"motivation\" for years.  I would read motivational books, watch motivational videos on Youtube etc.  The motivation would last, at most, a week.  It wasn't until I started focusing on small habits that my life, my outlook, and my mood drastically changed.  I started with simply preparing my morning gym clothes the night before I would go to the gym.  That simple. Just one habit. That turned into me going to work out 5 times per week.  Because I worked out I felt better.  I added Pomodoro's to the mix.  Pomodoros are focused, distraction free, work periods.  My goal was to do at least 5 per day.  On a good day I did 10.  It didn't matter what I did as long as it was moving me toward my goal(s) and it was focused, distraction free work.  This led to leaps and bounds more productivity in my business, personal finances, and personal life.  Because my life began to be more orderly and ROUTINE, my stress level began to decrease.  I just wished I could have learned the power of habits earlier.  Humans are habitual creatures, we wake up and pretty much do the same thing (with minor changes) every day.  Change your habits, change your life!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/duseuz/50_days_till_the_end_of_the_year_make_it_count/f7a9pfy/"}
