A bad past is scary to have. Regrets and guilt. One thing that has helped me is to say that the person you are today is not the person you were in your past. You are stronger. You are more resilient, even ever so slightly. Trust in your future, yourself and your partner. Love and forgive yourself. Getting help is strength, strength to be the best you.
