I don\u2019t care about study\u2019s or research I care about me, I will do 100% 100% of the time because I don\u2019t care about being held back by doubt this. As much as I would love for you to do all this work for me, you can\u2019t, only me. I\u2019m the one in the mirror yelling at myself to become the future me that I have my eyes set on and you or anyone else will not stop me from reaching my goal.
