I do not care about you, I did not yell at you or anyone else in this thread. It\u2019s written communication, tone is very hard to portray when there is no pitch or body language to distinguish. The lack of accountability and maturity in your response just shows your inability to process rejection. Again I do not care about you, this response is simply to let you know you can\u2019t go through life thinking you\u2019re taking the higher road when you\u2019re just acting like a little kid with a superiority complex.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lehvol/20_years_old_and_dissatisfied_with_my_life_i_will/gmwypg8/"}
