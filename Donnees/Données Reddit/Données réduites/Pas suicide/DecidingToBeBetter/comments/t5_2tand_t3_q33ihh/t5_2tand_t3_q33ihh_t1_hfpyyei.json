Especially since lockdown and a wanted pregnancy. Just completely greyscale and no laughter or excitement about anything. But I also have stress, anxiety and upset to deal with.\n\nI have good eating and sleeping habits, no alcohol (pregnant anyway), exercise routine and a full-time job where I work from home. It doesn\u2019t make a difference to me right now. Everything is just numb and unjoyous.\n\nI was on sertraline but stopped when I was pregnant - not sure if that would have helped. I had CBT for low mood and learned some techniques but nothing has made me \u201chappy\u201d for a long time. I feel extra awful since I am pregnant too.\n\nI don\u2019t really have any advice because I am in the same boat. I would suggest not giving up on things while you feel like this though - even if you\u2019re just going through the motions, you might regret it when you start feeling better again.\n\nI will be returning to sertraline when I can and hopefully seeing friends and family more next year will help. Doing more fun activities etc. It\u2019s been a really hard few years", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q33ihh/how_to_stop_feeling_nothing_and_depressed_all_the/hfpyyei/"}
