I suffer from depression as well and it has ruined my life. It cost me my life. I lost the ability to continue my schooling, the best relationship I ever could have hoped for, jobs, my social skills, years of memories, hindered my abilities to pursue my dreams, and lastly all the days I couldn't do much besides lay around doing nothing worthwhile. It cost me my identity and my ability to interact with the world around me and the people inhabiting it. After a decade in a daze I've begun to crawl out of it but the wreckage depression has left in my life is incalculable and has affected all aspects of my existence. Please please please don't lose yours. Seek help.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q33ihh/how_to_stop_feeling_nothing_and_depressed_all_the/hfpgkwh/"}
