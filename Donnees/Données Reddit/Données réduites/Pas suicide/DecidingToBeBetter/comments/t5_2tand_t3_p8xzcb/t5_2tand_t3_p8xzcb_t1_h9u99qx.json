It's fucking hard.... I've been doing it for 20 plus years, and I still suck at it..... just keep going, and watch how your mind works, and learn to watch and listen to your mind without reacting to it.... you'll be fine\n\nI'd suggest starting with a book. I can suggest a few if you want, most of my experience reading and practicing comes from Zen Buddhism, hmu if you'd like some reccomendations", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p8xzcb/how_meditation_changed_my_life_and_anxiety/h9u99qx/"}
