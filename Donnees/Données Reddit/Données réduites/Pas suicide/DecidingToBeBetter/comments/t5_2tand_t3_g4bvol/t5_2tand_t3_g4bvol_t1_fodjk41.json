I just got the Kindle edition of the book you recommended and I am very excited to read it. \n\nI've been thinking I need a change too, maybe as drastic as moving to another city, going back to school. Haha possibilities are endless with nothing holding you back, and nothing rooting you either :)\n\nI started writing on my Tumblr blog as a motivator to keep prospective readers, and myself, updated on my writing journey. I thought I'd use as a catalogue for my current writing projects and a method to hold myself accountable. \n\nI will try to keep these points in mind. Thank you for sharing your advice :D", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g4bvol/apathetic_looking_for_my_spark_again/fodjk41/"}
