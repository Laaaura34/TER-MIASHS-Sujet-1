Get a note from them and give it to your school. Ask for a medical withdraw. It'll be like you never took the classes. There won't be any failing grades on your transcript.\n\nThen take a break from school. As long as you need to get better. \n\nIf you happen to get diagnosed with something by the doctor, don't be afraid to work with your school's disability office. They have all kinds of goodies they can give you, like extra time on tests and flexible deadlines.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mg78qr/is_there_a_way_to_keep_goin_from_this_situation/gss0197/"}
