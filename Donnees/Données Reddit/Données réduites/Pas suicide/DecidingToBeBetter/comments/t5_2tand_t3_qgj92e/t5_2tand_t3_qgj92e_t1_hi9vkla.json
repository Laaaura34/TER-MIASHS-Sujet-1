I would agree that lots of men are terrible. Lots of men do not know how to appreciate a women's existence if sex is not an option. Lots of men say and do hurtful, insensitive things and, when confronted, deny any wrongdoing. I can easily imagine how hard it is to be a woman and pick through the good and bad! This is all to say some of your thoughts have merit. But other parts of what you are feeling do not have merit. There are good men out there, men who will see you for everything that you are, as a person, as a human being. Like, I'm here to tell you that they exist! It just takes time to find the right one. Don't give up. Take some time to readjust your thoughts towards men, maybe think about talk therapy, and then when you're ready, try again. He's out there, you just gotta find him.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi9vkla/"}
