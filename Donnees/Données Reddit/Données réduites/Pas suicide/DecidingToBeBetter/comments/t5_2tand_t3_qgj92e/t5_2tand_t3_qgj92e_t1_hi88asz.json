Do all of the partners of your friends act that way? I suspect if you think on it, you'll realise you have met men who don't act that way. \n\nWhat you're seeing is that some behaviours are almost exclusively male, and the human mind isn't good at differentiating between \"almost everyone who does that bad thing is male\" and \"all makes must do that bad thing\". You can intellectually reason out the difference, but until you really call the fact that this distinction is *actually* at play into your mind to permit it to become what you actually believe about the situation you won't feel it. \n\nI have a friend who is bisexual, though has a heavy preference for men. She recently tried to \"switch teams\" and date only women for the same reasons you've listed, only to be immediately harassed by a woman in the exact same way that men had previously harassed her. It was an interesting learning experience for her - it drove home that whilst she has an armour of hating men, it really was far less to do with \"men\" than it appeared from the perspective of someone dating men primarily.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi88asz/"}
