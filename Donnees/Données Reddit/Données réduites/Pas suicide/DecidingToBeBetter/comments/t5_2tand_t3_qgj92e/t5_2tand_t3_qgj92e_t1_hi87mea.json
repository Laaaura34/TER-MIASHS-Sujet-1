He knows all women are not bad and did not go shitting on the other gender, but actively seeked improvement. \n\nAlso, how do the statements made by OP not fall in the incel category? They literally said they hate all men and all of them are bad. I could understand that they would be triggered by traumatic features, but porn and video game addiction? Is that really worth mentionable? Is that really worth hating someone? Also, are you honestly trying to tell me that OP is not clearly hateful/has some deep seated mental issues when she's making those claims? She might be facing trauma, but these statements make them an incel nonetheless. Also, if you read it, they added an 'etc' after their trauma. Would anyone ever add etc to their list of traumas?\n\nI understand OP has some issues and if some things hadn't happened to them they'd be in a better place, but this does not absolve them of the sheer bias in their opinions.\n\nAlso, OP believes you cannot be sexist against men.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi85fjq?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi87mea/"}
