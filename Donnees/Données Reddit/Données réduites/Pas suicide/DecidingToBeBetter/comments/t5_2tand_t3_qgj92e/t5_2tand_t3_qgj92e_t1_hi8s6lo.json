Anyway, Ok, let me give you an incident that happened a few days ago and you tell me if I did anything wrong. I sat next to a guy in my college's library, I complimented him (just being nice) on his handwriting (I compliment both men and women just to be nice), he looked like a timid quiet guy so I wasn't expecting anything from him, after finishing what I was doing he asks to exchange numbers, we talk for a few days and then he tells me \"wanna come over to cuddle?\" I blocked him after that because I was really frustrated that he thought I was flirting with him because I was apparently too nice. This is just something that happened a few days ago, but honestly this happens so often to me, it makes me feel like a sex object and I feel like men are incapable of just being friends and having normal human interactions with women.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi8s6lo/"}
