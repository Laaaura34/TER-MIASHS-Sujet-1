I had a rough time at home with a father who would spend 12-16 hours a day at work. My mom would vent her male-related frustrations from my father on me, as a child. I was often cursed to \"grow up to be just like my father\" \"another evil and hateful man\" etc etc. \n\nI was 99% black pilled on relationships after I caught my fiance cheating on me in a hotel room after I came back from a boat trip (aircraft carrier) a few days early. \n\nAfter a few meaningless flings, I found the woman who would eventually become my wife, she was in school to become a teacher, and had some training in dealing with troubled children. She was able to see I had a lot of text book signs of past abuse and trauma and helped me get through a lot of dark storms in my life. \n\n\nBefore I met my wife, I had sworn in my heart to never trust another woman. But now I'm with her, and I've never been happier in my life. \n\n\nI'm not saying you need to throw yourself at any man, but you do need to give people chances to show you, that male and female are just facets that people have, and that just because someone is the shitty gender that's always traditionally wrung you out and left you out to fry, that you need to be able to look past your own prejudices and look for someone who makes you feel special.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi88xrc/"}
