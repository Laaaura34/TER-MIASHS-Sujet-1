I know I\u2019m not perfect but who is? Sex is very important for esteem and mental health. Sometimes men just want to escape there reality and past. Drugs, smoking, video games and porn are all great at numbing the pain and taking the edge off. Also as a man I really don\u2019t want female friends, I want a spouse. When I show interest in a girl I want them to know that I don\u2019t want a friend I want a partner. I\u2019m not using women, I\u2019m looking for my soulmate.  After sex men get a post nut clarity and sometimes I don\u2019t know if we are compatible until after sex.
