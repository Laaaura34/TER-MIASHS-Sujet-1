There you\u2019ll realise you definitely aren\u2019t alone in how you feel, they share the same concerns (abuse, being objectified, porn and gaming addictions). A lot of people call that sub toxic, but it is only toxic towards \u201clow value men\u201d ie lazy, abusive, take more than they offer ect. There you\u2019ll be able to identify the traits of a LVM and then avoid them, plus learn how you don\u2019t owe these men chances or your time or vulnerability. You will also see what a \u201chigh value man\u201d is through all the praise that sub gives them. FDS doesn\u2019t hate all men, only LVM. Go there, it will feel like home.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hia41r1/"}
