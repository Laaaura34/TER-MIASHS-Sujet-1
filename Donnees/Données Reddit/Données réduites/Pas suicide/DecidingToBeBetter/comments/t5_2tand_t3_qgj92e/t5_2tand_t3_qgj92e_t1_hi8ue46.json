There are those of us who have lived both sides\u2026. Especially people over 30. Not saying we have it figured out, but we probably have it figured out more than a 17 year old. I sure didnt have NOTHIN figured out at 17. \n\nTrans people have generally done nothing for some time BUT think about gender and the pain caused by society and internal pressures  related to gender, dating, sex, sexism and identity. But to be clear, hating an entire gender because of your horrible experiences is normal and understandable, but not fair to any future friends you may make, and it\u2019s also a massive burden on you. Carrying hate around is very heavy. \n\nI lived for 26 years as a woman and I can\u2019t even tell you how many times I had male friends, or so I thought, who would suddenly spring the \u201cso, do you wanna go out some time?\u201d On me without warning. Yes, it was disturbing every time. I thought we were friends!! \n\nI recommend the book \u201cWhipping Girl\u201d by Julia Serano, and its passionate takedown of patriarchial issues in Western society and the demonization of femininity (including femininity in men), and why that\u2019s taught to everyone. The only thing her book doesn\u2019t really get is the increasing number of people who identify as non-binary or genderqueer, people who have cast off gender roles entirely. \n\nIn short, the problems you\u2019ve experienced are real and real annoying, but there are lots of people who are not only sympathetic, they\u2019ve tried to find solutions to this behavior:)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi8ue46/"}
