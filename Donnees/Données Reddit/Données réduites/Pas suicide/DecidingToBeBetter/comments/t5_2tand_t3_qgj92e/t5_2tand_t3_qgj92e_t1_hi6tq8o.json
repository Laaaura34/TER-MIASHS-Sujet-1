Logically, she knows they are not all the same but its hard to see that and be able to change a belief, in this case, about men when time and time again that belief is being reinforced by meeting disgusting men.\n\nMaybe you should take a break. Focus on you, focus on releasing limiting beliefs. Maybe reflect on why you keep attracting these kind of men. Also, things don't work on our timing. We are on Gods timing, divine timing... whatever you wanna call it. Enjoy being single so you can enjoy yourself when eventually you find the one for you.
