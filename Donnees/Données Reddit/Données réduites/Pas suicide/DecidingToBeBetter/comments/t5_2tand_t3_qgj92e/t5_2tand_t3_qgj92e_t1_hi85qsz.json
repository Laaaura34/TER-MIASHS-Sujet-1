How does friendly look? If you are bringing out a vibe of getting to know someone to be friends and paying special attention to this guy, it can be possible to interpret that as interest in more, especially if this is a focus for that guy. Building friendship can take some time, seeing persons in different moments, moods and environments builds it up. \n\nYou invest with your time the growth of these relationships. And you can choose who to do that with. Follow some interest or hobby for yourself where you can maybe get to know people. Think for yourself what kind of experience you want to have with men, in a way you would feel relaxed, supported, safe, happy, enjoying, etc.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi85qsz/"}
