A man who hates women is much more of a danger than a woman who hates men. A women who hates men will try to avoid them. And men? Well you only have to look at the incel killers to think about that.\n\nYou vote left but you don\u2019t seem to have any understanding of class and hierarchy. I\u2019m sorry your exes were shitty but let\u2019s not act like society & media promotes women cheating. And lets not act like cheating is on any level close to sexual harrassment. You say \u2018men in power\u2019 but you refuse to think about the way all men wield power over women. You can \u2018not all men\u2019 all you like, but the reality is that all women face this violence from men. \n\nJust like I know nothing about your life, you know nothing of mine. I am very happy. I love your condescending tone that I must be unevolved tho. Thanks, but no I just have an understanding of sex class dynamics.  I have men in my life who I love and appreciate, but they very clearly support the women. They have an understanding of discrimination against women. I don\u2019t hate 50% of the population. I just refuse to look away from the male hate / entitlement causing her dislike of men. Who caused the men to treat her in that way? Why is that not deemed as hateful? Was anyone standing up for her then? Why has she felt so unsupported by the other men? \n\nThe reality is is that when women face misogyny and male violence most men look away.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hiahnsa/"}
