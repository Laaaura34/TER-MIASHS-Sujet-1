Do this enough times and the conscious effort becomes unconscious and therefore not an effort. I couple this step with a lot of ruminating, as in I think about recent situations and try to observe it from a completely neutral perspective. In time I make progress and slowly my perception shifts. \n\nUnfortunately, that is what traumas do, they lie to you. They skew reality slowly and in such a way you cannot notice that something has changed.\n\nNow please take into consideration that this is my process and personal experience, you don't have to do as I. My only universal advice is to keep trying. In my experience the how comes naturally, it takes time and effort, but that time and effort cannot be taken away from you and fortunately, growth isn't linear, you might feel like you have done almost 0 progress, and then one day bam! you feel like you've advanced 10 levels.\n\nAnd the last thing, even if this post may not make much sense, or is stuff you already knew, trust me any info will eventually help you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi98f07/"}
