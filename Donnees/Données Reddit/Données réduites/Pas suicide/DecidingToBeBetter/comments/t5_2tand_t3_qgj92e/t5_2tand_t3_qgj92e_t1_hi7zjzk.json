It\u2019s so bad that I can\u2019t have sex with them anymore. It\u2019s been almost a year since I last had sex but wasn\u2019t enjoying it when I was with my ex. Im so traumatized and filled with anxiety my hectic nervous system doesn\u2019t allow me to produce lubrication. I\u2019m always bracing myself around men and feel so unsafe around them. I don\u2019t always think they\u2019ll physically harm me but I think they\u2019re always up to no good. They don\u2019t care about who they hurt and they always have a very demanding energy. I can\u2019t tolerate demanding energy. This applies to gay men as well although I do feel slightly more comfortable with them than straight men.\n\nI\u2019m kind of ranting but every single man I\u2019ve met in my life is so entitled. My last ex is what really caused my aversion. He had mommy issues, took it out on me, wasn\u2019t in touch with his emotions, an alcoholic, and so cruel towards women. He kicked me once and I can\u2019t shake that feeling off me. My ex and dad are similar. My dad jokes about hitting me and it triggers me to fight or flight. So yeah I feel like I might have ptsd.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi7zjzk/"}
