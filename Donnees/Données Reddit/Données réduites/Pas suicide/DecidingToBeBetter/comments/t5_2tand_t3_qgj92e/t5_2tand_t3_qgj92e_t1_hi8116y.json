More or less I realized I was with someone who I believe to be a narcissist who had no emotional concern for me even as just a person. I was just something to be used for money, sex, attention, and pride. In the end I was not even treated with the decency you'd give a stranger. The relationship ended with her cheating multiple times, lying to me repeatedly for 6 months (at which point I cut her off), and lying to people about me. She would admit it to my face all of this but never showed remorse past shallow words. She had often told me I \"saved her\" from herself.\n\nThe thought of dating makes me sick, I know not all women are her, but I see red flags everywhere now. I am overly critical and overly judgmental. Not because I want to think poorly of women but as an instinct to protect myself.\n\nI realized this was happening though, and I've been working to change it. I do not want to treat women with any prejudice. I know not allow women are one way or the other. It's just a matter of rewiring that warning system in my head. It's slow but I'm making progress.\n\nStep 1 was to go after just friendships.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi8116y/"}
