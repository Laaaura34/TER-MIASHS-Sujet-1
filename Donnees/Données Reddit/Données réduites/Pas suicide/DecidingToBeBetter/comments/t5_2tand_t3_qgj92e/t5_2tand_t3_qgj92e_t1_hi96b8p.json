These are oppressive things upheld by our society. These are absolutely violent things. Not to mention she states the attitude that men have with her of only being nice to her bc they want / need something from her. All acceptable reasons to feel frustrated. If you\u2019re reading the lazy /non ambitious thing you are hyperfocusing into her attitude on porn / video games taking over mens personalities , and is far from what she is talking about. You seem a bit defensive. Anyway, this whole post was about her wanting to learn how to ignore her past bad experiences so she can interact with men, she said it wasn\u2019t about dating. It\u2019s a bit weird of you to act like it\u2019s her fault / her attitude that is making men treat her in this way. If you wanted her to trust men, this isn\u2019t really the correct approach to have.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi96b8p/"}
