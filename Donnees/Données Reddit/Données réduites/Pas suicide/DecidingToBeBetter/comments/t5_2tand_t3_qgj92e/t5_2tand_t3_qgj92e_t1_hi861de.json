In some cases, i perpetuated the abusive aspects of a relationship willingly, and even seeked out people who were like that. Welcoming their codependent way of helping me, and being codependent on them. My issues were rooted in my youth, some traumatic experiences, and a deep lack of self worth and appreciation. The ways I\u2019ve been taught to alleviate those beliefs are the ways I\u2019ve set myself up to be in relationships where abuse happened. I\u2019m doing better now relationship wise, but it feels \u201cwrong\u201d often.\n\nI don\u2019t know you or your situation well enough, but you may want to look into codependency (codependent no more is a good one) and find a therapist to talk with; especially if the addiction part of what you\u2019re experiencing is true! it can change your life in more ways than only finding a partner.
