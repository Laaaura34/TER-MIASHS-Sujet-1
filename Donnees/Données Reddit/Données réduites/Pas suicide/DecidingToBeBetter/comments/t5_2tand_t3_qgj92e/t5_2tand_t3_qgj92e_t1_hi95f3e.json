When a guy is forward with you about wanting a physical relationship, let him know that you aren't comfortable with it before completely blocking him. Some of my best plutonic friendships with the opposite sex started off as potential or actual sexual relationships where we decided being friends was a better idea. I'm in my late 20s now, but looking back on my college years I really did crave human connection with women, and it does cloud your brain a little bit. I can assure you that for most men, the intention is not to use you. However, this doesn't mean that all experiences with them will be good. Many men will be taken aback by female attention and automatically assume that it's romantic. Be clear with them that its not, and some will be perfectly ok with this, but just know their default is going to be romantic until you let them know it's not.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi95f3e/"}
