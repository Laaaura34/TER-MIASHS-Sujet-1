If I posted \"I find all women vacuous, baby obsessed gold diggers\" I'd be rightly torn to bits.  Even if my personal experience was legitimately of only vapid, pregnancy obsessed status climbers (it isnt - although there's been more than a few... ).\n\nThe unfortunate truth of it is, the vast majority of both men and women probably are cunts.  It's all too easy to lump them into one catagory and say \"I just dont like men / or women\".  There's good people out there, they're just in the minority.  Past personal experience either way unfortunately skews our outlook of the future.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi849r1/"}
