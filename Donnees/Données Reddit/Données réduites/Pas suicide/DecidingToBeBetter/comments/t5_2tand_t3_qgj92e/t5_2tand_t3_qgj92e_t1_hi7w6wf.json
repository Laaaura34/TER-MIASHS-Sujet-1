Humble little old monks can be relaxing.  Fred Rogers and Bob Ross are obviously safe.  Try seeing them as individual and interesting people rather than men.   Reading biographies may be helpful.\n\nBy the way, don\u2019t abandon all caution, but don\u2019t let fear keep you from where it\u2019s safest.  When choosing who to interact with, if you go to a group of polite people and pick randomly, odds are you\u2019ll get someone pretty harmless.  If you hang back and wait for someone to come to you, odds are higher that a pest at the fringes of the crowd will emerge.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi7w6wf/"}
