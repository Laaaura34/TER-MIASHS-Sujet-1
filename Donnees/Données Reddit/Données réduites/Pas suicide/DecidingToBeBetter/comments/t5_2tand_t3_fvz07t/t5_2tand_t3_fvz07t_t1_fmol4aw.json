I don\u2019t think he was angry more concerned. Prior to that we never had the best relationship because we\u2019re basically the same person and would butt heads. I moved out when I was 17, ran wild for awhile and didn\u2019t talk to him or my stepmom for quite some time. We had just started getting our relationship back when I dropped that little bomb on him. When I told him part of me thought he would just be like \u201cwell that\u2019s the road you choose, good luck\u201d but it wasn\u2019t like that at all. He arranged everything for me from the rehab center to the flight. Then every day I was in rehab I would talk to him on the phone and when I returned home he let me stay with them. I will say that I think my mother was really angry at me (she always is) but bit her tongue in front of me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fvz07t/two_years_ago_i_left_for_rehab/fmol4aw/"}
