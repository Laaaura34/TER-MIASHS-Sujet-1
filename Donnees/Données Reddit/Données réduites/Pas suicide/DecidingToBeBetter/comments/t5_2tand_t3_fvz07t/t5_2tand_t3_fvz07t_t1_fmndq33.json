I am so proud of you and the progress you have made. My s/o completed rehab for drug addiction about a year prior to when we met. I\u2019ve watched him grow and change and I\u2019ve seen the hardships and aftermath of a nasty drug addiction. His going to rehab was less willing, so I can imagine the absolute strength it took to admit that you needed help. Being vulnerable is hard. Rehab is hell. Learning to live a life without drugs again is hell. I am proud of you for doing the absolute best thing to better yourself, and I am wishing you all the best as you continue through life! You have lots of years left and don\u2019t need (nor should you) to be defined by a 6 month period in your life. Cheers to 2 years :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fvz07t/two_years_ago_i_left_for_rehab/fmndq33/"}
