One being, on the adds I see on TV one of the side effects is always suicidal thoughts, and as someone with 2 suicide attempts behind me and who is still strongly considering a third that\u2019s probably not a good combination. Also I live with my parents right now and the chance of them allowing it is slim to none. Another reason why is because I don\u2019t want to take a medication that can mess with my mind and my emotions, and sometimes the side effects are diseases or something and I already have enough health problems as it is. I have a few more reasons but I\u2019ll leave it at that since I have to go. But thank you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lxeatb/how_do_you_overcome_depression/gpn95jx/"}
