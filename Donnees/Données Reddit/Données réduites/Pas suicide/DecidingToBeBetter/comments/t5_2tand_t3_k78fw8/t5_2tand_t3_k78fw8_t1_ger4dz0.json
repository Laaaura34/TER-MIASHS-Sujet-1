Well done, I'm proud of you! It's incredibly hard to do what you did. I had tried to cut ties with some people that would spread negative energy and my parents would also not be very supportive. I guess they are afraid I might end up alone if Im too picky or smth. Eventually I just had less and less contact with those people, I distanced myself on purpose and today we text occasionally and see very rarely and I'm fine with that! My point is you can either do it gradually as I did, so it looks less obvious, or be straight forward and explain yourself and be clean with yourself what do you want for yourself. That takes a lot of courage, and you must not daubt yourself. If those people were good for you, you wouldn't suffer for so long. We must protect ourselves from negative impacts, and care for ourselves first to be good to others. Let yourself enjoy your little victory and allow your heart to meet and love some new, good people in future!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k78fw8/i_finally_cut_ties_with_a_toxic_person_in_my_life/ger4dz0/"}
