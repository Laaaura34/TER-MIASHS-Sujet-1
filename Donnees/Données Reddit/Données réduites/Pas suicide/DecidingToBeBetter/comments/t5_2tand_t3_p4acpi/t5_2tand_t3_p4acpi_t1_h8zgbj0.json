Birthdays aren\u2019t that special, unless you\u2019re a kid or ultra elderly (imo). \n\nEveryone has them. Arbitrary ones like 27 or 36\u2026 not that meaningful. \n\nMilestones such as 30, 40, 50 I can see an argument for. But as for the other ones\u2026 we live such busy lives\u2026 I don\u2019t expect happy birthdays each year and I hope others don\u2019t as well. If you remember it, great! Wish them a happy birthday. If you forget it though, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal. It doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t care about you. It just means they\u2019re busy and forgot. Nothing more. Many people are going through a hard time because life is hard. It happens. I\u2019d shrug it off.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p4acpi/i_got_past_negativity_toward_my_best_friend_with/h8zgbj0/"}
