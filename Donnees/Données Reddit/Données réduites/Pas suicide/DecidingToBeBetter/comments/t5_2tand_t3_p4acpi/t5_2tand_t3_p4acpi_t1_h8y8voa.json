We coincidentally both have the same disease and handled it differently. I love him to pieces and he me. So when I hurt him we didn't talk for two years. A lot of  things I did wrong. It took two years for me to make a proper amends. There are just things we share that I cannot share with anyone, and a life time of history together. As different as we are we are also so similar. He just expresses it better. We are slowly talking again and I could not be happier about it. Life is short, treasure what you have.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p4acpi/i_got_past_negativity_toward_my_best_friend_with/h8y8voa/"}
