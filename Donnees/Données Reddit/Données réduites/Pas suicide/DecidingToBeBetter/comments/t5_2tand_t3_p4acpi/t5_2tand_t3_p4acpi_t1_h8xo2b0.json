For a second there, I thought I wrote this post. Foreal tho, my close friend has severe depression and she withdraws a lot. I did get resentful and it affected our relationship. But we communicated and she's putting in more effort to contact me. Sadly, depressions a bitch and she's bad at keeping in contact online so I don't hear from her as often as I want. It's much sadder if we're not friends though. This is such a good idea.
