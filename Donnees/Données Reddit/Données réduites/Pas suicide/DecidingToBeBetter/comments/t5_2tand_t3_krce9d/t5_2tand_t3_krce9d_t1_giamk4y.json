Your dedication shows. Even if you had a setback, you didn't let it take control. You owned your life. It takes 3 weeks to start making something a habit. 3 weeks. That's all you need to dedicate your life to a small change.\n\nIm sorry about the message that your parents instilled in you about your worthiness. I hope that now you realize how wrong they were, and how harmful those comments were.\n\nYou're an inspiration. From one internet stranger to another, I love you man.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/krce9d/since_december_ive_been_writing_daily_brushing/giamk4y/"}
