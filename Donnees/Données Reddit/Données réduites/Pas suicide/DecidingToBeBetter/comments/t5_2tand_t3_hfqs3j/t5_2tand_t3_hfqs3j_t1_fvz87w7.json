To be honest: that time of my life made me seriously miserable. \n\nEvery day that I wake up and choose to do something to better myself, I become one step further away from becoming that person again. \n\nThe same could be said for you: you don\u2019t seem happy with your life at the moment, and every time you make a decision to better yourself, you\u2019re choosing not to live this life anymore.\n\nRemember: progress doesn\u2019t have to happen overnight. If you can make one tiny change a month and stick to it then you will be in a better place in the long run than if you were to fix everything overnight. Start in the area that\u2019s most important to you (for me, it was regular exercise and cutting down on \u2018junk\u2019 food) and take baby steps until you are where you want to be.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to eat healthily overnight, but if there\u2019s one meal a week where you eat something healthier than the usual cheeseburger then that\u2019s great progress.\n\nBe kind to yourself, and good luck \u2728", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hfqs3j/serious_question_what_makes_you_want_to_get_better/fvz87w7/"}
