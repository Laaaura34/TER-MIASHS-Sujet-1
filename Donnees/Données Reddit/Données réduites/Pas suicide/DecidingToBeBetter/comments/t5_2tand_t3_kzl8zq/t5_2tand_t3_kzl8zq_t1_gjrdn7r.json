I keep a lot to myself. I also deleted Instagram and never had tik tok, SC, or Twitter. I don\u2019t DM anyone here either. I\u2019m a lot happier doing things like exercise, reading, traveling, and watching documentaries; scrolling for hours on social media becomes such an unhealthy drag and I always feel like I wasted too much time and mentally dragged down.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kzl8zq/i_permanently_deleted_my_snapchat_twitter_account/gjrdn7r/"}
