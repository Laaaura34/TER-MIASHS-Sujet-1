Ok, maybe reddit counts, and I might want to cut down on it. \n\nAlso, WhatsApp is gone from my phone. The initial trigger was Facebook's new terms of use, so despite being in some group chats that were very useful in my job, I decided that enough was enough and changed over to Signal.\n\nEven getting rid of WhatsApp makes my life better, with less disctracions. But I want to keep them, and not going back to the shit in a year, so I'll keep everything the way it is.\n\nI recommend it to you as well. The benefits of sometimes being a little bit out the \"loop\" far outweigh being stuck on the attention-getting (or, actually, hijacking) not-really-social networks. Life is short, and you only have this one. I don't think you'll regret not using social media on your deathbed.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kzl8zq/i_permanently_deleted_my_snapchat_twitter_account/gjpjv02/"}
