It takes a mature person to identify and expunge the toxicity (i.e. shitty \"friends\") from your life! Depending on the COVID situation in your country, you now have that social space to find new friends while doing the hobbies and passions you enjoy! I had a similar experience where I cut ties with my high school and uni \"friends\" then joined a few casual social sport comps on my own, and ice met many new friends through that! It was the best thing I did in 2020. Would highly recommend to everyone!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kzl8zq/i_permanently_deleted_my_snapchat_twitter_account/gjpkdpr/"}
