I dread the time when if I'll make a new ig.\n\nI didn't use it like I used to though, for fb I use only for follow store pages and marketplace, no friend. Twitter only for \"news\". Now I just use it as the few place people can try to contact me since I change my number and basically purge my old contact.\n\nA little advise, as long as you're not addicted to social medias (e.g you couldn't spend 10 minutes without opening 1) there's no harm of having the accounts.\n\nEdited: with hindsight, forget what I said. I might reconsider deleting the socmeds again, I give it a trial the 1st quarter of 2021. If people finds me and add, at least I know there some who still looking for me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kzl8zq/i_permanently_deleted_my_snapchat_twitter_account/gjqwj7s/"}
