I still get  some sort of engagement with the person. I never  get some sort of bad reaction from a person i ask out. maybe a bit awkward sometimes, but usually im kindly turned down. this is okay. But on the online dating platforms its just day after day of putting in effort to just not even get matches, or ghosted by a match, that i assume must have accidently matched with me, or my first message to the match must not have been \"entertaining\" enough. im not sure, but it feels very bleak either way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nive been going through periods of legit trying through out all my twenties. (im 29). These times of effort usually last a couple months before i take a break and stop. then try again after a few months not trying. ive had maybe 4 people ive gone on a date with during this time. all 4 people were people ive not legit interested (2 were twice my age, and the other 2, we just did not have any connection going. And none of these went past a second date.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mtp9kx/how_to_fix_life/gv28gir/"}
