What i currently try is online dating apps. This is an absolute toxic nightmare that doesnt seem to work. and trying to seize opportunites to chat with random people i see in person or at meetups. Random encounters however are obviously never completely smooth because im a random guy initiating a convo with a chick. I understand its awkward for her, but again what choice do i have. and if the short lil convo is atleast half way not a train wreck i ask for her number. no luck yet. This atleast doesnt make me feel awful. i dont have a problem getting rejected. the dating apps tho.... they are awful for the mind.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mtp9kx/how_to_fix_life/gv1lh4b/"}
