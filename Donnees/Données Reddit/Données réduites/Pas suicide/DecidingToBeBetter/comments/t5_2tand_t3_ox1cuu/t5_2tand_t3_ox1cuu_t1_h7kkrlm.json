Quite a few people become psychologists just so they can help the people they want. That is people with depression and anxiety and mild forms of ptsd. A lot of people with more complicated/stigmatized issues going into therapy end up more lost than ever because of these therapists. Please, don't contribute to this. Or if you do, at least be clear on what you specialize from the start and put it on your website of some sort", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ox1cuu/im_trying_my_hardest_guys/h7kkrlm/"}
