I don\u2019t wake up depressed super often, or maybe I do? Hard to tell what\u2019s being tired and what\u2019s feel depressed at this point but it\u2019s more to combat my bouts of depression that comes and go for no reason or the long term drain that stops me from doing anything. Also my doctor might be able to help figure out why I wake up at 1am so often.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ox1cuu/im_trying_my_hardest_guys/h7ljswn/"}
