I understand what you're saying... and agree in some ways.  The thing is, that just because other people love you - doesn't mean you will love yourself.  That's why we can never judge someone by the outside.  There's a Stevie Nicks song... \"Everybody loves you, but you're so alone... Everybody knows your name, but you can't find your way home.  Nobody really knows you, I'm the only one.\"   Sometimes people look at attractive people and judge them, too... It's a heavily layered dynamic... but what is to be learned is that being attractive or being unattractive is not what it's about.  Physicality is an illusion itself.  It's cheesy as hell, but beauty fades - love is eternal.  Cheers.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/2phh44/i_am_a_thin_beautiful_privileged_woman_article/cmwyobf/"}
