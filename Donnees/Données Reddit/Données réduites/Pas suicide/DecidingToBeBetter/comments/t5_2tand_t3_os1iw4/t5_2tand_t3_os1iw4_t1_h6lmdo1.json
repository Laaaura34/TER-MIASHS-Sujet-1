Accidents happen.\n\nMy best suggestion to you is to give yourself a date in next couple of weeks to give up search to fix the gpu - but to try your best in that time to reach out and search a possible repair but on the date you have decided the search will cease. If you have not found a way to repair the gpu by this date i'd suggest hiding the card away and forgetting about it. \n\nDraw a line in the sand and move on.\n\nBy the sounds of your living conditions I think that is more important to work on and improve right now.\n\nForgiving yourself and moving on is not easy and i'm am definitely not that good at it but am aware that it is a useless exercise to beat yourself up. Occupy and distract your mind is also helpful.\n\nHope things get better for you. All best to you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/os1iw4/how_do_i_forgive_myself/h6lmdo1/"}
