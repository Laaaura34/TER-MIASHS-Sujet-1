Make it something you can hold yourself accountable for and make it achievable. Try something like \n\n- go to one event that caters to my interests every 2 weeks (that leaves 13 evenings of you time while you still go out and do something new or intriguing)\n- maybe say you\u2019ll try some type of class at least once a month\n- if you are outside of the US, a lot of places you\u2019re old enough to grab a drink\n- if you don\u2019t have close friends right now, 18 is an awesome age to meet new people. A lot of folks are reinventing themselves and settling into their more independent lives. Find likeminded people and maybe link up every once and a while (the internet can be a really wholesome place for people to find eachother)\n\nIf all of that sounds like a drag remember that what other people consider squandering their youth doesn\u2019t have to apply to you. You make the rules for your own expectations of a life well spent. If that means getting baked and having a lovely time alone that\u2019s totally cool. You don\u2019t need to force yourself to have the same social battery as your peers", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qh7pea/i_prefer_spending_time_alone_but_i_dont_want_to/hib5uk9/"}
