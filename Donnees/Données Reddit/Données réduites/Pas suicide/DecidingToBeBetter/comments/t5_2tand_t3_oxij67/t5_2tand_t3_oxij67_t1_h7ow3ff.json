So I'm not ~only~ my anxiety. I'm not only mu fear to trust, I'm not only my awkwardness around others. I'm also a good heart, I'm very kind, I'm always trying my best to better myself, i take care of my house, my life, i have a good nutrition, I'm very glad and grateful for having a house, a job and how to maintain it.\n\nI have a self hatred feeling, but I'm not only it. It's just a part of the whole I am, so i decided to focus more in those i can improve and celebrate everyday as a small victory. \n\n:)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oxij67/you_are_not_your_thoughts_you_are_not_your/h7ow3ff/"}
