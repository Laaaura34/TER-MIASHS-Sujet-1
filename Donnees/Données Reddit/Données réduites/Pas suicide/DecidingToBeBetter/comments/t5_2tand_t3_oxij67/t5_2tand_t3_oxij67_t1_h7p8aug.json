When your kindness shines through and your actions prevail in line with your values and commitments no matter how you feel, you will be proud of who you see in the mirror. We all have moments when we prevail and moments when we do not. It is an infinite battle of us against ourselves. Once we surrender to that life is so, it actually can be a fun battle to fight! Thank you for your beautiful words.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oxij67/you_are_not_your_thoughts_you_are_not_your/h7p8aug/"}
