I am not a big fan of the word intrusive. I believe automatic thoughts is more accurate.  One way to look at this is that those are actually not thoughts that you are having, but those thoughts that are designed to have you. Responsibility for these thoughts starts with whether we act on these or not.\n\nLet's say you are in a relationship and you meet a stranger and talk with them. You notice you find that person attractive, but you choose to treat that person as a friend. In that moment we can be proud of ourselves maintaining the integrity of the relationship we have.  However, if we consciously seduce that stranger, that would be outside the integrity of the relationship unless you have a special agreement with your significant other that that is OK.\n\nDon't feel guilt and anxiety over having thoughts. Just let that be. The only thing to concern ourselves with is whether our actions are in line with our values and agreements.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oxij67/you_are_not_your_thoughts_you_are_not_your/h7ov4dv/"}
