I\u2019ll keep it brief. \n\nIn a month period. I; broke up with my gf, hung out with another girl, while, still sleeping with my ex, and eventually, getting back together. I have all this guilt how bad I treated her and manipulated her. We\u2019re back together and she moved past everything. But I haven\u2019t. All I think is how she could stay with me knowing what I done, and I say, would I stay with her if the rules were reversed ? \n\nThat\u2019s why I have anxiety, I feel I don\u2019t deserve her. I look at her, whether we\u2019re laying cuddling, or out together, I don\u2019t think of our good our moments are, All I think is, why. And how. Why did I do those things, and how am I able to date her with this guilt?\n\nStarted therapy, but having anxiety/guilt/intrusive thoughts because of my actions when I was single, for a very short time, kill me every day. \n\nDidn\u2019t mean for story time but it feels good to talk abt it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oxij67/you_are_not_your_thoughts_you_are_not_your/h7ovyw4/"}
