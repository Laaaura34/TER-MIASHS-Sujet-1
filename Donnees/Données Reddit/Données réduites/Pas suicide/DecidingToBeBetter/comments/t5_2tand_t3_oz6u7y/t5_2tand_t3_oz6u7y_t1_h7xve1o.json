You are doing the very minimal, but it is not nothing. It\u2019s something. Start by making a very little daily change to that something. If your main goal is studying, read a paragraph daily. If your goal is exercising, do one squat daily.  \n\nThe reason behind making the daily change little is because what you need most is consistency. You need a goal that you can trust yourself to actually do, day after day. Whenever you fail at being consistent, make your daily goal easier.  \n\nDo your best to keep at it for two weeks or so. You will probably fail at doing this 100%. This is normal and expected since you\u2019re trying something new. So don\u2019t get all disappointed when you fail at this one or two days. Just keep on without any drama.  \n\nWhile doing this, cheer yourself up. Be inspiring. Don\u2019t become your own inflexible dictator. Instead, be your own life coach. Be your best friend. Take care of yourself. Be kind in the way you talk to yourself. Be encouraging.  \n\nAfter two weeks, make another little change. Do one more squat a day. Read two paragraphs. Again, we make the change little to let you get used to it. We make it easy because the most important thing in your training is consistency.  \n\nTwo weeks later, increase your daily goal by just a little, and so on.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oz6u7y/how_to_force_myself_to_do_things/h7xve1o/"}
