If not, volunteering at a food bank or other charitable organization is a really good use of your time. It will:\n\nA. Provide the fulfilment of helping others\nB. Social environment for making friends\nC. Something good for your resume to help you get a slightly better job when you feel ready\nD. Get you off the phone and moving your body\nE. Show your parents you are doing something productive and worthwhile for others. It sounds like they are handling it really poorly, but a lot of the attacks they are sending your way likely come from a place of fear that you are checking out of life, and it\u2019s their (warped and counter-productive) way of forcing you to try something new. If they see you volunteering and working towards a goal, for example building your resume for a future job, the personal attacks will likely decrease. Not victim blaming here, but this will likely help the situation and deescalate tension.\n\nVolunteering positions can also start out just a couple shifts a week, so you can start slow. Some cities even have volunteer coordinators who work to match volunteers with suitable positions.\n\nOther than volunteering, getting a low stress job or joining a club are good options. If you go the club route, you may have to try a couple before you find a group that\u2019s a good fit. Volunteering or jobs are usually better primary options.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oz6u7y/how_to_force_myself_to_do_things/h7zajr3/"}
