One stretch, one jump, one pushup.  Walk around.  Look at that bed, and say you know what I'll lie down in a minute, let me go walk to the kitchen and have a glass of water.\n\nSee what happens on your first small journey.\n\nIf you lay back down after that's ok, tell yourself, I'm gonna lay down, but I'll do it for 1 hour, and then I will get back up and take a walk to another room in the house.  I will find something to pick up and put away before I come back to bed again.  Then repeat.  Next time find 2 things to put away...
