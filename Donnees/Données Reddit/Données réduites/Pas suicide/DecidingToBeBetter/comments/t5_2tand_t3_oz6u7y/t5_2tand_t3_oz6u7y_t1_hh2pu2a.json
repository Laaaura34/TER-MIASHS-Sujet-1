I'm not gonna be all motivational speaker like others because that never works for people who rarely have the mental energy to get things done and get drained really quick. Your best bet right now is to work freelance (and possibly from home) in any way you can after you meet the required qualifications. I saw you mentioned writing. Be it content creating by writing simple online articles or managing a social media account of a company etc. I'm sure you'll find something that you don't mind doing as a job or maybe even interested. There are many possibilities. I know it's hard to even force yourself to get out of bed and you probably feel so done with everything but I really hope you start doing little things -anything you want- one by one when you can, just because doing nothing kills your mind and it becomes a dreadful cycle. Reading the other answers, you seem to be aware of things and smart. My advice as an ex burnout is to make a list of things you like doing or things you are good/okay at. Anything can be turned to a job that pays the bills. You need money to live how you want, even doing nothing is a luxury now... You got this, just try to waste your time wiser maybe?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oz6u7y/how_to_force_myself_to_do_things/hh2pu2a/"}
