I can\u2019t speak for OP, but I\u2019m 40 yo and I\u2019m lucky I have one truly amazing parent because I\u2019ve done nothing but make bad choices and disappointed the other two. Fortunately I figured out that I wasn\u2019t unlovable, I wasn\u2019t too much, I wasn\u2019t going to fail at everything I tried, and it\u2019s actually ok to fail as long as you keep going. What\u2019s not ok or normal is parents who constantly scream at you and tell you there\u2019s something wrong with you. My dysfunctional parents had parents who were abusive. My stable parent had kind, loving parents who used appropriate discipline and showed unconditional love. Parents who are abusive are often victims themselves but it doesn\u2019t excuse their behavior, nor does knowing any of this absolve those of us who experienced it from helping ourselves and breaking this cycle.\n\nEdit: just to add, verbal abuse is abuse, period. Fearing for your life (for me on more than one occasion before I moved out of their home) is not ok. It\u2019s abuse. Some people go completely no contact with family like this, but I chose boundaries and other strategies for personal reasons.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oz6u7y/how_to_force_myself_to_do_things/h7yvfs2/"}
