The most effective way I\u2019ve found for me to get things done is to ask a trusted friend or family member for help at a specific time. \u201cHey, I want to find a therapist, but I can\u2019t build up the motivation to call. Will you sit with me (even online) tomorrow at this time and help me get that done? If you\u2019re doing it online, share your web browser screen with them so that they can see you do it and actually do it with you; I have to do this sometimes to take away my ability to lie that I\u2019m doing it. And set a follow up with them to go over any voicemails or emails you receive back from a therapist. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oz6u7y/how_to_force_myself_to_do_things/h7ynujs/"}
