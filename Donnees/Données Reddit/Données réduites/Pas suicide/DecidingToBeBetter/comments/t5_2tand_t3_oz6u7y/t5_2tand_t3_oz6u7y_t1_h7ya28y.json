It sounds harsh, but that\u2019s how it is. There will be many days when you don\u2019t feel like getting out of bed and going to school or work. You won\u2019t be in the mood to talk to your manager, but they will want to set up a meeting with you anyway. You won\u2019t feel prepared for an exam but you\u2019ll have to show up and give it your best shot. You won\u2019t want to pay your electricity bill or your rent because there are additional expenses that need to be paid this month, but if you don\u2019t pay rent you\u2019ll get evicted and will not have a place to stay. As a matter of fact, you\u2019ll notice that your emotions, feelings, and moods will keep shifting \u2014 and if you let them take over your day, you\u2019ll likely have a hard time dealing with even the smallest tasks that need to get done.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s not the end of the world if we don\u2019t feel like doing something. We don\u2019t feel motivated \u2014 or we did yesterday, but today is a different story. There\u2019s still plenty of time to course-correct and change our behavior. **We are the ones in charge of this ship!** We can change the itinerary, we can shift the schedule, we can rearrange the list of what needs to get done, and we can feel more excited about the whole thing\u2026.\n\n\u2026 but ONLY IF we can figure out why we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing.\n\nThe **WHY** here is the most important part of this conversation. It\u2019s really hard to do anything, feel motivated to keep going, if you don\u2019t see the point. The point in this case is a purpose, a plan, a goal. If we don\u2019t have a clear idea of what we\u2019d like to do with our life, it\u2019s impossible to move in a forward direction.\n\nAnd speaking of moving forward, be honest with yourself. Have you thought about any goals that might be important to you? Goals give your life a sense of purpose \u2014 you are more in tune with the big picture of your life, not just what is happening to you today. Pursuing any kind of goal \u2014 personal or professional \u2014 is an excellent way to learn more about yourself. You find out what your top priorities are and how you can solve problems. Goals keep you focused on your personal development and they reflect your values and beliefs. No matter how you look at it, goals say more about who you are becoming as a human being. And that\u2019s why they give us motivation to do things.\n\nIf you are serious about finding motivation, it\u2019s worth it to take some time after school or work to think about a few things. Like this:\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffe Think about what you want your life to be in the long run.\n\n- Do you know where do you want to be 1, 5, or even 10 years from now? Don\u2019t think only geography and economy of your country, but more in terms of personal development and skill level.\n- Who do you want to become in your career? Is it motivating to see yourself as a leader, CFO of a startup, politician, university professor, innovator, scientist, writer?\n- If you can come up with a dream scenario, what is it? Do you wish to live in a specific city, becoming an expert at something, having your own business, teaching others how to improve a skill?\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffe Try to make your goals specific.\n\n- Non-specific goals can be anything of the following. I have to graduate from college, I need a job, I must move out of my parents\u2019 house, I want to get fit, I want a large salary.\n- Specific goals are spelled out. For example, if you\u2019re starting a job search, write down that you want to get a job offer for a [insert job title you want] that pays an annual salary of [insert amount you believe is fairgiven your skills and experience] so that you can develop [insert current skills and new skills you\u2019re working on].\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffe Have a real reason for choosing to go in a certain direction.\n\n- Instead of seeing goal setting as a chore, turn it into a choice. Tell yourself, \u201cI really want to see myself succeed in this area!\u201d The benefit? It gives you a greater sense of control about what you\u2019re doing. That\u2019s much better than feeling like you\u2019re reacting to things or you have an obligation to work towards someone else\u2019s goal (for example, a goal set by parents).\n- Remind yourself of the reason for action with this question: \u201cWhy am I choosing this goal?\u201d Make the connection with the initial reasons for working on something to begin with. It can be to learn a new skill, solve a problem that you\u2019ve had for years, pass an exam to graduate from college, start your own business, etc.\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffe Make your goals actionable.\n\n- Select your top 3 personal goals. They can be anything you\u2019ve been obsessing about for years, or something you\u2019ve been considering more seriously in the past year or two.\n- Under each goal, write down 3 things you need to do on a consistent basis. This could be to practice a skill three times a week, set aside an hour a day to focus and do research, or sign up for a class to broaden your knowledge in a field.\n- Create a schedule for the week ahead. Set aside blocks of time to making progress in the areas you've identified. Start small, with a 15\u201330 minute block of time. You\u2019ll be surprised how much it adds up without you having to give up on other things you need to do during the day.\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffe Hold yourself accountable for your efforts.\n\n- After you\u2019ve followed your plan of action for one week, ask yourself, Did some activities take more time than you anticipated? If so, why?\n- What was easy? Why do you think it wasn\u2019t as difficult as you initially thought?\n- What could you have done better? Where could you have used shortcuts?\n- How can you improve the following week? Can you dedicate a bit more time to one activity to make more progress towards your important goal?\n- How will you measure your success? Can you set milestones to reach each week or deadlines to stay on track? Will you measure your progress in a journal or spreadsheet?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oz6u7y/how_to_force_myself_to_do_things/h7ya28y/"}
