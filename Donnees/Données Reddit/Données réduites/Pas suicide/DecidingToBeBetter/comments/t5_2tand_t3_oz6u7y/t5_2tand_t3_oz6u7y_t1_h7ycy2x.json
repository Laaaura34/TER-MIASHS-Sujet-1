Sorry if you feel like all your effort in this comment was for nothing. But anyway, would \"finding a longer-term romantic partner\" be a viable goal? I honestly don't feel so sure about this but it seems to be the only goal I can come up with (and I attempted thinking of others before, with no success) and I feel like it's such a huge goal, I feel like I probably couldn't reach it anyway. Not because I'm ugly or anything, but because, well, I'm just not doing anything in my life. My life is kinda boring and I'm not even financially independent. I wouldn't even want to get into a relationship in my current state anyway. But the thing is, I'm still not doing anything about it. Because there's no real motivation. I just... accepted that I'll be alone and that's the end of it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oz6u7y/how_to_force_myself_to_do_things/h7ycy2x/"}
