I was in a more or less similar position last year (more emotionally and with habits than anything). One thing that really helped me in addition to writing everything down was to break down my goals into small categories, and pick a month for the entire year to focus on it. IE, for Jan I focused on hygiene, Feb I focused on order, March was exercise, etc. The idea behind this is it takes about a month to make or break a particular habit. I actually got the idea from this sub, but I forget where (and I made my own take on it anyway...)\n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qcab83/starting_with_walking_to_get_to_running/hhizjva/"}
