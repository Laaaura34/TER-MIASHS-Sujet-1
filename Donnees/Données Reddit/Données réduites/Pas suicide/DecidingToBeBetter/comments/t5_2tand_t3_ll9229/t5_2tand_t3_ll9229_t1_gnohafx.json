It also destresses us which is beneficial not just for our health but because when we're relaxed, we come up with more creative solutions for tackling challenges. \n\nAnother reason that your approach is the right one is because it focuses us on what is going in the 'now.' When we live in the now, we become more aware and appreciative of even the smallest things. This is good for helping us to develop resilience, our ability to deal with whatever life throws at us.\n\nAs a life coach, I come across too many people who are either fixated by the past and, therefore, sleepwalking through life or who rush headlong towards the future set on reaching their destination as quickly as possible. This is sad because both these types of people miss out on the journey. The journey is more important than the destination because it's the process through which we grow and learn and appreciate.\n\nWell said for reminding readers to recognise that it's our life. We must all take responsibility and shape our outcomes.\n\nWishing you every success with your new approach.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ll9229/finally_deciding_and_dedicating_myself_to_take/gnohafx/"}
