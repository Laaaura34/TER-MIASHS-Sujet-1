For me, everytime I started to skip classes, everytime I started to procastinate, everytime I binged junk food, everytime I skipped exercise, etc., all of this things gave me rushes of dopamine that I later regret. When I start doing things, especially going to classes and not procastinate that much, is when I start to feel proud of myself, I feel so good about myself, even though I'm insecure in other parts of my life.\nI think no change is easy, and sometimes you have to live through a lot of pain for you to realize how much you need to change in order to feel better about yourself. For me, it was a very sudden breakup with a girl I liked and it was because of my mistakes and insecurities, after this I learned that I needed to fix myself, I needed to be happy with my own self in order to start enjoying life as it is. I think therapy helps as well.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/geh81m/replacing_easy_dopamine_fix_with_long_term_self/fpog0mt/"}
