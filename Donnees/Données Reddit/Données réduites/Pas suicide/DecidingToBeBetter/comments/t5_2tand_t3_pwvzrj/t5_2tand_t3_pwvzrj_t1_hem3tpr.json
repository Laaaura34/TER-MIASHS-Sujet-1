Everyone loses their youth, eventually, and everybody has regrets. Everyone. \n\nEven the most attractive and privileged college students, who started at 18 and graduated at 22, feel depressed and anxious. Well they get a job? Why am I not married? What graduate school will have me? Now I\u2019m living with my parents? I\u2019m nothing if I\u2019m not in college.  My degree is useless, look at my debt!
