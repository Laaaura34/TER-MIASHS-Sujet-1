I've been depressed since i was a teen and now im approaching my mid 20s so *sick & tired* of my negative self talk. if anyone treated someone the way i treat myself, it would be considered abuse.  i cant take it anymore but its what I've been familiar with for about 20 years. i am at a crossroads and the only thing stopping me from taking a healthier path is my fear of uncertainty.\n\nfor me to feel ~~young again~~ healthy, i know i need to change my diet and change how i talk/perceive myself. i just have to make a plan though. also i been off Instagram, tiktok, and facebook for a few weeks. i feel so much better just by being off of those socials. being off those socials, I've made more time and energy to focus on better things.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwvzrj/what_can_i_do_to_feel_young_again/hekaoaf/"}
