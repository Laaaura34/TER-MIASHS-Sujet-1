I call it rewiring my brain/thinking. \nIMO, from my experience, they talked me through just things in my life, what I wanted out of counseling and then we talked about what things in my life I think could have had an impact on why I was there. And she mainly gives me things to think about myself, rather than telling me to do or not to do anything (like some TVs/movies make you think)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwvzrj/what_can_i_do_to_feel_young_again/helqwy2/"}
