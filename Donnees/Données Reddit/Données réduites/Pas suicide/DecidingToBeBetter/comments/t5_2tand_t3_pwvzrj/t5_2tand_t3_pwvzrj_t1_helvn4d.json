I sort of \"went wild\" a couple years after I graduated from college. Traveling, rando sex, booze/drugs, moving to a new country. All wonderful except for the random sex, that was fairly hit or miss. I'm settled and content now, but these things make me feel \"young\" right now: going to see my friends wherever they live. We usually do novel things + eating out + dressing up + drinking (sometimes). I got together with several girlfriends this weekend and we hiked & went to the beach, had a bonfire, played board games, went to a flea market and chilled on the patio. It was amazing. \n\nTraveling with my partner and trying new things. Due to COVID, everything is domestic & within driving distance, but it's cute! I tried an apple dumpling for the first time at an apple festival recently. There were Amish people everywhere. Totally new for me.\n\nI wear whatever the hell I want. This includes Crocs.\n\nI listen to new music releases.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwvzrj/what_can_i_do_to_feel_young_again/helvn4d/"}
