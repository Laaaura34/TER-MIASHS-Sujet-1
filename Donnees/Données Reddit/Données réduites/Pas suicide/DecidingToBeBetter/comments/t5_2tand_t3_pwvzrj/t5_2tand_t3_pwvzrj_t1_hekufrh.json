Yes there was good moments here and there, but mostly it felt like jail and routine for everyone. No wonder that current society makes you depressed, because it is depressing, but you can try to escape it if you hate it that much (I do), just because 9-5 is a standard doesn't mean you have to follow it. If you manage to get some gpu's, 30k investment in crypto mining would yield you 5k a month and you would not have to work. Invest in s&p 500 monthly and long term so you don't hold everything in crypto. On average every 5 years your money in S&P doubles. Try to get a remote job and maybe a part time one at that, you probably don't want to spend your life in a cubicle. I'd suggest learning programming if you're into that, but there are many kinds of remote jobs, it's not too late to learn. Shout out to TheOdinProject. Then with all the free time you have left, travel the world and party, experience different cultures, find what you are and what you like, taste many different foods, have a bucket list to complete, maybe vlog your experiences and when you are ready you can settle with someone. Maybe something sticks from here idk, you do you, this is what I'll be doing, don't live by other people standards, you are given a life and you should enjoy it however you want it, not how you are told to do it. Read or listen to a few best selling self-development books, they should help you untangle your mind.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwvzrj/what_can_i_do_to_feel_young_again/hekufrh/"}
