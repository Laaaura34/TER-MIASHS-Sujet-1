I think her personality just stays hidden until you're close to her. She can choose any guy over her friends tbh. She never offered to pay anything for us (not saying we need or want that) but she spent one evening with a guy and paid all his drinks. \n\nI think she does have strong work ethic. She's a great pianist and violinist. I try to find flaws but that's the only thing I can find. I think those \"advantages\" already gave her the ability to be 10 steps ahead of us tbh.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ogi98f/dealing_with_jealousy/h4j71yj/"}
