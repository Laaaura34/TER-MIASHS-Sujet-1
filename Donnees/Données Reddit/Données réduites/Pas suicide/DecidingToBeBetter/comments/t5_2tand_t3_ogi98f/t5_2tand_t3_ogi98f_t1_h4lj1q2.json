I think jealousy springs from the illusion that people can be reasonably compared (like one species of apple to another). And perhaps we can be, but I don't think it's to our benefit - I think it's an instinct taught to us by fearful minds and those who never questioned them. We compare ourselves to those we think are experiencing *our* happiness but in *their* lives.\n\nOnly you can experience what *your* particular sense of happiness and peace feels like. Continue to chase it and welcome genuine allies where they appear. But this peer of yours, however successful she may appear, also has her own struggles. If you believe you understand the full story when only part of her iceberg is visible, you may get confused because the pieces don't add up.\n\nIf you'd like something actionable: gently and respectfully put some space between yourself and her. Spend more time with kind, patient and authentic people. If it's not too scary, spend some time with yourself. Ask yourself big questions, play with your ideas and be gentle if you find your instincts are inwardly judgmental or harsh.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ogi98f/dealing_with_jealousy/h4lj1q2/"}
