We just went out to eat 4-5 times, and nothing ever happened between us, not even kissing or holding hands. We both then came to the mutual conclusion that what was forming was a friendship, not anything else. We\u2019re still friends, and both of us now have significant others that we are happy with. I think I\u2019m seeing him for dinner soon, and I\u2019m thankful I gained him as a friend. Every person you meet serves a purpose in your life, even if it wasn\u2019t the way you originally intended!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mple28/im_taking_charge_of_my_dating_life_by_not_taking/guc3qc9/"}
