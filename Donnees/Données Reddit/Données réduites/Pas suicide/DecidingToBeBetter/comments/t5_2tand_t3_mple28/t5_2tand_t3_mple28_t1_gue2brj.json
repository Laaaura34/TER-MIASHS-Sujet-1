We were mutually attracted to one another initially, went on a date, and then we kissed. It was just.....wrong. I dont know how to describe it. We both thought so.. But we were both adults about it and ended up being best friends, and later roommates. Years later I officiated his wedding, and a few more years later his wife was one of my bridesmaids when I married the person I had that sort of enduring attraction to. He is now Uncle Toby to our kids, and my  oldest friend (20 years and counting.)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mple28/im_taking_charge_of_my_dating_life_by_not_taking/gue2brj/"}
