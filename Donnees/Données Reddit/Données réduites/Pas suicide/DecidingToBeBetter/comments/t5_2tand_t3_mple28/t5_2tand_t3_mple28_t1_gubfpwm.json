As long as BOTH are on the same page. Can you imagine finding out your spouse only married you for practical reasons or because they simply didn't want to be alone? I've heard of marriage of convenience. But situations like that are only fair if that's what both of them want and are fine with. I had coworkers who tried getting me to give guys who liked me a \"pity date\". How is that nice or doing anyone any favors? All it would do is lead the guy on and make me feel awful. I don't go out on dates just for something to do on a Friday night. Or to take advantage of someone who wants to spend money on me/buy me things. Regardless if the guy was ok with doing so, I wouldn't feel comfortable with it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mple28/im_taking_charge_of_my_dating_life_by_not_taking/gubfpwm/"}
