I was about to ask this girl out, completely nervous like is it the right time for me to step forward? I didn\u2019t mention it. She went towards this route. Sadly she wanted to be friends. I was very sad but at the same time I accepted myself. It feels weird but I\u2019ve never had a friend that talks to me everyday about a specific game and in general conversations.\n\nI hope she\u2019s open about depression and anxiety. I know this topic can be excruciating, but I really care. I\u2019m very worried, and she told me not to. \n\nWe made a promise not to lose each other. I hope that promise will set more closely to ourselves in the future.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mple28/im_taking_charge_of_my_dating_life_by_not_taking/guc9f64/"}
