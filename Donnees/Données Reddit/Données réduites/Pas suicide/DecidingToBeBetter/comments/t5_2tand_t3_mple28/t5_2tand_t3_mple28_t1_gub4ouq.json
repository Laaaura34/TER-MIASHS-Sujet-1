Years ago I went on a date with \"Bob\", moment I saw him I didn't like him. Nothing specific. I think he felt the same but we continued our date after lunch, giving it time. Everything he liked I didn't. Date ended and we parted ways.\nMaybe a week passes and he calls leaving me a message, very polite \"just friends\" and wishing me luck etc in the future. Perfectly reasonable.\nMy ego took over for a second, how dare he blah, blah blah. Took a breath and realized he was right and at least he had called. No harm no foul.\nI think if I had been there to answer the call my ego would have done the talking...which could be why many people \"never call\"", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mple28/im_taking_charge_of_my_dating_life_by_not_taking/gub4ouq/"}
