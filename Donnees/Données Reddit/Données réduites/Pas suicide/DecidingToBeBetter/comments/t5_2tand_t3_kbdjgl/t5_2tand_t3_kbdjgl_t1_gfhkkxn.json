It\u2019s not bad to crave some praise from her, it\u2019s human.\n\nAs someone who grew up feeling dirty and unlovable, I understand the pain. I craved praise from my mom for a long time. Then, I started to learn how to love and trust myself. I worked on accepting myself. After a while (it takes time) I began to feel sorry for my mom because I realized that it was her issue and not mine. Now our roles have flipped and she\u2019s always asking me, her former rotten screwed up child, for help and advice.\n\nSo flip the roles, your poor grandma, how messed up and damaged she must be to treat you so badly. Feel sorry for her; in the end, you may find that you don\u2019t need praise from someone so messed up. \n\nListen to your friends who love and support you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kbdjgl/the_first_time_a_family_member_asked_me_how_i/gfhkkxn/"}
