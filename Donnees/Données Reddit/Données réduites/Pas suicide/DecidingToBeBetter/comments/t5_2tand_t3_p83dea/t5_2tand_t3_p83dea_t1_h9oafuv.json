As long as you tried. \n\nIt was consistently said to me. I have the same issue as you, and I try to tell this to myself. Trying something and failing, which includes not being perfect in the process, is better than not trying at all. We have one life to live. People who would see you negatively for trying, or who might make fun of you... Have some issues themselves. Those are probably not people you would want to keep company with. Their opinion can be thrown in the gutter, it's useless. \n\nIf you get praise or if you get ridiculed, it doesn't matter. \n\nI hope this doesn't sound harsh. I personally just block people out when I'm in the zone and trying something new. I honestly do noticeably better than when I start worrying about what's around me. Everyone messes up. It's nice to find friends and family who are supportive at a distance that helps you grow. \n\nThat's what has helped me. I hope it can help you.\n\nI have tried playing golf, rock climbing, lifting weights (I am still nervous to do new things at the gym on free weights, but I pretend that nobody is there), hacky sack (sp?) (Which I suck at), learned to ride a bike at an older age, and more. \n\nI used to deny trying anything new because I hated being seen as incompetent. But that mindset gets in the way of living your best life. Everyone fails, those who have found success know that. It's fun to laugh at yourself. As long as you are really trying.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p83dea/how_to_not_be_afraid_of_being_seen_trying/h9oafuv/"}
