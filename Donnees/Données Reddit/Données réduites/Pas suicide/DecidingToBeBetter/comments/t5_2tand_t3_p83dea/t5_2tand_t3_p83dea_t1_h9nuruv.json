I did not like being bad at things. I was a smart kid, that was luckily athletic, so naturally I was good at sports, and most topics in school. However, if I wasn't immediately good at something, I hated it. I hated not being perfect at something. I often would rather not do it, then to be seen as not being good at it. For some reason I had this idea that it was embarrassing to NOT be good.\n\nAs I started to grow up - I realized that all we really can take with us from day to day, is our experiences. Any task or skill we learn is with us for far longer than any physical objects in our lives. I started to understand that learning tasks and learning HOW TO learn new things was far more valuable then being good at things. Because what you want to be good at, changes throughout your life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p83dea/how_to_not_be_afraid_of_being_seen_trying/h9nuruv/"}
