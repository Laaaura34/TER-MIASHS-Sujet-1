Ask all the questions to everyone there, maybe even make a stupid joke about how you\u2019re gonna not be the best at this (if it feels natural), take off any mask you have about it, even if you think you might be kinda good at it. I make sure everyone knows I might fail because then any potential expectation they have of me is already Diminished. So if I\u2019m good I\u2019m good, if im bad, it\u2019s fine. Probably not the best route to go cuz sometimes it sets people up to have poor expectations from me (when our towards more serious things) but it\u2019s an escape route I use. I\u2019m trying to work on selling myself short lol.\nAlso just force yourself to be uncomfortable sometimes.
