I've never been on a skateboard before! I was geeked out with the helmet, the knee pads, and I couldn't go more than 2 feet without stumbling/falling. I also learned on a boardwalk that is very, very busy and full of people pretty much all the time.\n\nI'm sure a few people snickered at me honestly. But I'll never forget three separate people that passed me and gave me props for trying to learn. One even said \"The first time is the hardest - you're doing great!\" and that made all the difference.\n\nGoing with my husband also eased the nerves. Maybe try something new with a friend? Partner? Family member?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p83dea/how_to_not_be_afraid_of_being_seen_trying/h9pk6dd/"}
