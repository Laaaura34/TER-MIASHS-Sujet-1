I'm so terrified of failure and everyone smirking, saying knew she couldn't do it etc it stops me trying in the first place.\n\nI know people probably don't ever think like that, it's just what my brain tells me, but it doesn't stop me listening.\n\n2 things I can offer as advice.\n\n1. Talk to yourself as you would talk to a friend. If you slipped up one day would you tell your friend they are a failure? No, you'd tell them don't worry about it and just pick up where you left, you are doing great.\n\n2. Stop negative talk. This is something I have to seriously work on and my doctor has referred me for CBT to get over this, but I think you could honestly find the same help on the internet or in self help books.\n\nEvery step we take in the right direction is bringing us closer to where we want to be.
