I had a very poor working memory (ADHD sucks), so I take some amount of time to settle my mind and think about it. So when a teacher explains something to me, I don't get it right away. I have to analyse it piece by piece before applying it. There was this one time where my teacher asked me to come to the board and solve a basic force-balancing problem involving a pulley, I couldn't do it and it stressed the f\\*ck outta me when my classmates started laughing at me, i couldn't take in whatever that he was saying, he then thankfully told me to go back to my seat. I was portrayed as an idiot in front of the whole class for the first time. It did make me sad for awhile ngl. BUT I did not start hating my physics classes nor did I lose interest in learning it. I worked my ass off, I had numerous other instances where I was made the clown of the class by the teacher. I did not let that affect me, at that point, I had gone through people laughing at my inabilities so many times that it stopped hurting. I did not stop asking stupid questions, I tried my very best in learning what I like, and I was no longer getting affected my people giggling and laughing. I, then, proceeded to top the class not only in physics but other every other course that I took. What's the worst that could happen? a few giggles? Are you really so weak to let someone's laughter discourage you from doing something worthwhile?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p83dea/how_to_not_be_afraid_of_being_seen_trying/h9nqdk9/"}
