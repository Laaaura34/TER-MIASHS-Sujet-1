It definitely sounds like your experience of it is negative, like the way it makes you see yourself is negative. But...what if it's a blindfolded guard, trying their best to protect you from even worse negative feelings? You don't have to be thrilled about it, but I think its reason for being is probably a key to the puzzle you're working through.\n\nAdditionally, I'd ask if there are people in your life you do feel comfortable around when going out on a limb or attempting something difficult? Perhaps preparing \"little vulnerabilities\" or \"small attempts\" to build up the muscle you're looking for could be a route to more confidence.\n\nLastly, (and please let me know if you'd like any elaboration) I think the trick is less \"not being afraid\" and more so \"why am I afraid? Can I answer that with bravery and love?\" And I think that you can. I think fear often holds onto what is and what was and bravery nods to what will be. To me, that's what your post (and I suspect your current thoughts) are pointing towards. I believe in you, earnestly.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p83dea/how_to_not_be_afraid_of_being_seen_trying/h9ucgy9/"}
