Maybe you did figure it out (apparently you did) but not everyone is so lucky. There are lots of cases, for example, of scientists or mathematicians who will dedicate their lives to trying to work out some problem without success. It's absurd to say the problem isn't important to them.\n\nFor some people, some of their personal problems will be like that. Not every problem is destined to be resolved within a human lifetime. And if a person says \"well, I'm going to spend my time elsewhere then,\" that's not an excuse, nor does it mean the problem isn't important to them. Sometimes it's good to take a break when you hit a wall, and sometimes it's good to abandon some projects. There's nothing to excuse here.
