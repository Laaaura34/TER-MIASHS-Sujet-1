I struggled with an ED in highschool. What helped me get out of it at first was nutrituon shakes (like the old ppl ones) because it got so bad for me that I couldn't physically eat food. Then smoothies (mmm peanut butter banana strawberry was my go-to, I lovee them), and just literally anything I felt like I could eat (nutrition went out the window, and thats OK. \"Fed is best. All food is fuel\" -a nutritionist I consulted once). ALSO see a therapist or psychologist if you can!! Mine started because of depression..learning how to solve the mental struggle was really important for solving the ED (and starting to feel really good about myself) too. And then I started watching cooking videos on youtube and learning how to cook! That helped so much! I really enjoy cooking, and tasting the food I eat, and cooking for other people makes me happy and gives me validation and attention. Good luck, and don't look back!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gr08iq/today_marks_the_day_ive_consumed_the_highest/fryjbsg/"}
