Some things were minor and not things I wanted or needed to change, but others things were things I didn\u2019t like about myself- I was rarely exercising, never cooked, and had let certain hobbies outweigh other priorities.\n\nThe biggest thing on making changes in your life is momentum. I focused on the things I wanted to change and tried to incorporate them into daily life through repetition. Early on, I kept a journal of the progress I had made. Small, daily progress can grow into realized change. I started traveling more (which I realized I really enjoy), and making serious attempts at writing (which I had talked about for years but never started).\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to make bigger changes. Life is long, and there\u2019s plenty of room for mistakes, which will invariably happen. A living change or job change can help reset your life and way of thinking. Watch out for places and people that might make you back slide into old habits.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy- you will have bad days, despite attempts at improvements. Over half a year later I still have bad days. You just have to keep powering though on that incremental change.\n\nGetting an app like \u201cTodo-Today\u201d can give daily reminders and the like to help you track your progress. Good luck, it\u2019s not easy, but ultimately can be a formative experience.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/9k5yy8/where_and_how_do_i_start/e6wmejv/"}
