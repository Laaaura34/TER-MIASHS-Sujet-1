I once told a co-worker who was always chatty \"No offence, but please keep conversation with me to a minimum until about 8.\"\n\nI really liked that co-worker. He was fun to talk to. I just couldn't process anything that early and it was frustrating.\n\nNow I can go to work much later. I've rolled into the office at 11pm some days. I get much more done at night for many of the reasons stated in the article. Quiet time to think and plan while the rest of the world sleeps and my mind is alert and functioning.\n\nI don't fall asleep until about 2am most nights. Sleep by midnight is early for me, and 4am is late.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/4s9fr1/the_unfair_advantage_goes_to_the_early_bird_why/d58bg50/"}
