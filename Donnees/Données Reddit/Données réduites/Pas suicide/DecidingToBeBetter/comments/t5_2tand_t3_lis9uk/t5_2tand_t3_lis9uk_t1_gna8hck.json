Prior to running, I actually started out with trekking, there\u2019s an easy 3KM trail near my house. I went everyday in august - September and then afterwards I began running around my neighbourhood. Slow runs and built my way up to where I am now!\n\nThat is wild and brilliant! Congrats and also keep it up! I have a hard time being as consistent as i'd like. I manage 3 times a week most weeks for the last couple months, trying to strength train on my non running days. But I struggle with depression and find it hard to get out of bed much less run/exercise the days its bad. I've been keeping track and have managed to exercise or run 31 days this year so far.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lis9uk/i_ran_10km_this_morning_for_the_first_time_in_my/gna8hck/"}
