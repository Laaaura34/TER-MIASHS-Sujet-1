It felt like torture LOL. \n\nBut I literally can\u2019t run for more than like 2 minutes straight, so I\u2019m definitely going to try to start running again, just because of health reasons. I don\u2019t have asthma or anything, I\u2019m just ridiculously out of shape.  \n\nI remember my sister used to run, and when she was starting out, she would run 1 minute, then walk 1 minute. So I\u2019ll probably try that. :) \n\nI\u2019m lucky to have beautiful trails around where I live, so I might as well use them!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lis9uk/i_ran_10km_this_morning_for_the_first_time_in_my/gned8mh/"}
