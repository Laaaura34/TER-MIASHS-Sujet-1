But i don't really care where you're from 12k a year seems like not enough in any scenario. Especially for what they were having you do. I would agree with you though, as abusive as this place was to me the experience I got was extremely valuable. There is still some good that came out of this place but at the toll of my own sanity and happiness. It sounds like you got out of where you were, and I'm happy for you!
