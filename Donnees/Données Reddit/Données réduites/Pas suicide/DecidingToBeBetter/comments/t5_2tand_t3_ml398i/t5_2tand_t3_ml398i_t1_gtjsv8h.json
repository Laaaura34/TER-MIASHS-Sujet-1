No appreciation or recognition. I was paid \u00a312k a year for running the head office of a multi million turnover company, covering for the IT department, supervising contractor works, managing the fleet of vehicles, some purchasing.. I was stretched thin quite considerably.\n\nI would say that the breadth of experience was very beneficial in the longer term. I look back as it being a formative couple of years where I learnt a lot across many disciplines and what boundaries need to be set down with employers. I agree with being aware of what your contribution is and always be aware that we deserve to be treated with some respect and consideration for our personal wellbeing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ml398i/i_quit_an_abusive_job_and_now_normal_jobs_seem/gtjsv8h/"}
