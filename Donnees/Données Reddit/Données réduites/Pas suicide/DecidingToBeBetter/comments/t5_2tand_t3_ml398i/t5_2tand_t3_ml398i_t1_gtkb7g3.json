Then the last 2 weeks were basically me transitioning my work load to the people that didn't want to help me in the first place. It was a great feeling. The new job, to nobodies surprise at this point was very understanding of the 2 week period before me starting. \n\nGood luck! keep your head up.. Its hard to come to the conclusion that where you are and where you been working is a toxic environment. At least for me it was, I'm the type that wants to work somewhere for 40 years and retire knowing my work and experience gained was appreciated.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ml398i/i_quit_an_abusive_job_and_now_normal_jobs_seem/gtkb7g3/"}
