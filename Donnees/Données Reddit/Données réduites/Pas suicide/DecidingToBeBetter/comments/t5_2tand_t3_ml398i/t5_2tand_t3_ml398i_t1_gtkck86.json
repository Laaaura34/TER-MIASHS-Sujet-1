I left a toxic job (my very first job, ever) six months ago and joined a bigger company. I couldn\u2019t believe that the work was split up evenly because I was so used to struggling to do everything myself. I also used to work during every \u201cvacation\u201d I took at my old company, but this new company takes time off very seriously. The difference is truly night and day....I think it\u2019s so true that sometimes you become blind to the environment when you feel it\u2019s \u201cNormal\u201d or the best you can get, until you reach a breaking point. \n\nOnwards and upwards, glad you\u2019re getting the appreciation you deserve now, and thanks for sharing your story!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ml398i/i_quit_an_abusive_job_and_now_normal_jobs_seem/gtkck86/"}
