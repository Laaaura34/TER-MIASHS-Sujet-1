The people that just didn't want to do my work are now doing it. Anytime I asked for help the people that were supposed to help me are now stuck doing it without any choice. That's where my victory is. I don't really care to sink the company but I was basically a target for everyone to give their work to and I had hard time saying no. I still talk to those co-workers on a weekly basis. I was also the person everyone came to bitch about the very things I left for, so add in therapist to the list i guess LOL. But they're doing ok still, i know its not the most satisfying of things to hear but if it makes you feel better the victory I was looking for was won.
