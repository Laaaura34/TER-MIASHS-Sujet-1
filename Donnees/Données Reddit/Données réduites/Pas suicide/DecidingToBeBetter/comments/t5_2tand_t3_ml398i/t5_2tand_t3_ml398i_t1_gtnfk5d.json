Everyone was feeling what I was feeling, but they've been promised too much they think by sticking around they will still get what they were promised. I really do hope they get what they were told, but I sincerely doubt it. I know a few people were salty, but it was those people who didn't want to help me when I had asked for it. Just seemed like the perfect parting gift. The company itself is doing fine, no business has really been effected by me leaving because my job wasn't necessarily difficult just time consuming. They just didn't want to give any time to me to help out, so now they just have to deal with it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ml398i/i_quit_an_abusive_job_and_now_normal_jobs_seem/gtnfk5d/"}
