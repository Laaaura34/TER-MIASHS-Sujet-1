I used to work for a company that was heavy on the presenteeism culture, and paid peanuts, and thought that shouting like Gunny Hartman was the best way to motivate an employee. They actually insulted me like schoolchildren when I said I preferred to be at home with my partner (now soon to be wife). \n\nSo, I worked to rule. No more, no less. They still fired me, for performance issues, and told me that perhaps IT isn't for me.\n\nFunny thing... my next proper job after that pays me more than twice what I was earning there, with less work, and somehow more responsibilities, with a proper budget. Night and day, indeed.\n\nCongratulations on your new job.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ml398i/i_quit_an_abusive_job_and_now_normal_jobs_seem/gtk1nbp/"}
