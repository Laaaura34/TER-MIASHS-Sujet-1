I also worked for a fiber optic company where I ended up taking way more responsibilities than I signed up for, taking over management\u2019s duties because they had no idea what they were doing. I had excellent managers who ended up leaving one by one till I got the manager that ended up firing me cause I told him he was misusing the data he was compiling. What you described in your post is a job that three to four departments should be doing, and I\u2019m glad you were able to get out. For whatever reason, telecom is a small world and they keep hiring the same managers while rotating them out from state to state. I\u2019m glad to be out of that industry, and hope you have a better experience at your new gig!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ml398i/i_quit_an_abusive_job_and_now_normal_jobs_seem/gtlennp/"}
