From a small company of seven (though two barely did their jobs, two were on maternity, and one part time), paying scraps, insane micromanaging, and screaming at employees (and each other - two bosses) at a daily basis. \n\n\nI moved to a job where they are strong believers in showing appreciation. Weekly shout outs, always taking pride in each other, a support network for mental health, and just all around a very strong business structure. It's a culture shock to say the least.\n\n\nAnd yes, I do get paid more!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ml398i/i_quit_an_abusive_job_and_now_normal_jobs_seem/gtjr8bq/"}
