It seems like you are pushing a lot down and not dealing with it. Therapy is great for helping you be more honest with yourself. As we grow up, we develop all these coping mechanisms to push the bad stuff away. People who live honestly and who are aware of their flaws are just much better to be around. Trying to be friends with someone who always has a wall up is tiring. But people who are actively trying to improve are awesome. I recommend reading the Art of Being. He explains why everyone should be in therapy. We should all strive to know as much about ourselves as possible. Think of it as a challenge. An exciting journey :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dmr9zc/can_anyone_here_explain_the_stepsprocess_of_how/f54gn7o/"}
