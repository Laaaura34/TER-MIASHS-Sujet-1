One thing that\u2019s helped me is reevaluating what productivity is. I personally shifted it to add self care as well. Things like naps, making good food, stretching, painting my nails, or things doing that bring me joy. Taking care of yourself is a revolutionary act in itself, and being revolutionary is productive IMO. Also, try making a \u201cthings done\u201d list along with your to do list. That way when it feels like you did nothing all day, you can look at that list and be like damn look at me go. Anything from brushing your teeth to cleaning the whole house can be on that list. \nAnd don\u2019t forget to be kind to yourself.
