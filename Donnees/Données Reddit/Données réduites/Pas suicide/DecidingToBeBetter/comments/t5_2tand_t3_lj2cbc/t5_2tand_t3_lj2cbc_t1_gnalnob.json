As I complete each activity during the day, I either check it at the time its complete or later that night when I'm winding up the day.\n\nWhile there are still times that I get anxious about how I'm not \"doing anything productive\", it now soothes me to look at my large, very physical reminder of what I have been doing today, this week and this month.\n\nIt took me years to figure out the Lifeboard solution, and I think each person's solution may be different. At the end of the day though, find some outlet that soothes you when that feeling awakens, ideally something physical that you can easily access (I know a lot of people keep a daily log or Journal).\n\nBest of luck in your Journey :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lj2cbc/how_to_stop_constantly_feeling_like_youre_wasting/gnalnob/"}
