I could see myself under certain sections you listed. But I have a feeling this is little bit exhaustive , like relationships take a lot of time to begin mature and reach a steady state. I feel as we grow old we become particularly choosy about these things. I was an introvert workaholic almost a year ago. But there was an immense emptiness in me or sort of like loneliness and I decided to work on a few things\n\n1. Decisive and Responsible : Quick decisions but take up responsibility all the time. I used to suck at responsibility part but I decided no matter I will take up responsibility for every decision I make, whether good or bad. \n\n2. Beginners mind, but Zen mind : I am a beginner everyday, but I dont have to think like one all the time. This comes after reading Jeff Bezos letter : Day One. \n\n3. Give your time to those who really matter to you and when you do give it with completeness : I stopped checking my phone when I am talking t someone. I began to look into their eyes when we talked. \n\nAllow time to heal. Allow time to flow. \n\nLove what you do. Believe in yourself more than you should. Perseverance pays huge dividends \n\nFor the now and future, I just want to play four roles right: \n\n4. Be a good brother : To my sister, who knows that I will be there regardless of how difficult life can be. \n\n5. Be a good son : To my parents and to my wife\u2019s parents. Take care of them and value them. \n\n6. Be a good husband : An equal, loving and faithful partner to my wife. \n\n7. Be a good father : Someday. Be an amazing dad.
