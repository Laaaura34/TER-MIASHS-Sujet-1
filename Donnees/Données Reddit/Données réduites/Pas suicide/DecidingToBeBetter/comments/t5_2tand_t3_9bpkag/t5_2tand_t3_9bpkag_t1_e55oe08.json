One of the things you will figure out as you get older is that you have to choose what\u2019s important to you. This also means you give up concentrating on other parts. \n\nMy suggestion is to find a way to combine areas, like fitness and socialization. Join a hiking meetup or start taking a regular CrossFit class. You\u2019ll make new friends and meet people outside of the campus bubble many students find themselves in. Health tends to naturally follow if you begin working out regularly. You could also try getting a job at a gym or other health related facility. You\u2019ll meet new people, get free access to the gym, earn cash and create more financial security.\n\nUsing a hobby to make money makes that hobby a part time job. You may lose you love of that hobby by monetizing it. Do something just for you.\n\nAnd lastly, at 25 you are on the first third of your life, don\u2019t burn out this early! Define your most important areas and slide into a new routine that gives you time each month to work on different areas. Call family on Thursday evenings, join a social club or fitness group, take 10 mins before bed to meditate, stop buying crap food, move more, take time to breathe. \n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/9bpkag/key_areas_of_life_to_improve_on_suggestions/e55oe08/"}
