Yes paper!), write down all you can think of on the topic that you\u2019re writing in a spider diagram/mind map/ brainstorm. Use bubbles and arrows and color code stuff. Spend most of your time here, just exploring and organizing info.  Redraw your diagram a few times as you refine your information. \n- soon you will notice that this huge topic is actually lots of interlocking sub topics.\n- convert the diagram to a word document outline. Each \u201cspider leg\u201d is usually a paragraph, each \u201cspider body\u201d is usually a section. If you have lots of things to reference use excel, have a column for the specific quote or reference you are going to sprinkle in to that section.\n\n-fill in the rest with prose. \n\nGood luck!!! You\u2019ve got this!!!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qc1gdc/how_do_i_start_my_university_assignment_that_ive/hheqozj/"}
