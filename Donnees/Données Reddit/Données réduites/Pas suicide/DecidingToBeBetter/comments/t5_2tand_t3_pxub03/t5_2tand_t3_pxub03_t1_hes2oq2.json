Compatible, funny, caring, well spoken, polite, respectful, kind, good provider, etc...\n\nYou broke up with him over the one thing he is not good at...? And you're listening to these other failed, single women give you advice? They are all lying to you to cover up their own miserable lives and mistakes. Most of them are bitter, as well.\n\nIn 6 months, I hope you don't wake up and realize you're a fool.\n\nAfter 20 years of marriage (and counting), I can tell you this with great authority...You probably made a mistake and missed out on a good partner. No one is everything you want in a partner. Everyone is raised different and have different personalities & flaws. When you couple, you accept them as they are. Just like everyone preaches about. But, you can't do that for someone else... Yet, you expect it from a partner. Perhaps a bit unrealistic? \n\nIf you want to date people just like you, you're in for a shock. There's only one YOU. But, now that you're alone...mission accomplished. \n\nNever take advice from people that are serial singles. They don't know how to be a good partner. It's why they're still alone.\n\nI wish you all the best and Cheers.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxub03/starting_life_over_at_32/hes2oq2/"}
