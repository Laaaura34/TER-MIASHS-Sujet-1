We live together and we\u2019ve been overcoming this by setting goals together and opening up much more. Our dedicated \u2018us\u2019 time has been dinners (where we don\u2019t watch tv but just talk), weekly date nights, and weekly hikes. The biggest game changer has been opening up about our emotions and emotional state. I end up being really cold if I\u2019m stressed or worried and I\u2019ve been trying to recognize these situations and being verbal about them. She has a hard time speaking about her emotions in general so I try to listen to her and make her elaborate about what she\u2019s feeling. She the youngest of 6 so I need to make sure she understands that she has is being heard, understood, and respected. \n\nI guess the reason I\u2019m rambling is because what I see that worked for both of us is expressing our thoughts and emotions and even insecurities. I believe this is key for a fulfilling relationship since this builds trust. We all have our crap and we can\u2019t begin to understand or trust each other without vocalizing it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxub03/starting_life_over_at_32/heqo8kx/"}
