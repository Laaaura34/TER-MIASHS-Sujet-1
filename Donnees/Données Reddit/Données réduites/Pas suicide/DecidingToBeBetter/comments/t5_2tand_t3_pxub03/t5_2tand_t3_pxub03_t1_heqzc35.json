In my years as an expat I haven't had a relationship, so everything I have it's just because of me, tags also why I feel like I am behind in comparison to the rest of people around me.\n\nIt takes time, effort and sometimes standing on your own can feel soul crushing, but it's good to be able to do it.\n\nThere's far more flexibility and security sharing a living with someone, but being alone is also a gift that it's hard to give out easily: now that you are alone and will be able to have independence in your own actions, time, day-to-day decisions as well as the long term ones, finding someone with whom to share your time will be a difficult thing, because, if they are going to take space, time and freedom, they better be a positive addition to your life who joins under the terms that suit you, else it's not going to be healthy and won't be worthy to spend that time otherwise either on your own or with someone who does add positively to your life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxub03/starting_life_over_at_32/heqzc35/"}
