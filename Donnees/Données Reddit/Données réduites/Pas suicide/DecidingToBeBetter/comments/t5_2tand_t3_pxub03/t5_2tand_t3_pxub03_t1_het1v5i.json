A lot. They weren\u2019t right for each other. So my mom filed for divorce when she was 37 and dated various men for a while. At 40, she met a guy. \n\nHe was working in the gym my mom used to frequent when my parents were still together and they would exchange greetings but nothing more. He was also married during that period. But somehow, when they bumped into each other again, they were both single and they started dating. Even though they have been on and off throughout the 6 years, he is still so loyal to her and supports her emotionally and financially during this covid period. He makes her happy and still devotes himself to her even though she refuses to marry to him (he\u2019s proposed multiple times but mom doesn\u2019t want to get married again ever, she is fully committed to him though)\n\nAll i\u2019m trying to say is it is never too late. You will find someone who will love and support you unconditionally because all that matters to them is being with you, that they can\u2019t live without you. I don\u2019t want to sound like a cheese ball but fate will bring you together. And all your effort with them will matter to them. Be open to new people and old people because you never know :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxub03/starting_life_over_at_32/het1v5i/"}
