Your life is far from over though, no need to stress about that!  \n\n>Is it really true that people cannot learn to express love differently?

I don't buy firmly into the whole love language thing, though I think kept in broad terms there's some merit to it.  But I think the bigger issue is it sounds like your ex is unwilling to learn/compromise on changing.  Either he thinks it's impossible or he just doesn't have the interest in doing it.  In which case, you're better off finding someone who will treat you better than that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxub03/starting_life_over_at_32/heqrcbr/"}
