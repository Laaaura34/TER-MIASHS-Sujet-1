I *believe* it talks about how to meet someone else\u2019s love language as if it\u2019s not the same as yours, it can be difficult to do. \n\nRegardless though, it sounds as though he\u2019s given up and said he\u2019s not willing to try to meet you halfway. That\u2019s unfortunate but it happens. \n\nThe good news is there are tons of great guys out there who, like you, have found themselves \u201cstarting over\u201d. \n\nGive yourself some time to grieve this relationship and then get back out there. But do focus on getting yourself to a financially independent place. It\u2019s so important to not need to stay somewhere you don\u2019t want to because of money. \n\nYou\u2019re still young and you can most definitely have a happy life still.
