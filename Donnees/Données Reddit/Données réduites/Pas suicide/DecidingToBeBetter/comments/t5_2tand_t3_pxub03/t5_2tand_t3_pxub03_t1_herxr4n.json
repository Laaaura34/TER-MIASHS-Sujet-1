I\u2019m working so I can\u2019t type terribly much right now, but you\u2019re not alone and you\u2019ll be okay. Last year ended a 10 year relationship for me and I\u2019m in my early 30s as well. Ended under similar circumstances.\n\nYou can and will find someone. Don\u2019t worry about that right now though. Focus on taking care of yourself, grieving in whatever way that means to you, and get support from friends and family if you\u2019re able to. \n\nEventually you\u2019ll feel a little better and you\u2019ll be able to start thinking about the future.\n\nI ended up moving across the country. I\u2019m still rebuilding, but I\u2019m really happy and things are only getting better.\n\nBest wishes.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxub03/starting_life_over_at_32/herxr4n/"}
