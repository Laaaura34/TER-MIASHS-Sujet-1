I think that since he isn't willing to put effort into the fact that you need touch and compliments and to hear those words, then maybe he doesn't love you as much as you think. People will at least try to change to accommodate the ones they love. Love includes compromise, understanding, communication, and effort. If you've expressed what you need and he refuses to try, then leaving was the best thing you could do. It's only a sign that he's not willing to make you happy and that life with him would only lead to you resenting him more and more each day. So im proud of you for leaving. Don't worry about finding love again right now or having kids. Focus on your mental health and finances right now. Find a job (or 2) and a roommate (or 2) and keep pushing through. I learned as a woman, it's soooo important to set yourself up so that if a man leaves you, you don't have to go through this. Try to set yourself up for success so if it happens again, you won't have to scramble so much. Save as much money as you can with your job and try to promote and make more money so you can take care of yourself. Eventually you'll find a new partner. It may take time but i know you're capable of finding true love next time. Just don't settle for another 6 years, or even 6 months with anyone who is not worth your time! Good luck <3", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxub03/starting_life_over_at_32/heq39ds/"}
