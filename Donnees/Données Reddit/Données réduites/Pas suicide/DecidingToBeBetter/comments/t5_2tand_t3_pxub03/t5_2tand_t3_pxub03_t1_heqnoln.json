If it helps, remember that there are others out there going through really similar things and people out there who are wishing for the very best for you. I also was in a 6+ year relationship that ended (due to worse incompatibility though) and recently ended a 1 year relationship. I'm 30 and it's tough, I feel lonely right now, and so much more. But I'm realizing that we all move at our pace and it's 100% fine to still be figuring things out in your 30s and beyond.\n\nTo your question, I think the fact that he felt that he couldn't learn to give you the love you asked for and deserve says everything. I believe everyone is capable of change, but it depends if they are truly willing to put in the effort (with some exceptions, like at the end of the day, we are who we are at our cores).
