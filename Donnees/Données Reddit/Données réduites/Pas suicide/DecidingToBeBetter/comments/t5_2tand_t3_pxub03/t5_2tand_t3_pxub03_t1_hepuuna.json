Me (33m) and my girlfriend (32f) have been together for 6 years. \n\nI\u2019ve never been great at expressing my emotions, giving compliments, or initiating much of anything . I\u2019ve just never been good at getting them outside of my head, my head will stop me. I suppose I don\u2019t want her to laugh at me, because in my head I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll believe me. \nIn the beginning, I\u2019d say something kind or the like and she\u2019d tell me to stop, never realizing that she enjoyed it, but her insecurities told her I was lying or the like.\n\nRecently, I was made aware that our relationship felt more like that of roommates. I can\u2019t say I was completely surprised, but it kicked me into gear. I love her so much and couldn\u2019t imagine my life without her. The most important part to me was that I wanted her to be happy. We decided to take a break.\nMuch of our lives still intertwine, so we\u2019re still \u00ab\u00a0together\u00a0\u00bb. \n\nWe\u2019re working on ourselves as well as each other in the mean time. I\u2019m pushing through my thoughts and expressing myself.\nIt\u2019s a partnership, I figured it was worth looking at myself and allowing myself to say what I\u2019m thinking as well as how I feel for her on a daily basis. I honestly feel that the two of us are closer now than ever. It feels light and freeing now as well. We\u2019re so much more jovial. \n\nI don\u2019t know if it will last like this way forever or if I will revert back to my old self. I feel that not only is this benefitting our relationship but also myself.\n\nI hope this helps you and hasn\u2019t just been a rambling mess. Good luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxub03/starting_life_over_at_32/hepuuna/"}
