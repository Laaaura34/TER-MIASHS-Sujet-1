My fiances Love language is touch. He's very much like you in that need. I am like your ex. I used to be very touchie feeling but as time went on I just stopped being that person. Now my love language is quality time. It's hard to live like that and I understand. My fiance is very verbal about his feelings,needs and wants. A lot of why am the way am with love is cause that's how I learned to love. Not by words or touch but with time. Our family histories do play a role in our relationships. \n\nIf you are not happy and he is not wanting to at least try it's sad but it might be over.. or you could try a break. My fiance and I took about a year apart to figure things out. We had been together for almost 10 year (I have bad issues with marriage due to my up bring) which he has helped me work thru..(after many patience years!)\n\nYour never too old to start over! It's scary but i might be what you need! It's your job to make yourself happy and to get what you need. You can't wait for people to get to your level.. well you can if you want to wait or give up a bit of yourself in the process. \n\nGood luck you go this! \nIf you need a friend feel free to DM. \ud83d\ude42", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxub03/starting_life_over_at_32/heu78r5/"}
