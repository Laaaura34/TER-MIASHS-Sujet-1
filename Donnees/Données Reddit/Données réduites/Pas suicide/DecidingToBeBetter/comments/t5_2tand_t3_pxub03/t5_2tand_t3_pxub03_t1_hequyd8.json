I expressed my needs but she was not willing to change or at least try to understand where I was coming from. It was difficult, and still is sometimes, but I have a better sense of my worth now.

It may take some time, but one day you\u2019ll see it happened for the best. Best of luck to you and hugs.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxub03/starting_life_over_at_32/hequyd8/"}
