My current partner also was not touchy at all and that\u2019s also a very important need of mine in a relationship. So we talked about it and he told me it just wasn\u2019t something that came naturally to him but if it was important to me he would try to do things more. It wasn\u2019t a night and day switch but I noticed he started to make more gestures and efforts to cuddle and over time he has become quite affectionate. It\u2019s okay to have needs and healthy relationships try to meet and accommodate both partner\u2019s needs. If your needs aren\u2019t being met it\u2019s perfectly valid and healthy to call it a dealbreaker and walk away.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxub03/starting_life_over_at_32/herh9tc/"}
