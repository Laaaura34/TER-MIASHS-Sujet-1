I dated a guy for 4 years and we definitely felt like roommates (I can count on one hand how many \u2018intimate\u2019 times there were). He proposed to me and 4 months later I ended it - I felt like nothing felt right about it. We had the same talk multiple times throughout our relationship and things never changed. I felt like I settled because at the time I was 30 and I thought the same thing \u2018how can I meet someone and really connect with them at this age?\u2019 I also feel like I said yes because of all of our connections - I worked for his mom and step dad, I didn\u2019t know how that would work separating our stuff, we each had a cat that bonded (I ended up letting him keep my cat even though that was extremely hard to do, but I knew he was in good hands and my cat hated change and I was moving into my parents basement until I figured things out)\n\nBut then I really got to know someone I knew already even better and we have sooo much in common it\u2019s insane! Everything is amazing! I\u2019ve never loved someone like this before and with it also being 100% mutual on every level! We\u2019ve been together now for 3 years and he proposed last month! (I\u2019ll be turning 35 early this coming year) \n\nYour life is what you make of it - there\u2019s only one life to live so live it to your fullest!! Do what makes you happy - don\u2019t just settle if you aren\u2019t happy.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxub03/starting_life_over_at_32/hery2mc/"}
