Good guy but didn't like kissing me, hugging me, wanted humiliating sex only, could only last 2 minutes... Got worse as the relationship wow on. Put up with it for way too long because I loved him, before one day I woke up and realized I didn't anymore.  Divorced him after 15 years together. I'm 40. Already found a man who is a good guy, sexy as hell, constantly tells me I'm beautiful and smarter than him and kisses me all the time. and sex lasts 30+ minutes. However, I'll always have an exit strategy from now on...all women should be ready to walk out at the drop of a hat.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxub03/starting_life_over_at_32/heqzbs8/"}
