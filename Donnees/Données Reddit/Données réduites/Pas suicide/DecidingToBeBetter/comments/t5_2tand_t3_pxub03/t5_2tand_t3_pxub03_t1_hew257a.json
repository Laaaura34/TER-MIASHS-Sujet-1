I get that I have to respect what my ex want(ed) and I would NEVER force them into anything.  But like, what the fuck?  First he can't wait to get home to my wiener and then all of a sudden I'm told he doesn't like being sexual and sees it as an unhealthy attachment - while still living with me and wanting to keep the relationship.  \n\nThe worst part was that he argued against the breakup.  I flat out told him, either you put more effort into sex at least like once a month, or I need to find something else.  He shut down and didn't respond, as always, which was my answer.\n\nLike what the fuck.\n\nI was deeply in love and thought this was it for me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxub03/starting_life_over_at_32/hew257a/"}
