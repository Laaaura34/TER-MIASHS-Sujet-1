Give yourself time to grieve the loss of this relationship. You made a wise decision. Even little things can be very annoying 10 years later. My husband picks up after himself very well except his socks. Lol I can\u2019t tell you how many times I have had to bite my tongue over those damn socks. It is comical but something as big as taking care of your needs isn\u2019t something that you can ignore. \n\nWith that said I was married to my first husband for 21 years when he served me with divorce. He decided me and our teenagers were too much for him so he moved in with his mother. I was 44. I hated men for 3 years and on a dare I agreed to say hello to one man one week. That man turned out to be my future husband. I would have been perfectly happy just being a single mom doing my stuff but I am very thankful for my husband and I am very thankful for my ex husband\u2019s mother. \ud83d\ude0a She did me a favor. \n\nLike I said give yourself time to grieve. You are in the prime of your life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxub03/starting_life_over_at_32/hes969v/"}
