The reasons are things like being taken off a project at work, but when I ask for feedback being told I did a good job and there is no negative feedback. Or one of my old friends never saying yes when I try to organise to spend time with her but always saying yes quickly and being excited if one of my other friends (who she has met through me) wants to come too. It\u2019s like people just don\u2019t want me in their life but don\u2019t really know why.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p6qojo/wanting_to_do_better_but_feeling_lost_any_advice/h9kev9l/"}
