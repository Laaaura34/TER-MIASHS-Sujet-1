I can recognise bits of it from my own feelings. I feel like there is something horrible and off-putting about me but no one will tell me what it is. That I have no reason not to be happy and if I could I ought to get myself out of the way and let someone more deserving live my life and make the most of he opportunities I have. However, from what you wrote I can tell you are a good person who has worked extremely hard for a long time. I can imagine you are tired. You deserve to rest. You sound like a good person, please rest and then focus on doing one thing at a time, like continuing your healthy eating. I bet one area of success will help you feel more effective and like yourself again.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p6qojo/wanting_to_do_better_but_feeling_lost_any_advice/h9g1mzk/"}
