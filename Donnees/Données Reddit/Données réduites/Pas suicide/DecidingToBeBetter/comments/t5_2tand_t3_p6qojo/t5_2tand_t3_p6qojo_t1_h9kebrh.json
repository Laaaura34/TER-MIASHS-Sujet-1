Those comments about someone else taking over and something being wrong with me are more what I feel about myself when I feel very down. Nothing in your message made me think you lack gratitude, it sounds like you have worked very hard indeed. I think i mentioned these feelings I have because I was reading about how you have worked hard to succeed in your career, but now you can\u2019t find your energy and enjoyment any more - and that is how I feel too. But the rest is all me. Sorry, that was very confusing, but my main message is let yourself rest, you deserve it and slowly fix the things you aren\u2019t happy with one at a time, it will remind you how capable you are when you start to succeed.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p6qojo/wanting_to_do_better_but_feeling_lost_any_advice/h9kebrh/"}
