When I found out I was pregnant. I was in a shitty place, drinking almost daily and way too much. Blacking out every night. Couldn't find the motivation to stop. I took that pregnancy test and something inside of me flipped. I never had another drink while pregnant and I quit smoking cold turkey in less than a week. My son is 1 now and I don't even have the desire. He's gone for a sleepover to his grandparents a handful of times and my husband and I have had some drinks sometimes but I dont even find myself drinking to excess those nights and I wake up feeling fine and excited to go get my son! \n\nYou're already a great mom and there aren't enough words to tell you how awesome and fulfilling this new hobby of yours will be, lol! Your baby is so lucky to have a mom who puts their needs over your own. Congratulations! I'm actually so jealous of you! The first few months will be a blur of sleeplessness, bottles and diapers but every day gets better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l7ozts/so_im_preggo_time_to_stop_w_the_blunts/gl8gwwr/"}
