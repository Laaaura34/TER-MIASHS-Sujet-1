I can already tell you're going to be a great mom because you don't see it as \"this baby is making me have to stop smoking weed\" but rather as \"I'm going to stop smoking weed for this baby!\" \n\nIf I can give a quick non-parenting suggestion, do look into anxiety or other mental health treatments! You don't have to be running away from something to simply seek a boost to some chemical that you're deficient in without realizing or knowing it :) I used to do it with food instead of weed! It sounds like all you wanted was to live life as normal but with a boost to something, though you didn't know what, and mental health treatments can help with that! All the best and good luck on your motherhood journey!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l7ozts/so_im_preggo_time_to_stop_w_the_blunts/gladrqo/"}
