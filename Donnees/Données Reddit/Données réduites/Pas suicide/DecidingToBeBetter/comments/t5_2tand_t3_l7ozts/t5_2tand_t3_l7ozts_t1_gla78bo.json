My husband and I are currently trying for a baby and one of the excellent things I am hyped for about being pregnant, aside from becoming a mama obviously, is I can't WAIT to end the cycle of drinking and smoking that I've been stuck in since I was 14 years old. I've cut down both a lot since we've started trying as I want to be as healthy as possible, but still haven't gone 100% sober cos it's SO BLOODY HARD but the minute I get that test positive result it's game over for those guys, and I am never going back!!! Well done you and congrats on being a future mama :D", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l7ozts/so_im_preggo_time_to_stop_w_the_blunts/gla78bo/"}
