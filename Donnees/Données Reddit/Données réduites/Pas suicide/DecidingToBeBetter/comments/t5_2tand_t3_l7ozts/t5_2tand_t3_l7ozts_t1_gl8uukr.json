I have an 8 month old and I am on a similar journey. I didn\u2019t smoke weed but I didn\u2019t take care of myself. I abused adderall, starved myself, and let work be my entire life. \n\nHonestly it\u2019s fucking hard to become a good mom with a healthy, balanced life in such little time. You might fail sometimes or give into temptation a few times. Don\u2019t let it stop you from trying to be the person that you want to be. You *deserve* to be that person.
