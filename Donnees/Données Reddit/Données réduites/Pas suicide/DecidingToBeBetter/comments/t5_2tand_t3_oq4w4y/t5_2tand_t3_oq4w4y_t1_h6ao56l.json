I\u2019ve dated straight up mean people who literally blindsided me with breakups so in comparison, this is a better scenario. And it\u2019s her own personal issues not your\u2019s. I also have been with people I thought I would marry so it is very hurtful when the person ends things. Remember you are your own person and just like she shouldn\u2019t have to rely on you for her self-worth, neither should you. Put all your effort into healing and focusing on you, not what you \u201cdid wrong\u201d (you didn\u2019t do anything) or how to get her back or sit and wait for her to heal.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oq4w4y/am_i_the_problem_in_my_relationshios_or_is_it/h6ao56l/"}
