In this short period that i've known her, she gave it her all and more for me, and that's why i feel broken. I just couldn't imagine her doing this.\n\nI agree, seeing my parents toxic marriage, i've always thought that i never want to be a husband like my father. I want to love and be loved, for both of us to give it our all and more , for us to be faithful...etc.\n\nI know i am young, and never before with anyone else have i felt that i could have kids with this person, that's how much faith i've had in this relationship. Like i've said in a previous comment, it's still not fully over, but i'm not certain of anything anymore. If it is over, i'll learn and grow, just like i've always done after a breakup, the nasty thing about them are that it betters us as a person,but it comes at an immense cost of pain. It seems like we humans only learn from being in pain, just like a child touching a stove...", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oq4w4y/am_i_the_problem_in_my_relationshios_or_is_it/h6a9mwk/"}
