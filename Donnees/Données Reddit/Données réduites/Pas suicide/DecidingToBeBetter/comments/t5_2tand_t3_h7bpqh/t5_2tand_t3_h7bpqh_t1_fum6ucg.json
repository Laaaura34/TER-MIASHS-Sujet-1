Keep on telling yourself that you are someone that deserves happiness and realize that it's true.\n\nAs someone who was (and still am, kind of) in the same situation and mindset, I really really recommend meditation to keep that mindset up. Even if you're skeptical, I would recommend trying it out. Healthygamergg is an excellent source for meditation, mental health, and self care. Here's his video on meditation for starters: https://youtu.be/dvq48pfJa9w\n\nHis video on meditation for ego was also personally helpful for me.\n\nPersonally, I was really in my head, constantly putting myself down while helping lift others up. Meditation helped me externalize myself, if that makes sense. It made me look at myself as another person (as in I look at myself at the way that I look at my friends) so I feel like I'm worthy of the support that I give others.\n\nIirc, studies show (according to Healthygamergg) that on average it takes a good amount of time for meditation to see lasting results (about 8 weeks doing 20 minute meditation sessions at least 5 days a week). I recommend just doing 5 minutes a day to get into the habit of doing it, then ramping up to 20 minutes.\n\nI wish you well!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h7bpqh/learning_how_to_not_hate_myself_and_forgiving/fum6ucg/"}
