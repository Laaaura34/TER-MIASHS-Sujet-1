Spent two days in the hospital and then started therapy and meds. And it took going off the meds, trying different therapists, different environments, foods, exercises, etc etc etc until I finally figured out the root trauma, got specialized CBT and EMDR therapy and now still regular meditation and seratonin enhancing supplements, over a span of around 7 years from that attempt to get to the point where I\u2019m managing and don\u2019t consider suicide semi annually. \n\nIt\u2019s not going to be some quick easy fix. You\u2019re going to need to do some deep digging to really get these demons out but it is possible, my 8 and 4 year old are the proof that it does get better!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg2ygf/failed_suicide_attempt_dont_know_where_to_go_from/ggcjx39/"}
