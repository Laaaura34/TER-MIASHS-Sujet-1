It's an idealized version of social life. It's not real. It's like everyone pretending to be their own internet star. They might look happy but it's not all it seems. What got me out of depression was playing a rhythm game and listening to cheerful music. I know a guy who got out of it from watching anime and then getting into building hobby kits from that anime. I know I enjoyed reading manga and watching anime when I felt down. I am a big geek and I came to accept that and realized I don't really have to share this hobby on social media. Now I read a lot of fiction. Usually literature since there is no pressure to keep up with whatever new thing that's popular if I'm enjoying something that was made in the past and something that stands the test of time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg2ygf/failed_suicide_attempt_dont_know_where_to_go_from/ggcgizj/"}
