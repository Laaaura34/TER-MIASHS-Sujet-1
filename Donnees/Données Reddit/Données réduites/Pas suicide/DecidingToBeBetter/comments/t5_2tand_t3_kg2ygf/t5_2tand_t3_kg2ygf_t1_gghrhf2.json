POLITICS.  COMPLETELY.***\n\nIf you want to survive, and be able to provide yourself with incentives to live, this is the first and most important step.  Do not pay ***ANY*** attention to the news media or current events.  Reading about transhumanism or the Great Reset are a reliable method for causing me to temporarily want to kill myself, as well.  Don't do it.  \n\nIgnore anyone who wants to reprimand you about civic involvement, because if they are willing to do that when you are in your current state, then they do not care about you.  This is about your survival, and ***SURVIVAL COMES FIRST.***\n\n\\-  Stop comparing yourself with anyone else.  You will not develop self-worth for as long as you keep doing that.\n\n\\-  Get rid of any bullying/controlling/dominating people in your life.  I have a father and brother who are both monsters; I am hopefully going to move interstate in the New Year, and I plan on never seeing either of them again after that.\n\n\\-  Don't waste excessive amounts of time on pop culture.  That is time which you could devote to your fitness or learning new skills, instead.  I let myself watch the weekly episode of The Mandalorian, but I have been watching too much other Star Wars crap on YouTube, and I realise that it needs to stop.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg2ygf/failed_suicide_attempt_dont_know_where_to_go_from/gghrhf2/"}
