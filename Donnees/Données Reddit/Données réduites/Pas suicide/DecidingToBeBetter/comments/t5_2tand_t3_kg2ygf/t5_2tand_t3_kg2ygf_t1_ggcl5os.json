Every time was just like yours, they zipped me up or pumped my stomach and sent me on my way with nothing more than a small chat. \nI managed to get my shit together when I finally hit rock bottom, confessed to my family that I was sexually abused growing up and had a massive mental break down which led to me quitting my job and moving in with my mother who I hadn\u2019t had a proper relationship with for a long time. I realised that it was finally time to do something about my mental health instead of sweeping my issues under a rug and using drugs and alcohol to numb the pain. \nI managed to get into government run therapy where I found out I had bipolar disorder. \nThrough getting a real diagnosis I was able to find medication that actually worked and now I have a beautiful life living overseas with my amazing husband. \nSo my tips for you would be to:\n1. Admit to yourself what is really wrong even if it hurts way more than keeping it hidden inside, whether that\u2019s the fact that your partner is keeping you from living your truth, childhood traumas you haven\u2019t confronted or anything that\u2019s really stopping you from being the best version of yourself that you can\n2. Get help. It doesn\u2019t have to be weekly therapy like I had, maybe just a one hour chat with a psychologist could help you recognise what\u2019s really stopping you from being happy \n3. Consider medication, you might not have to be on it forever like I do, bipolar is a neurological disorder which means I\u2019ve got it for the long haul but many mental illnesses can be overcome. Medication can help balance the chemicals in your brain long enough for you to get yourself to a happier place where you can hopefully come off the meds. But if you do need them for quite a while, it\u2019s not the end of the world! Just means your brain needs a little push :)\nAnd lastly 4. Really WORK. You can rely on the people you love or a therapist for help but at the end of the day, your mental health is entirely up to you. Depression is a fucking struggle and I know how hard it is to wake up every day and have to TRY to be happy, it\u2019s almost like the trying ruins the emotion. But your mental strength has to be grown the exact same way as physical muscles, start small and work your way up to being the strongest motherfucker out there. How I did this was getting a journal, tracking my moods, writing to do lists (they make you feel accomplished even if it\u2019s small stuff like making your bed, which can feel huge when you\u2019re depressed), tracking when I\u2019ve exercised/eaten right/drunk enough water (all absolutely vital to beating depression) and tracking habits. Habits are another big one that helped me, pick a new one (like brushing your teeth before bed, meditating for five mins in the morning if you\u2019re into that etc) every week, no more than that so you don\u2019t overload yourself, and focus on just getting that one small action down. Soon you\u2019ll be a fully functioning little thing even if you still don\u2019t feel great about yourself and from there you can build on your mental resilience. \nOh and get vitamin D tablets! Lack of vit D is huge on killing your moods\nSorry that this is so long, your post touched me as I feel like I\u2019ve been in your shoes before and felt absolutely no hope for the future. And now that I am where I am in life I am SO glad those attempts did not work and frankly I\u2019m fucking proud of myself for getting this far and I want you to feel like that one day. Just always always remember there is hope for a better life, you\u2019ve just got to realise you\u2019re in charge and that you\u2019ve got to make some hard decisions and changes for your own well-being. Don\u2019t kill yourself, kill the parts of you that you don\u2019t like and work from there.
