In my case I was admitted both times, first to a medical floor and then to psych. Regardless, I had to go back to the world eventually. The way to pick yourself up, in my experience, is gently. When I left the hospital the world felt too bright, edges too harsh, everything was loud. Be gentle to yourself. \n\nFirst, call a professional. Even if you don\u2019t have insurance, there are community resources. Allow yourself the room to try a couple counselors and find someone you feel okay with. You don\u2019t have to think they\u2019re perfect, but you need to be able to talk and be vulnerable. \n\nBe kind to yourself and your wounds. This is blunt, but don\u2019t pick the scabs or the stitches. Clean them carefully. If there are other effects, tend to them gently as well. If social media is too much, delete it. If your partner is harmful, leave them. Eat, even if it is all comfort food. Especially eat comfort food. Self care is not all face masks and candles. Sometimes it\u2019s building boundaries and tending to your wounds. \n\nIt all seems like so much but it really is the only way to get better. You can\u2019t beat yourself into recovery. Feel what you need to feel, but try not to wallow in it. And forgive yourself. I stumbled over and over before I learned to be kinder to myself, and I was someone labeled a \u201clost cause\u201d. You truly can do it! Looking for help is the first step!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg2ygf/failed_suicide_attempt_dont_know_where_to_go_from/ggcby6q/"}
