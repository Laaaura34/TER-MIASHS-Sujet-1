The scientific (evidenced based) ideal is apparently plant-based, but many obviously and understandably don\u2019t want to give up eating meat, so if you can just make certain substitutions in your day to day life, (swap processed snacks for day: grapes or almonds, swap the VERY fattening Mayo for oh gosh, really anything is better than Mayo! ), and get lots of veggies in! (Veggies = fibre= full stomach! \ud83d\ude09). ( might I recommend the book \u201cHow Not to Die\u201d-changed my perception on food and how it helps us function. And it\u2019s not about depriving ourselves)\n\nAnd I\u2019ve recently gotten back into sports which I forgot how much I enjoy. Feels good to have a good runaround and meet new people. \n\nCongratulations on all you\u2019ve achieved!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/prr54k/down_3_kilos_after_just_one_week_of_diet_and/hdl9tdr/"}
