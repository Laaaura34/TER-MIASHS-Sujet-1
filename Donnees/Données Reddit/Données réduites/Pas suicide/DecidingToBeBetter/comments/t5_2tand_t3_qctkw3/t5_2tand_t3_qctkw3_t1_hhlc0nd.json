It's about replacing internal criticism of self & others with compassion & curiosity about the other: what they're feeling, why they're being that way, how you can make them feel good. \n\nIt feels like a weight off your shoulders when you start.\n\n- Meditation is great for this.\nMetta meditation particularly helps - there are loads of examples on YouTube.\n\n- There's also a CBT technique where you go through the day looking for things that give you a sense of pleasure and achievement. \n\nGood luck!\n\nEdit: the Susan Brady book is directed at women but imho this is pointless gendering (I am F), and the tips apply just as much to everyone.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qctkw3/how_do_i_start_being_a_good_person_again/hhlc0nd/"}
