I became tired of coping with my problems all the time. I woke up, and I realized I just wanted to live. I got tired of the story that I told myself. I was tired of feeling like I was a damaged person. I woke up, and I didn\u2019t want to feel that weight anymore. I wanted to be free. I wanted to be at peace.   Over time, I realized that I am not a victim anymore and that I can create my future. I am the creator of my life experience. I want you to feel that way too.
