I feel so defensive whenever someone has or does something I wish I had or could do, because it makes me feel like something is wrong with me, like I\u2019m not good enough. My self esteem is also bottom of Hell low, so that\u2019s probably why.\n\nMy 10 year relationship ended and now I get sad and angry at the same time at even the hint of someone I know being in love, happy, getting married, having kids (and I don\u2019t even want kids). Someone knows even basic Japanese and I feel ashamed because I struggle to even remember Japanese names in my favourite animes/mangas/video games. I see someone I perceive as beautiful/handsome, and while most people would probably develop a crush or be attracted to them, I pick apart their face to compare to my own just to make myself feel ugly. It\u2019s just become an impulse that I percieve every positive thing in the world as a cruel attempt to put me down.\n\nHonestly, good luck, because I know it\u2019s hard, but I believe in you! Maybe someday I\u2019ll be able to do the same.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hgqa9m/im_gonna_stop_trying_to_one_up_everyone_and_just/fw897dh/"}
