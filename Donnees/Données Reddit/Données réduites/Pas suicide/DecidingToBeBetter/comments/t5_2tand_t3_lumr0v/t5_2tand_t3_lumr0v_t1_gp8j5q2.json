Academic, career, financial milestones, check. Took up running, hit some big goals, check. Travel to other continents, check. Status and acceptance.. sort of, I guess, technically.\n\nTakes about a day and then I\u2019m empty. It\u2019s just what happens, and it\u2019s definitely not just you and me.\n\nLearning to nourish casual interactions with people into friendships changed my life. I did the other things.. got interested in cooking, bicycles, did a ton of reading, sat in with different spiritual groups (as an outsider)... still, just taking the risk of learning peoples\u2019 names and trying to learn about them and even inviting them to eat dinner or hang out on my porch has really filled in those gaps. Terrifying for me. All of those friendships took effort, and started from nothing. It took me a long time to figure out that adult relationships don\u2019t just magically happen. They take effort to cultivate everyday. I thought some people just \u201chad a bunch of friends\u201d and, I didn\u2019t know it\u2019s actually a skill! I kind of bungle my way through it and nobody seems to mind. Authenticity trumps status, I think.\n \nI\u2019ve been out of school for almost 20 years and I STILL get twangs of guilt when I spend a whole Friday night out doing normal social stuff. How fucked is that?!\n\nCould be an American thing or an academia thing, but I feel like I get fed messages every day about achieving things, and The Dream, and someday we can Arrive if we just work hard. If you\u2019re wired a certain way, you\u2019ll achieve the shit out of those goals with single-minded focus, one after another. And then... meh.\n\nI\u2019m just the internet, but truly I think you\u2019re on the right track here, so keep it up.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lumr0v/trying_to_fight_the_emptiness_in_small_ways/gp8j5q2/"}
