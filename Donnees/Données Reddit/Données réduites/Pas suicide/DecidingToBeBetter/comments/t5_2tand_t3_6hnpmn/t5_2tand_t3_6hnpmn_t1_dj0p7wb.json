He has so many interesting things to say. He's got shittons of 2 hour long lectures on his own youtube channel I've been meaning to check out.

Or even just making people laugh with a sense of humour. \n\nedit: Here's his full channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/JordanPetersonVideos\n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/6hnpmn/jordan_peterson_aim_at_the_highest_good_tool/dj0p7wb/"}
