I would recommend sleep early and wake up early. This is already a start. Start with small accomplishments, baby steps. Go for a  short walk in the morning, it won't reduce the weight right away but you can make it a habit. Do small but do daily. Do 500 meters per day for a week its just 3 minutes of walking, do it for a week. Next week make it 1 km, 1 week and keep on increasing the goals week by week.\n\nAs far as your language learning goes, the small.sense of accomplishment by waking up early or going for a walk will compliment language learning or studies. While studying i would also go with rewarda approach, study for 45 minutes and reward yourself for 30 mins by using your phone and so on. This is just an idea of the start of creating a constant balancing act.\n\nFocus on creating habits.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kj2t2z/cant_stand_the_constant_balancing_act/gguyl8l/"}
