I did hear from a Ted talk (I think) that since our brains are wired to repeat a pattern, it takes about 3-5 seconds to override that pattern. For example, you think \u201cI\u2019ll get out of bed now instead of snoozing\u201d if you don\u2019t do it in the next 3 seconds, your brain will automatically do the pattern of snoozing instead. \n\nSo next time you think \u201cI\u2019m going to do this\u201d don\u2019t hesitate, jump up and scream \u201cNOW!\u201d Then do it. \n\nRight now, tell me one simple thing you want to do.
