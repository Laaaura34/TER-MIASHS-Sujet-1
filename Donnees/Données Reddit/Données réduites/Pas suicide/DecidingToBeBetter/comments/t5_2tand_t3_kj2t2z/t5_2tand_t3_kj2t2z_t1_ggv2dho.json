Ok tomorrow morning, while you\u2019re having your shower or something pick 3 exercises you\u2019ll be able to do. For example, push ups, squats and lifting small weights. Then do 30 of each once a week. Take breaks in between your task, I used to do 10 push ups then have a 30 second break and start again. Easy and simple. \n\nThen pick a day to do it and set an alarm to remind you. When your alarms goes off, you\u2019ve got 3 seconds to get up and start. I don\u2019t care what\u2019s happening, do it! Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kj2t2z/cant_stand_the_constant_balancing_act/ggv2dho/"}
