I have a very internal locus of control and if I'm not doing something that I find meaningful, then I won't do it.  So the reason I wake up at 5am to take the dogs for a walk is to give myself an hour of quiet time before my silly crazy kids wake up.  The reason I do things for others is because -I- find joy in doing things for others.  I read a book recently called \"Better Than Before\".  It really helped me understand that each person has their own inner focus that helps them develop habits.  I highly recommend it.  Good luck to you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mzjsq1/who_has_unwavering_willpower/gw1cdv1/"}
