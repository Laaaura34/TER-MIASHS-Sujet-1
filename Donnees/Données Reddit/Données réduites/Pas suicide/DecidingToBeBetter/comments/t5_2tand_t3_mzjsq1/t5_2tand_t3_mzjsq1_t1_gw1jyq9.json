Thinking that everything should be perfect when I execute my plans. What broke this is to just really accept that I can\u2019t be perfect all the time. Switching from digital notes to paper from time to time also helped since there are no undo buttons on a paper.\n\nThere will come a time where trying to be perfect will exhaust you. I definitely don\u2019t have much unwavering willpower to do what I am supposed to do every day but it\u2019s just a matter of time when I realized that I want to be a person who shows up every day especially to the promises I\u2019ve made myself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mzjsq1/who_has_unwavering_willpower/gw1jyq9/"}
