I also have a toddler and this means studying from 7 pm-2 am every night while she sleeps. Sometimes I really, really, *really* don't want to do that. I'd rather sit back, drink a beer and let my mind unwind. I've been doing this for four months now, usually seven days a week, and it's exhausting. But I do it because I want to be a doctor, and in order to do that I need to get a good score on this exam, and in order to do that I need to study, and in order to do that I need ***time***. The only time I have is between 7-2 am every night. \n\nWhen you look back at everything you'll ever do in your life, all you will have ever needed is time. So I ask myself, \"How do I want to spend each moment?\" The question answers itself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mzjsq1/who_has_unwavering_willpower/gw134n8/"}
