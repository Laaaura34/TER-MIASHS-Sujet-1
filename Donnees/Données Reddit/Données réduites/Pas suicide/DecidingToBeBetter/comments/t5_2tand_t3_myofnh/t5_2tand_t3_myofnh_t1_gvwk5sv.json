And helped like embrace my femininity in like different ways. \n\nAlso 100% loved that I didn\u2019t have to think about it. Shower time was cut in half, no worries about drying or styling after. The grow back process was pretty quick both times for me & wasn\u2019t too rough of a transition as it grew out. Just wore a lot of pony tails for a while lol \n\nObv you don\u2019t have to go that extreme but it ended up being a great experience for me esp with the specifics you mentioned! Hope that helps!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/myofnh/i_need_a_little_push_to_encourage_me_to_chop_off/gvwk5sv/"}
