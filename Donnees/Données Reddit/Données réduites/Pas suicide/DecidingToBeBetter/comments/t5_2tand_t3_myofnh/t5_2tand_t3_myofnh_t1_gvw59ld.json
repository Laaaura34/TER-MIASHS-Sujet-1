Do it!! Free yourself from the keratin shackles that cause you so much grief!!! *push* *push* \n\nThe length of your hair doesn\u2019t define you and you will most definitely still be beautiful with less of it. Hold your breath and take the plunge. You deserve to and owe it to yourself. You know you want to, so don\u2019t stop yourself. Let it empower you to rid yourself of the notion that such superficial aspects are a measure of your beauty or worth as a person. You got this!\n\nI feel your pain with dealing with long hair. I\u2019m a guy with hair past my shoulders. I keep it long because baldness runs in my family and I want to rock it while I still can. Idk who sheds more, me or my cats.\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02\n\nI hope that was pushy enough for ya!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/myofnh/i_need_a_little_push_to_encourage_me_to_chop_off/gvw59ld/"}
