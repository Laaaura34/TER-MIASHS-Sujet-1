Personally I just want to improve somethings each month (and that\u2019s on aggregate - some months you\u2019ll get sick or have to take care of surprises).\n\nFor example Im 37 and I want to be in better shape each year til I\u2019m 55. One of the ways I measure that I pick an exercise that is reasonably difficult to do for 37 minutes or 37 reps. Next year it\u2019ll be 38, then 39, all the way to 55. Then I\u2019ll see how long I can hold that. This gives me 365 days to prepare for the next number.\n\nThat sounds \u201ceasy\u201d but truly the hardest part about habit is consistency. And if I\u2019m in better shape each year til I\u2019m 55, then I\u2019ll be the best looking 55 year old in town.\n\nSame thing with finances. I\u2019m looking for an upward trend each year, not a get rich quick scheme. Same thing with creativity (I\u2019m an author) I don\u2019t want to \u201cgo viral\u201d or have 15 minutes of fame, I want upward trends each year (again in aggregate). \n\nBe patient. Be realistic. Be consistent. Take breaks. Enjoy the journey!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pk6lhd/finally_working_with_myself_rather_than_against/hc28o46/"}
