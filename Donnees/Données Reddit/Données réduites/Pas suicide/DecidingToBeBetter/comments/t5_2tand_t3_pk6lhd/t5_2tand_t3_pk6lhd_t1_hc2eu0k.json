I appreciate your pluck.\n\nI'd like to point out how HUGE some of these goals are. To me they do not match your first paragraph, i.e. \"we need to take it one step at a time.\" Asking yourself to go to six hours a day on one activity three weeks of now is an enormous request to make of yourself and your lifestyle.\n\nMy concern for you would be you're setting yourself up for potential disappointment. So, if you believe you can approach these goals without letting them DEFINE you, I think it's safe. If you're going to apply that \"all-or-nothing\" trap to them, and kick yourself in three weeks if you only run two times instead of four... then I suggest some more reflection here.\n\nI hope you celebrate incremental changes as they come. That's one of the most difficult parts in life, especially in a culture that lauds \"more is more.\"\n\nEdit: typo in paragraph 2", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pk6lhd/finally_working_with_myself_rather_than_against/hc2eu0k/"}
