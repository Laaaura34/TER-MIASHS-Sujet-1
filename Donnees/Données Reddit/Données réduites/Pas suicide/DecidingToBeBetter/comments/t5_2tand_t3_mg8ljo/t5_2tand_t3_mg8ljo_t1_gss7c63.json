In the furst semester of university I was still playing and damn, it was great actually having real life friends to play League with. At that point I had already sunk like 2500h into that game and chased the dream of hitting diamond at least once. \nHowever, my grade in the first semester weren\u2018t great, and that was if I even managed to pass a class. At the beginning of the second Semester I stopped playing and it was the best  decision I ever made. It felt weird quitting LoL after it being such a huge part of my life, but my grades skyrocketed and it really had a positive influence to not longer participate in these kind of toxic days. Now, I play some Red Dead Online from time to time, but I definitely won\u2018t pick up another competitive game again.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mg8ljo/i_decided_to_uninstall_league_of_legends_before/gss7c63/"}
