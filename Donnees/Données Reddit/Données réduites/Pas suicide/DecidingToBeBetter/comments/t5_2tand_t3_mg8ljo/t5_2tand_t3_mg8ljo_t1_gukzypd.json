Silver or below, if you are a BOT laner, don't even bother playing, your lane means nothing. ALWAYS a solo laner will feed and the game will be blown wide open before you can catch the 2 levels you are behind being in a double lane. 1 in 100 games makes it to level 18, where you can actually have an impact.  So if you are a BOT laner or Support, in Silver or Below, change lanes NOW or just uninstall. I chose Uninstall, and my gaming life is so much more happy now.  GOOD RIDDANCE to the TRASH LOL.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mg8ljo/i_decided_to_uninstall_league_of_legends_before/gukzypd/"}
