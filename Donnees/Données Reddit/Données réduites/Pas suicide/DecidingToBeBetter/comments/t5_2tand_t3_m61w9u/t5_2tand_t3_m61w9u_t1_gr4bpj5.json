A couple of my clients, who I used to be an employee of, found out and gave me a \"christmas bonus\" so I could fly out and get it back.  I was humbled and on the verge of feeling very guilty about their act of kindness, but I got a message from them on Christmas day.  It basically said, \"when we met you, we were secretly bankrupt.  We'd lost everything trying to save our drug-addicted kids.  So when times got darkest, we sat down and decided to envision our lives, as we wanted them, in 5 years.  Detailed fully what that would look like.  We had no idea how to get there, but we had the goal at least.  Now 5 years later, *we're better than even that goal*.  We have no doubt you can do the same, you just need to see it.\"  It was good advice, and it helped a ton that these people were vulnerable and shared their story with me.  Without a goal sometimes it's very hard to make progress, or even know when you *are* making progress.  \n\nIn the past 6 months I've kicked meth, alcohol, cigarettes, the fucked-up anonymous sex/drugs scene, taken on a shitton of side work to save our mortgage, gotten in therapy for PTSD, gotten control of my finances and emotions and am rebuilding my marriage in the process.  For me it was the simple act of getting a sponsor, everything else cascaded from there.  For you it might be some other small but significant change.  Figure out what you want, figure out how to get it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m61w9u/it_is_you_make_a_decision/gr4bpj5/"}
