I specifically want to thank the person who posted the tip. Believe it or not, it was not painful with the oil. I have tried everything before, including completely wetting my hair in the shower and adding detangler. My hair would not budge and it hurt. I didn\u2019t think the oil would work either, but I was at a point of willing to try anything. I started by soaking my hair in the shower again. When I put the oil on, I just started brushing. The hair started to separate from the clump. After I was able to comb through it much later. The back of my scalp was a little tender. But not too bad.\n\nEdit: here\u2019s the link to the post that I read which helped me step by step. \n\n\nhttps://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/a/11342/33081", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ldabwt/combed_my_hair_after_2_years/gm5xud7/"}
