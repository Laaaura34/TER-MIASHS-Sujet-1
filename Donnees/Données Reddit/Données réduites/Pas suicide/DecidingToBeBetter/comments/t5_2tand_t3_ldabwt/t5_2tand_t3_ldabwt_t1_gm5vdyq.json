Well I had put Senegalese twists extensions in my hair and when I took them out I just washed my twisted hair without combing it first....big mistake!!! I took them out last September and didn't get my hair combed out till May....if it weren't for quarantine I'm sure I would've had a shaved head by now. It was matted up worse then dreadlocks there were mats in the mats until it was all in like 3 giant chunks I could barely get it into a presentable ponytail!!! Way to go, it's tuff work but I know the sense of relief and accomplishment you felt cause I felt it too finally being able to run a wide tooth comb through my hair.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ldabwt/combed_my_hair_after_2_years/gm5vdyq/"}
