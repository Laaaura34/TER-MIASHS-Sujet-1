I can't really express over the internet how much everything you guys said has helped me already. I posted this without really expecting any replies, I did it just because I was at a very low point, and I was so extremely dissatisfied with my life. But the amount of support I got from completely random people is incredibly overwhelming. Thank you so much for this, whoever is seeing this. Thank you so, so very much.
