Well, he is a psychiatrist, but also my uncle. I dunno if that counts. This was when I was 19. He diagnosed me with PTSD and ADHD. I dunno to what extent that's true, I mean, being my uncle he might have maybe overreacted? PTSD? Really? \n\n&nbsp; \n\nBut he's the only other person who I've told this to. Well, him and now the internet! \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI've never really thought about what it means to me. I've just blocked it out, and told myself it wasn't really a big deal, it happens to lots of people. I've always played it down. \n\nThanks for your response!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3ecbgw/how_do_i_get_out_of_this/cte7yyy/"}
