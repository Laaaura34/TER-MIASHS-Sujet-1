I've read a couple over the years, and I've done that exact thing. Read it and forget it. I felt good about myself for reading a self help book, but didn't take anything from them. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nQuite a few folks have told me to meditate, even on this post. I guess I was wrong about meditation. I always thought it was some spiritual zen woo energy healing crap. Turns out I was wrong. Guess I should give it a try. I've already ordered 10% happier, and will get the others soon. Thanks for those. :) \n\nI make to-do lists, but I think what was wrong was that they were too big and too broad. Things that seem great when I'm writing them down, but actually doing them seem impossible. So it makes sense to do what you said about breaking them down. \n\nThanks for this. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3ecbgw/how_do_i_get_out_of_this/cte86xu/"}
