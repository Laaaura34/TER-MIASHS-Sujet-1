It's just that it's been my way of maybe coping with it? I figured if I didn't give it much importance, then I wouldn't need to address it. \n\nBut the more I look at it, the more I feel like a lot of the things I do are related to this, or at least to how I've dealt with it over the years. Every failed relationship I've had is proof of this. \n\nBut it's hard even now to talk about it, even the thought of talking about it with a therapist scares me. The reason I was able to talk to my uncle was because I was at a very, VERY low point in my life then. I mean, I can talk about it here, but that's only because I can remain anonymous. But, in real life? It's scary. I don't get why, but opening up like that seems impossible. \n\nThanks so much for your comment. I can't really express how much all this is already helping. I posted this because I just got to a point where I couldn't deal with the way I was living. I didn't expect to have this much support. It means so much. Thanks. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3ecbgw/how_do_i_get_out_of_this/ctespmr/"}
