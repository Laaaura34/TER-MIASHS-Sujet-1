I'm very sorry that happened to you. Thinking about it now makes me feel enraged and sick. If that were my little boy I would be heartbroken. Please give your inner 8 year-old boy a big Internet hug from me.\n\n\nWe have protective thoughts and emotion-killers that shut down our empathy for ourselves. This is to prevent further harm initially, but there is a cost as well. I think you know what that cost might be. A ship in a storm will lower its sails, and the sails will stay down if the crew is unsure if they are in the eye of the storm, or if the storm has truly passed.\n\n\nConsider a young boy who is not yourself, but in a similar situation of being taken advantage of and abused. How do you feel about that boy? If he immediately came to you and expressed his true feelings, how would you react to him? I doubt you would turn away. I doubt you would place your hand over his mouth. I doubt you would tell him that it happens to a lot of people, and he should get over it. Even if you were unable to help him, I'm sure you would seek someone who could. \n\n\nIn your case, that little boy is you, and the person you seek to help that little boy is a therapist. Please value yourself as much as any child. Please help that little boy as much as you possibly can. Please find an empathetic therapist.\n\n\nGood luck, and thank you for sharing. You can have the life you want. I'm rooting for you :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3ecbgw/how_do_i_get_out_of_this/ctef8mi/"}
