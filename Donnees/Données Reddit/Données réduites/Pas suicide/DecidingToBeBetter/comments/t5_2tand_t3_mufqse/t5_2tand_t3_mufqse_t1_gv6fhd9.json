I really love the kroger brand flavored sparkling waters. They have a bunch of different flavors (white grape is my fav), big bottles for like $0.69-$0.99, sugar free, and they really hit those soda cravings. I did that when first working on weight loss myself, but these days I only have water or Gatorade zero for drinks. \n\nOh, another thing I found helpful is to avoid having any drink with a meal, and also chew your food more. You will eat slower when you don\u2019t have a drink to help wash big bites of food down with, and so give your body time to feel satisfied by the time you finish eating, and it will make digesting food easier the better you chew it, so less heartburn, less bloating,  and better poops.
