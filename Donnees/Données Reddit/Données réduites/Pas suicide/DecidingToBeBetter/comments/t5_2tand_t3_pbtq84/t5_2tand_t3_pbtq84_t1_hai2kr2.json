And then I did a decent amount of lifting maybe 4-5 years ago.  \n\nSo I\u2019m not a complete noob.  I think I\u2019ll head back to weights but lower weights.  But anyone reading this, that is some great advice for those who\u2019ve never lifted before.  It\u2019s really important for an absolute beginning to not just try to squat 300 pounds and injure themselves.  Body weight exercises are great.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pbtq84/small_victory_but_i_didnt_play_any_video_games/hai2kr2/"}
