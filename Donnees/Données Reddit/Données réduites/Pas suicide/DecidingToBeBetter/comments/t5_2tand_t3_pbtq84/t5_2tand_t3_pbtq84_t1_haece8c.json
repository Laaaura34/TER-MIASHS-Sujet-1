Maybe once you prove to yourself that you don\u2019t need video games, and go a period of time without them, you could reward yourself with a scheduled time to play games. Or if you haven\u2019t get a few mobile games to help cope. In my opinion that would help to prevent a \u201crelapse\u201d. I\u2019ve done this in the past and I\u2019ve actually gotten to the point where I\u2019ll go 20-40 hours without even checking my mobile games, and console/computer games I haven\u2019t played more than 40 hours in the last 4 months (And have found out that I don\u2019t enjoy them as much as I thought I did, doing other things felt a lot more rewarding than winning a game or beating someone). For me that helped a lot sense I\u2019d spend 4-10 hours a day mindlessly playing games.
