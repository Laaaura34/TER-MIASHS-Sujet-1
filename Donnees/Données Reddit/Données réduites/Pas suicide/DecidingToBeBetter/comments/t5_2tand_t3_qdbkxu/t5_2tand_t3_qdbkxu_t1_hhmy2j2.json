It can be extremely difficult to see and think clearly from within that kind of situation.  \n\nI escaped an abusive relationship three years ago (Oct 15, 2018 is the day I finally came back to integrity with myself).  \n\nOne piece of advice I have is to find a \u201cmen\u2019s group\u201d to join at least for a while.
