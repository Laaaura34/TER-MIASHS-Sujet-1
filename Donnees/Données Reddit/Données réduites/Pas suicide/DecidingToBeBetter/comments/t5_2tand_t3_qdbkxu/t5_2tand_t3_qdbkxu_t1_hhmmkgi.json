For some reason, this means a lot coming from a man. You said it right, you do lose yourself and they are parasites. The most shameful thing to me is that I grew up in an abusive environment, that he caused me to have a miscarriage and still I stayed, one day, just after we had made love he said that this was the worst relationship he had ever been in and I said I would leave because that's what I thought he wanted, he immediately tried to break my neck. I was so afraid, I really thought I would either die or be paralyzed but I stayed, I got pregnant again and stayed. I left until the birth of our healthy son then came back. Then a year later he nearly threw our son off a balcony and I went to kill him. The sound of our baby's crying saved his life because I was going to kill him, I told him as much. But instead I grabbed my crying baby and took care of him. I keep blacking out and hallucination because of the stress. I have so much shame for staying. I was like a trapped animal. We would be in public and I would try to run away from him and he wouldn't let me. But I'm free now. The next person to put their hands on me will go to jail. Its been over 20 years since I left and I don't miss him or hate him. I rarely think of him. I never dated again after I left him.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdbkxu/about_leaving_an_abusive_relationship_and_what_my/hhmmkgi/"}
