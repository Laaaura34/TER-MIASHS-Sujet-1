You\u2019ve found the bravery to do what so many sadly do not. You have decided to live your life, for you, and that is a beautiful thing. And also, so damn scary. \n\nMy main piece of advice is to change the noise around you so to speak. Follow pages and subreddits that affirm and encourage this type of behavior and lifestyle. Read books and listen to podcasts that promote sovereign living and self-care in the deepest sense of the word. Most importantly, limit contact with anyone in your life who is not supportive of this new journey. Join Facebook groups of likeminded people, make new friends with people who are also learning to put themselves first and live a life by design, get an accountability buddy, work with a therapist or coach. Essentially build a support system around you that encourages this new life rather than hinders it. \n\nHow exciting!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kewiem/how_do_i_get_comfortable_with_putting_myself_first/gg5290e/"}
