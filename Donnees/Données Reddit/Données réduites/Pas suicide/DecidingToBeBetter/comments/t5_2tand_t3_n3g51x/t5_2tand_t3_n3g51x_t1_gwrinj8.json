At the start it's so short-lived that somehow it feels \"tainted\". It takes a while to come out of a bad time. \nSometimes the bad feelings are so consistent that we don't even remember the happy times - e.g you might experience a few seconds of happiness a day, or a few min a week / fortnight but you don't remember them. That's because the sadness or feeling of being lost is stronger than the feeling of \"normal happiness\" & because it's not tied to an event in your life but just something that naturally happened - your mind may not remember it.  You'd feel like you're carrying a dread around all the time. \nI started exercising & taking a photo of myself every couple of weeks, just to compare my physique. When I go through them now ( a year later ) I realise I did have moments of happiness ( when I was excited about progress with my workout ), I just didn't remember them because I was dying every second of the day otherwise & had to stop myself from hurting myself to stop the pain every day. All I initially remembered was the pain of those 2 years. Now I can slowly remember the little happy moments too. \nBasically the happy moments start getting stronger & stronger the more you focus on them, the more you hold on to them & the stronger you \"believe\" in them. Then they start happening more often. Then it becomes normal to just be normal even if you're not feeling big feelings. \nYou'll DEFINITELY get there. I promise you. \n\u2764", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n3g51x/has_anyone_here_ever_seen_the_other_side_from_a/gwrinj8/"}
