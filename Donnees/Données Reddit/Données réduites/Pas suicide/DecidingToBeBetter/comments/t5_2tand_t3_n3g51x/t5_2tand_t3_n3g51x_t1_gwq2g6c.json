I've been in and out of depression since elementary school, and there are always times when it's easier.\n\n Last year my younger sister died by suicide, and it's only thanks to a large group of dedicated mental health professionals that I didn't follow her. For me, it took participating in an intensive therapy program for 4 months to get back to the point where daily life feels tolerable. \n\nThere were several days when the main thing keeping me alive was not wanting to further traumatize my family. Not gonna pretend that life is great now but there are moments when I can laugh and smile, and I can feel myself having hope for the future. I strongly recommend therapy if you can afford it. If you can't, there are therapists who may be willing to do sliding scale prices. \n\nMaybe the world wont ever be the same. Maybe it will. Either way there will be things worth sticking around for.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n3g51x/has_anyone_here_ever_seen_the_other_side_from_a/gwq2g6c/"}
