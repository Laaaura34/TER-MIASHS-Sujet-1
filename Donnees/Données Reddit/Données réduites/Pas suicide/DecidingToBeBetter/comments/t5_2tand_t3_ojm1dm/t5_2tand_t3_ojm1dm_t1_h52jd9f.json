We had to buy him suspenders so he could get his pants to stay up.  I however need to lose close to 100 pounds.  Not ready yet, but I know it will be a big job.  I've lost tremendous amounts of weight at least 2 times already.  It's just the old yo-yo syndrome.  But, once I make the decision to lose the weight and get on board with a program then I will be okay.  It's just getting there.  \n\nYour story reminded me when some 45 years ago I was having a discussion with my boss.  We worked in an Army education center and the desks were typical student's desks where the chair and the desk are all one piece of furniture.  I was sitting sideways in and when we stood to leave the desk lifted up off the floor with me still in it.  Talk about embarrassing.\n\nBest of luck and do yourself proud.  Just one day at a time.  One habit at a time.  Little steps will amount to tremendous gains.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ojm1dm/after_my_experience_at_an_amusement_park_i_am/h52jd9f/"}
