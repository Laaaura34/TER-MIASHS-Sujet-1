Ive lost 30lbs since November. Just by eating better and walking for 30 mins a day.\n\nIt's been tough and there are days where I have a hard time. But I found as long as I try to get back on that path it helps.\n\nI found smaller changes to be easier to implement. Any big changes I made in the past didn't last.\n\nGood luck to you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ojm1dm/after_my_experience_at_an_amusement_park_i_am/h56amvn/"}
