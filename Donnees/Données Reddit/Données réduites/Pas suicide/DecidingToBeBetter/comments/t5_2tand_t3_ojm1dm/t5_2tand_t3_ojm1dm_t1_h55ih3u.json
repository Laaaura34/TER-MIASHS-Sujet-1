What I'm doing now is not healthy for mind or body. I fell into the pandemic trap - stuck at home, getting everything delivered. Now, things are opening back up (At least in my area, and I'm vaccinated). \nI fell into a deep, deep depression a few months ago as a result of family issues, and that's when my weight really skyrocketed. \nI just want to get back to where I was 2-3 years ago. Not 'skinny', but a much healthier weight/BMI  than I am now.
