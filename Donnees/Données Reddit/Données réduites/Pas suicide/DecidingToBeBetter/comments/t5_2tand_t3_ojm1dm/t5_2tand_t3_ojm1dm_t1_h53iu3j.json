So I buy ice cream popsicles. Unlike a pint of ice cream they are a measured size so I can make sure I don't scoop too much.\n\n2. Chips: we have containers that we put chips into. It started as just a convenience but now we have ones that are the right size for a serving and they have lids. So you could pre measure a bunch. Now we never take a big bag of chips for snacking. We pour a container or have one of the small bags.\n\n3. Small bags of chips are handy if you are cutting down on your evening snack chip eating.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ojm1dm/after_my_experience_at_an_amusement_park_i_am/h53iu3j/"}
