With big behavioral changes like this, I always recommend the WOOP method. It stands for Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan.\n\nStart with a clear picture of what you want. Then, list all the benefits you\u2019ll get by achieving your goal. Next, think of what roadblocks you\u2019ll encounter as you go on this journey. And finally, what is your plan to combat these obstacles in the moment.\n\nSo often we are faced with unanticipated setbacks and challenges that we give up. By thinking ahead of what might come your way, you will be better mentally prepared to withstand them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ojm1dm/after_my_experience_at_an_amusement_park_i_am/h53kjaz/"}
