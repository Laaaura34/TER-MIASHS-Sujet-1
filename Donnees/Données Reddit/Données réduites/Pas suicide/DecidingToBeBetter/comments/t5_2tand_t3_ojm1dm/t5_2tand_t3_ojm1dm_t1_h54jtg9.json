Back in March, I was forced to go on vacation to Florida. (Yes, forced. I am a winter person, not summer. My dad couldn't go and my mom can't drive, and the only other ones were my nieces who are too young to drive). We went to one of those jump parks, with the trampolines and foam pits. I decided to go do the obstacle course. Well, I didn't quite make it across one of the parts and fell into the foam pit, as many do. Unfortunately, due to my weight and size, I couldn't get out and would only sink in further when I tried to. It took FOUR workers and over half an hour to get me out and even then it was with my own strength added that got me out. They threw a mat beside me to roll onto so I wouldn't directly sink. It was humiliating that they needed so many people and so much work to move me out, plus my own weakness that I couldn't get myself out.\n\nNot going to leave any advice here aside from saying that you're not alone and you can always ask for help. It sucks when you can't do things on your own, but it is what it is.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ojm1dm/after_my_experience_at_an_amusement_park_i_am/h54jtg9/"}
