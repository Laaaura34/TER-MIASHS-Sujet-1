This isn't ridiculously hard to do. The hard part is that you need to do it for weeks and weeks on end. One pound = 3,500 calories. 500 calories x 7 days a week = 1 pound of weight loss per week, which is healthy and attainable. Don't beat yourself up if you have a bad day. Just get back on it the next day. Use the app called \"lose it\" to track your calories. It's free and works great. \n\nDon't do fad diets. Don't do crazy workouts. Don't do extreme shit. Just remove 500 calories per day. The weight will come off. \n\nThere's a subreddit called r/loseit that's quite helpful.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ojm1dm/after_my_experience_at_an_amusement_park_i_am/h52p25y/"}
