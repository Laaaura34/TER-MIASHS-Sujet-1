I was severely depressed and even questioned my abilities. It wasn\u2019t until I stood up again and made that one step forward that I really gained traction again. It didn\u2019t matter how slow I moved, it didn\u2019t matter who was doing what with their lives at my age, and it sure as hell didn\u2019t reflect me as a person. Once I came to terms with that I made small strides that gained momentum and ultimately have given me the opportunity to be more humble, experienced, and proud of myself for saying, \u201cI went through hell, but I didn\u2019t give up\u201d.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n0xutm/go_at_your_own_pace/gwe05wy/"}
