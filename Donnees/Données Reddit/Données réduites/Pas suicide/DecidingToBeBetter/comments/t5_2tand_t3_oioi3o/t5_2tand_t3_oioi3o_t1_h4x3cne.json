One thought to ponder. What exactly makes you such a spectacular piece of shit that you should single yourself out for this much loathing? I would bet you $10,000 that you have several close friends who are OBJECTIVELY assholes (because kids of narcissistic parents put up with asshole friends) but you love them anyway, have compassion for them, and provide them with tons of support and validation. If they are worthy of that, why are you exempt? Make a list and be SPECIFIC about what is so terrible about you. Sit down and discuss one item with yourself like you are discussing it with a friend who is talking about himself/herself. There is nothing you can\u2019t address, we all have qualities we don\u2019t like and have to manage. It could be that what you are actually feeling is toxic shame. Know that you can overcome this 100% because it is based on an internalized lie your parents told you\u2026that if you stepped out of line or disappointed them or didn\u2019t meet their needs, you were fundamentally \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d. Once you see through this illusion once you will always be able to eventually see through it even if you get stuck for a bit here and there.
