When that is threatened and I\u2019m taken down a peg, it really stings! \n\nThere are of course other things in your life that anchor your identity - family, friendship, skill at hobbies, faith, generosity and kindness to others. Try to take a step back and see your whole self with work being one part of it. \n\nI also try to imagine down the road being described as an employee long term. It\u2019s going to be more valuable to be someone consistent, honest, open to change and growth, even-keeled, easy to get along with (and yes, competent!) than someone who \u201cnever made a mistake\u201d. I might get some disagreement there, but that\u2019s who I\u2019d want to hire as a permanent employee.\n\n(And this is coming from recent personal experience - feeling this same way last week at work and being surprised at how much it got to me.)
