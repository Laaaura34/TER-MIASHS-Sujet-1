I had my first panic attack of my life this last summer because my boss told me to do a really simple task and I just couldn\u2019t figure out how to do it. The thing is though, i came back the next day and asked how to do it to try and avoid another panic attack, he explained it to me again, and it was all fine after that.\n\nThis time last year I was in a pretty high leadership position at another job. There was so much responsibility dumped on me that I just couldn\u2019t get anything done because I tried to do it all myself, even though it was too much for any one person to do, and the stress of it all was really getting to me. One of my higher ups noticed how stressed I was and she pointed out that every time anything was getting done, it was all done completely by me and me alone. She told me I needed to ask other people for help before I start getting in trouble for so many things not getting done and the stress just breaks me. Because of the type of person I am I just never thing to ask anyone for help with anything but I\u2019ll be damned if that simple solution didn\u2019t fix everything \n\nYou can be the best worker in the world, but there will always be things you just can\u2019t do alone. The most important things you can do are to communicate and ask for help. It\u2019s such a simple solution that we never even think about it but it works miracles honestly ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/afw07s/need_advice_cant_calm_down_after_bosss_comment_on/ee1w9m0/"}
