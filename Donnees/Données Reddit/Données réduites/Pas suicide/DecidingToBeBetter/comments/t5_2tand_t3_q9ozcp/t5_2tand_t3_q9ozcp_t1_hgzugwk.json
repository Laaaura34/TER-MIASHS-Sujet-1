Boredom, and sadness are what gets to you. Take yourself out for dinner, watch movies, learn to cook nice meals for yourself instead of them ready meals. Literally, the term \"treat yourself\" applies to loneliness better than it does for a break up.\n\nPicking up a hobby is great for making friends. Try to find local groups on social media and try connecting with people.\n\nAnother thing I've learnt is from camping. Specifically, survival in the wilderness. When you're on your own, the fire is burning and the night is setting in, you've now got nothing to do but be with yourself. Can you be with yourself? How are you going to handle boredom? Low morale (sadness, motivation, etc)?\n\nThey're the questions I've been asking myself this past year. If I was alone right now, surviving, could I handle it?
