Things that helped; \n\n1.  Learn to like who you are.  I find the more I become more authentic to myself and the more I like who I am today the easier it is spending so much time by myself.  \n2.  Find hobbies that you can do alone.  Over this covid year I took up piano, painting and reading.  \n3.  Just go out to be around people.  I take myself on self dates all the time.  I actually just returned from a restaurant and sat at the bar, ate dessert and talked to the bar tender.  \n4.  Go to the same places regularly to make community.  Now that things are fully open again my plan is to go to the gym at the same date and time each week.  Eventually I\u2019ll start to familiarize myself with the people that go and maybe make a new Freind.  If not I\u2019ll at least feel like I\u2019m in a little community as I recognize people.  \n\nHope that helps!\n\nForgot to add, with everything being said above there are still some nights I do feel lonely.  This just happened at thanksgiving that just passed.  This tends to be when I feel like it\u2019s not my choice.  When that happens I just sit in those feels (sometimes cry about it) and I know it will pass.  As soon as I cry or sleep on it I end up feeling better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9ozcp/how_to_be_alone_without_being_lonely_advice_pls/hgy7zz9/"}
