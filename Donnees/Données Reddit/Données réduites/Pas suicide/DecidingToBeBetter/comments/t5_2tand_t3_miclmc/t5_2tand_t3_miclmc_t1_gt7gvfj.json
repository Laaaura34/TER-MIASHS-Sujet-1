Man, I'm sending you so much high-five energy from afar. And I really commend you because sometimes it can really, really suck to be rejected, and the loneliness can feed those obsessive feedback loops. It's really awesome that you're able to clarify those feelings for yourself. And if you \"shoot your shot\" and it doesn't work out, well, it sounds like you're in the company of some good friends (and some very good personal growth) to reassure you that things will turn out all right. Way to go, dude :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/miclmc/how_do_i_become_able_to_fully_feel_and_express/gt7gvfj/"}
