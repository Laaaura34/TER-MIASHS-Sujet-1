For years I have been really bad at knowing when to pull back and knowing when to keep going. For example when I had a crush on a girl I would typically convince myself to keep going as hard as I can and not pull back. Ended up not only getting rejected every single time, but also damage my mental health.\n\nExample: One time, I wanted to have a relationship with a girl, so my strategy was to try as hard as I could, even though I knew well into the situation that she didn't like me back. Ended up getting a boyfriend and I felt like shit afterwards.\n\nAlso, in some situations when I should have challenged my feelings, I instead pulled back and losing potentially valuable opportunities to have a good time.\n\nExample: When I was in 8th grade I wanted to have a beach party with friends, but never acted on the matter at all and instead kept dreaming. Ended up never having the beach party.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/miclmc/how_do_i_become_able_to_fully_feel_and_express/gt72hxo/"}
