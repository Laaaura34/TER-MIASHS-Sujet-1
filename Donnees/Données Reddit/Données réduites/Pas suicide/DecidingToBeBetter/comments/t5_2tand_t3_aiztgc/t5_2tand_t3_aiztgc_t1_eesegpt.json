A theme can have variations while still achieving a goal. If you sleep in, or miss a gym day don't beat yourself up, you tried, but you couldn't that day. That doesn't mean the theme of improving yourself is over, you just continue on with the theme and ignore the misstep.  \n\nI heard this advice with regards to new years resolutions, don't set a 'I will go to the gym everyday' resolution - set a theme for the year of improving yourself physically. Miss a day, no problem, you tried but the over arching theme is still there.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/aiztgc/i_woke_up_at_830_am_today_instead_of_sometime/eesegpt/"}
