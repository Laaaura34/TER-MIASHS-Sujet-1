And the types of fights you\u2019re having? I know you expressed that the fights are not relevant, but they might be relevant to helping us and also you understand what\u2019s causing you to act out your emotions physically. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve hit a point in your life where you need to find healthier ways of connecting with and expressing your emotions. Being accused of being domestically violent is scary, but I would focus on the plan of action instead of the negative connotations associated with the label. How, for instance, can you communicate effectively that you need space to cool off, and how can you do that cooling-off without causing harm to yourself or your belongings, or scaring your partner? \n\nYou are not a bad person for struggling to express yourself in a healthy manner. Even adults who had the most picturesque upbringing have to do this kind of work when issues arise. Coming from an abusive background, it\u2019s not exactly surprising that you\u2019re acting out the way that you are; the self-awareness in this regard is something to be acknowledged and applauded. \n\nHang in there, buddy.
