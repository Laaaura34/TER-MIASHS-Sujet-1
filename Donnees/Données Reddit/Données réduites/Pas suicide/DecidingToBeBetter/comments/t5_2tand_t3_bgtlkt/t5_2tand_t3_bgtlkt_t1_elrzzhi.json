(should have stopped with the *\"took care of my father as he died of cancer\"*... because all of the rest; you went overboard... well into \"one upmanship\" *fiction* territory).\n\n-\n>Which is why I find this post so surreal. It comes off as, \u201cwork as hard as me and you will be rewarded!\u201d \n\nYeah... because you've got your head waaaaay to deep up your own arse. Sounds to me more like **jealousy** rearing it's ugly head... daddy didn't leave you anything (much) for an inheritance, and you cannot STAND the idea that some guy w/o kids might leave everything he owns (house, dogs, whatever) to some \"surrogate nephew/son\" in exchange for the younger guy being there to care for him.\n\nAlso, be willing to bet you wouldn't say anything like the same thing if OP was a woman.\n\n-\n>It\u2019s tone deaf and in reality, it doesn\u2019t really meet a good example of that sentiment.\n\nWhich just indicates that *WHOOSH* you missed the entire point of the post (too stuck on your OWN issues yet).", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bgtlkt/3_years_ago_i_made_a_decision_to_move_out_of_my/elrzzhi/"}
