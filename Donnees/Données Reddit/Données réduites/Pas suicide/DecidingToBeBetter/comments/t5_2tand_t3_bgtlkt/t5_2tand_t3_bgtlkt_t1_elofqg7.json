It\u2019s horrible what happened to your mentor, and I appreciate the uplift that you felt from imposing the ultimatum of \u201cmove out from my parents or else be stuck forever\u201d, but I feel like this is telling people that in this climate, taking the plunge is a risk worth taking. If anything happened to you where you couldn\u2019t work, if you needed to pay any unexpected expense, you\u2019d have been screwed. Your health deteriorated partly due to the farm work and you could have been so close to a breakdown, especially when you were asked to leave. \n\nI completely admire that you forced yourself into a do or die situation, and admire that you came out the other side happier, but you\u2019re extremely lucky to have ended up better off given the circumstances and it\u2019s not as easy to land on your feet as this post might make it out to be.\n\nI just think it\u2019s important to decide to be better, but not to advocate taking huge risks just for independence. You could well have made a life at home given the right changes and the right chance, and I think that\u2019s also a message to spread. It doesn\u2019t have to be as \u201cLeave or be stuck forever\u201d as you explained.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bgtlkt/3_years_ago_i_made_a_decision_to_move_out_of_my/elofqg7/"}
