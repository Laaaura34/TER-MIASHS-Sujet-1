The attention I got from men and women ruined friendships sometimes, I had a stalker at my first job and was sexually harassed by coworkers and customers. I quit that job, moved, got a pixie cut and now still get harassed and hit on, but less so if I dress boyish. I also have struggled with acne marks after high school, which has hurt my confidence but doesn\u2019t seem to stop people from hitting on me. \n\nMy genuine advice: I think it\u2019s best if you just be yourself, if people don\u2019t like the real you or think you aren\u2019t perfect just the way you are, then f*ck them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/obd5t4/19_yr_old_girl_who_began_receiving_attention_from/h3n6u7n/"}
