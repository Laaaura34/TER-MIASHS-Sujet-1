I've noticed as I get a little older that even though my cardio health is great, I'm feeling increasingly stiffer and am more prone to lower back pain (I'm a web dev, so I sit most of the day outside of planned exercise). I really appreciate your emphasis on flexibility as well. I've been contemplating integrating yoga into my daily routine, maybe as a post-cardio cooldown. I'm also a casual rock climber; I think leaning into that as a secondary sport will help cover some of the areas I'm missing as a runner.\n\nI guess you nailed it with \"longevity.\" I see my parents - who are both in their late 60s - still fairly active but with different musculoskeletal ailments; their primary go-to is OTC or prescription meds, and I want to avoid that if possible. \n\nI've also had a bit of a personal renaissance in terms of emotional and spiritual self-care, and it's helped me develop a healthier view towards my perceived self-purpose and overall goals (specifically, learning to be more patient and less judgmental towards myself). Small steps, but I'm embracing the art of doing a little every day instead of trying to force radical change all at once.\n\nThanks for your response, I really appreciate it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n1mt2w/which_aspects_of_physical_selfcare_should_an/gwgam2h/"}
