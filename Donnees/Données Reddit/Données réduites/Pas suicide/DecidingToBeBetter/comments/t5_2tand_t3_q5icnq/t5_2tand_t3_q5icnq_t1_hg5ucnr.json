Somehow it got installed into your mind. Maybe when you were young something happened to cause this program to be installed.\n\nSo number 1 is realizing that the voice is not Reality. The voice is an old program. It's not real. It's just a mental neural connection that has been reinforced. Know that you can change it. \n\nStep 2 is to learn how to pull \"away\" from that voice, to get \"distance\" between you and the voice. For this the time-tested practices of meditation and yoga are incredible. Pranayama (breathing techniques) also are magical.\n\nStep 3 is to install a new program, a POSITIVE program that will be the new voice you hear when something important like a job promotion comes up. Yes this is possible, we can create new programs in our minds through daily affirmations and repetition. It's just creating new neural connections in our brains. \n\nAnd Step 4, after you've worked on all of the above, is to accept that failure is always possible. No matter who you are. Even if you're Michael Jordan or Elon Musk, whoever you are, failure is possible and failure happens to everyone. So there is no reason to fear failure. It's just part of the architecture of life. Achieving true acceptance of something we don't want leads to surrender and peace with whatever happens. When we have this peace we can still take action but we leave the stress behind. \n\nIn my healing practice I help people with things like this. If you are interested in talking more you can DM me :) \n\nBest of luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5icnq/promotion_opportunity_coming_up_need_help/hg5ucnr/"}
