I kept things around to reach for when I had an urge to \"make myself feel better\" or wanted to \"take the edge off.\" I relied on ginger ale, which I love, and then got myself back off the soda once I didn't have urges to smoke anymore. Hope this helps, you sound strong and resolved! Breaking the habit will be worth it! I'm so happy I kicked this thing I did daily for 5 years, I was so scared life wouldn't be fun anymore. I have much more fun now because I actually invest in myself and my life and can see and feel the rewards instead of getting high and letting the TV play. I don't have to make excuses for my habit anymore. It's so empowering.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/igf0f7/today_i_decided_to_be_done_with_alcohol_forever/g2vcv6d/"}
