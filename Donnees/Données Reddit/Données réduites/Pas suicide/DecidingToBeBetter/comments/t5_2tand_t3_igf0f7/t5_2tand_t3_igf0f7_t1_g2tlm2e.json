I was drinking every night for the past 2 weeks, for no other reason other than \u201cI feel like I should.\u201d Nothing negative, emotionally or physically, ever happens when I drink. But I got a real wake-up call last Thursday night when I once again got REALLY drunk. I don\u2019t like looking back and realizing these habits are going to make me dependent on needing alcohol in order to just relax in the evening. I have no reason to be drinking alcohol, especially not to the point of blackout every few nights. I just drink and then keep drinking because I still have zero sense of what my tolerance is, also. I\u2019m so proud of you for realizing, like me, that even though we can\u2019t really see the negative consequences yet, we will if we keep this up. And that we DO have the power to change this habit :) I\u2019ve been alcohol free for 4 nights now.
