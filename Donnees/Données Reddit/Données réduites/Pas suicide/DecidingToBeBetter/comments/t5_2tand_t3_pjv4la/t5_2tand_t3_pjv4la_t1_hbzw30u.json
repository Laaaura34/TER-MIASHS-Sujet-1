I don't know you but if I had to guess you're more capable than you believe, you sound more focused and devoted than most people that study literature. I also know that there're some people who have honestly very derivative, unoriginal ideas doing PHDs and they're never \"caught\" (there's really nothing to catch someone for because of them being unoriginal). So even if what you believe is true (that you have no original ideas) then, honestly, you have nothing to worry about; there's nothing you can be catched for unless you're straight up doing plagiarism, which is something very different than being unoriginal.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjv4la/i_have_no_ideas_of_my_own_ive_been_a_fraud/hbzw30u/"}
