Isn't your PhD the first opportunity to try to do this? And that's why they give you lots of guidance and supervision because it's a tricky and new undertaking. \n\nThe fact you realise much of our though probably isn't your own is likely a good sign and signals some kind of maturation in your assessment of your abilities and limitations.
