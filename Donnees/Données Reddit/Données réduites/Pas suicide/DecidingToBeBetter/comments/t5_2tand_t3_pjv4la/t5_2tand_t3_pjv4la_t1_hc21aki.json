It is a lonely path in a lot of ways. The traditional job market for PhDs in academia is absolutely horrible: universities are slashing humanities programs,  and trying as hard as possible to staff the remainders with adjunct and contract faculty rather than full time or tenure track. If you do score a tenure track job, it's a stressful and competitive environment as you try to publish and do enough service while improving your teaching in order to receive tenure. \n\nObviously there are benefits: you get to read, write, \nand think for a living, congenial colleages, etc. But please don't think this is the only thing you can do or enjoy.  Look into other career paths where you can use your mind and work with smart people,  not necessarily the endless self esteem drag of academia. \n\nSource: got my history phd in 2008", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjv4la/i_have_no_ideas_of_my_own_ive_been_a_fraud/hc21aki/"}
