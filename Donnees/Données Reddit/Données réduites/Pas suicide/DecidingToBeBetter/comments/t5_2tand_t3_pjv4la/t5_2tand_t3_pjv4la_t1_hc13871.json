You're having a moment of here of looking at the world and seeing your place in it. I know it seems ridiculous all of a sudden, but that anxiety is a response that your body is doing to try and help you. It doesn't always help mind you, and I don't think it's helping now, but it's good sometimes to take things into perspective.\n\nWhat you've written down... You say it makes you a fraud, but I think this: you are very very good at research. That is your skill. Many people have looked at this angle of research before, so you get to use what they've written down as a short cut (that's what everybody gets to do these days). That's not cheating, it's just cutting to the point. You're still early in the game. This now, this is all background knowledge you're accumulating. You're gonna be fluent in it. Once you're fluid in it, you can look into new things, and use that language you've already learned to explain it all. \n\nI'm wondering if this anxiety you're feeling could instead be quelled by working on what you do with your personal time. Maybe you need more creative fodder? Like reading for fun, or learning about something you don't already know about? All these things inform you and may make your internal library feel more \"full\".\n\nI hope this was helpful! Take care! Tell yourself you've done a really good job once in a while, okay? It sounds like you've worked hard.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjv4la/i_have_no_ideas_of_my_own_ive_been_a_fraud/hc13871/"}
