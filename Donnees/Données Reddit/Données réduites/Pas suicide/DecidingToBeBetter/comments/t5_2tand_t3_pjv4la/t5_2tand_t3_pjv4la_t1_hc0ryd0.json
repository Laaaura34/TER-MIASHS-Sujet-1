Yours sounds fairly valid to me as someone with a Bachelor's in English.  This process you describe where you think and let the ideas marinate basically is coming up with your own ideas--you are probably finding some criticism you read more valid and useful than others, right? That's where you're applying your own thinking and not just parroting what others say mindlessly. \n\nIf you want to feel more 'real' try next time just doing some reading and instead of jumping straight to the outside research, spend a little bit guessing at what you think you will find in your research. If it matches, congrats, you came up with your own theories that happen to match what other scholars say. If it doesn't match, congrats, you thought up some of your own ideas, even if they weren't as well researched or thorough or accurate as others.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjv4la/i_have_no_ideas_of_my_own_ive_been_a_fraud/hc0ryd0/"}
