I still don't feel like I have any solutions or any path forward. All I can think is, just memorize, just attain, to be able to someday continue to combine all these ideas and make them into something - even if it's just bland or unoriginal or obvious or lame. As long as I'm entertained, as long as I can distract myself, even if I'm completely pathetic, I don't have to think about it. I really find it amazing you can stay and research things for hours, I wish I had that kind of will when I think everything I do is subpar, at least 97% meaningless, and not as good largely because I simply don't have that many resources or ways to attain them. And honestly, when it comes to conferences or presentations, my goal is literally just to say the completely obvious, overstated things to get it over with - not like people are really inclined to pay attention, usually I just need to open my mouth and do minimal things to maintain the status quo.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjv4la/i_have_no_ideas_of_my_own_ive_been_a_fraud/hc3ajra/"}
