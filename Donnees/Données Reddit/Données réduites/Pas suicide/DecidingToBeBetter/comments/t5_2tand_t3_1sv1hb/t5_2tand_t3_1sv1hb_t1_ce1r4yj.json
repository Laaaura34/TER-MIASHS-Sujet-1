After 3 years of heavy self-work I have pretty much reached the burn-out stage. I finally admitted to myself this week that I was just tired of struggling against the negativity of the world, and the negativity of my own mind. It's like being crushed between two giant rocks every day, and trying to smile and pretend like it's the greatest experience.... I just can't do it anymore. I realized I feel overwhelmed with how hard this life is, and how much I have to fight to make even the smallest bit of progress with myself. I thought I was doing the right thing, never letting up for a moment and always working against my flaws, trying constantly to be a better person, but the amount of suppression and control that it takes to achieve that is sucking all the joy out of my life. Every time life has handed me a shit sandwich, I've put so much pressure on myself to see it only as an opportunity to grow, without taking any time to let myself be sad or angry or afraid. I've felt guilty for even having those feelings and pushed them away, and the whole thing just blew up in my face. I guess I'm learning that I need balance, that it's okay to work on being better, but I have to be compassionate enough to accept where I am and give myself space to breathe.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1sv1hb/negative_emotions_are_key_to_wellbeing_scientific/ce1r4yj/"}
