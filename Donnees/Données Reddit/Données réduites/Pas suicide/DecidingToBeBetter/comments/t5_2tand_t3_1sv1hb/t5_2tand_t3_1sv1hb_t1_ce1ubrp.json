I've always analyzed why I feel a certain way and explored what to do about it, but it was only recently that I realized I have to just let myself *feel* it as well. The way I am about things (the suppression and control you mention, the striving for improvement) has always made me feel like an anomaly -- this feeling was compounded by a therapist weirdly highlighting how unique my desire/attempts at self-knowing and self-improvement are -- but your comment actually made me feel a bit less so.\n\nThanks and all the best!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1sv1hb/negative_emotions_are_key_to_wellbeing_scientific/ce1ubrp/"}
