But. Baby steps. Don\u2019t set yourself up to fail. Don\u2019t try and tackle a mountain of study when you\u2019re currently withdrawing. \n\nPeople view weed as harmless. It\u2019s a drug that has the potential for dependence and addiction like any other drug. \n\nWhen you\u2019re withdrawing from weed, common symptoms are: \n\nHeadaches, chills, irritability, anger, aggression, sensation of extreme nervousness or anxiety, depression, difficulty sleeping, insomnia, troubling dreams, nightmares, decrease in appetite which can cause a lot of weight loss, restlessness, malaise, abdominal pain, sweating, shaking. \n\nSuddenly quitting worsens the withdrawal process, compared to tapering off in a planned and structured way \n\nUnfortunately there aren\u2019t specific medications which can help with the withdrawal process for weed withdrawal like other withdrawal processes (alcohol or opioids) so it\u2019s really important to have support, be around the right people, not be around the wrong people, and have the right environment (if you can, have your bedroom and bathroom a clean, calm space. simple things can help). \n\nSymptoms peak within (normally) a maximum of 10 days of quitting. After the peak, things steadily get better really quickly. Picture it like a triangle where the day you quit is the bottom left corner. Maximum of day 10/when you peak is the top corner. Day 30 is the bottom right corner. \n\n If you start using marijuana again, the symptoms will go away, but you\u2019ll have to begin all over again. \n\nKeeping a calendar and knowing you only need to get through a maximum of around 10 days (often it\u2019s a lot quicker) and then you\u2019ll feel a *lot* better *and* have got through the worst of the withdrawal and begun your sobriety from marijuana will feel fucking incredible. Put a giant red cross on the calendar for each day you have made it through. \n\nKeep doing it after the symptoms have eased. It\u2019s soooo satisfying to see those crosses and be like \u2018I have that big of a chain going, yes I\u2019m feeling tempted right now but there is no way I\u2019m going to break this chain right now. Not after ALL that\u2019. \n\nPrint off calendar pages just for this purpose. Even write down how each day felt. Keep a journal. You\u2019re going to be so proud to look back and say you have overcome your addiction. There\u2019s no shame in addiction. I was addicted to opioids. The pride that comes in knowing that I can go through my day without thinking about that next pill is freaking fantastic. \n\nPlease consider seeing an addiction doctor. They can help you through this process. I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re doing this while under the support of a therapist. You can reach some pretty low lows in the depths of withdrawal. An addiction doctor could help you develop a tapering plan. if you need to be able to still get through studies, it might be a better option for you. They can also supervise you during the process and check you for dehydration, weight loss, and suicidal thoughts. \n\nIt\u2019s different if you quit cold Turkey, where you\u2019re going to feel it hit you like a truck, versus if you quit by tapering, slowing cutting it down at an agreed rate. \n\nWhatever route you take, we know that you will succeed. There might be some speed bumps along the way. That\u2019s all part of the process, and makes your success and recovery all the sweeter. \n\nI am SO proud of you op. I hope you are too. \n\nI\u2019m also very, very sorry for your loss of your cousin. How profoundly painful. I don\u2019t know what your beliefs are, but I don\u2019t doubt that your cousin would have been proud of you for taking this path and act of self love. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about being better. This is an act of love for yourself. \n\nWe accept you, as you are. In this moment. \n\nPlease, if you feel able, keep us updated on how you\u2019re going. Not only the good days. F toxic positivity. We\u2019re behind you 100% of the way. \n\nYou can do this OP.
