Huh, I've not really taken the time to think of it like that, thank you for that and for your wishes. It has been a crazy ride from being a non-verbal and somewhat disturbed autistic mixed kid, to a scholarship student at a prestigious public university, to teetering in and out of psychosis and in and out of psychwards, to homeless and fighting to sober up and to get to my partner overseas, to years of panic and uncertainty with my disabled partner and working with a fraction of what I used to be capable of while we made online content together...to, well, nowadays. \n\nHoly hell it has been a wild ride...thank you for helping me see that in a different light today.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ismrqr/ive_been_sober_from_alcohol_for_over_6_years_now/g59eqdg/"}
