For me in particular, I had alcohol-induced psychosis, that plus being on psych meds messed my thinking up horribly. It was like going from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde. I became someone I never wanted to become while on booze and psych meds.\n\nI try to explain what alcohol-induced psychosis is to my partner's relatives when they offer me alcohol, but they don't really understand that. His father also has alcohol-induced psychosis, his rants while drunk included but were not limited to:\n\n* Being confined in concentration camps and being beaten by my partner's mother's extended family when this never happened.\n* Talked of being a mob boss in town when this was never the case.\n* Admitting he was a werewolf.\n\nAnd yet his relatives still enable his drinking. His father literally drank himself into a wheel chair and they still enable his drinking.\n\nThey would enable me into a wheel chair too if they could, and this horrifies me. But too, it helps keep me sober.\n\nCongratulations on your progress as well!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ismrqr/ive_been_sober_from_alcohol_for_over_6_years_now/g59twsh/"}
