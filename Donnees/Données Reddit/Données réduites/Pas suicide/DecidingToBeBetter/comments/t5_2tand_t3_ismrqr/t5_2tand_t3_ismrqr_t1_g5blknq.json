I can't imagine being shut away from society like that for wanting to be healthy.  Society is so utterly sick, and they want to prescribe *us* anti-psychotics? You deserve a place where you have community, you deserve not to be bombarded with addictive poison, you deserve a life that works for you and not against you. Your in-laws frankly horrible people, and they're lucky you grace them with your presence, much less tolerate their inhuman abuse. That sickens me.\n\nI hope you find others to support you in this sober journey, and a truly fulfilling life. It is often out of a deep emptiness, not of our own fault that we turn to addiction. I want you to know it is possible to fill this void with exactly what you're doing: loving relationships, sobriety, giving yourself and your labor to humanity and a higher cause. Intentional community changed my life. We weren't meant to live this way. You are valid and doing the right thing against immeasurable odds.
