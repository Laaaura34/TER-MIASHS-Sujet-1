Sobriety is a huge achievement, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking today to celebrate a little. Trauma will always leave scars. Growing past them and carving out your own little space in the world to be safe is difficult, so that you\u2019ve managed it is worthy of pride. You\u2019ve weathered many storms, and that kind of resilience is hugely admirable. \n\nBest wishes to you and your partner. What matters most is that you have some kind of stability and someone who loves you, and who you\u2019re happy to love. That\u2019s a big thing. This internet stranger is so proud and so happy to see your achievements\u2014and given renewed hope for their own course in life.
