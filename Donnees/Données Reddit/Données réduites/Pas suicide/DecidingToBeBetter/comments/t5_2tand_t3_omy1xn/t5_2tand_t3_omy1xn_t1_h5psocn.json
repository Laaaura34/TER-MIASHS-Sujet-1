I quit drinking. I quit cocaine. I quit eating massive quantities of food, because I weighed 350lbs.\n\nI chain smoked cigarettes for 54 years and I knew that would be the most difficult addictions to break because nicotine is the 2nd most addictive substance on earth. Opioids are number 1. \n\nI did that cold turkey\u2026 no patches, no nicotine gum, no marijuana substitute, no nothing. I just suffered the misery you go through when you cut your body and mind off of things it is really addicted to. \n\nAfter I beat the cigarette addiction\u2026 everything else was easier by comparison. Plus I was used to being miserable for an extended period of time. \n\nYou might want to beat the cigarettes first\u2026 because it\u2019s the hardest.
