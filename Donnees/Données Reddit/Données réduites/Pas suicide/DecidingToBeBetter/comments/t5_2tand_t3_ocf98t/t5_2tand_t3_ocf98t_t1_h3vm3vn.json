I too still struggle with this. Art was something I was naturally decent at, but couldn't stop comparing myself to others. I found that I was only creating art because it would get the attention of others and I lived for the applause.   \n\n\nSadly, it was my downfall, I couldn't stop the comparing. In a world with endless talent my art was empty, inauthentic and my professors often overlooked my work for those who freely expressed themselves. Their art was authentic and came from their own natural creative flow. I stopped getting better and stuck to the same old things that would get attention.   \n\n\nWhatever you happen to do in life, do it because you want to. Be selfish.
