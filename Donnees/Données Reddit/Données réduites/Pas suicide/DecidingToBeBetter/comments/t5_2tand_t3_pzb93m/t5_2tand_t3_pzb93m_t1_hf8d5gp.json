I only asked because I started following weed threads on Reddit and people were questioning themselves constantly. So then I started to wonder if I was in the same boat. It\u2019s also illegal in my state still, so I have that constant paranoia that accompanies doing illegal things. If it weren\u2019t for those two facts, I\u2019d be blissfully unaware that my nighttime usage could be a problem. You\u2019re right though. It is an escape. I shouldn\u2019t need a glass of wine every night to go to sleep so maybe a bowl every night isn\u2019t good either. I think I just need to limit myself a little more and be more mindful of my intentions.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pzb93m/am_i_self_medicating_or_fueling_my_depression/hf8d5gp/"}
