But honestly its a slippery slope, I also have a science degree and smoked occasionally through my undergrad (till I met my ex bf who didn't smoke so I stopped). But from 23-26 I've been smoking same as you, after school and work are done and I'll be home the rest of the day. Trust me once you get into the habit it's really hard to stop. I quit last year from July 2020 till March 2021 and now I'm having a really hard time quitting again. Its starting to interfere with my school and work life. I had a good job in the summer but I didn't push myself to do my best, I just did the bare minimum and I'm sure they noticed that.\n\nA few reflection questions that might help: How is your memory? How do you feel about going to sleep sober? When you go out, can you have a good time without weed? How do you think your life would be different if you didn't smoke?\n\nEdit: also check out r/leaves and r/Petioles if you haven't already", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pzb93m/am_i_self_medicating_or_fueling_my_depression/hf0oieu/"}
