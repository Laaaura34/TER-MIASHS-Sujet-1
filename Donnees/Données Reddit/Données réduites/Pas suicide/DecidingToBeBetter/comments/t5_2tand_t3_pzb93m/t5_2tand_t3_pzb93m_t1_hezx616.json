Because weed provides lots of free dopamine, you lose any desire to do productive things you'd ordinarily do to get dopamine. This is especially harmful if you already have self-motivation issues without it!\n\nIf it helps with your anxiety and depression, that is good. However, if it affects your motivation, then sacrificing the apathetic comfort of the high is worth it, for the sake of an unpleasant reality that at least motivates you to better your life.\n\nMotivation is THE most important thing. \n\nYou will never be able to help yourself in the really important ways you actually need if you don't have the motivation. You need every scrap you can get, ESPECIALLY since you have depression and motivation is in short supply to begin with.\n\nI learned this the hard way. I was in denial of my addiction for two years. I started smoking at 15. I'm 25 now and not even five days sober. \n\nI have several therapists to get back in contact with, I need to get a GP since I haven't seen a doctor in a decade, I have several teeth actively rotting in my skull, I've never been to the gyno, I have a pile of clothes the size of a small car that need washed, let's not even talk about the state of my house, I haven't even looked at any of my art WIPs in seven months... the list goes on. \n\nAnd it's all so easy to ignore when you're stoned.\n\nDon't be like me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pzb93m/am_i_self_medicating_or_fueling_my_depression/hezx616/"}
