There was a point in time where I was very anxious about my future, and was very depressed that I wasn\u2019t doing anything about it (or as much as I thought I should have). I started off smoking only after exams and then that slowly turned into every weekend and then it pretty much became every day. Looking back at that time, I don\u2019t remember much. I didn\u2019t do much. I would stay at home and order food. Work on weekends and then come home and get high. Then one day, I realized I need to cut this out. So I threw away my bag that I would carry all my weed related equipment lol like my bongs, my grinder, my lighters, and my pipes. At the start I didn\u2019t feel any difference, but after a week I felt different in a good way. It\u2019s like this fog was lifted off my mind and I could think clearly again. I didn\u2019t turn into the perfect person right away, but I got some motivation back and started going to the gym semi-consistently. Slowly that anxiety began to wither away. 2 years later and it still lingers, but it\u2019s so much more manageable now. But what I found interesting was that cloud or fog that prevented me from seeing clearly. When I was high all the time, I genuinely believed it was super helpful and that I was learning so much about myself, but it wasn\u2019t. It was really detrimental to my mental health and physical health, and I just couldn\u2019t see it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pzb93m/am_i_self_medicating_or_fueling_my_depression/hf26858/"}
