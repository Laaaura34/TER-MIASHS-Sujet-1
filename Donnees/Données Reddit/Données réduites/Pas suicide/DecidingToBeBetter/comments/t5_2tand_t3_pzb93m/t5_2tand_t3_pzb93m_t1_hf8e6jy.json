I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 13 (long overdue) and have gone broke seeking treatment. After apathetic approaches to my issues by about 8 doctors, I sought out other means. It helped me sleep, be present, and appreciate being alive which was very very new to me. I wanted to craft and cook and dress like no one was looking at me. I forgave my mother, I called my dad, I started showing up to friends invitations. It\u2019s hard to look at all that and see the negative, but any time I skip a day of smoking I feel like shit. And that tells me all I need to know. I\u2019m just terrified to go back to the way things were before weed. I hope I can learn to manage as you have. Best of luck to you too!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pzb93m/am_i_self_medicating_or_fueling_my_depression/hf8e6jy/"}
