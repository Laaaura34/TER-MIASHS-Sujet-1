It made everything easier. I enjoyed eating, talking to people, saying what was on my mind, the music and art I was making flowed freely. Just last night I found myself thinking \u2018man if I had this edible I\u2019d go and kill it on the dance floor instead of worrying about people looking at me weird\u2019. It\u2019s all in your head, you sound like someone who overthinks so many things, as do I. \n\nIt seems your misconception is that you NEED to smoke to achieve all that. You\u2019ve conditioned yourself to believe that if you smoke you\u2019ll give less fucks. It\u2019s not solving the root of the issue, just sweeping it under the rug until the next time you NEED to smoke. Right now, you don\u2019t see any other way because you\u2019re not willing to live any other way. I get that. I was there just a year ago. \n\nI understand what you\u2019re saying. What I\u2019m saying is THC does help. It helps give you the tools to understand where you\u2019re having issues dealing with the ordinary. It helps take those inhibitions off and let you view the world (and ourselves) with fresh eyes, clarity, and truth. \n\nHowever, if you don\u2019t take the time to look deep inside, and learn how to use those tools to achieve sober what you\u2019ve learned that you CAN achieve high, you\u2019ll be relying on smoking to enjoy ordinary things that you enjoyed sober as a child. \n\nGreat things take time, it\u2019s up to you to decide whether it\u2019s worth it nobody else can do that for you. I\u2019m not trying to convince you to stop smoking forever (I\u2019m down to once a month from 10+ times a day just a year ago), only trying to relay how much better it is to have a grip on life sober and enjoy the highs 100x more because my tolerance doesn\u2019t minimize it so much. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s really cool to actually remember all the details I didn\u2019t even realize my memory was too shot to keep up with.\n\nEdit: If you\u2019re questioning whether it\u2019s fueling a problem it\u2019s probably because you\u2019ve already recognized in some ways it is.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pzb93m/am_i_self_medicating_or_fueling_my_depression/hf8j6yc/"}
