I will defend myself a little and say that smoking has improved so many aspects of myself. I tend to be a bit of a hermit, but since smoking, I\u2019ve rekindled and began relationships with friends and family. I felt like a shell of a person before smoking. Now I feel more creative and expressive. I used to be a doormat to avoid confrontation but weed convinced me to not give a fuck sometimes. I used to lay in bed all day waiting for the end of the world, but then I\u2019d smoke and be like fuck it let\u2019s go look at some trees. Not saying there isn\u2019t a ton of bad that comes with it but I think our situations are a little different.
