It sounds like you're doing well and are functional.\n\nYou know you best though. Maybe not right now but somewhere down the line it might be beneficial for you to quit weed and talk to a counsellor about your anxiety/depression. I've seen a few in college and some therapists are totally cool with weed, they'll just help you with whatever goals you're working towards. Some will think that weed is the reason for everything else wrong in your life, so if you do look for counselling try to keep looking until you find someone who is a good fit for you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pzb93m/am_i_self_medicating_or_fueling_my_depression/hf1czyw/"}
