At some point, you have to be willing to sit with yourself, your thoughts, and be able to address them sober. Such is the way of life.\n\nYou can TRY to be high all the time. Even you said it\u2019s affected your energy levels. Basically sounds like you\u2019re ok with being a shell of who you are just so you don\u2019t face the anxiety and depression. Imagine yourself not high, with high energy, performing. Now you\u2019re super high performance, and not using weed as an excuse to deal with the things people have to face everyday. \n\nYou\u2019re not treating the depression and anxiety. You\u2019re numbing yourself to it. Running from it. You can TRY to run forever, but at some point life will happen and you\u2019ll be forced to face it eventually; potentially at a time when you\u2019re older with more responsibility and don\u2019t have the energy to learn healthy coping skills that people who don\u2019t smoke everyday learn. \n\nThere are so many ways to smoke for benefits. And at times, you probably do it, but it sounds like most of the time it\u2019s done as a crutch. Essentially limiting your potential for growth as an adult. \n\nThe withdrawals will suck. That\u2019s the price you pay for relying on training wheels excessively. Thank goodness it\u2019s not opioids or benzos (I would never wish those withdrawals on my worst enemies). Force yourself to eat/drink nutrients even if you\u2019re not hungry. It\u2019s not supposed to be easy, but these are the consequences of your own actions. You know what sucks more? Being an adult that hasn\u2019t learned how to face life head on so she HAS to be high all the time (versus choosing to because smoking is enjoyable). \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong though, there are people who smoke all day and it\u2019s beneficial, but the intentions and purpose make a huge difference.\n\nThis is coming from someone with years of being stoney baloney. In the moment it\u2019s fun, but it only prolongs the inevitable. Best to get a grip on it soon before you become complacent with life and apathetic toward everything and live a life of, \u201cwell I have shelter and food and weed as entertainment so all is dandy!\u201d", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pzb93m/am_i_self_medicating_or_fueling_my_depression/hf1gj2o/"}
