You can reference this in low moments.\n\nIn high school, I'd get hit with waves of sadness that were scary partially because of how endless they felt. I wrote down moments of happiness (a couple sentence description, a date) in sharpie on the underside of my desk, and in those low moments I'd go lay down there and look up at this concrete evidence of past joy that strongly suggested future joy. Was enormously helpful.\n\nGood luck with therapy! While the majority of mental health work happens outside of those hour-long sessions, having a professional help keep you on track can be enormously helpful.\n\nSending you light. So glad you're dedicating yourself to self-love.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n6qkoy/yesterday_i_wanted_to_end_my_life_today_i_want_to/gxau0nt/"}
