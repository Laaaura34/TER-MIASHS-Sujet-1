If I was truly at that point. I would make a knife on my own, I would fashion a loin cloth out of leather on my own. I would go to Africa and search out a rogue male and challenge the lion to a duel. If he kills me then so be it, but if I can kill a lion with my bare hands, then I can overcome what ever it is that is making my feel so down, that I want my life to end. Obviously don't go kill a lion to prove your worth, but know you just have to be strong enough to overcome what ever it is. At one point we didn't have as much freedoms and privilege's as we do today, and we should be excited to be able to live free in the world and have all these opportunities at our hands. We have to chance to be and become what ever we want. Whether it be a gothic punk or a hippie, a lawyer or a construction worker. What ever we want in this country is at our finger tips, all we have to do is want it enough to make an effort to achieve. Nothing is unreachable once you set your mind to it.
