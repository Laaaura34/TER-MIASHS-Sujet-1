My primary act of kindness this week is to bestow upon my son's girlfriend (who I'm trying very diligently to \"like\" \\[AND simultaneously improve my faith walk in the process of this act of kindness, trusting my Lord will help me overcome my unChristian dislike of her\\]) is to give her a scripture box (she's an Atheist).   She has had a very difficult, harsh and hard upbringing and is extremely stoic so I am hopeful I am not burned at the stake before dusk today!  LOL\n\nThereafter (eating my \"frog\" first today), I am running around town giving out boxes of home-made holiday cookies to friends and relatives.  \n\nHoping everyone enjoys the upcoming holidays!  Peace and joy to each of you!  \n\n<3", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kcmu02/in_a_world_where_you_can_be_anything_be_kind/gft6xg4/"}
