Most people are so jaded they commit to a life of \u201cfuck it I\u2019m gonna do whatever and hurt whoever\u201d. You\u2019re story reminds me a lot of my own (m28), relationships and women being the catalyst to my deepest darkest moments and ultimately my greatest transformation. \nBeing present is the answer. Awareness, breath, noticing, compassion. It starts with understanding that when we get upset and lash out, we are the ones who are suffering first, our anger our sadness our jealousy burns us before it burns the other. It\u2019s like picking up a hot rock and wanting to burn someone else with it. First, it burns you.\nSo there\u2019s a lot of work and intentionality that goes into this but the short answer is...start with awareness, choose every day to put yourself first and give a fuck about how you feel, hold yourself accountable, and get vulnerable. Lead with your heart and trust.\nIt gets better i promise. \n-KD Coaching", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mcuqf8/i_20m_want_to_learn_how_to_trust_people_who_love/gs5m7ih/"}
