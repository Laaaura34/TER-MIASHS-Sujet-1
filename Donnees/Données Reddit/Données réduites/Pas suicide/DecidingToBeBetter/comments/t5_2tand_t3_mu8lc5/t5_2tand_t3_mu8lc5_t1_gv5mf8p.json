Before I knew it, I was eating an extra 200+ calories before bedtime. At first I tried small hacks, like relaxation tea and trying to distract myself. But then I found that I really did need just something small and sweet to satisfy myself, otherwise I'd obsess. I discovered that a candy lozenge does the trick for me. I like the Torie and Howard brand. One is 12 calories and is instantly satisfying - it's not a bingeable candy for me because the flavor is pretty strong with just one - and it's long lasting enough that I can mindfully enjoy it. I pair that with a can of seltzer and my belly and mind are happy before bed. \n\nThe way I'm discovering my overall eating patterns is by using MyFitnessPal. I'm able to see how my calories are spread throughout the day. I'm discovering that a tiny meal makes me overeat later. Or too little fat makes me overeat in general. And lack of fiber makes me want to fill my belly endlessly with bad things. My accountability buddies are family members. We text each other all the time and that is super helpful for me. Long story short - you'll start to recognize your patterns and that alone is so worth the annoyance of logging all the time. Good luck - I believe in you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mu8lc5/i_want_to_stop_night_eating_accountability_friends/gv5mf8p/"}
