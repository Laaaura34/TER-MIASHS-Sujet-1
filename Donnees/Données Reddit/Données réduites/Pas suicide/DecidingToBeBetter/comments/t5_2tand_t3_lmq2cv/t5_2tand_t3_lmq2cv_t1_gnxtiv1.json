Don't put it down. Put it away.\n\nRinse everything immediately.\n\nI rinse pots and pans immediately after plating the food.\n\nI live alone so cook normal sized recipes and put it into containers as I'm serving myself. What I don't want to eat right away goes in the freezer. Each container is a complete meal.\n\nThis way I don't _have_ to cook but still eat properly.\n\nAll this comes from hard experience of single-parenting three kids.\n\nBy the way, doing the dishes _*starts*_ with putting away the dry dishes.\n\nNot doing this is planning to start tomorrow on the wrong foot. \n\nWe need to set ourselves up for success. That starts with a good breakfast in a clean kitchen.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lmq2cv/clean_the_kitchen_before_bed/gnxtiv1/"}
