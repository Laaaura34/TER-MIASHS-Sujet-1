There is absolutely no reason to hate yourself or other because of their skin color.  Don\u2019t be radicalized by our shitty culture into self loathing. Be proud of who you are and your unique traits.  And having morals and ethical foundations is nothing to scoff at; in fact this will separate you from\nThe typical chaff.   Even if you don\u2019t believe god is real, the foundation set by a religious family can be a very good thing.  Just be careful not to let the pendulum swing too far or you can end up a degenerate.\nIf people downvote me they are either racist or just shitty people, and that\u2019s fine with me, we are all different.\n\nI recommend practicing meditation and exercise daily if you don\u2019t.  And take breaks from your phone/social media periodically.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p9d1mu/deconstructing_taught_ideals/h9zvunc/"}
