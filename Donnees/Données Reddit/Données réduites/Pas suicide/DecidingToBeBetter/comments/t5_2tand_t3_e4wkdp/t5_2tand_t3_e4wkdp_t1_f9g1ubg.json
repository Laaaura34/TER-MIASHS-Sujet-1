My solution is to practice saying no for smaller things. Also a big one is how often I'd step up and offer to help. Thereby distracting myself from really making any impact because I was busy helping others doing things they are very capable of. \n\nSince I stopped doing that, my free time has increased like 10-fold and I can just sit back and watch people do stuff. When they come to me for help - I give them just one point of help as the next step, and leave it at that. Sometimes I'll even say no just because \"I want to do something else instead\". \n\nIt gets easier once you realise people will respect you more for the things you say NO to than YES to.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/e4wkdp/how_to_stop_having_my_niceness_taken_advantage_of/f9g1ubg/"}
