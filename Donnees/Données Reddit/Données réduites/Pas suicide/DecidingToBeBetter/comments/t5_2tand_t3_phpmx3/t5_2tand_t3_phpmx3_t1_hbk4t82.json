You say \"Yes\"  to make someone happy or get them to quit asking or because you *wish*  you would be available to do it.   \n\nHow about instead of saying \"Yes\"  you say \"I don't know if I can fit that into my schedule- I need to give it some thought.\"     \n\n>Every day, I\u2019m telling people that I\u2019ll do a task, and saying yea when someone asks me to do something     \n\nStop that. Set some boundaries- don't just automatically agree to anything someone asks.  \n\nIf it's something you must do make a note on your phone. Use your calendar app or a note taking app- it's very easy to scribble \"Lunch w/mom Giovanni's 1pm\" in your calendar. But you must keep everything in one place. Then **each night you review it so that you can plan the next day.**     \n\n>to make sure I\u2019m not letting others in my life down?    \n\nPlease give your own life as much priority as you give everyone else's. You are in a very busy time of life right now and need to look after your own health as well. \nYou need to learn how to say no.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/phpmx3/i_dont_do_what_i_say_i_was_gonna_do_help/hbk4t82/"}
