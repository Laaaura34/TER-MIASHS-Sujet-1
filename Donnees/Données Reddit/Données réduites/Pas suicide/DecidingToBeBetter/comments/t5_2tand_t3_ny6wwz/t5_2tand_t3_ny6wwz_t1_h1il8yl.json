The fact you've even posted this first and foremost is a great step in the right direction. \nThere's nothing wrong with watching some tv but since you want to curb it, I'd say start small and aim to watch one less show per day or simply set a time to cut off the tv. Another thing you could benefit from is altering the type of subject matter that you watch. Instead of entertainment shows, you could try edutainment type of videos that entertain and teach you. A big part of the reason many of us don't have as much fun when our friends aren 't around is because we actually haven't given ourselves a chance to be alone and think about what we personally like to do. Start a hobby for yourself that you can do alone. It'll greatly help pass time when you are by yourself. But just take baby steps each day, to be better than the last. Hop in that shower, when you smell better you feel better and when you feel better you do better. We all can do better, heck I've gotta get off of my ass and start losing all this weight that I've gained from the lockdowns lol. Be sure to listen to motivational stuff too. Bottom line is you care about your situation which makes you better off than 50% of the rest of people who wont bother to do anything. You're in a great place my friend, and I'm very happy your father is well.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ny6wwz/i_could_use_some_advice/h1il8yl/"}
