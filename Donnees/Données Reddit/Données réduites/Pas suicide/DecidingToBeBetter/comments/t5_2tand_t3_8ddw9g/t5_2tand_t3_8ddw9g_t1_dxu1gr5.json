I created an 11:11 alarm as a reminder to constantly reflect on it.\n\nhttps://goop.com/wellness/health/rewire-your-head-change-your-world/\n\n\"In\u00a0Superbrain, Deepak and I emphasize that your brain is an organ that works for you. That might sound weird, but what I mean is that your brain is bringing you sensations that need to be interpreted. Whenever we have a sensory experience of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, or feeling something, we have to put it in context of what we already know in order to make sense of it. To do this, you use brain synapses you\u2019ve already formed, based on experiences you\u2019ve already had, all driven by the choices you\u2019ve already made.  \n So the choices you\u2019ve made in the past create the experiences you have now. The choices you make from today forward determine the experiences that will determine who you are in the future.\n  \nWe like to say that the real you is that entity that\u2019s using the brain. You\u2019re using the brain as it\u2019s bringing you these sensations and images, memories, feelings, and thoughts.  \n In effect, your brain brings you your world. But you have the power to determine the world your brain brings you.\n\n\u201cThe mistake that will make you miserable is to identify with the information being made available to your mind.\u201d\n\nAs soon as you make that leap of understanding, you realize that when someone does something bad to you and makes you sad or angry, the last thing in the world you should do is say, \u201cI am angry\u201d or \u201cI am sad.\u201d When you see a red car go by, your brain brings you the image of a red car, but you don\u2019t say, \u201cI am a red car.\u201d You say, \u201cI see a red car.\u201d Same thing: If that red car then runs through a puddle and soaks you, your brain brings you the feeling of anger. That doesn\u2019t mean you \u201care\u201d angry.\n\nI call it mountaintop consciousness: You\u2019re sitting on a mountaintop, observing what the brain is doing\u2014using your brain, rather than having your brain use you. The mistake that will make you miserable is to identify with the information being made available to your mind\"", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8ddw9g/how_to_not_complain_in_life_please_respond/dxu1gr5/"}
