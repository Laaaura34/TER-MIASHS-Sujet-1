And honestly, Arnold Schwarzenegger has been my idol since the age of 5. I've read multiple biographies of his, bought his autobiography in 7th grade and read it cover to cover. Always wanted to be just like him, but when I tried to share that interest I was either made fun of or completely ignored, so I turned to expressing my feelings on the page. One Writing degree later, here we are.\n\nI suppose that's partially why the fitness journey means as much to me as it does. Partially because I'm being true to myself, but partially because I equivocate it to improving all aspects of self.\n\nOther things I've realized over the course of this journey is that 90% of what we do boils down to a reaction to what we're afraid of. You can back away from it or you can run at it head-on. Because of that I'm choosing the latter--that means arguing with professors, or choosing a major in a subfield that isn't great outside of academia, or even cooking something I've never tried.\n\nHappiness is DEFINITELY a choice. That's why I pumped my fists with the \"YEAH\" every morning--it helped me choose progression, choose optimism. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/26kcr2/waiting_to_stellify_a_success_story/chtmrsn/"}
