You have a long term visa on where you want to be, yet you put that to the side to go to video games, something that is supposed to be fun and entertaining, something that in the end makes you feel even worse. How is that?  How is it that something made to be pleasurable makes us not feel great?\n\nTruth is, there is a feeling you\u2019re likely trying to escape and do so by going to a source of \u201cpleasure.\u201d  It\u2019s a false pleasure in that it\u2019s great in the moment  but doesn\u2019t serve you. You get a urge to go to it from your brain because that\u2019s more exciting and pleasurable than the boring, less desirable work you have to do. In the end those urges you get to go to video games are just urges. It\u2019s just your brain wanting to put you in a state of pleasure from an undesired state (discomfort, boredom, stress,etc.). You don\u2019t need to act on the urge and you can decide whether to follow it or not. It\u2019s completely on your control. It only turns into and action if you decide to act. \n\nNext time you get an urge to go to video games, when it\u2019s not your true intention (e.g. when you\u2019re in the middle of a task), identify what you\u2019re feeling and the thoughts you have. Are you thinking \u201cthis is boring\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t really want to be doing this right now?\u201d These are easy ways for your brain to go after that cheap and easy pleasure. Don\u2019t let it. Let the feeling dwell, recognize it, and just let it sit there. Let it just run in your mind and body, don\u2019t act on it. After about 10 min, the brain gets bored and goes onto something else. These urges may be hard at first to resist, and you may give in. That\u2019s ok, just recognize it and be ready for next time. Over time you\u2019re urges will subside and become far more manageable. Pretty soon the game console will start collect dust instead of your attention. \n\nYou can control yourself, know that. You\u2019re on a good path to your dreams, don\u2019t give that up for a video game that\u2019s obsolete by next year. You\u2019re life and future are far more important. \n\nI hope this serves you, you\u2019re amazing, and I love you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0zjju/i_want_to_focus_on_things_i_need_to_do_so_i_can/hfbyphv/"}
