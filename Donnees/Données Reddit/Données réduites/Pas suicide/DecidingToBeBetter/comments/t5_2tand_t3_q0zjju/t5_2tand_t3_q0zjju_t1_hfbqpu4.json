But where I\u2019m currently working on! I highly suggest you take a look at the Pomodoro technique to maintajn your focus on the goals you set up. For the goals, create a \u2018to do list\u2019 and just make them small, like: \u2018create a folder for this project\u2019 and \u2018start this document\u2019. \n\nWhat I\u2019ve learned is that procrastinating by, in your case playing video games, is just a lack of self discipline which those tools I just described can help you with, for it has helped me!
