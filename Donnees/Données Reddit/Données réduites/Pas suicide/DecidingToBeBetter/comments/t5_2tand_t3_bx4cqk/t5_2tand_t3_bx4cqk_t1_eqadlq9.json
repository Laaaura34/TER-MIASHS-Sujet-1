It is fine to have feelings about it, to be angry on some level. Many people would be frustrated by that - so I think it also might help you feel less concerned about your feelings to know that others would also feel that way. \n\nI'm not sure I'm on board with the \"not look down upon people who are selfish\" idea, but it sounds like from the rest of that sentence, they are trying to illustrate this concept of looking at multiple facets of a situation. My therapist described a similar thing, asking me to imagine I am in a bank and it gets robbed and I get shot in the arm. It seems ridiculous to imagine a silver lining there, but she was suggesting that being able to practice doing that is healthy - i.e. I got shot but I'm also not dead = positive. HOWEVER, it is important to keep in mind that this isn't advocating for ignoring the negative. I am allowed to still say it sucks that I got shot, ya know? The goal is to be able to hold more opinions of something simultaneously and see the \"gray area\".", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bx4cqk/we_are_not_meant_to_constantly_suffer_through_life/eqadlq9/"}
