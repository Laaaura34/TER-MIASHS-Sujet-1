But sometimes \"asking\" or \"seeking\" for someone to be on the same level with you might not be a good idea. - Not in the sense of searching of comfort or feeling wrongness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy more concern was of the feeling of trying to find a placeholder of chucking the problem into - Although sometimes (we) truly needed it, because of a sharp dramatic unforeseen pain/event. To temporary numb the pain. Its like trying to \"run\" away from the issue and not facing it. By hoping that oh... others face it too, so it is ok and I am not the only one. It happened to me at least, way too many times. Until I am at the state I am at now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am truly sorry again for your lost. And I cant really offer much advice.\n\nSince you have those AHA moments, and if you find it difficult to \"do it\", maybe jot it down somewhere and the next time when you need/want/wish to get it settled, at least you have something to look forward to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are most welcome. Thank you too for the well wishes. - Stay Strong", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bx4cqk/we_are_not_meant_to_constantly_suffer_through_life/eq7zmpg/"}
