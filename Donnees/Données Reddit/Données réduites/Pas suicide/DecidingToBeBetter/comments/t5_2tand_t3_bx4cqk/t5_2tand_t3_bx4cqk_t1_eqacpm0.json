Any advice that asks you to \"not let something get to you\" is BS because that is feeling-avoidant. It is much better to be able to \"see\" that feeling, identify it, ask why it is there, and use it as a messenger. Then, you can work on learning various ways of processing and acting in response to said feelings. Much healthier approach.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bx4cqk/we_are_not_meant_to_constantly_suffer_through_life/eqacpm0/"}
