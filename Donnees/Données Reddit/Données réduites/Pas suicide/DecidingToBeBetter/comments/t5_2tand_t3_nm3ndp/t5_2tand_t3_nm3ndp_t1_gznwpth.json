Thank you for the work you do. Seriously.\n\nEspecially this last year with Covid, when everyone was stuck inside, you guys provided safe transportation of food which allowed people to feel some sort of normal. And on a more personal level. I suffer with depression and when a depressive episode starts for me, it comes with anxiety and paranoia. A few times a year I'll have days or weeks where I struggle to do anything, shut down, and struggle to go outside or complete basic tasks. When this happens, usually UberEats is literally the only way I'm able to eat. And getting my favourite comfort meal from a local restaurant helps me feel a little bit more stable\n\nSo thank you :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nm3ndp/my_best_friend_challenged_me_to_do_one_difficult/gznwpth/"}
