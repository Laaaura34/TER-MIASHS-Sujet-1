I\u2019ve been doing this same challenge for a few weeks now and my whole life has changed. I look back at the things that gave me anxiety or made me feel insecure and I\u2019m shocked at how easy they seem now. I used to dread calling people on the phone. Whether it was to set an appointment or just check on a friend. I hated it. Now that I\u2019ve done it so much I can see how easy it is. Of course, I still may encounter rude people, but I still great knowing it\u2019s all a part of growth. \n\nI hope whoever is reading this is inspired to do the same. YOU CAN DO IT!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nm3ndp/my_best_friend_challenged_me_to_do_one_difficult/gzonx32/"}
