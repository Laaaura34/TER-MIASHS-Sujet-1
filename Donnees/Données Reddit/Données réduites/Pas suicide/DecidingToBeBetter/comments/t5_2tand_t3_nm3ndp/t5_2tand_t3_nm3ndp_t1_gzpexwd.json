I might spend a few minutes reading, but then I\u2019ll turn on a podcast, turn the lights off, snuggle in, and close my eyes. That hour and a half gives me enough time to do everything I need or want to do before I lay down such as start the dishwasher or take a warm shower or do some light stretching on my yoga mat. I also tend to start eliminating all non-essential lights since it\u2019s been shown that light screws your body\u2019s natural sleep clock because your body says \u201clight! That means time to be awake\u201d. I used to struggle sleeping before 2-3 am and now I\u2019m asleep by 11 pm at latest most nights. It takes time. It takes finding your own routine and rhythm and whatever helps you personally. Just, set a time that you want to be in bed to start. Then, set a time when all electronics go away. I find that the podcasts help sort of ease my mind and also fill that gap between screen time and sleep time. Also, I found that weighted blankets really help me sleep faster and better. \n\nI used to close the bar down so I wouldn\u2019t even get home till 3:30 am and wouldn\u2019t sleep till 7-8 am. It was a hard adjustment to make.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nm3ndp/my_best_friend_challenged_me_to_do_one_difficult/gzpexwd/"}
