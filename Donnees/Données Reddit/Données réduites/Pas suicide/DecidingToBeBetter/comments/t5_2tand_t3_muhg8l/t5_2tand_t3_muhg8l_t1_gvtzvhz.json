A lot of it goes back to my childhood but it doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s fault it was anymore it\u2019s my responsibility just as it is your own. It\u2019s really strong of you to realize that because sadly most people just blame others and play victim. I pushed away a girl I really loved because I had no idea how to set my own boundaries and how to respect others, I didn\u2019t know how to apologize, communicate, or really just stand up for myself. I\u2019ve realized that people would do things that bothered me and I would get annoyed about it but never make a big deal of it. Then eventually the pile would get stacked so high that I\u2019d become passive aggressive, resentful, rude, angry or even just blow up and say horrible things I\u2019d never say otherwise. I\u2019m healing now. But it kills me I didn\u2019t realize this sooner.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/muhg8l/ive_burned_bridges_with_people_who_care_deeply/gvtzvhz/"}
