(Tip: use Etsy for modern pop culture project patterns)\n\nI just finished a Bojack Horseman project for my best friend, and now I\u2019m doing a Doctor Who themed project. \n\nSizes also range from something you can do in a single day, to something you spend YEARS working on. \n\nSuper creative, great for keeping hands busy, and you get this wonderful piece of art to keep or give as a gift when you are done!\n\nEDIT: Also a super cheap hobby! Thread can be as little as $0.23 a skein, and fabric is about $5.00. Patterns can range from free to usually about $15 or so. I can typically finish a project that takes me months for about $20.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oorkq3/whatre_some_funcreative_hobbies_to_get_into_from/h61idjf/"}
