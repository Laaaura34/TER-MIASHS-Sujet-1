If you don't have any plants inside your home, go get one! Simple plants like Aloe or succulents are great. But plants that grow quickly and can make cuttings (cut pieces that grow roots in a cup of water) are really encouraging (my favorite is coleus, they're usually colorful). \n\nThis hobby helped me to see that growth, and change, happen. And that I am capable of it. Having greenery in the house also makes the air feel cleaner.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oorkq3/whatre_some_funcreative_hobbies_to_get_into_from/h60nw15/"}
