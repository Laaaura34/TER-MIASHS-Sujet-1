Basically you learn the basics of the mouth movements and imitating the sounds before trying to memorize the language and it helps you sound more like a native speaker. You do this by mimicking Spanish songs through a series of exercises. It\u2019s really fun and has made me more confident in speaking. \n\nThe courses aren\u2019t offered for enrollment online anymore but if you\u2019re interested, DM me and I can send you something useful.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oorkq3/whatre_some_funcreative_hobbies_to_get_into_from/h60mtir/"}
