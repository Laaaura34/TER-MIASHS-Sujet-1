You can put on your favorite TV show, do the same stitch thousands of times, and suddenly its September and you already have all of your Christmas presents made.\n\nI prefer knitting, but a lot of people told me crocheting is a lot easier. My fingers are just too fat and uncoordinated to figure it out.\n\nQuilting is also pretty fun. I think quilts are the peak of blanket technology and designing them is such a fun process. Actually finishing them is a lot harder though lol.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oorkq3/whatre_some_funcreative_hobbies_to_get_into_from/h62uy6z/"}
