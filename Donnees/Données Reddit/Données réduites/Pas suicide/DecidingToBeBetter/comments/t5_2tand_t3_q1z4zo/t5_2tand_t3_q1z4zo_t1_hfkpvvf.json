I don\u2019t do fully nude content either due to having a high sub rate. But it still takes a huge toll on me and the stigma around Of is still the same despite not producing actual porn or posting full nudes. I also wouldn\u2019t be able to make this much money at any other job at my age, but again I have a social media following- this doesnt apply to a lot of people unfortunately. \n\nI hope this helped :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1z4zo/i_quit_onlyfans_because_it_was_harming_me_my/hfkpvvf/"}
