Right now it's a hobby, but I am worried that making it a job will suck the fun out of it. She had some similar experiences making and selling art - was fun to do as a gift, but when orders came in (especially for things she wasn't excited about working on) it felt like a second job.\n\nReally good post and I'm sure this will lead to same great discussions on our end as well.
