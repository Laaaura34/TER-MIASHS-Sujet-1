It\u2019s so sad to see so many people buy in and not even see the effects it\u2019s having on gender and sexual relations. \n\nThank you for your post, we need other women to speak out on this issue because we\u2019re surrounded by messaging that everyone supports this and if you question it you\u2019re a prude and anti-feminist. It\u2019s so disempowering. Sorry to get political but reading your post gives me hope that the OF trend is temporary. We\u2019re people, not products. \n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking care of yourself!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1z4zo/i_quit_onlyfans_because_it_was_harming_me_my/hfkpeu6/"}
