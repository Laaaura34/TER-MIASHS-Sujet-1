Some people may have started ahead and got addicted to alcohol. Some people seem to have it together and don\u2019t. Some people don\u2019t seem to have it together but they\u2019re on the verge of figuring it out. Your situation is complicated, and no one\u2019s is any simpler.\n\nThis is tossed around so much.. but it\u2019s true:\n\u201cCompare yourself to who you were yesterday rather than who someone else is today.\u201d (Edit: See, u/wiresided beat me to it.)\n\nThe ONLY WAY to be satisfied with yourself is to keep improving. Don\u2019t set a marker for the point at which you can no longer improve, instead lead a lifestyle and follow a goal that requires CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT. Notice I say \u201csatisfied\u201d and not \u201chappy\u201d. Happy isn\u2019t a beneficial/productive thing, satisfaction is. Happy doesn\u2019t help someone sleep the way a day of productivity does. Happiness can be acquired without satisfaction and sometimes satisfaction doesn\u2019t bring happiness. Sometimes to get that satisfaction with yourself, it can be a very testing and uncomfortable situation. \n\nBe happy when you die. Until then, keep showing *yourself* how good *you* can be. When you can finally say you\u2019re a good man, everyone around you may have already been seeing it and saying it. That wouldn\u2019t matter because *you* don\u2019t know yet. The type of man you\u2019ll become is determined by what you put into yourself, not what others put into you, by what you recognize within yourself rather than how you compare to others. Please take a healthy pride, if not in who you are now, in who you plan on becoming and what you\u2019re doing to get there. \n\nSocial-media is what it is. I\u2019d suggest you narrow it down to people you actually care about. I have 19 Facebook friends and I could even delete some of those. I am, however, a hermit.. your list might be 50 or it might be 10 depending on how close you are with your family and whatever. I *do* recommend you purge that list though, and it\u2019s not like significant life-changing thing.. it just feels like freedom.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivk1uw/i_cant_stop_comparing_myself_to_others_and_its/g5t574v/"}
