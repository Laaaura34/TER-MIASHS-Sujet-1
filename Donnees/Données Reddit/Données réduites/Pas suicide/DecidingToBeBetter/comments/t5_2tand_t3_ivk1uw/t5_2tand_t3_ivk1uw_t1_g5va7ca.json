But again, I think this is entirely subjective, what you see as growth could serve to stunt someone's growth. It's fairly irresponsible to offer it as some 100% solution because it worked for you. If someone followed your advice, felt miserable and were already at their end of their stick so to say you basically just played a role in a great downfall. \n\nYour solution isn't realistic, moreso it's based again off blind optimism thjat things \"might\" or could get better after it. \n\nThis is all not set in stone and pretending is is very, very dangerous. There are people who grinded their whole lives doing what you're saying and get no where, there are people for the counter as well but weird cringey blind optimism isn't 100% and to sort of push this narrative that it can get better by doing something like setting yourself up for mediocrity is very lemming. \n\n\"I got a promotion lol\" isn't valid at all. All the same, I'm glad it worked out for you and maybe it'll even work out for others but dismissing those that it didn't work out for...
