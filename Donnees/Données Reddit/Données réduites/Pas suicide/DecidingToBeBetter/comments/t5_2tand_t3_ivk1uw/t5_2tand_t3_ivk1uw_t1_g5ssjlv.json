There really are a lot of people out there who are older than you and still are figuring things out.\n\n Some of them look like \"they have it made\" to people around them, but the reality might be that they just followed a path and still are not content. (I personally feel like this myself.)\n\nWhat do you find neat and cool? Like seriously, what topic do you find interesting enough that you want to learn more about it? Better yet, what inspires you? \n\nIt can be as simple as an idea like loving cars and applying that love to an activity like learning about what makes it tick. If you find that you really do like learning about it, then it could be a ticket to head in that direction.\n\nIf there is nothing you can think of, then no sweat I would say!!! Find someone you trust and see what they think is neat. You can figure out if what they believe is neat is something that rings a bell within you.\n\nThe most important thing is that you give just enough thought to get yourself to take action, but not TOO MUCH thought that you NEVER take action.\nNo action is the greater evil.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivk1uw/i_cant_stop_comparing_myself_to_others_and_its/g5ssjlv/"}
