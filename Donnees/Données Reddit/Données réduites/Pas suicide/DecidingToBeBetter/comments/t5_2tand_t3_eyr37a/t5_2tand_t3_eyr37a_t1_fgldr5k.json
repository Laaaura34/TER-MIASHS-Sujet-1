I am new to this sub and I have this exact same problem. I am always after instant gratification things. This is even after knowing in my head, \"what is right\" and \"what I should do instead of this\". As one of the other users mentioned, I guess \"I don't want it enough\". The problem is, from time to time I do feel motivated, go out and do stuff. But every so often I just fall back to this pattern. No matter how much I think it through, I don't seem to find a way to stay motivated for something long-term.  \n\n\nIt's relieving to know that other people are going through similar things. I just want to tell you guys, that I really really hope that you find happiness, and soon. And thank you to all the kind souls giving advice. I really really hope that I can start going to sleep happy everyday, someday. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eyr37a/why_do_i_persuade_myself_to_do_things_that_are/fgldr5k/"}
