I was 22 myself when I was diagnosed with both severe clinical depression and severe generalized anxiety. \n\nI would strongly suggest investigating therapy, or at least an initial psych evaluation (I know the cost can be extreme, but I promise there are ways to make it affordable).\n\nIt sounds like you were an intelligent kid, and there\u2019s some hopelessness about the future that has taken hold-an unfortunately common thing for smart kids-and can easily turn into some serious depression. \n\nJust my two cents. Hope you find answers OP!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbx2td/im_terrified_of_my_extremely_average_and_lazy/hhdme2r/"}
