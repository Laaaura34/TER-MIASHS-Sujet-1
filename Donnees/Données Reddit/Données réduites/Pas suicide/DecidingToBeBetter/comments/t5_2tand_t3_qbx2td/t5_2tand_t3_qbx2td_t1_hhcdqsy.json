Just before reading your post I was literally thinking to myself how I wasted all of the years in my twenties. I'm now much older than that and regretting it so much. I was an excellent student but I didn't know what to do with myself and I wasted those energetic and unencumbered years. Give yourself some time, a few days, a week or two, and just keep a journal asking yourself what it is you want out of life. Pick some goals, short-term, long term and decide what you can do each day. Even becoming a writer can happen but you have to think of each day's work as being a writer, not the goal of having become a writer. Ann lamott's book, Bird by Bird, can explain. I think the idea can help even if you want something other than to become a writer. Or talk to a guidance counselor or find someone you can trust as an advisor. These are the years when you are not dealing with having to earn an income to support a family, then later you will deal with aging - definitely live in your 20s but make your decisions and then live to your fullest. Don't waste your only life on the things our civilization is giving you to waste your life energy on. Good luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbx2td/im_terrified_of_my_extremely_average_and_lazy/hhcdqsy/"}
