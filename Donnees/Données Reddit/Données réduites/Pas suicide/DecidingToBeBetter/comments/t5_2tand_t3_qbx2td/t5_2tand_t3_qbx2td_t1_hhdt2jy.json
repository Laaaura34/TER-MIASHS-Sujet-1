My parents used to drill into me the importance of college and getting good grades, and to pick a major that would pay off (Engineering, Law, Finance, Pre Med). I ended up doing Finance, but because of depression and anxiety, I graduated with a gpa below 3.0. I struggled throughout my 20s trying to \u201cmake it\u201d in the corporate world and never did.\n\nI sit here as a 30yo man without a career and without direction, still chipping away at a lost cause. In fact, despite having a Finance degree, I\u2019ve only ever worked in shitty jobs that paid below $20/hr. Jobs like manufacturing, call center support, billing clerk, etc.\n\nTL;DR\u2013 I\u2019ve still yet to figure out who I am and what I want to do.
