I think the biggie is figuring out your why. What do you want your life to be about? What brings you joy? Where do you want to go? Who do you want to be? There is nothing wrong with not being the most career-oriented person if that's how you truly feel. Life is whatever you want it to be at the end of the day. If you want to be rich, you can be rich, if you want to travel the world then focus on traveling the world, if you want to meet someone and have a family then focus on that. I think the thing you're really missing is what's the point of all this and in reality, the only one who can answer that for you is you. Just know that you can do anything so long as you consistently work towards it. Some goals you can reach faster than other goals and it's an important skill to learn how to work on things long term and finish your projects before starting a new one. \n\nAlso, college is a hard/depressing time, things do get better out of school especially if you get a low maintenance remote job that allows you more autonomy with decent pay. What your feeling is normal, decide what YOU actually want in life honestly, and make some short and long-term goals that can help you achieve those things. I would also add in exercising and possibly speak with a psychiatrist if you really feel like you can't focus or complete tasks, could be an issue with your body's dopamine production and medication may be helpful", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbx2td/im_terrified_of_my_extremely_average_and_lazy/hhdobnd/"}
