It was really bad and undiagnosed when I was in college. I finally got help in my late 20s after I had flunked out of school a couple of times and was working a dead end job. Therapy (and a little medication) really helped me get my life back on track. \n\nAgain, I'm not a doctor and I'm not trying to diagnose you, just telling you my story. I wish someone would have recommended that I talked to a therapist sooner.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbx2td/im_terrified_of_my_extremely_average_and_lazy/hhczfc1/"}
