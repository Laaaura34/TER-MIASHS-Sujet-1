National Novel Writing Month is this coming November. NaNoWriMo is a really fun experience, thousands of people all over the world participate. It's entirely free. You can donate, but you don't have to. Some companies offer free or discounted things to participants and winners, like writing software. \n\nThe standard goal is to write 50k words over 30 days. You can choose any genre, fiction, non-fiction, and even fanfiction. There is a forum filled with different useful topics, from asking advice to whinging. My favorite threads are making playlists for each other's stories and reading other's excerpts and telling them what you like about it. There are also weekly pep talks from published authors giving advice and encouragement.\n\nBut ultimately, the real goal is just to write every day, even if it's just a sentence or two.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbx2td/im_terrified_of_my_extremely_average_and_lazy/hheq6c6/"}
