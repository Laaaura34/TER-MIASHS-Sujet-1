You don't become who you want to be during the down hours, it's more in the day to day things.  You're in school, are you focused during class? Do you understand the things you are learning? Are you getting a degree in what you ultimately  want to be? If so, I would say you're on track.  Nobody is dialed 100% of their time, go easier on yourself. \"Bare minimum\" is just fine as long as you're meeting your long term goals.  For the things you aren't meeting, ask yourself if it's really that important to you right now (ie, why guitar? Sounds like that can wait). Having a social life and relaxing is important, and the amount of time is variable dependent on how much you have to do and how stressed you are", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbx2td/im_terrified_of_my_extremely_average_and_lazy/hhd9coj/"}
