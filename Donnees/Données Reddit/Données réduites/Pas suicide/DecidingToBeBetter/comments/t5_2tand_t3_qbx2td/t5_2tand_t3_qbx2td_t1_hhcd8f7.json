They never pushed me to do anything, they themselves only completed high school and went into \u201cunskilled\u201d jobs. They never got mad when I got bad grades because I always achieved more than they ever did so they were still proud. I don\u2019t want their lifestyle at all, I want to go places, earn money, see things\u2026. But I\u2019m realising I\u2019m still becoming them slowly. I\u2019m taking your advice though - I need to chill and slowly rediscover my ambitions and all that.
