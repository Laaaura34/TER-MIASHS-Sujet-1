For example there are a lit of people in reddit that seem to think you can't have opposite sex friends and be in a relationship. IMO this is controlling and awful to think this way. But at other times people sometimes do crazy stuff like be overly critical of their partner's looks or something.\n\nThen I stopped reading and remembered my golden rule in dating. If the person doesn't share my values then I just find another person. Its never worth it to try to change someone. Do you really want to police your partner's behavior.\n\nYeah....you were being a nag the solution isn't to stop nagging the solution is to be in a relationship that's harmonious. If you start to find you can't have a harmonious relationship even when your values closely align then take another look at your own behavior.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hqdy1u/some_insight_please_i_used_to_be_critical_in/fxxmlbx/"}
