I\u2019m not asking whether to cut it or not \u2014 that\u2019s already done, we\u2019re not in contact anymore.\n\nI am purely asking about the psychology of things, as I\u2019m confused about how to feel about the way we handled things. \n\nAbout the \u201calways a cheater\u201d saying, I strongly disagree. I know several people who have turned their lives around. But the cheating itself does break the partner, so it is a horrible act, I agree there.\n\nThanks for your time", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hqdy1u/some_insight_please_i_used_to_be_critical_in/fxxkcsl/"}
