And nobody likes living with a loser\". It looks like you both on some level fell in the trap of \"well I'm right about you doing X and I'm justified to do Y\". ie. He cheated therefore you felt justified to in the language you used or demands and he then felt he had changed and showed he would go the length to make it work and was rewarded with more of the same language therefore he's taken licence to say you're over critical about everything and has made him suspicious of your intentions. \n\nUltimately if you intend to have a long term relationship you have to be honest about your feelings with eachother but you need to guard against yourself using that to 'win' . Aim for peace rather than winning. The health of the relationship should be the common goal for both of you if you intend to continue and it requires the effort and good faith engagement of both parties in sharing their issues as well as improving themselves.\n\nI hope that makes some sense, I don't mean to overly criticize you in particular if it came off that way. I hope you both learn from this experience and become better people.\n\nPeace and love", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hqdy1u/some_insight_please_i_used_to_be_critical_in/fxxoq6q/"}
