Unfortunately, I actually married the guy. Now we are in the middle of a legal separation \"trying to work things out\" but he is also gaslighting me and telling me that I use my feelings to manipulate him.

You'll end up in a relationship with someone who treats you as inferior forever, and if you're like me you'll be in therapy 2x a week for the foreseeable future. Seriously, it isnt worth it. Your emotions are justified, i just hope you don't put up with this as long as I have.
