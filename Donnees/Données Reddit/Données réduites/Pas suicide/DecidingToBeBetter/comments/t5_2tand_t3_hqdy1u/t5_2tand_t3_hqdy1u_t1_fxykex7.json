I broke up with my ex 7-8 months ago over very similar issues. Him being abusive, trying to change and me not having the best reactions, ending up abusing him as well. On top of everything I developed a severe anxiety that was also blamed for our problems.\n\nA very wise friend of mine answered my question of who was right or wrong, saying truth is halfway between the two of you. Instead of trying to find who is to blame I would advise focusing on healing your most broken parts, so next time you make better choices. \n\nLook at the roots of your patterns: is this the first time you were in an abusive situation like this? Why did his behaviour trigger strong reactions in you? Why couldn\u2019t you truly forgive him or yourself? \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re both good people, just probably have unresolved issues that your relationship brought out. Instead of playing the blame game and / or beating yourself up about it take it as a very important lesson. You\u2019re already on the good path by posting here and trying to grow. I highly recommend therapy, it can be a big boost on your journey of recovery and will help you understand yourself better. \n\nAnd until then, be kind and forgiving with him and yourself. We all make mistakes, what we learn from them is key. \n\nGood luck! \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hqdy1u/some_insight_please_i_used_to_be_critical_in/fxykex7/"}
