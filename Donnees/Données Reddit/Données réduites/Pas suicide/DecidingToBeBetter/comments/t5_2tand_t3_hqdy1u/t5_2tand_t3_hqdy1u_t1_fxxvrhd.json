This is what he is doing to you , accept it or not. He's not gonna change , change might take at least a few years if at all . I've been in your exact situation last year, gave him a second chance,  all that shit , and now I've been in absolutely zero contact with him since February,  and this is the most peaceful and happy I've been in my life. My former relationship was of about 2 years as well . \n\nIt's not easy for a person to overcome their narcissistic,  abusive tendencies,  these kind of people rarely change , and if they do it takes a lot of a time and a lot of consistent effort . He is not going to take those efforts as long as you still be with him , even if you leave he may probably not look within or make any efforts. You must leave for your own greater good , love yourself to protect yourself from abusive people.  Do not stay in a situation/relationship where you are dehumanized , treated in a sub human manner and are abused . \n\nTwo great books you can read on this topic are - ' Why does he do that ?' By Lundy Bancroft , and 'The Body keeps the score'. So far I've read 'Why does he do that ? ' , it changed my life forever.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hqdy1u/some_insight_please_i_used_to_be_critical_in/fxxvrhd/"}
