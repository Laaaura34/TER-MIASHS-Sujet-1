He tried to stop talking to her, but ultimately went back. And he would flirt with other women constantly and kind of just ruined my trust in that department. \n\nAnd yeah I'm not allowed to talk to him unless he speaks to me first. It's a shitty situation but I dont believe in giving up on anything until its 100% over with no going back so I'm giving it a year. I definitely shouldn't because this is super unhealthy but it is what it is. \n\nYou're not terrible. I reacted the same by telling him how he should behave and what he \"needed\" to do. While that isn't healthy either, it's pretty normal to react that way. It's a way to control the situation that otherwise feels uncontrollable. But as much as it hurts to say, even if you'd been more patient towards the end it would have likely ended anyway.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hqdy1u/some_insight_please_i_used_to_be_critical_in/fxxg5tq/"}
