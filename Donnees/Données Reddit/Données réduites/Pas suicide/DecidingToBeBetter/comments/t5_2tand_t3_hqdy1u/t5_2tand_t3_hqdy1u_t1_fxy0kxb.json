You grow organically together, or you don't and move apart and eventually break up. But you can't choose to change your BF and then expect him to want to change. \n\nOfc you discuss negative behaviour and meet in the middle for a compromise and both grow that way. \n\nActions speak louder than words, why do you think at this point, he is going to change? Why are you continuing to waste your time?\n\nI feel, just from what you have said, that you are both consciously or unconsciously manipulating and gaslighting each other here and basically, this relationship either needs counselling or needs to end. \n\nRelationships require work, but they should not be a power struggle.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hqdy1u/some_insight_please_i_used_to_be_critical_in/fxy0kxb/"}
