He is, as you said yourself, blatantly disrespectful - and has been since the beginning. And I think you\u2019ve been unfair to yourself throughout this whole relationship. \n\nIts not fair that he gets to \u201cpractice being committed\u201d on you and basically use you to make all his \u201cmistakes\u201d on. Being committed is a choice, you either do it or you don\u2019t. He\u2019s chosen to disrespect the relationship multiple times. You shouldn\u2019t have to tell a grown man how to be a respectful partner. Don\u2019t put yourself through that. Don\u2019t be his emotional crash test dummy. \n\nAnd don\u2019t fall for that \u201cyou\u2019re toxic\u201d bullshit either. He\u2019s the one manipulating you, because you\u2019re now questioning whether you have the right to express how you feel about things *he* did to *you*. He wants to be able to disrespect you with impunity. \n\nRelationships like this don\u2019t usually change, OP. ~~I\u2019d leave and find someone who\u2019ll respect you without you having to tell them to.~~ Those people are out there. Also check out Dr. Ramani on YouTube. She\u2019s an expert in narcissism, so many see if some of what she says resonates with you.\n\nEdit: Forgot that he already broke things off.
