This is not right or wrong, but entirely human.\n\nExample, if he was supposed to call you at 8:00 but did not do so, your brain goes straight to disrespect, disregard, and maybe even infidelity - because that\u2019s what it was in the past. But the \u2018reformed\u2019 him could have just genuinely overslept, been detained elsewhere, or made an honest mistake. You proceed to berate him for disrespect and accusing him of not genuinely loving you. *Without* a past history, your reaction is over the top. So I can see him unfortunately shutting down any kind of comment or reproach from you no matter how justified you may be. Nobody is an asshole here, but your communication and reception of each other\u2019s ideas was stuck in an unhealthy place.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hqdy1u/some_insight_please_i_used_to_be_critical_in/fxxs4s2/"}
