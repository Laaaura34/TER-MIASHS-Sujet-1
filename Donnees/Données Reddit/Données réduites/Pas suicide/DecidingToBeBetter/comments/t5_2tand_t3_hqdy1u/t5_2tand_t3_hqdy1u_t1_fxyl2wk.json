Cos I think, by the end, I was emotionally spent. Before the cheating, while he was \u201ctrying out\u201d this monogamy thing with me, he was so self-absorbed that I felt like I was exercising compassion for two people. It was exhausting, but I was just doing what felt natural, without stopping to think how it was affecting me and my wellbeing.\n\nSo I guess in our second round, I dumped the majority of the load on him to try to \u201cmake up for\u201d the amount I exerted before. But I didn\u2019t even consider that this would be too much for one person to handle. No one likes to be continually criticised, judged, blamed, or bossed around, you\u2019re right. And it absolutely is mentally draining\u2014for that, I am glad he left. For his own sake. I do hope he finds his happiness and peace.\n\nThanks again for the breakdown and interesting perspective!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hqdy1u/some_insight_please_i_used_to_be_critical_in/fxyl2wk/"}
