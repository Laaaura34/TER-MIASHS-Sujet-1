I just want to stand firm on my ground. If they don't get me and don't want to do what I do. It's okay. I am no one to force or advice them to follow me. I just consider them referring to my way of life as shit was wrong. Anyways I guess they have their reasons and can not discuss them due to issues they might have. I tried to speak my mind they didn't like it. It's cool. I can't shut them down you know. So I'll let them speak. Mostly they also needed somebody to pick on so they picked me today that's all. I'm cool.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ez6k12/a_fellow_redditor_is_calling_my_ideology_shit/fgllug8/"}
