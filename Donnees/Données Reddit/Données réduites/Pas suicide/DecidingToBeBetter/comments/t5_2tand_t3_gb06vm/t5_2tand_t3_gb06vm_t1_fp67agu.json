Thats NOT nice. You\u2019re judgemental.\n\nThe simple truth is that if you don\u2019t change your act, the reaction won\u2019t change either. You are the only constant.\n\nYou asked for advice and I gave you an honest outside perspective. I hope you actually take it into consideration. \n\nThe following will also sound unpleasant but I think you need to hear it: stop being so insecure and defending yourself blindly before actually thinking fairly about the negative feedback you are getting and why.\n\nYou say you\u2019re confident and you say you\u2019re nice, but those aren\u2019t thing you can just claim about yourself. Youre not nice, you\u2019re not confident.\n\nHate me and ignore it or change your life for the better by swallowing your pride and working on the flaws that are causing your issues.\n\nUp to you, this wasn\u2019t an insult but rather a wake up call. \n\nI wont be reading your response. I rather have you ponder it knowing your excuses will go unheard.\n\nTruly hope my rudeness was eye-opening, good luck in your future random Victorian.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gb06vm/i_feel_as_if_my_victorian_lifestyle_is_going_to/fp67agu/"}
