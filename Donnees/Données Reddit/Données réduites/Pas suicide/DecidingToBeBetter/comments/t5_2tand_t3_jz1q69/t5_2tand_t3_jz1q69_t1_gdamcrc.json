The best advice I can give you is to own it, this new thing about yourself that you cannot change. From discomfort comes growth - no one ever grew by staying in their comfort zone. \n\nPeople will admire your bravery and guts more than they will judge you for the cut. Surprise yourself and you'll surprise others. I've been where you are - don't overthink it, just fucking go. You've got it handled. You are exceptional and you are just fine. Your worth isn't measured by the esteem of men. You're indomitable. Walk, sweet girl. I'm right there with you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gdamcrc/"}
