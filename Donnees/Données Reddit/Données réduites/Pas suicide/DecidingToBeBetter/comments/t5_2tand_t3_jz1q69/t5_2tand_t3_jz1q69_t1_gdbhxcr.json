Buzz cuts are awesome! My personal mantra that gave me big break through was \"whatever people think of my optics, does not really affect me that often.\" people on the street that might look at you wierd don't affect your life in any meaningful way and everybody else that can actually affect you will have more information about you than the way you look. What you do and say can turn around a lot. As long as you feel good with how you look and are, you will radiate that and that will eventually overpower everything. Good luck in your further growth, don't let anything stop you <3", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gdbhxcr/"}
