I just wanted to express myself a bit, but there is so much pressure from parents, friends, classmates, and just general society to conform to traditional gender norms, especially when it comes to hair. I constantly had to listen to \"jokes\" about girls having shorter hair than me. And if I had a problem with it, I just didn't have any humor apparently. It led to a lot of self doubt and self hatred. Who exactly benefited from that is beyond me, I hope those people's chuckles were worth it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gdbamx2/"}
