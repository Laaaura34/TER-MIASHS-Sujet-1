Denial lasted a while.\n\nBalding is a funny one as it can be openly ridiculed, even though people don't have a choice in the matter, similar to ginger hair or height. Acceptance is the answer, & it really doesn't matter in the grand scheme.\n\nYou're attempting a great experiment, both external among society, & personal with confidence & identity. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gd97jf4/"}
