You got this, it can be hard at first but other people or societal norms don\u2019t matter, buzzcuts are awesome on any gender! I had super long hair my whole life that I also kept in a bun constantly when i was alone, it was so hard to deal with and uncomfortable but I kept it long until I was 18 because I thought it was the only thing that made me pretty. Finally I shaved it and it was terrifying at first, and I got a few disparaging comments, but in that time I gained the most confidence I\u2019ve ever had! Buzzcuts are beautiful and badass and anything you want them to be :) When i tell people that someday I\u2019ll shave my head again they (especially men) tell me not to do it, but that only reinforces why we gotta keep doing stuff like that! I also got the most positive reinforcement from people who actually mattered during that time, so rock the buzzcut, I\u2019m sure you look awesome and you feel a lot weirder than you look rn!! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gd9zaxt/"}
