And some people may misinterpret it as an indirect attack on them, implying that they\u2019re close minded but that\u2019s more to do with how you conduct yourself. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s you, or that you shouldn\u2019t do these things if you want to, but you can certainly be subversive and unique without reflecting it in your physical appearance, and that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re still enslaved by the societal norms or anything - it\u2019s often just a matter of convenience.\n\nAnyway you\u2019ll be alright, just go about your life as you would have, and If you and your boyfriend like it then that\u2019s the main thing", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gdegesa/"}
