It felt so weird to no longer rely on my hair as my crutch \u2014 for example, I\u2019d always put my hair down when I wanted to feel prettier. But the first time I stared at myself in the mirror after shaving off my hair, I felt like I finally saw my pure beauty for the first time. No makeup, no hair, just my face and newfound appreciation for not having to wash my hair anymore. The whole experience really taught me to fuck gender expectations and norms, and I\u2019m so proud of you for being so bold and doing what you think you need to do. Keep rocking it :) And there are some very cute accessories as your hair slowly grows back, or even if you decide to keep it shaved!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gdauto0/"}
