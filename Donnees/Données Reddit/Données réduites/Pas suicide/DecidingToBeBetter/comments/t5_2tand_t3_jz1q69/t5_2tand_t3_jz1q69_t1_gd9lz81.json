Maybe you\u2019ll grow to love it, but if you don\u2019t that\u2019s okay too. Hair will grow back. My hair is long now and I love it again. Sociology wise - do things for you, look pretty or don\u2019t for you. Shave or don\u2019t shave your body hair, it\u2019s you CHOICE. You don\u2019t have to do things out of societal obligation and beauty standards, but also if you feel more confident about the way you look even if it\u2019s closer to society\u2019s beauty standards, that is OKAY! Having a critical understanding of gender, race, sexuality, law, and a lot of other things is hugely important and that\u2019s awesome you\u2019re into it. If I were you I would focus my energy on my education of those concepts. Have fun on your journey! And don\u2019t sweat the hair, you may adapt to love it, and if you don\u2019t it will grow out in like a year. If you don\u2019t feel confident during that time, take it as an opportunity to understand that you have SO MUCH MORE TO OFFER THE WORLD THAN \u201cPRETTY.\u201d", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gd9lz81/"}
