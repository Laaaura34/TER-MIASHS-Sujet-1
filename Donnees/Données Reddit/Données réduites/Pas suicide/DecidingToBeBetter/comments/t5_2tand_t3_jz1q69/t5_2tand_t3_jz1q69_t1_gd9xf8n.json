It is difficult at first, but you learn how to deal with it, cope with it.....you may eventually learn to like it.  People gonna say all kinds of stuff, ngl (I know b/c I have gone from beautiful long hair to very closely shorn 2x times now).  However, you learn a lot about yourself.\n\nThat, and the grow out process is fun and frustrating at the same time. Plus, you get a fresh start at new hair, hopefully.  You may find out more things about your hair (and yourself) that you did not even know existed.  You will grow as a person while your hair grows out.\n\n If you listen carefully, the universe will tell you to trust yourself.\n\nYou got this.
