I'm a lot older, and it wasn't until my first post-lockdown haircut a few months back that I found the courage to say to the hair stylist, you know what, do THIS. I'd had it cut like that once before, very short, and my then-OH jokingly but not entirely joking threatened to beat up the hairdresser (he wouldn't have done - he was all mouth, no trousers). Since then I'd always got it cut how other people liked it, even though it drove me nuts. So this summer for the first time in years the back of my head felt fuzzy and I loved it. I didn't care what anyone else thought; I didn't care if I got no compliments. I liked it, and that is ultimately what matters.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gda7t29/"}
