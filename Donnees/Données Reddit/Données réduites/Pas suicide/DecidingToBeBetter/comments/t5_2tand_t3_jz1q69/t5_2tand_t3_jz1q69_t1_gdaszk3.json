Truly, it made me so self conscious. Personally, I loved it a lot of the time, but like you, I was kind of insecure about getting looks in public. Eventually the feminist in me kicked in and I tried to stop caring, but there are still days as it grows back out that I kind of hate it. \nI just try to remember that I had bad hair days before this when I didn\u2019t love how it looked. It\u2019s okay to care what people think sometimes as long as you don\u2019t let it hold you back (and obviously you didn\u2019t.)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gdaszk3/"}
