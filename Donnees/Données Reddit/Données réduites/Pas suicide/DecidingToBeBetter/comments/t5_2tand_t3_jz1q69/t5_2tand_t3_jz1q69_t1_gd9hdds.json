She plans to grow it all back, but she went grey early in life, had been dying it ever since and finally wanted to start over. She hasn't looked back and has found the experience very empowering.\n\nWe have two young daughters and the number of social norms that they will adhere to, compared to boys, makes me sad. Women do so many things to themselves because society expects it (I'm guessing that the number one item is shaving legs and under arms). It just isn't necessary and it would take a few generations for society to shift, but it just won't happen, sadly.\n\nI was excited to realise that here in the UK my children will learn to drive in electric cars, due to the ban on petrol and diesel cars from 2030. I am seeing the future in my lifetime and it's great. But I'm also going to have two girls who will shave legs, don make up and wear the latest fashions, most probably with no clue who they are doing it for.\n\nEnjoy the haircut. I love mine, but I'm a man and isn't as shocking for people. Life shouldn't be like that. Keep a diary of your experiences as I am sure you will look back on it one day and wonder why it was ever a concern.\n\nOh, and have a read of the Four Agreements if you want to walk down the street without a care in the world \ud83d\ude42", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gd9hdds/"}
