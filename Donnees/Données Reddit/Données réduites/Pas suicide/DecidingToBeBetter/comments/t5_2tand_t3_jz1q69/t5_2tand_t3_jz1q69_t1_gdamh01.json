I seriously feel like shaving your head is something worth trying at least once for everyone, especially women. And if you decide to grow it longer again, it will be your choice because now you've experienced it both ways and you'll know what you prefer.\n\nWhen I moved on my own to the city for the first time there was *so.* *much.* street harassment, every single day, every single time I left my apartment, that it was starting to take a serious toll on my mental health. I ended up saying 'fuck it' and shaving my head one summer to look less traditionally feminine, and it was honestly so much fun and such a relief afterwards. I was really lucky at the time to be at a supportive job where my hair didn't matter, and to have a mostly-LGBT social circle where people didn't judge me or think twice about it. It's really freeing to be able to exert agency over your own body like that, especially if you've had others telling you what you should or should not do with your own hair for so long.\n\nAlso, showering and getting ready in the morning is so much faster, and throughout the day you never have to worry about what your hair is doing or how it looks. (You're probably saving money on hair products, too.) It can be hard to make a change for yourself when we're always told to worry about how we look to others, but I hope you enjoy the benefits!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gdamh01/"}
