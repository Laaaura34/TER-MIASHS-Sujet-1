I know that\u2019s a difficult thing to accept but it\u2019s so very true. I\u2019ll be 24 next month and i shaved my head earlier this year after wanting to do it for years! It is such a freeing and brave thing to do!! You\u2019re body is your own and in reality it is just a vessel that carries the most important part of you; you\u2019re soul. Nothing physical makes you truly attractive. It\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside as cliche as that may sound. Things will get better. When you get out of high school and move on you\u2019ll be around more people who validate you because of who you are as a person. Try positive affirmations and know that you followed your heart and did something so incredible. I\u2019m proud of you and I truly hope you know that beauty 100% comes from within. Much love.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gdbda2l/"}
