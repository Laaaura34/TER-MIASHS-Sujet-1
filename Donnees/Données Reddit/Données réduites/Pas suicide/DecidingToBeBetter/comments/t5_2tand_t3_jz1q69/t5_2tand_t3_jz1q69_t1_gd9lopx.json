I regret not doing it and now my job most likely wouldn\u2019t allow it. Over the summer I was off for knee surgery and I ended up dyeing my hair purple.

You went against societally norms and hopefully this will be a learning experience for you. I hope you find the answers you\u2019re looking for. I\u2019m proud of you for following your heart, 20 years from now you don\u2019t want to look back and wish you had done it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jz1q69/i_shaved_my_head_and_now_im_struggling_with_my/gd9lopx/"}
