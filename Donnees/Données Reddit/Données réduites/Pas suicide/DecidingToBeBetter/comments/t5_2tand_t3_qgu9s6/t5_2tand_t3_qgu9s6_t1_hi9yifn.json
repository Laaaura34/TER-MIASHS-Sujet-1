This is the way. Lol. It takes some self awareness to be able to recognize the negative (and untrue) thoughts, but once you are able to pick them out, you begin to train your self to purposely change them. It's worked wonders for me.\n\nIt's funny, cus when I was 18 I was a pharmacy tech in college too. I hated myself too. I even clung to a relationship that supported these negative ideas I had on myself .\n\nAlso know you can't master this overnight. I mean, you didn't learn to hate yourself over night, like the commenter said. \n\nLearning this is a discipline at first. But it is so so worth the follow thru.\n\nI'm 32 now, and my change clicked at like 22 or 23. I dumped the verbal abuser I mentioned earlier and that was when I realized that I wasn't having anymore negative thoughts to correct, well at least not as frequent negative thoughts. Lol.  \n\nAnd it's super useful to learn how to do this for other thoughts in your head you don't like. Again I'm 32 and happier than I have ever been, but there are still times I recognize a negative thought, whether about myself personally or even a situation in life. I challenge it, then change it.\n\nLook. If I can do it, you can too. I'm no more special than you. And we are both champions. \n\nI wish you all the best in this world, as I know you deserve it!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgu9s6/how_do_i_stop_hating_and_cringing_at_myself_for/hi9yifn/"}
