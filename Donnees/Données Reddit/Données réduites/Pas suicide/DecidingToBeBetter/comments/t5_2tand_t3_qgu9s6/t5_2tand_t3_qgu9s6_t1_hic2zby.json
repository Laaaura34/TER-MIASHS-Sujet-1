Elon Musk is known to have used all his money he got from selling PayPal, in Tesla and SpaceX. \nHow are those companies looked upon today?\n\nAnything worthwhile can be constructed only with a certain amount of dedication and investment. Just ask yourself how well you have invested in you?\n\nIf you haven\u2019t, the society is giving relevant feedback and you are replaying that in your head. \n\nThe best place to start is from where you are. Decide to invest in yourself. Learn how to maximize you body, mind, emotions and energies so you can glow as a human being. You will see how much joy and happiness that brings to others and I can tell you, that day, when you look into the mirror, you will have the biggest smile. \n\nWhen you help someone with a challenge, your challenges miraculously disappear.
