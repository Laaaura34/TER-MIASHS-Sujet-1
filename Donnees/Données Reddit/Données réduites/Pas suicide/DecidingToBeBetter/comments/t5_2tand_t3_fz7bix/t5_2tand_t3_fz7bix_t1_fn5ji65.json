I had my 5 year soberversity on 12/1/19 myself. I think now I hit the 5 year hump, I've gone through some intense and interesting feelings. As you're likely aware, even this far down the line, we can have moments of vulnerability. I recently got a really weird urge to use after flicking koolaid packets to get the sugar powder to the bottom so I could cleanly open them. I didn't act on the urge but it felt weird and overwhelming and reminded me how real and how 'one day at a time' the recovery process is. Proud of you though. Your life is probably so different now than it was 5 years ago <3.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fz7bix/half_a_decade_clean_from_drugs/fn5ji65/"}
