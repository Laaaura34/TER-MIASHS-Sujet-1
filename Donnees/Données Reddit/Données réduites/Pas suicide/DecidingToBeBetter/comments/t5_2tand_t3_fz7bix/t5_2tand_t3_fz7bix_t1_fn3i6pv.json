I went to rehab across the country from the Midwest to the west coast. After that I moved to the east coast to get away from everything I had ever known to start a life on my own. It was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. To stay motivated in the beginning I definitely thought about my lowest points when I was using, as to not go back. Today, it\u2019s a lot easier to stay clean than it was back then. Still challenges, but not near as many. I\u2019m too proud of myself to slip up now. \n\nThank you for asking! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fz7bix/half_a_decade_clean_from_drugs/fn3i6pv/"}
