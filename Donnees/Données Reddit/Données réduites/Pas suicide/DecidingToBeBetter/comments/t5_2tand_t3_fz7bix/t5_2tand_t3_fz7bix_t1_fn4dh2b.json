So I get why it\u2019s so hard. I think the first year and a half I was clean, I was SUPER depressed. There\u2019s a name for all the symptoms you get after quitting drugs. Anyways they can last for up to a year typically. To combat them, I had a good group of people to surround myself with and did things that had meaning. I go on walks often. I meditate almost every day. I write in a gratitude journal almost every day. And I see a counselor. \n\nGood luck with everything!! You got this! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fz7bix/half_a_decade_clean_from_drugs/fn4dh2b/"}
