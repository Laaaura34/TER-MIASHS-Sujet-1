You are a unique an intricate person, but these themes are not. \n\nFirst, you may want to slow down. Renegotiating how you look at the world is going to take time. I had an almost identical realization about a decade ago, and am only now getting to the other side. Be patient, be kind (especially to yourself), and enjoy everything you\u2019re going to learn about life moving forward.\n\nSome tools - \nsomebody mentioned stoicism which is a fine recommendation. Ryan holiday built an empire of the back of that idea. His books are good and worth checking out.\n\nJon Kabat Zinn, Sam Harris, Dan Harris, Sharon Salzberg all have some great books on mindfulness and looking at the world. I\u2019d start with \u201cwherever you go, there you are\u201d by Jon Kabat Zinn or \u201c10% happier\u201d by Dan Harris. \n\nViktr Frankl\u2019s \u201cMan\u2019s search for meaning\u201d is a game changer. \n\n\u201cThe subtle art of not giving a f*#k\u201d by Mark Manson is a fantastic read. This might be the first book I\u2019d tell you to pick up based on your post. \n\nThe school of life YouTube channel is a fantastic place to learn about philosophy and concepts that will help you with your perspective. \n\nFind a place to physically connect with others. Volunteering is a great way to get out of your own head. \n\nPatience and self compassion.  The conscious life is just one story we tell each other after another. Patience and self compassion will help you build up your sense of self, trust in yourself, and love for yourself, which are the first tools you need to help other people. \n\nYou\u2019re already amazing, and you\u2019re going to keep becoming even more amazing.
