They *actually are* good enough. They just don't *feel* good enough. And that's a valid issue, I'm not disparaging that at all. But the reason I don't feel good enough is because I am actually not good enough. If I were successful, happy, belonging to a group of people who like me and care, had a book deal, whatever, then I would have to be good enough. But since I don't have social or creative success, it must be because my best is not good enough. Feelings are important, but I'm concerned with reality much more than my feelings right now.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dvl8ag/when_does_being_yourself_and_doing_your_best/f7e8qlc/"}
