That quote haunted me all through high school, college, and partially still doesn\u2019t. But he never knew there was more to it... \u201cA jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.\u201d\n\nBeing passionate about a number of things is a benefit, NOT a downfall. At 17 it sucks because everyone seemingly has a passion and is passing you. They\u2019re dedicating hours upon hours to be the best at something and you\u2019re just a jack of all trades. But! When your 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s start, al of those skills you\u2019ve picked up on will show themselves. Continue being a jack, learn everything you can about everything because it\u2019s ALL interesting and it\u2019s ALL important.\n\nIn the end, I\u2019ve realized I have a ton of passions and skills. I may not get a Nobel prize in a specific category, but that\u2019s not my passion. \n\nI enjoyed building computers as a kid so my first job as a customer service rep for an electronic store turned into a computer technician because I knew enough for them to train me up. I went to college for psych because I wanted explanations for behaviors I saw/experienced. I\u2019m not doing anything in that field but I use the knowledge I learned, literally everyday. I learned ASL because it looked interesting. Then I taught it part time for awhile, now I just know sign language. 2 different jobs have given me an interview because ASL stood out to them. Those jobs set me up for my current career. I attended a dog training academy because i wanted to understand more about dog behavior. Now I have the best trained dog on the block and get asked (sometimes hired) for help. \n\nI love real estate now, I guess that\u2019s kind of my passion at the moment. I\u2019m interested in creating a non-profit to help low income families get access to a variety of social services but on site at my real estate development. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this got so long. I guess I\u2019m saying there is no right way to approach life. It\u2019s a huge journey with twists that you\u2019ll never see coming. Learn as much as you can and you\u2019ll be better for it. That saying just destroyed my confidence as a teen/young adult but it didn\u2019t have to. I think you\u2019ll be okay :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ggebo8/i_cant_find_my_passion_and_im_stuck/fq0xmho/"}
