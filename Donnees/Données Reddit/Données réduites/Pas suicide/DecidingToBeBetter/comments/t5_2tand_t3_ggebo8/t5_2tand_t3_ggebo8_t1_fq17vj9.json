It is completely okay to have a variety of interests that change over time. \n\nMy major problem with the concept of a singular passion (though if that works for you, that's great) is that it relates to a fixed mindset where you have innate talent/intelligence as opposed to a growth mindset where learning and intelligence can grow with effort (see Carol Dweck). Under the fixed mindset, not being good at something you try, not knowing what your passion is, or coming up short against some expectation you have for yourself can feel like failure. Under a growth mindset, it's all an opportunity to explore and discover. \n\nYou don't need to have a singular passion or even be good at something for it to be your passion. What do want to invest your time thinking and learning about? For some context, I have a PhD and work as a research scientist in a field I am interested in, but I wouldn't call it my passion. I always felt pressured to have one and that there was something wrong with me that I didn't. Now I see that most things you delve into and work on become interesting, and for me it's about putting in the effort and taking new opportunities as they arise. I never intended to get a PhD, but I followed interesting opportunities. \n\nGood luck to you! You are great the way you are.
