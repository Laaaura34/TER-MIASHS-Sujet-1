I was a music major in college ten years ago and I wanted to be a composer but life happened and I eventually changed majors to something more \u201cpractical\u201d. My degree has led to good jobs, but I always regretted dropping music. \n\nSo I decided recently to pick it back up but I can\u2019t help but think about how far along I\u2019d be if I\u2019d stuck with it, how I wasted a literal decade, and how behind it all makes me feel. Better to do it now than later but I can\u2019t get over the guilt. \n\nMy point I guess is that while this is a helpful philosophy, it can be taken to the other extreme where you shame yourself for having not started sooner. I\u2019m more likely to practice piano if I forgive myself for my past inaction on this goal.
