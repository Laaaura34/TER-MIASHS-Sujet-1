I can read a few solid pages in a couple minutes and the chapters are short so I can get through 1 in 10min of free time.\n\n2) I also carry my journal around in my bag, so whenever I have free time I update it with any worth while experience, thought, interaction or result I have yet to update from the last entry (This is great to do, 20 years later it will be awesome to look back on, or give to your children/grandchildren)\n\n3) Through my day when I come across articles/videos I didnt have to time go through I save it on fb/my reminder app, and then use those spare 5-10 min to go through it\n\n4) As of a month ago I found a business podcast (but find one that works for your interests) and each podcast is only 5-15min long so it's perfect during breaks, or driving somewhere to make productive use of my time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/75yj63/finding_ways_to_optimize_idle_time_and_take/doet3gp/"}
