Maybe you should consider *limiting* the amount of time that you spend on netflix, the same way a person should limit the amount of time that they spend watching tv. I'm not sure about movies. If it's something you really enjoy- like a hobby- then I think you should just limit the amount of time you spend watching those too.\n\nFinding hobbies will definitely improve the way you feel- so will exercising. Going for walks (at least 10 minutes a day) will make you feel a little bit better as well. \n\nWhen it comes to stopping masturbation, the best thing to do is keep yourself busy (honestly, you'll have quite a bit more time) and avoid situations where you have the opportunity to masturbate. Hang out around family members and places where you wouldn't fap. If you're left home alone, go for a walk, find an enthralling show or movie to watch, take a cold shower, avoid your phone/computer if you have to.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/6wbe6k/how_can_i_quit_fappingwatching_pornquit/dm8x8m3/"}
