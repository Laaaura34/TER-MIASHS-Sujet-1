Getting professional help will be much better than what people on reddit can offer. \n\nSecond, you want to quit basically every form of entertainment? What would you do with your free time? I get that you want to change, but doing something this drastic won't help. It will only make things worse. \n\nAre any of those things actual problems for you? Are you on Facebook when you should be doing homework? Do you spend your entire weekend watching movies and Netflix? There's no reason to remove things from your life if they aren't a problem. \n\nYou want to be fit? Okay, start working out. Run in the morning or after school,  find sone weights or do body weight exercises to gain muscle. \n\nYou don't have to change your entire self to be fit and find happiness.
