The principles are the same in both, just some examples are different. So it doesn't really matter which one you read. The newer one (digital age) is just a marketing technique to get attention and bring an old book to life again and sell more.

Otherwise if you are a person who likes to catch up with what's newer, then pick up the digital age one. If you ask me which one I prefer, I'd go for the Digital Age one as there are more modern examples in it.
