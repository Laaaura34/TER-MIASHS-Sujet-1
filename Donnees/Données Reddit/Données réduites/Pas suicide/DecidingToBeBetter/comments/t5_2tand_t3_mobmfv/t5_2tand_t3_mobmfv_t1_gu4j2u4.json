I would then just say we've just grown apart, which technically isn't a lie, considering OP has actually grown up and wants other things in life but the friend circle doesn't reflect that.

So if OP wants to be better, then hanging around what they've always been around will hold them back.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mobmfv/is_it_appropriate_to_separate_myself_23_from/gu4j2u4/"}
