Your friend who lives in his parents basement and complains about having to do chores? Sometimes people like that genuinely don't grow up, ever. Hopefully he does, but how long do you wanna hear him out on his hard life of having to do dishes? My first boyfriend didn't move out of home until a month before his 30th, i was 21 and living 600km+ away from family, and the only reason he did move out was because I said I wasn't going to date someone who actually made it to 30 without ever even attempting to live out on their own. Sometimes you have to go back and that's fine, but that's not what he was doing. He didn't have to cook or clean, pay any real bills, got to video game until all hours of the morning (looking back i can't understand why I thought he was so great). So he lived with me for a year, and when we broke up, guess where he went back to, and stayed? Dude is now approaching 40, and still lives with family. His mum is dead, and he has no fucking idea how to live outside of home. That is the reality of people like that. I felt bad for leaving him behind but if someone doesn't want to grow up, they won't and it will eventually become a burden.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mobmfv/is_it_appropriate_to_separate_myself_23_from/gu4jzmt/"}
