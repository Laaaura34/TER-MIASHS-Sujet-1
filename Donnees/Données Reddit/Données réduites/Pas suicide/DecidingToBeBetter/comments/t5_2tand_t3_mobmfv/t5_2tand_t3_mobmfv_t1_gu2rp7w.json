Does it affect you in any way? It sounds like their lack of development triggers you for some reason. Maybe you should ask yourself why?\n\nI have a friend who has a serious weed smoking addiction, suffer from depression and doesn't have the confidence to get a better job than his minimum wage one. Despite the fact that he has an education and a natural creative talent. All the while me and many others from our friend group are developing and changing around him.\n\nWe can still hang out and have fun together despite our differences though. If you are really confident about your own development, then it shouldn't matter whether they develop or not. \n\nAgain I'm just trying to play devils advocate here, but unless they are toxic people who make you feel miserable when you spend time together I don't see why it should matter to you whether they develop or not.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mobmfv/is_it_appropriate_to_separate_myself_23_from/gu2rp7w/"}
