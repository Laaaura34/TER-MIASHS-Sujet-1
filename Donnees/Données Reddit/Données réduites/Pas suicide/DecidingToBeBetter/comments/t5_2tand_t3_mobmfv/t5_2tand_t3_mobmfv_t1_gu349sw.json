Or spend only a little less time with them.\n\nBut honestly you sound like you don't enjoy the time with them anymore. so maybe slowly reduce it without making a fuzz?\n\nAnyway in cases like this I usually try to see all my options and start a \"scenario simulation\" in my head. I try to imagine what the others will do/say and how I will feel in the process and when it is over.\nThat always helps to make a decision (at least for me).", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mobmfv/is_it_appropriate_to_separate_myself_23_from/gu349sw/"}
