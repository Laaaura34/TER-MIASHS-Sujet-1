I've done training at my work place and can tell you, I much prefer the positive, outgoing, energetic type. It rubs off on those around them. (Some find it irritating but perhaps they are the ones that need to change)\n\nIf you wanna be better and set goals, why spend time with people who wont encourage that? If it brings you down instead of builds you up, it's not worth it. \n\nI've had maybe 3 good friends in my entire life. Life has split our paths but each one was a very positive, encouraging, caring relationship. They challenged me, made sure I was okay, and was there to listen. These people help you grow.\n\nSo I'd say it would probably be better to find a new group of friends. People like that drive me crazy. If your not gonna get out and do something, then you cant sit there and complain. Either meet with them sparingly or just kindly end it. You dont need draining people in your life.
