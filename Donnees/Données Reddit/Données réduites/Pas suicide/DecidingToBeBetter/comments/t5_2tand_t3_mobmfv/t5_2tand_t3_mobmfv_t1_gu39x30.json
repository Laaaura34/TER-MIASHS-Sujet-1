Being a right idiot with his time, money, and opportunities. Drank too much, played too many games, the usual. We're 29 now, he picked up engineering and is _shockingly_ good at it; went to uni late, but is now working at a job making plane engines. Point is, your friends shouldn't be leaning on you for anything you're not capable of dealing with, and if you have no respect or friendly feelings towards them anymore then by all means cut them loose, or distance yourself as much as you feel is necessary. But I'm glad i didn't let my friend go - he returned the favour of my never giving up on him 100 times over.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mobmfv/is_it_appropriate_to_separate_myself_23_from/gu39x30/"}
