I honestly only viewed one post as a criticism. And I did not feel that I needed to change their views. I have rarely been criticized straight to my face so I am currently just finding out how I should respond to criticisms. And from what I've gathered, I should respond to al the criticisms. Thank you for pointing it out.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1gf760/"}
