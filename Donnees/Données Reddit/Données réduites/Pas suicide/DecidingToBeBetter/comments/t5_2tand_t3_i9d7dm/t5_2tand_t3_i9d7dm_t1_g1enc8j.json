A lot of the time they just want to be heard, and to know that you are listening. \n\nI think it\u2019s also important to note that Emotional Intelligence is a thing. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re working towards developing that, but it is different than what people consider intelligence. I guess it\u2019s the difference between \u201csmart\u201d and \u201cwise.\u201d\n\nLastly, you can be unintelligent and manipulative. There are plenty of those people. And you can be intelligent and empathetic. Not necessarily saying that manipulation and empathy are opposite, but I\u2019m lacking a better wording.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1enc8j/"}
