I\u2019m an engineer by trade but I\u2019ve been in marriage therapy weekly for about two years now. I think you could use mindfulness and philosophy. I really like learning about Stoicism because it helps you prevent causing yourself mental suffering, such as anger. It teaches you what is in your control (your thoughts/reactions) and what isn\u2019t (everything else). Being angry isn\u2019t productive, and many more emotions we feel make situations worse. It will teach you that everything is natural, we\u2019re all connected, and to love everything that happens to you. Pair that with mindfulness, being aware of what you\u2019re actually thinking at all times. What your heart rate is, what your tone of voice is, etc. and you can communicate calmly through any situation. Much easier said than done, but this would be a good place to start IMHO. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1ftp7a/"}
