I managed to get a therapist for \u00a35 a session at one point when I desperately needed it. \n\nThere are also apps available that act as essentially free online support groups, which you might find useful. If one of your problems is an inability to sit with difficult emotions, I've found the Insight Timer app really helpful- it has a huge range of meditations available, with a lot of different practitioners so you can find the one/s you want.\n\nThe fact that you have the self awareness to admit your problem and accept that you need to change is a massive first step. I wish you all the best in working to improve.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1feqgx/"}
