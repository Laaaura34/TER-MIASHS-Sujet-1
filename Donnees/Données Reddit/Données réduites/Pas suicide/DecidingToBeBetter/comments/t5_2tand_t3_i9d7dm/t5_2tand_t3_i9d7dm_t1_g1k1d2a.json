He is as much a part of who you are today as the other persona is - the one you've constructed to protect him :) plus he's just a little kid. I'm sure even you wouldn't walk up to a child and bully or harass them, or call them names, or tell them they're a loser.

Maybe take his hand and give him a hug instead :) Metaphorically of course.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1k1d2a/"}
