It\u2019s called The Way of the Superior Man. I also exhibit these traits and the book has a good segment in being able to acknowledge feminine feelings and how they compare to a man\u2019s way of thinking. I think acknowledging your problem means you\u2019re not a bad guy, you just don\u2019t understand what it is you\u2019re doing wrong. The audio book is on YouTube, and Id say it\u2019s worth a listen", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1f4fnq/"}
