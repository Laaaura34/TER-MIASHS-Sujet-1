A lot of the other comments have decent resources etc.\n\nEmotions can be good, and can be bad. Something you've said in the comments is thinking that emotions are a form of weakness, yet in the original post you've said you would lose your temper. Anger is an emotion, and it's a much more dangerous one than the others to be losing control of. \n\nPerhaps a way to start tackling things is to balance out your emotional control a little more - the first step is always to recognise a problem happens, the second is to recognise it as it is happening, the third is to learn to slow it down as it happens or damage limitation, the fourth is to stop it earlier, the fifth is to stop it from getting out of control in the first place. That sort of thing takes years - my own experience with tackling depression/ anxiety has been a long road, but I doubt anger is any different really.\n\nI came from a household where anger wasn't acceptable so I became fairly good at repressing it, but sadness was. Perhaps because I'm a girl - unconscious sexism really is a thing. But anyway, I digress. It is possible to undo the things we've been taught, and learn to process things differently. But it will take time.\n\nI am concerned about your wife and your marriage tbh. Perhaps it's not too late to save, but it could be. You need to be selfless here, and really try to change, not for a day or a week, but for years. Not just on the version of you on the outside, but truly change how you think on the inside. Maybe just maybe, you can do it. At the very least, it's worth a try.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1f6ubp/"}
