I was just out of any leads on how I could find out what was wrong.\n\nI am not accusing her or being emotional, she no longer wanted to talk to me because (after finally talking to her earlier today I found out that ) she thought that talking to me would only lead to me losing my temper, which fortunately after reading some pieces of advice here, notably from someone who just said to listen, helped by having her tell me what was driving her mad.\n\nI know she is the victim, thats why I am trying to ask for help on how to solve my being an abuser.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1gmemv/"}
