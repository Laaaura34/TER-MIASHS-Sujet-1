You mentioned you tend to deal more in reason than emotions and have valued manipulation highly. I'd like to offer a different way of thinking rooted in reason.\n\nManipulation is at best a good short term strategy. You can get something out of someone for now, but people realize when they've been manipulated. They'll tolerate it for a while, but they'll stop playing with you once it's happened too many times or with too extreme cases. You've probably in the past had to sort of \"cash in\" on your reputation or history to squeeze a behavior out of someone who didn't want to follow your lead.\n\nThe alternative to manipulation is not to be manipulated. It's cooperation. And through cooperation you can form bonds that make you more powerful than manipulation alone. When you've proven you're one of the ones who works with people rather than against them, you no longer have to trick people into a certain behavior. You can just ask them. But even further, you'll find that people will be more likely to actually volunteer to help things you didn't even ask for.\n\nMaybe it takes some smarts to employ manipulation to your advantage, but the real big brain play is to build a team on your side with genuine cooperation.\n\nHope that helps dink your mindset towards the right direction. Working on making your bonds more genuine is the next step to building real, healthy relationships and finding true happiness (the answer is not getting what you want)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1fzx9k/"}
