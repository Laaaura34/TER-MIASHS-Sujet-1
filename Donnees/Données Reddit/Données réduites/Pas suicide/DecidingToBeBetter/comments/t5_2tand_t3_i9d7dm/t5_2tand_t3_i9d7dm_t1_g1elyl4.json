Im guessing you\u2019re under-insured or not insured, as therapy is usually covered (I think??) so assuming you would have to pay out of pocket, try to see it as an investment. If you were physically sick, you\u2019d try not to skimp on doctor visits, right? As others have said, take a look at the online options and maybe see if you can put together a budget for it. I\u2019m not saying that you can\u2019t do this without therapy, but the professional guidance can be so worth it in the long run.  \n\nNo matter what - good on you for recognizing your behavior. It\u2019ll take work but you can uncover the better you. You got this!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1elyl4/"}
