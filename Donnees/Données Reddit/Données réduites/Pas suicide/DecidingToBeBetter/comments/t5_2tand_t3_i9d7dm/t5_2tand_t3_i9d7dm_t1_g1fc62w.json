I\u2019ve recently had to start to come to term with myself, also. It\u2019s a big blow when you realize the \u201cnormal\u201d behaviors you thought you exhibited are not emotionally healthy, but the very first step is admitting you have a problem. \n\nI pushed away therapy for far too long thinking it\u2019s too expensive and I couldn\u2019t afford it. After my husband and I\u2019s last big fight, I researched \u201csliding scale\u201d therapy and found one in my town that offers their services for completely free if you\u2019re on unemployment, or any type of state assistance, really. They also told me that any therapist worth their salt wouldn\u2019t turn away a client who wants and needs help over something as trivial as money. I am in the US, so I can\u2019t speak exactly to your area, but honestly, it\u2019s worth a shot.\n\nEdit: we also signed up for an app called \u201cLasting,\u201d from the Gottman institute. We use it alongside our individual therapies to help us get back on the level we need to be together. It\u2019s not free, but again, totally worth it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1fc62w/"}
