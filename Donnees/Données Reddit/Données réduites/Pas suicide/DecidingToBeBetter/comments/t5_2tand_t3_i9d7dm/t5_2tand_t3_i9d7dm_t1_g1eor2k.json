She rarely cries to me as I tend to close up emotionally only to present choices/solutions. \n\n>I tend to lose my temper when I feel that I am baited to engage emotionally as I have a hard time dealing with emotions other than anger.\n\nI don't care if you need to cancel your internet, sell your TV, live off rice and beans for a while, but DO SOMETHING TO GET YOUR ABUSED WIFE HELP!\n\nYou don't allow her to act like a full human being without losing your temper. That's just extreme when it comes to emotional abuse. \n\nThe most important thing right now is to give HER a place where she feels safe. \n\nAll these comments praising you and suggesting what you can do to change are missing that there's an abused victim and, right now, she should take precedent. You definitely need to change, but the urgent question now is if she can even be safe with you. \n\nNo amount of good intentions matter while she is still in an abusive relationship.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1eor2k/"}
