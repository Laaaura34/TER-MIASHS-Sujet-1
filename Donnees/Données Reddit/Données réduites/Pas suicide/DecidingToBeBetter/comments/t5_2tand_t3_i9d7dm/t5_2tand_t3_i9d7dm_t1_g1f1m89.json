If any of this doesn\u2019t land or apply to you, throw it out. But if something juuuust might, look into it. It\u2019s through the hardest things that we learn. \n\nYou are okay. I accept you as you are, and encourage you to accept yourself as you are. That is the first step. Radical Acceptance is an amazing book, with exercises, on becoming more intimate with your emotions. Or Brene Brown if you don\u2019t want the Buddhism. \n\nFinally, take small steps. The most effective thing I\u2019ve learned EVER, with lots of widespread accclaim and success is this: do one small thing for your healing daily. Just pick one tiny thing you can\u2019t fail at. For me it was 1 minute of meditation a day. I still do that, two years later and usually more like 20 now. \n\nYou can do it. It\u2019s not easy. But it\u2019s worth it.\n\nBest of luck to you.\n\nEdit: added a little more because it\u2019s important.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1f1m89/"}
