She was trying to kill someone you loved, herself. So you did your best to stop her.\n\nIn these cases it is best in my opinion to be totally honest rather than try to manipulate or intervene in their life other than asserting your own boundaries: that you won\u2019t tolerate them hurting you. You can\u2019t change someone, and trying to do so is a nasty trap. Leads to always hoping for change that never comes, feeling drained, and codependency. Often times you just have to part ways, let them learn the lesson the only way they can: for themselves. This *is* loving them for who they are, and doing what is best for them a lot of times. In the case of suicide or hurting others, however, I think it\u2019s okay to intervene.\n\nThese are rare cases and require lots of judgement. This is not the same as OP\u2019s case, and OP is at a different place than you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1gu8m4/"}
