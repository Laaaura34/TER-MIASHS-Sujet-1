It might be a cheaper option. It\u2019s usually recommend that those who are abusive (physically and/or mentally) should get therapy to get to the root cause of their needs.  It\u2019s hard to give advice on how to help when we don\u2019t know the relationship dynamic or how you respond to certain situations. \n\nNonetheless; I found that people who I knew were emotionally abusive also had narcissistic tendencies. Look up articles to see if you resonate with those personality traits them look into self help books discussing that to gain more info/tools to use.\n\nMight also help to start becoming more aware of your emotions. What happened/what was said that started you to become \u201cemotionally abusive\u201d to your wife? Start writing those situations down and try to notice a pattern. It could gain you insight. \n\nIt\u2019s not much advice and you won\u2019t change overnight. It\u2019s going to take a lot of work but do this as a favor for YOURSELF and your wife.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1eifi5/"}
