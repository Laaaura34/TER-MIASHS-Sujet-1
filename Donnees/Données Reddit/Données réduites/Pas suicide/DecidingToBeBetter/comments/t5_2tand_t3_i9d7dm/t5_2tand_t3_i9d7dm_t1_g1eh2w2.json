Talk to your wife, and explain to her that what she confided to you really hit home and tell her how you feel, for real. How you used to think is not how you are thinking now.\n\nAsk her if you could do one thing differently, what could you do to make her feel a little more special (daily!) you will feel uncomfortable. This is normal. Reminding yourself that being emotionally in tune or being in complete control of everything does not make you weak. Let her have a win.\n\nDo not turn any of it around or put up walls when she gets emotional or when you feel you are being cornered. She is just trying to get close to you - the real you. Let her in a little.\n\nShow her affection. She needs and deserves it.\nYour kids too. You aren\u2019t really changing who you are. You have some powerful values inside, its just that the behaviours don\u2019t match.\n\nYou could try brainstorming things that would make your wife and children feel valued, loved and safe too. \n\nIt\u2019s okay and healthy to let your guard down now. She loves you and clearly you love her. We are all works in progress. \n\nGood luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1eh2w2/"}
