If she needs to be away from you for a time, do what you can do support that. If she deems the abuse makes the relationship irredeemable, respect that. If a decision is made to work on the relationship, center the healing on your wife's needs. Emotional abuse means she hasn't been safe to authentically and fully be herself. Prioritise that.\n\nYou ARE going to need to talk to people and have a space to get support (someone recommended a men's group) for your own self-improvement because real change will require you to be vulnerable and it's not easy. But make sure you get support from places and people other than your wife. Don't make your wife take on emotional labour for you. And don't make the situation to be all about you.\n\nI would like you to know that committing to improving yourself is worth it. Learn to meet yourself where you're at and see all the things about yourself that make you uncomfortable and accept them. A new understanding of the world opens up. Learning to have unconditional self-acceptance (that doesn't rely on feeling superior to other people, for example) helps you to accept others without needing them to be certain way.
