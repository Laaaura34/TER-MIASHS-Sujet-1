It\u2019s sickening and heart wrenching to think about. I\u2019m happy that you discovered your issue before you destroyed any relationships you have. \n\nI don\u2019t have much life experience and I have even less experience with overcoming my own narcissistic tendencies, but I can say this: figuring out that you have a problem is the worst feeling in the world, but the best thing to ever happen to you. Not only am no longer hurting anyone around me, but I am genuinely happier in myself. I still feel awful for what I\u2019ve done and the relationship I destroyed, but I know the future will be better, and yours will too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1eo4qx/"}
