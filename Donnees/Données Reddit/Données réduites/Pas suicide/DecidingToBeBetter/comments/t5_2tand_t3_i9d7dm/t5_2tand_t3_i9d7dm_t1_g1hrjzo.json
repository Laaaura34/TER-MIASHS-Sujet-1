Like, it's easier to stay sober when we are happy and harder when we're under stress. Also, you could probably make an argument that maybe him not being manipulative during engagement was actually still manipulative bc he thought acting manipulatively would get in the way of them getting married or something. \n\nMy point being: humans are complicated.  I'm not trying to convince you that he's genuine, just that we\n can't really speak with certainty about the true intentions and motives of a stranger on the internet from reading a single post and I'm not sure that making pretty strong judgements like this is particularly helpful.\n\n I'm not saying this dude for sure wants to change for all the right reasons, or that it isn't coming from a narcissistic place, just that there's legitimately a chance he does and saying he doesn't want to stop being manipulative *because* he's still manipulative doesn't make sense to me. You're free to disagree and go with your gut on this one though!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1hrjzo/"}
