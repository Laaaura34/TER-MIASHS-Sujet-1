Rosenberg. I think this book may be useful to you. It is a book about the fact that the way many of us communicate with others is detrimental (termed \"violent\" by the author) and helps people understand better ways of communicating with others.\n\nI am not yet finished reading the book, but so far it has been very enlightening. I think the book can benefit everyone, but especially those who have issues communicating with other people. It deals with the importance of empathy, dealing with feelings, and other aspects of emotions and communication. I think it may provide some help to you.\n\n[The book is $11 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Nonviolent-Communication-Language-Life-Changing-Relationships/dp/189200528X/) if you're interested. Best of luck to you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1fr2u0/"}
