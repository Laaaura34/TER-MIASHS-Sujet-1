I know this is very delicate subject matter but in a way it's almost like saying \"we'll take your word for all the negative things you've admitted about yourself but we don't think you're a genuine person\".\n\nMy personal opinion is change is capable in all people of intelligence with the right slap in the face. You may also have trauma that you don't realise from growing up in a manipulative environment. Overwhelming guilt/shame and skewed/biased opinions and memories of yourself can be a symptom of depressive disorders.\n\nWithout knowing further details, I would say instead of thinking of yourself as being 100% responsible for your wife's emotional situation, think of it instead as something more like 80%. Narcissistic traits exist in all people to some extent but self-awareness, which not all people are capable of, is a strong first step (of many) in overcoming them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1gktq6/"}
