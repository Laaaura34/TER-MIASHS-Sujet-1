I do think the first thing you should do is talk to your wife. Keep in mind that you haven't lost your manipulative tendencies yet, and you should try to control them.\n\nAt the most basic level, manipulation is getting the other person to think and feel the way you want them to think and feel. The next time you say \\*anything\\* to her, consider all of these things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* What is my emotional state?\n* What is her emotional state?\n* What do I want to convey to her?\n* How do I convey this to her without coloring my words?\n* Am I unconsciously using a specific tone of voice and language to negatively impact her emotional state?\n* If she does have negative feelings; is this because of me, or is it because of the overall situation?\n\nIt's admirable that you're trying to improve yourself. Overall, you should be aiming for open, honest communication. That's the end goal. Communication where your wife knows how you feel, and you know how your wife feels. With both of you working as a team to raise a good human being in a cruel world.\n\nDo nice things for her. Go on a nice, quiet, peaceful date at least every two weeks. Not for the sake of getting favors or to make her appreciate you, but just to see the joy on her face. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck, mate. Never stop trying to improve yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1f6psi/"}
