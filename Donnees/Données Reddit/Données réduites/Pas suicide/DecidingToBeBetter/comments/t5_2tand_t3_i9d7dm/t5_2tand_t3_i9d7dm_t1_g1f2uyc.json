You never learned to cope and deal with feelings and emotionally regulate like an adult- so it\u2019s only natural that it feels childish. That\u2019s where you are stuck in your development. Now that you are at a crossroads where you can keep ignoring this problem and let it compound and it will get and worse or you can take the better harder road where you really put the work in become introspective and learn to not only identify and sit with negative and uncomfortable emotions but how to cope with them in psychologically healthy ways. Just remember the actions that got you to this point are NOT going to be the ones to get you out of this situation. Try new words, new behaviors and develop DIFFERENT ways of coping and reacting to things.    \nGood Luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1f2uyc/"}
