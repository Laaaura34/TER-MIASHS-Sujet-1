I can see in my own family  how easily unhealthy, manipulative and controlling ways of communicating can be passed down, and I know what it is to be severely manipulated and abused. I\u2019m still recovering. It\u2019s so good to see to that people are actually taking  steps to examine their abusive behavior and work on changing it. That is how we heal as a society, that is how we end abuse. When therapy is not an option, books ( vetted, credible ones) can be really helpful for sparking introspection and change. It will be a long process, and it should be. Listen to survivors, especially when you think what they have to say is silly.  Find out what emotional states or situations trigger your urges to use abusive behavior to get what you want or think you need. Examine what you are afraid of or angry about when you feel an urge to manilpulate. Let everyone around do what they need to do to feel and be safe, even if it feels bad or means you don\u2019t get to know them anymore. Respect boundaries. Know that you can get to a place where you do not feel the need to say and do abusive things in order to feel calm/secure/intelligent. Learn the difference between healthy guilt (i did something wrong) and shame (an overwhelming feeling that can take over and lead to even more unhealthy behavior). Understanding and empathy and genuine connection > control of a situation.  Keep going.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1i4hhq/"}
