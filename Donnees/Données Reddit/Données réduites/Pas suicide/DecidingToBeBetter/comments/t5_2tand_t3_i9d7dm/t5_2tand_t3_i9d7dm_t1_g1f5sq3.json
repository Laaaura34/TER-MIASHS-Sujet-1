Manipulation  is all about tricking the opposite side.\n\nIt is really hard not to go that path when you're used to, and there will be times where you'll do it again, trust me.\n\nBut try to analyze how you manage to manipulate, and tell your tactics to your wife. She will be able to handle it and to help to stop you, or at least she will not fall for it\n\nAlso this is not about emotional intelligence. \nThis is about being a decent human being. I saw comment blaming you for feeling bad for yourself instead of your wife.\n\nIf you don't have any empathy, it is not really your fault. But the way you act is your fault. You don't need empathy to want to be a better person. It doesn't matter what is your drive, only the result matters.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1f5sq3/"}
