It sounds like you need to untangle feeling emotional (a perfectly natural and unavoidable human action) with weakness. I would start by just looking at how you talk about emotions:\n\nIs your wife having an \u201cepisode,\u201d or is she opening up and trusting you with her emotions? Are you being \u201cbaited to engage emotionally\u201d or are you being treated like a healthy support system? \n\nInterrogate your own feelings about feelings. Write down as much as you can. It\u2019s going to be painful, being vulnerable always is, but do your best to actually go towards your emotions instead of shutting them out. \n\nLastly, let your wife know you\u2019ve started this journey. It\u2019ll be a tough conversation, but she could help keep you accountable and she needs to know that you\u2019re trying to get better. Opening up to her about everything that you feel about this and this process would be a good next step. She might have ideas to help you too, especially given that she knows your situation better than anyone on reddit.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9d7dm/i_recently_found_out_that_i_am_an_emotional/g1ei4x9/"}
