Unless they are very simple-minded, without any doubt or ability to reflect on own performance. Waiting for others to change and accomodate you is impossible task, but you can work with your own mindset. Trust yourself and listen to your actual feelings and \"feedback\" your mind&body are trying to give you and start from there. If someone is being patronizing, and it feels awful then calm yourself by thinking that whatever they say cannot determine your value as a person.\n\n If you feel that you are doing your best then trust your own feeling. You can even say it aloud to them if they seem to try and push too much, stand your ground and protect yourself. Establish a filter between yourself and other people's comments, run everything though that filter. You are perfectly fit to decide whether they are right about you, and if you feel it is not right then trust that also.\n\nAlso, reinforce positive habits such as get enough sleep and lower your stress. Remember that this is only a small part of your life, it will get better someday.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3zv0a2/i_look_into_the_mirror_and_smile_tell_myself_its/cypklo3/"}
