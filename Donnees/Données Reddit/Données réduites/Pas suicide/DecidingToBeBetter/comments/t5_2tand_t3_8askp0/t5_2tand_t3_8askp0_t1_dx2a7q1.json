I ate an entire white-chocolate panda (from Easter) and I felt so disgusted and nauseous afterwards! So I decided to go outside with my dog, play with her and have three giants hibiscus tea. I read a nice magazine and I felt really good! I completely forgot about my binge that happened an hour before.\nSo the distraction is the best thing to do!
