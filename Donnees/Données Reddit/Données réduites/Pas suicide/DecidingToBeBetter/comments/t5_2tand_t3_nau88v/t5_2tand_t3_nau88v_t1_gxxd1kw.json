Try to be present for every moment of your life. The point is not to always be present but to be able to bring your mind back when it starts drifting. When I notice I got distracted I try to focus on my breathing, and let go of the invasive thought... but also don\u2019t overdo it at first, it\u2019s pretty exhausting at the beginning, so it\u2019s easy to start disliking it or just semi-consciously give up on it. Good luck!!! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nau88v/habit_change_seeking_tips/gxxd1kw/"}
