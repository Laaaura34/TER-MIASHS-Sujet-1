The therapist was super supportive and concerned when I voiced my worries. Through the process and after multiple sessions, I was able to do that to myself. It\u2019s been transformational and I applaud you for taking this first step. Life is about to get so much better for you :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i72bnk/i_started_the_journey_towards_therapy/g0zdysc/"}
