Not condemning, merely finding an interesting observation.\n\nSo it seems like your ultimate conclusion is that to be truly happy (as defined in the original post) you must be selfless, or take selfless actions. This is a sufficient philosophical explanation. Thank you\n\nThank being said, I still don't find it sufficient in terms of accuracy. There are plenty of times when my being selfless has not resulted in happiness. For example, I volunteered 300 hours at a children's museum in about a year and a halfs time. And I was not truly happy. But you could say that that was not true selflessness because there was a reason behind it, a reason I was volunteering. Ok, fair enough.\n\nTake a more simple example. I recently let someone skip ahead of me in line at the grocery store because I noticed they had less things than me. There was no motivation except to help this person out; a true act of selflessness. And yet during and after the incident I was not truly happy.\n\nI am not saying that being selfless does not equal happiness. I'm sure there are many people that find the genuine happiness I'm describing by being selfless. What I'm saying is that it does not hold true all of the time which thus makes it an insufficient definition in mind.\n\nWhat's your take? I'm interested to see how you respond. Thanks so much, this is quite fun", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/axu7dl/help_question_what_is_happiness/ehwdean/"}
