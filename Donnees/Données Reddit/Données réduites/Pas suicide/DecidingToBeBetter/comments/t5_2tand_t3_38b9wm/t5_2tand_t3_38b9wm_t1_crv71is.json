The idea that personality is a bunch of continuous traits is simply something that should be obvious to you if you've met more than 6 people. I keep going back to the year, is this 1950?? Who honestly beleives in the idea that personality is binary? It's just absurd. It's like saying \"well the popular notion is black people should sit at the back of the bus, all the psychiatrists say that they are fundementally different from white people, so it's cool.\"\n\n If a physicist tells me I'm wrong about the mass of an electron, I'll probably take his word for it because I don't have the tools necessary to measure the mass of an electron. If a psychiatrist tells me something that I've SEEN and EXPERIENCED is wrong, I'm not going to beleive them. Psychiatry and actual science are pretty far apart from each other. One is COMPLETELY subjective, while the other is kind of subjective. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/38b9wm/what_can_psychopaths_teach_us_about_success_we/crv71is/"}
