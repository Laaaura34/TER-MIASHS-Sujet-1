Obviously there\u2019s is a lot of good and joy interwoven into it but what he said really struck a chord with me. \n\nDude it\u2019s so sick that you\u2019re making this commitment I yourself and honestly it puts you so far ahead already. \n\nI have and am struggling in a similar way and what\u2019s been helpful to me is intention and but also not fighting unproductively. I feel that I\u2019ve misinterpreted a lot of my emotion just because I didn\u2019t want to admit I was going through it. Not fighting what I\u2019m feeling but working with it has totally changed my perspective.\n\nI feel like this is a little all over the place but I just like to remember when the less good times come take a breath and flow till it\u2019s over (because it will be over).\nGood luck duder!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g0pikm/i_21f_have_been_depressed_for_most_of_my/fnbbsyj/"}
