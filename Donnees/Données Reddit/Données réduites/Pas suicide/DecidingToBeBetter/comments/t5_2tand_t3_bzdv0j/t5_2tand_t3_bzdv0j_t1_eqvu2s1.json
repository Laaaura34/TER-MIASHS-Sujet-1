To be honest, I was terrified of commenting because I was worried I'd do more harm rather than good. But I was more concerned that this post would get buried by all the other things on here and OP would go unheard. The thought of someone struggling alone really bothered me so I figured I'd try anyway. \n\nThank you for taking the time to comment. Words cannot express how your words have made me feel. Thank you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bzdv0j/help_my_overall_productivity_and_mental_health/eqvu2s1/"}
