What we have influence over and what we do not. A flight is delayed because of weather\u2014no amount of yelling at an airline representative will end a storm. No amount of wishing will make you taller or shorter or born in a different country. No matter how hard you try, you can\u2019t make someone like you. And on top of that, time spent hurling yourself at these immovable objects is time not spent on the things we can change.\n\nThe recovery community practices something called the Serenity Prayer: \u201cGod, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.\u201d Addicts cannot change the abuse suffered in childhood. They cannot undo the choices they have made or the hurt they have caused. But they can change the future\u2014through the power they have in the present moment. As Epictetus said, they can control the choices they make right now.\n\nThe same is true for us today. If we can focus on making clear what parts of our day are within our control and what parts are not, we will not only be happier, we will have a distinct advantage over other people who fail to realize they are fighting an unwinnable battle.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bzdv0j/help_my_overall_productivity_and_mental_health/eqszfj8/"}
