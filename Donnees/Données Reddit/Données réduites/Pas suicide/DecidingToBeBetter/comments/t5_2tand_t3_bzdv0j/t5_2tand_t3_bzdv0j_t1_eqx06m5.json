I've often pondered the same thing and I've recently come up with a theory; good people are humble. Good people contribute without thought of recognition or reward. Many charitable donations are from people who wish to remain anonymous. Or, if a person does take recognition for their good deed, they usually pass it off as not a big deal or that it's only natural and anyone else would do the same thing. It's comforting to think that good things are happening all around us without our knowledge because being good is just human nature. \n\nI made the mistake of watching Restoring Faith in Humanity videos during my lunch break and now I'm an emotional wreck. If they have enough footage to make multiple videos on this topic, imagine how many things are going on without our knowledge.
