I think it's better to change the lense you see problems through rather than denying them completely. OP can be the next big climate scientist when they grow up. These problems are real, and we need people committed to solving them. OP just needs to learn to frame things in a more resilient way, with less doom and gloom.\n\nI personally felt the same way about cancer. I felt sick that probably 1/3 of us are going to die of cancer at some point. There's no defitive cure. It took a classmate of mine too. And man, everything can cause cancer. It really bummed me out--but that fixation wasn't healthy. Now, one option is that you can stop consuming research papers, but I grew up with a more problem solving attitude. I'm hoping to become a cancer researcher with an MD PhD.\n\nWe all will die whether it be from cancer or climate change or whatever--but instead of being afraid, let's get curious. What can we do? What are the career choices? What are solutions? Is there a chance we'll fail? Sure. I became comfortable with that. But my life's purpose is to try anyways and be grateful for the ride.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bzdv0j/help_my_overall_productivity_and_mental_health/eqt19b3/"}
