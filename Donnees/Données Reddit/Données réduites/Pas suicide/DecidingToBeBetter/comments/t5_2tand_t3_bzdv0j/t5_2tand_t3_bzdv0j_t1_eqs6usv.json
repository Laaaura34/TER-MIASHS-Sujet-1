Particularly this part:\n\n>It's impossible to feel sad when you're truly grateful. Feel gratitude for the birds chirping outside your window and how they signify spring and new beginnings. Send blessings to the hands that picked the beans, molded the cup, and built the water treatement plant so that you could enjoy that cup of coffee.\n\nThis exemplifies a state of mind that was once very important to me, and you have made me reflect on how it has been lost. It can be rekindled though, I know it. I have a feeling I will be returning to and re-reading your comment. It's very reassuring, and excellent food for thought right now. Thank you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bzdv0j/help_my_overall_productivity_and_mental_health/eqs6usv/"}
