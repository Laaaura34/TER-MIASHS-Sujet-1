Part of it is finding charities that do work I believe in, part of it is learning what sort of things actually need to change for us to attain a better society, and part of it is actively taking part. For me, since I am disabled, I can't go out to help at a charity or NGO, but I can check in with the people around me, help them where I can and give them the mental support they need to go out influence the world in a good way.
