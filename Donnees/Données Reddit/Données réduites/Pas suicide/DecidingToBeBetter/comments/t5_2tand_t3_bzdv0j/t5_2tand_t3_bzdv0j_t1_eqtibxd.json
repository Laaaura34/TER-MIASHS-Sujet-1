An online group I am in was having a discussion around mental health. I'm not receiving treatment for any mental health concerns, nor did I feel I was in need of any, but I read along in interest. Someone mentioned that they had recently got back into treatment for anxiety once they realised that their current feelings about climate change was actually rooted in anxiety, as it manages to make you feel like its a completely legitimate fear. I experience mild anxiety symptoms around two things: climate change and driving. One is probably the biggest danger facing our world in my lifetime and the other is the most dangerous thing I do on an average day. I had thought of anxiety as being about ridiculous things- like documentaries I had seen of grown men who only ever ate chicken nuggets gagging at the thought of merely holding a piece of asparagus. My anxiety felt completely justified, if not outright sensible. I had never really considered it 'anxiety' - an exaggerated feeling to the point of being irrational. Once I thought of it in that way I found it easier to dismiss. The future of the world is not reliant on me reading all the doomsday articles and freaking out. I will make sensible choices and try to get the right people voted in, the rest of the time I will avoid news that triggers me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bzdv0j/help_my_overall_productivity_and_mental_health/eqtibxd/"}
