I stay of social media now because a lot of that negativity is bred from there. Since getting off I\u2019ve realised how outside of that, people are much more normal human beings and I myself am less burdened by this strange societal negativity. Also you\u2019ve got to remember what fills and entertains our minds is the exciting and extreme. War over water sounds like this crazy dystopian future, that yes may now be a possibility, but will more then likely never happen. So much of what we hear now is statistics spun to look completely terrible so we click on it and fuel ad revenue. It gets spread and here we are. \n\nYou\u2019ve also got to remember that the vast vast majority of people want the best for their life and this world. Europe is now prioritising global warming as the number 1 international threat (I\u2019m pretty sure Britain has just declared it an international emergency). There are solutions to all these problems and people in power (especially recently) are realising these things aren\u2019t just going to get swept under the rug. And if they\u2019re not fixed there will be no more power for them to have. \n\nFocus on yourself, if you have creative or work outlets you can sink yourself into do that. If you think you really want to have an impact on these issues look into how you can. Often times when I feel the world is bleak it\u2019s because I myself am unhappy and am unable to see past the negativity. Enjoy your life and don\u2019t put importance in what just anyone says, they don\u2019t know.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bzdv0j/help_my_overall_productivity_and_mental_health/eqsvpjw/"}
