Instead I would offer this perspective:\n\n  \n\n\nYou are what you eat\n\n  \n\n\nEasy to understand with food, harder to understand with information... but your thoughts are very centered around the things you pay attention to. So... pay attention to different things.\n\nIf the environment is your deal, focus on what you can do locally. Trash tag is a good start. Figuring out if there are any wins to be had with local polluters or parks. Pay attention to those things, and *explicitly do not* pay attention to national things. You might be the example we all need to bring change elsewhere. Let the guilt about unplugging come, and then let it go. You will be happier and better able to focus on what you can do if so, even if it takes a week or two to shrug the feeling off.\n\nCal Newport talks about using digital news only for the best thing it can be used for.
