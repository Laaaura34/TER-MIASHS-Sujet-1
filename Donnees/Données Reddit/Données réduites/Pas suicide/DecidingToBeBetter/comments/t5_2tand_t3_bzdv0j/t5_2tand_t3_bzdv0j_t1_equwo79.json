I'm probably twice your age but I'm not sure that matters. I went through a crippling depression due to this and my own mortality for about five years(totally wasted five years of living worrying about dying? Ain't that some bullshit?) Predictions are just that. Much of what you(we) worry about could happen tomorrow or 200 years from now. That is of course technology doesn't save us(which) I believe it will. Just like it has every other time in human history. That's step one. Believe that the predictions aren't set in stone. Knowing these things are napping is important to the process of fixing them.\n\nStep two. Turn all that shit off man. Unless you're actually gonna get involved in politics or climate science then you have no reason to watch it. Knowing all this shit ain't gonna help your life in any way. The human need to \"stay informed\" is a toxic one and one that serves little purpose.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bzdv0j/help_my_overall_productivity_and_mental_health/equwo79/"}
