I felt even more disconnected even though I wasn\u2019t receiving all the negative news and \u201cfacts\u201d. Since we live far away from close friends and family, it\u2019s hard to be connected without social media. \n\nGratitude: \nAfter I do the gratitude lists, I then run into panic anxiety mode of immense fear of losing those things I was extremely grateful for.  Then I get all sad and lost and that nagging hopeless feelings comes right back. \n\nHigher being:\nI really do wish I wasn\u2019t a skeptic and over analyze everything. I wish I could be like friends and family who have complete faith in something they can\u2019t explain. No matter how hard I tried or at my lowest point, I just can\u2019t blindly believe in something without tangible evidence. \n\n\nI just came to accept my thoughts and emotions run rather low and that\u2019s just how my brain\u2019s wired.  Now THAT helped. \n\nJust the acceptance and being aware that that low feeling is ok and will pass, that I don\u2019t have to carry out dark thoughts. Just accepting the ebb and flow of different emotions and that I don\u2019t have to act or do anything.  I let myself free of being responsible or doing something with moments of happiness or sadness.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bzdv0j/help_my_overall_productivity_and_mental_health/eqswjt4/"}
