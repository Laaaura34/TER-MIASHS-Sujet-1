This as the best habit I started for myself. I would just have to get out of the house for at least a five min walk, or a run if I was up for it. I usually went at least 10-15 min. It helps everything-regulates my mood, hunger, sleep, anxiety, increases daytime energy, calm and focus. I recently broke my leg though, so I haven\u2019t been able to do this (I\u2019ve tried a bit to go for a walk with the crutches, but it\u2019s painful for my hands and arms, like walking with shoes that don\u2019t fit). I can\u2019t wait to start doing this again more regularly.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/f1q14a/taking_this_whole_sub_on_a_walk_this_am/fh7y54n/"}
