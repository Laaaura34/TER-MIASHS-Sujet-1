It takes incredible courage to admit your feelings.\n\nIf you have any doubts at all about how your family will receive this, you might ask for some help. Here is a link to the national alliance on mental health (nami) https://www.nami.org/findsupport.\n\nThis is a time, more than ever, when there should never ever be any stigma for asking for help.\n\nWhatever you choose to do, I hope it makes you be the best person that you can be and that you can find your authentic best self.\n\nPlease post back and let us know how you're doing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ln0ife/i_think_i_might_finally_open_up_to_my_family_and/gnzc6pq/"}
