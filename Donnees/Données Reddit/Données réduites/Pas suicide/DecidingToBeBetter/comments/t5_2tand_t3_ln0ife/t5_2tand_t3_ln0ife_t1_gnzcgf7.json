You have intelligence and a ton of self awareness. The fact that you went from obese to in shape shows a fuck ton of capability in itself. Apply that to the rest of your life. \n\nOne thing you need to realize is that you feel like a waste, because you\u2019ve simply done nothing. It\u2019s not about you. Think about this, let\u2019s say your life split into two different universes at 22. One scenario is what you are living now. One scenario you actually took action, found a career or at least a job you can stand, cultivated a social life, put yourself out there, etc. In both scenarios you are the same person. Only difference is you took action. Do the same thought activity with where you are now. It\u2019s never too late. \n\nWhat I would do in your shoes is just start over. I guarantee there is a job you could find online. You said you need something to do during the day? My man, apply for jobs lol. Find something. Anything. It doesn\u2019t matter where you start. Save enough to get an apartment. You gotta get out of there.\n\nIt\u2019s never too late to start now. I did when I was 29.
