It seems like each problem  kind of influences another and makes it worse, so starting at the most obvious issue seems like a good start.\n\nFor me I was thinking of starting therapy, hopefully that will fix my social anxiety and help me to start dating, interacting with more people, and interview for jobs. I want to start leaving my house for at least 10 - 15 min a day even if its just a walk to the market.\n\nAlso my family has never really understood why I do the things I do and mostly isolate myself, they have never seem to accept that there is something psychologically different with me and it has affected our relationship. Maybe the therapist can help with this, but my plan is to show them the goals I want to reach and maybe they feel inclined to help or learn more. Hope maybe some of this helps you too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ln0ife/i_think_i_might_finally_open_up_to_my_family_and/go3v9g6/"}
