We give either 7 or 9 mg. Personally I've also discovered a zinc supplement is even more effective. I read about it in Psychology today. Zinc deficiency is a common reason for circadian rhythm disruption. I would suggest a 50 mg supplement taken with the melatonin. Both need to be taken when you're in bed ready to go to sleep. Do not use anything else with these two supplements, no alcohol for example. Also make sure it's dark. Artificial light is another culprit in disturbed circadian rhythms. \n\nI'm a die hard insomniac and have battled for sleep my whole life. These supplements are the most effective thing I've found to encourage sleep.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hp8gnc/three_days_of_no_nicotine_or_marijuana_just_raw/fxr4zrq/"}
