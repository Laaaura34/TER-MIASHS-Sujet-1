That or they really don't use it as often as I and others who discover its negative side do. \n\nLike I said in my post, smoking it daily means that it becomes really hard to enjoy anything without it. Food, sleep, sex, entertainment, hanging out with friends. Yeah it's not necessarily a problem if you just always smoke before you do those things, but as soon as you try to without it it becomes disappointing. I really don't enjoy the idea of needing a (recreational) substance in order to function normally. \n\nAll that being said, I didn't really even quit, I just moved to a state where it's illegal and my supply I brought ran out. I'm using that as an opportunity to address those issues from my previous paragraph and lower my consumption. I'd 100% partake on trips back home to visit friends though, and I might even bring some back to have here but it wouldn't be the endless supply I had there.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hp8gnc/three_days_of_no_nicotine_or_marijuana_just_raw/fxvz1oe/"}
