There's a graph often shared that paints the schedules of some historic people and a whole bunch of them had wacky sleep patterns. Think twice in a 24h period, or working at night, or sleeping very little. It's even more common with all kinds of neurodivergencies.\n\nMy quality of life improved immensely when I accepted that the classic sleep schedule just shat on it and did me no good. I'm much more efficient and happy when I do my weird hours.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hp8gnc/three_days_of_no_nicotine_or_marijuana_just_raw/fxr2b8y/"}
