I know it\u2019s used more for alcohol than cannabis, but it does work pretty well for me. After a certain dosage, your hunger increases a lot too (I\u2019m officially prescribed 20mg x 4/day, but take up to 50mg per dose; if you have an understanding doctor, they\u2019ll prescribe more than 20mg at a time, but you need to have a good addiction specialist for that). Sleep has also improved, but I have to be careful when I take the baclofen (like many medications, it can have a paradoxical effect too).\n\nOtherwise try mirtazipine (I personally hate it, but it can work for many, and has super-similar side-effects to cannabis, i.e. sleep and eat shitloads).", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hp8gnc/three_days_of_no_nicotine_or_marijuana_just_raw/fxryvcb/"}
