He was not a very nice guy but clearly went through a lot. A few years ago he was sent to prison for about 3 years for illegal drug possession etc, and I think he got out last year (empathy for him for that right there, not the best time!). I definitely have a lot of empathy for him because I know his parents were terrible and I can't even imagine not having the love of my family to guide me on the right path. Sometimes in those years he was in prison I would think about somehow helping him, though I doubt he would have wanted it from me. Anyways, I spied on his FB page now that he is out and it seems that he's settling down and getting his life together, having a kid, etc. Judging by the pictures I am hopeful that he straightened out and willing to give a kid a better life than what he went through. That would be my greatest wish.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lpgf5p/is_it_normal_or_ok_to_feel_empathy_for_my_past/gobgk9q/"}
