You've got the right mindset though. It was around this teenage time I found myself able for the first time step back from the chaotic storm of existence and realize I had the agency to change myself and my situation.\n\n\nMeditation literally is the practice of what you ask for. It helps create space between thoughts and action. But it's rather abstract initially.\n\nI suggest to start a weight training program. Lifting is a rather meditative practice for me too and I started as a teen. Every lift is like exorcising the lack of control you have in life. Soon, every day in the mirror, you will see the fruit of your labor (and eventually others too). You will have willed into existence parts of your body. It's an empowering concept. \n\nAfter a good workout you have an afterglow and will feel calm and relaxed too.
