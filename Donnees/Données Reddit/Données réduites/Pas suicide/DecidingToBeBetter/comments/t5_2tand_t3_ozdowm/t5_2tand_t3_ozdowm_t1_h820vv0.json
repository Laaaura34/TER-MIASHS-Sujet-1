Comfort too, can be a killer.\n\nAlso maybe read the Kybalion, you may like it, you may not. If you are looking for spiritual it is an excellent primer.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kYTJwgXjb7w\n\nI like this version because of the voice and music combo, easy listening while I do other stuff.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ozdowm/i_created_this_account_4y_ago_when_i_was/h820vv0/"}
