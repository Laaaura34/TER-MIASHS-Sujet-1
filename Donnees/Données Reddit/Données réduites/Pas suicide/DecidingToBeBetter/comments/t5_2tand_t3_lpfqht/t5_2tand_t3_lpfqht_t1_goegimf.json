It's not easy and it takes time, and it doesn't matter how long it takes, it will be over eventually.\n\nI also wish nobody has to go through these horrible feelings, but at the same time going through hell made me reach heaven, and if I could choose to go through it all again, I would have, because I am a much better and happier person right now.\n\nStay strong, my friend, I'm waiting for you here on the other side :) You are already on your way here and that's all that matters!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lpfqht/im_ready_to_say_my_breakup_was_the_best_thing/goegimf/"}
