It felt impossible to continue to exist. But I threw myself into my work, invested more time and energy into my friends and family, reconnected with lost friends, and went back to doing the hobbies I loved before we were a couple. I found me again, and a better version of myself. It\u2019s paid off immensely, and I\u2019m so much happier with my life and myself (if still, lonely romantically). \n\nThe really great part about something like this, is realizing that you can survive feeling THAT terrible, and come out stronger. The next time I got my heart hurt, I was able to know: 1. This is nothing compared to a 7 year relationship dying, and 2. I\u2019m great, I have everything I need to pick myself up and start over. \n\nI\u2019m really happy for you, the lessons you\u2019ve learned in the past couple months will help you through all of life\u2019s ups and downs.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lpfqht/im_ready_to_say_my_breakup_was_the_best_thing/godwm9h/"}
