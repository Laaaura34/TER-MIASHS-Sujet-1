When we're stripped away from the person we think \"completed\" us, it may destabilize us at first, but eventually we remember who we were -- or are -- when alone. It often ends up being a good change to lose that person who had eclipsed us.\n\nI learned how to be happy without a SO and that was the best life experience I've ever had.  After a painful breakup years ago, I changed my pattern and, for once, didn't rebound into a new relationship to fill the void. I was lost and depressed for quite a while, but the drive to survive overtakes the rejection and provokes healing. The despair I felt forced me to examine my choices, values, goals, and mistakes, and to decide what to focus on next. \n\nNow I've been married 20 years to someone who is a true companion rather than a security blanket, trophy conquest. or someone I settled on to fulfill my life script. I had to learn how to be happy alone first, which made it clearer what kind of partner I needed.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lpfqht/im_ready_to_say_my_breakup_was_the_best_thing/goefgkw/"}
