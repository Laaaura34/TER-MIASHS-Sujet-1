Different circumstances, but the pain, ups and downs, and desire to be better are the same. Some days good, some bad, some really bad from being triggered by nostalgia or a reminder of something from the past. But I\u2019m in that process of slowly picking myself up. The visual of the pillar falling and feeling like it brought everything down with it really resonated. Thanks for this post. Not glad anyone  else has/had to go through this type of experience/pain/confusion/self-doubt, but does help knowing it might be somewhat normal to feel this way. Glad you came out of hell a better person. Hoping to see ya on the other side some day.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lpfqht/im_ready_to_say_my_breakup_was_the_best_thing/goc0khk/"}
