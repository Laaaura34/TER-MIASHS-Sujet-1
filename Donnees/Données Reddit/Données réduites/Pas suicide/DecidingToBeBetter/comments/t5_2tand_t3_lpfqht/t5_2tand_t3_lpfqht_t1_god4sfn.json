I\u2019d been wanting to do it for years but never felt confident enough to do it on my own as we have four children together. I used to dread coming home from work. I can breathe now. It\u2019s still hard, but a good kind of hard. I take pride in the little things, like coming home from work and cooking a meal for us and maybe doing some housework as well. I\u2019m working on my health and fitness, have been before the break up but I didn\u2019t go backwards in that time. I find time is helping with resentment towards the ex, he\u2019s been not a great person since he moved out. I used to fight with him every time I saw him but now I just say the basics and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s harder with kids as I can\u2019t have a clean break like I would love but it\u2019s ok. Even talking to an amazing guy now who makes me feel so loved as well.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lpfqht/im_ready_to_say_my_breakup_was_the_best_thing/god4sfn/"}
