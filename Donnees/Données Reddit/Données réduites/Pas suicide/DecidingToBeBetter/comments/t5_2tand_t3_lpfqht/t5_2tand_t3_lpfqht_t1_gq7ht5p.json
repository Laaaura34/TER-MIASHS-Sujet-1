I'm usually good at ignoring my emotions but I feel physically ill, and I can't get the feeling to go away.\n\nHow did you meet new friends? I desperately need to go out and meet people. I don't even know if I want to look for romance, but I need people to talk to and spend time with and I just really don't know where to find it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lpfqht/im_ready_to_say_my_breakup_was_the_best_thing/gq7ht5p/"}
