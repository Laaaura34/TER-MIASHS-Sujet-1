Now it's been like 4 years or so. Yes, I've learned to live alone. I learned to enjoy life on my own. Yet, I'm alone. Now I perfectly understand what it means. A year is not enough. Not 2 nor 3. It's getting to me. I will die alone. And I don't like it. Don't get me wrong. I can enjoy life. I'm not dependent. But I know way too much what I miss. I cannot even describe it. It's subtle. Of course it's not entirely subtle, I miss sex in my life. I can have fun with myself, it's quality time, but it's just not it. No fights now, no stress, but something is missing. BTW, we became friends. We meet sometimes. We even had sex once in the summer. But I know we can't get together. It didn't work then, it just won't work. Life. I'm pretty sure I did the right thing ending our relationship, but you know, I also have some doubts years after. The crazy thoughts of getting together again. But it's irrational. Bad idea. I know it. It's just tough sometimes.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lpfqht/im_ready_to_say_my_breakup_was_the_best_thing/gobzz2a/"}
