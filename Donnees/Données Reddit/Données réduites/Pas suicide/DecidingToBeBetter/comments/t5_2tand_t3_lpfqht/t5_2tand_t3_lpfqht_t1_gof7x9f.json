With the pandemic, it's hard, but I've been looking into making online friends for the moment (which isn't the same as meeting someone face to face, but it helps a lot!). And I have revived old friendships that got lost in time, and I have also been reinforcing the friendships I already had. And it paid off, it's good to have people to talk about stuff, whatever it is!\n\nAs for romantic intersts, again, as the pandemic doesn't allow much face to face interaction, I have been using dating apps such as Tinder to meet other girls and I have been enjoying it! Also, for now, I don't want anything serious with anyone, the 7 year relationship made me realize I want to be free right now and getting into a serious relationship with someone now wouldn't allow me to be like that. \n\nI want to meet new people, get to know them (with romantic interests or just as friends), and above everything to enjoy life. \n\nI went on a date last saturday with a girl, we had a picnic at the park and it was amazing. We were really into each other (we kissed, hugged). And I felt free. We enjoyed each other for the time we had and that's it. No attachment, just two people enjoying themselves and having fun! It was great.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lpfqht/im_ready_to_say_my_breakup_was_the_best_thing/gof7x9f/"}
