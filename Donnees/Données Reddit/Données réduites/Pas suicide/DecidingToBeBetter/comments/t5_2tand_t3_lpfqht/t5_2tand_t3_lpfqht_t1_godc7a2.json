Those feelings that come crashing down on you are like waves. When you\u2019re floating in the sea of life and going through it, those waves are big and they hit *hard*.  When you finally pop your head back up, gasping for air, another wave hits and sends you tumbling. \n  \n  As time goes by, though, those waves still come but they are smaller and much less frequent. Eventually you even see them coming. \n\n  So keep floating, friend. Your seas will calm down. I promise. And then you\u2019re already in the water, ready to catch one of all those other \u2018fish in the sea\u2019.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lpfqht/im_ready_to_say_my_breakup_was_the_best_thing/godc7a2/"}
