And completely agree, I've thought these exact words just a few hours ago, as I was sprinting across town drunk to meet the pizza delivery guy.Motivation/reason to do something is my biggest driver.\n\nI have a vague idea of what I want, but I don't think it's nearly enough. I always liked to make people laugh, and do what my heart desires while defying authority / societal standards. It has become norm for me to hear things like \"I don't understand you sometimes\" and so on. But then the rabbit hole continues.\n\nI Want validation and attention because I've never really felt understood or accepted for who I am (my family is pretty much the opposite of me). They have been telling me how I can't do things my whole life and just live in a totally diferent reality. \n\nI don't know who I am, where I belong or what to do with myself. It's pretty fucked up when I stop to think about it, but what scares me is that I've gained the ability to not really care about anything. Or maybe I've always had it. No matter what happens in my life, I can just shrug. And say, oh well. I've fallen apart with every single one of my fallen friends, either by argument or just lack of compatibilty.every single one. At one point, a person just has to stop and think... Am I the asshole? And I don't know how to help myself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8rxbm/how_can_i_be_more_enthusiastic_about_life/hgt3cht/"}
