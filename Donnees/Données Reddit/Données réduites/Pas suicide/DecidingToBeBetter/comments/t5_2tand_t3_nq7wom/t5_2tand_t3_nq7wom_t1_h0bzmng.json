I can't imagine the fear and emotional trauma you go through.  As a 2x cancer survivor with extreme PTSD and depression/anxiety I am way proud of you.  When you said \"it's not much\" you were wrong. Its everything! I know how hard self care is with these illnesses and even 1 day let alone 6 weeks of continuous self care is a huge triumph.  In my own life I've fallen off the health wagon and gotten back on so many times I can't even remember anymore, but I keep trying no matter what and I find your post very inspiring. Thank you for sharing!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nq7wom/i_have_ptsd_and_depression_and_i_set_a_goal_back/h0bzmng/"}
