I would put on a video or an episode of a show I really enjoyed. And I would get on my parents treadmill and I would tell myself, \u201cif I want to stop after 5 minutes of walking then I can.\u201d But usually I would be lost in whatever video or show I watched that five minutes would go by and I would still want to walk more. Soon enough it became, \u201cif I want to stop after 10 minutes then I can.\u201d There are lots of times I stopped at 10 minutes. \n\nEach time you try to start up the habit again, is a success in itself.
