Remember that no one feels like exercising. If I went to the gym only when I felt like it then I would be a sedentary out of shape being. You make the rule--you go after a hard day at work when you don't feel like it. You go when you didn't get enough sleep--in fact, make that a personal challenge--to go anyway when you are tired. Every time you do it is a victory--and builds just a little more momentum. And you keep going with your plan--no matter what. Hope that helps--Charles", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nq7wom/i_have_ptsd_and_depression_and_i_set_a_goal_back/h0c9ofh/"}
