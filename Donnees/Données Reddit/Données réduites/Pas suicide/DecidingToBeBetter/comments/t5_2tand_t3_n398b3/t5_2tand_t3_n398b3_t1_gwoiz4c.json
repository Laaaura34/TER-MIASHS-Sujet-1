I've never really been religious, growing up we only went to church Easter and even then that was maybe a handful of times. I do like the morals that religion teaches. The commandments, like don't kill and what not. I may not believe in it but the morals are great to live by.  That's awesome youre finding your way without religion. How do you feel now about your life and where it's headed now as to when you were following religion", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n398b3/went_to_church_for_the_first_time_in_many_years/gwoiz4c/"}
