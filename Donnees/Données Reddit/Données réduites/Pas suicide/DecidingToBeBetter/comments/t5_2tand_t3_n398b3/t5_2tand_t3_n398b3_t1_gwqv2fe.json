Even right at the top it talks about how he criticized atheism. You fucking people and your cherry picking. I love how you guys always try and reattribute his beliefs when they were foundational to his coming to power.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_of_Adolf_Hitler?wprov=sfla1\n\nNo I don't think the other few guys have killed anywhere near the massive death toll Christianity / judaism has amassed in the past 4 thousand years.\n\nEven if any of this were completely false, just because an asshole believed in science doesn't negate the facts of science. They are clear, concise, and they are provable. Unlike magical fairytale bullshit in the sky. Religion has NO place on this planet and it should not be tolerated. It does vastly more harm than good.
