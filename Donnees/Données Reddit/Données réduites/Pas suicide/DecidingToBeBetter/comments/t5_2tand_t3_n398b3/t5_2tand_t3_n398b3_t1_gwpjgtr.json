That is how cults operate. By aligning yourself with religious organizations you are perpetuating stupidity and the loss of rational thought. There is NO evidence for religion. There IS evidence against it. Denying this is plugging your ears from the truth and reality of the world we live in today. Religion perpetuates poor critical thinking skills and is a major reason why we have idiots voting for cheeto man. WE DO NOT NEED irrational thinking to be perpetrated!

Religion is a net negative and a massive drain on societal progress as a whole.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n398b3/went_to_church_for_the_first_time_in_many_years/gwpjgtr/"}
