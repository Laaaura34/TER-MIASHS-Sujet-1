You're adding to the societal negative that you KNOW religions are guilty of.\n\nThere is no irony in me telling somebody that religion is the wrong place to better yourself. And why would you think that a community group of people, a \"religion without religion\" would be bad? Community is the main reason people get sucked into church. But then churches poison you with irrational thought processes. Community groups are great.
