It encourages groupthink, discourages rational thought, continues to support otherism, continues to spread lies and misinformation about all sorts of things, they continue to support pedophilia, they refuse science and logic, and religion as a concept overall perpetuates poor critical thinking skills within a population that desperately needs it.\n\nYou should think for yourself friend. Don't allow a church to get into your head. Most cults are welcoming, that's not a surprise. If you need a community there are plenty of non religious groups that are welcoming without the societal drain that religion propagates.\n\nEdit: Down vote me all you want, it doesn't make your fantasy sky master real or tangible. It certainly doesn't make you any more intelligent.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n398b3/went_to_church_for_the_first_time_in_many_years/gwpg8vh/"}
