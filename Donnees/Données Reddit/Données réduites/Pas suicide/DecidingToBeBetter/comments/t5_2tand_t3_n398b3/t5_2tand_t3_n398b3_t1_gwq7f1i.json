Lots of time on stage listening to the same sermon for multiple services gives an agnostic a lot of time to think about the nature of religion and it\u2019s role in these peoples lives. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t see myself ever believing in what they believe in, the role the church plays in these people\u2019s lives is amazing. It gives them a sense of belonging. A community. A home.
