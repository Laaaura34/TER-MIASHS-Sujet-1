What I'm saying is that there are secular (non-religious) groups, that have just as deleterious effects on society, and that are just as cult-like as some religions. You're making a blanket statement that non religious groups are better for society than religious ones. You have unexamined assumptions and you make blanket statements about entire groups of people and and widely distributed organizations kinda like someone in a ... cult. \n\nMy point is YOU have religious tendencies and I was right in that you don't even catch the irony. Again, i'm not a church goer, just pointing out some sweet sweet neck beard irony.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n398b3/went_to_church_for_the_first_time_in_many_years/gwpwil3/"}
