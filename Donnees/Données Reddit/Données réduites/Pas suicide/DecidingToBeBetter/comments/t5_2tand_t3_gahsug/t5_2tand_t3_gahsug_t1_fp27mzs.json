I am ADHD and one thing I do if I do not have my concerta is I avoid any task that is causing me stress. That is why you are doing nothing rather than doing the task/obligation.

Not sure if you are on ADHD medication, but it has changed my life since going onto concerta.\n\nI only discovered I was ADHD at age 30 and took another medication for years, but only when I took Concerta about 3 years ago now have I been able to achieve things in life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gahsug/pinpointed_the_i_know_i_have_obligations_today_so/fp27mzs/"}
