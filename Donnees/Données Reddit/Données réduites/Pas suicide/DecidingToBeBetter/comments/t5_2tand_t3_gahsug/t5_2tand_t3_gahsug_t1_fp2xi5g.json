Not to put too fine a point on it, but I'm in a life situation where those around me don't really believe that it's severe enough to warrant getting therapy/meds for. If I *really* wanted to, I could get out there and do it, but it'd complicate things. So I live with it.\n\nAnd I have to say I turn green with envy when I see other sufferers say how much their medication clears their mind. It may sound like bragging, but I legitimately have many talents, some of which I've taken to a pretty decent extent. I can only imagine what kind of things I could accomplish if only I was able to properly control my level of focus.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gahsug/pinpointed_the_i_know_i_have_obligations_today_so/fp2xi5g/"}
