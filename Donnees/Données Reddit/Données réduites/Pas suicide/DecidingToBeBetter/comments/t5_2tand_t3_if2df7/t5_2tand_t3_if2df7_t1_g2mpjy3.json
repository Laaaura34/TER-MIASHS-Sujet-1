Wonderful. I married my best friend 14 years ago. Truly fantastic. So, I\u2019m really truly happy for you. That is an amazing thing. I must say however that I, personally, haven\u2019t been able to rid myself of the depression (but heck we are all different, aren\u2019t we!?). Anyway, this wonderful understanding love of my life and best friend, has come to understand my ongoing struggle and not take it as a failing of his. So, I wish you well and constant healing and reprieve from depressive episodes. Just know that if you continue to struggle, your new best friend might still be able to support you through those reoccurrences. I personally thank the universe every day that the love of my life (despite the fact that he personally has never encountered depression) has the patience, wisdom, calm and self confidence to help me weather the storm last that I continue to encounter. Much joy to you, now, and as you both grow together.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/if2df7/i_beat_depression_and_married_my_best_friend/g2mpjy3/"}
