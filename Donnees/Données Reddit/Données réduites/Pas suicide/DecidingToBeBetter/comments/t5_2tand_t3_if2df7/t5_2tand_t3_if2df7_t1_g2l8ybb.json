I do have some concern. From what I understand those who suffer from depression can never truly beat it. I'm diagnosed with clinical depression and when I finally reached out and got help and got on medication, I felt fixed. I thought I had truly beaten depression. I won't go into details but I went through another real hard time and my depression came creeping back. It destroyed me. I was convinced that I was broken and I attempted suicide. Life is a roller coaster. There are highs and there are lows. Just be prepared for depression to show its head again. You're not broken. It's normal to feel sad and depressed. You will probably be depressed again sometime in your life. If that happens, just know that it's not permanent. Don't forget all that you've learned about mental health and you'll feel those highs again. Sorry if that was a downer. I'm really happy for you op and I wish you the best!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/if2df7/i_beat_depression_and_married_my_best_friend/g2l8ybb/"}
