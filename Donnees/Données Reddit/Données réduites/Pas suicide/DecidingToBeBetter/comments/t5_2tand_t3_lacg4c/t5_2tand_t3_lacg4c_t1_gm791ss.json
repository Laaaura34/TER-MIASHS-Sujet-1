I ended up consuming 7 spoonfuls of hot sauce but all in all it was definitely an improvement over nothing. Earlier it felt like I had no time whatsoever. All the time after work got lost into the endless social media feeds and Youtube videos. But now I could find enough time to read 150 pages during working week which had never happened in over 4 years. I also found time to practice on my piano (keyboard?). Last time I played it was 6 or 7 years ago, so I'm happy to jump back in.\n\nThe brain did tend to slip up and crave for the instant gratification like an addict several times in the last 5 days. I had to forcibly pull myself away. My flatmate held up his end and made sure that I was punished whenever I slipped up. This tangible threat made it a little easier to stay on track.\n\nTLDR: I'm happy with the progress on first week.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lacg4c/i_have_decided_to_start_a_digital_detox/gm791ss/"}
