If you find you jump from one addiction to another, you could seek out mental health services in your area and speak with someone. Depending on where you live this may be free, but likely would have a very long wait time, so get on the wait list asap. This doesn't have to be anything too onerous. But often people who jump from addictions do it for some underlying reason. If there isn't one, no harm done in exploring it. But if there is, and you leave it alone, it can grow and fester and become much harder to deal with later on in life. It will also always remain in the back of your mind fueling whichever new addiction you're drawn toward. I say all this because I find often when I recommend to people to seek out mental health services, they assume I'm saying they're crazy. But that's not it. If you had a cough that wasn't going away, I'd recommend you see a doctor. But that doesn't mean you have stage 4 lung cancer, so don't think of it that way for mental health either. Think of it as mental health hygiene. \n\nps. Great job on your recent decisions. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7ri5p0/quitting_masturbating_for_3_days_more_than/dsx5yuu/"}
