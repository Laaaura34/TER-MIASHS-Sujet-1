The only thing you can do is practice mindfulness, be present and in the moment rather than thinking about the past. The fact you feel bad for the things you have done, shows your growth. Its okay to feel angry about a past version of yourself, its okay to be ashamed and feel guilty but it's important to not let those feelings consume your life. Your past doesn't define you, everyone can have a redemption. \n\nI wish you all the best luck and send nothing but positive vibes to you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pij8qp/how_do_i_deal_with_the_guilt/hbqngct/"}
