Being told you're amazing for no particular reason makes it meaningless. Most people don't feel amazing for doing nothing. We feel uncomfortable, or that we haven't done anything to deserve the baseless praise. \n\nHowever, pinning the praise and gratitude to a specific attribute or behaviour makes it meaningful and makes the receiver feel more valued. It also shows that the person giving the compliment has paid attention!\n\n\"You're amazing!\"\nOr...\n\"I love the way you show you care for me by putting the coffee on when you get up.\"\n\nWhich one feels more personal? Which one feels more tangible?\n\nSo I would say YES to this. Celebrate your other half and make sure they know how loved and valued they are. But don't be afraid to be specific with it!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lwtrrj/if_youre_currently_lucky_enough_to_have_a_partner/gpmkhfr/"}
