Honest post and i can see a big stone fell off your shoulders now. You are getting back on track step by step.\n\nIm in a similar spot right now. Same 7 years. My biggest problem is my ego. I have to admit it and i know that wont get me alot of empathy because i guess its stupid.\n\nI was successful in the past and always could provide for myself but after some mental health problems lost everything so i have to start from zero again.\n\nAlways waiting and hoping for a chance coming around but deep down i know it wont come until i change my habits.\n\nMy ego is stopping me to start a job where i will earn a small percentage from my past. Any advise?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i4wepx/i_got_a_normal_paycheck_for_the_first_time_in/g0my3sj/"}
