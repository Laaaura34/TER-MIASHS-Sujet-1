I too have been out of the work force for about 5 years now, also with my CS degree that's been going unused. I've tried several at home business \"ventures\" that haven't worked out. I want to get back to work, but the social anxiety is great and I honestly feel ashamed of my past 5 years. The idea of explaining that employment gap in an interview is absolutely terrifying.\n\nCan I ask you if that came up in interviews, and how you responded? Either way, thanks for the inspiration.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i4wepx/i_got_a_normal_paycheck_for_the_first_time_in/g0n2l69/"}
