The biggest help has been self-compassion work, and one of the steps in building self-compassion is recognizing that other people feel the same way.  So in a way, you and I are connected through our shared feelings when we make a mistake.  You're not alone!\n\nAnother thing that helps is separating the facts about what I did (keep knocking that piece off, knitted five whole rows inside out) and what I tell myself it means (I'm a klutz and will never get it, I'm an idiot and should've been paying better attention).  Also I try to separate the feelings that go with them (the mistake makes me feel frustrated or annoyed, the thoughts about the mistakes make me feel worthless and humiliated).\n\nRemembering to breathe, take a break, and calm myself down has taken me a lot of practice, and I still don't get it right all the time.  Sometimes if I can trace back to what happened right before I went into a meltdown, I can learn to recognize the warning signs and \"quit while I'm ahead.\"  But not always, I'm also stubborn.\n\nDealing with perfectionism is a real challenge, and it's not a problem you can just stop having.  But it isn't an insurmountable problem. Working with a therapist can help.  Talking with your friends can help.
