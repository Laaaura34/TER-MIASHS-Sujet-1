I really hope we don\u2019t have another shutdown.  It made it acceptable for a lot of people to stay indoors and do nothing for hours on end.  \n\nPeople who have issues will use any excuse to justify their crappy behaviors.  I know a lot of people, myself included, were like \u201cnah, I can\u2019t go out and be infecting people, I have to be safe.  I\u2019m gonna stay home and play video games for 14 hours a day to do my part!  I can\u2019t be going out to the grocery store and infecting people there, I should just order pizza and have contactless delivery!\u201d  \n\nAnyhow, mini rant, but yes.  Anyone on this sub is atleast taking a step in the right direction. More power to us all!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcljjx/guess_who_just_walked_5_miles_before_7am/hamf78p/"}
