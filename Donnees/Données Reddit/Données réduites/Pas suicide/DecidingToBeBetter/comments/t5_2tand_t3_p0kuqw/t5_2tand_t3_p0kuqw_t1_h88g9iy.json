I am astounded. I wish I could see the ages of the people posting that they have settled in to mediocre. How old were you when you just tossed in the towel? I am not saying that anyone here will ever make the better mouse trap. But try. Be an artist at nails, or really strive to make tight joints when building shelves. Take the time to check each lug nut again on that tire you changed. Experiment with Ramen noodles and make the perfect hangover soup. Do something. You may not land a rover on Mars but you can be the world\u2019s foremost authority on the pictures it send back. Everyone has a talent. Brushing teeth really well is a talent. Design a brush that mimics your motion. Don\u2019t give up. Don\u2019t get discouraged. Don\u2019t hate on yourself and don\u2019t listen to the haters. You don\u2019t have to be Einstein even Einstein wasn\u2019t Einstein.
