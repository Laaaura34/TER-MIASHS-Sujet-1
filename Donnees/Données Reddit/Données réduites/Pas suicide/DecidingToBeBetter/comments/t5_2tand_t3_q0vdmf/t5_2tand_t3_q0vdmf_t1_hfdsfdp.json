The other day the same thing happened.  We were out as a family (of 4) at a nearby park nearing our dinner time with nothing prepared.  It crossed my mind to go buy McDonald's for our meal but instead chose to make it ourselves.  Dropped them off at home, picked up the ingredients at a store, and went home to make it ourselves.  It took a lot of work but the result was amazing and the kids prefer it now.  Not to mention, healthier in the long run on our bodies and our wallets to boot!\n\nStrive to be better today than yesterday and over time, you'll see how far you've come.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0vdmf/i_went_grocery_shopping_and_made_dinner_tonight/hfdsfdp/"}
