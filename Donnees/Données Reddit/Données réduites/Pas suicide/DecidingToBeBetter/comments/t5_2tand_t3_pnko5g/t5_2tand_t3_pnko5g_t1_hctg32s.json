I deleted the app on my home screen so I wouldn\u2019t open it as often and I started reading books instead. It\u2019s been amazing and every now and then I download the app again if I need to do something specific that I can\u2019t do in the web version and I won\u2019t even stay there long because I rather read. Well done and I hope you find something you enjoy enough to make you forget about Instagram too :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pnko5g/deleted_instagram_now_what/hctg32s/"}
