When I first deleted social media a long time ago, It took me a while to figure out what I wanted to do with my time and for a bit, I ended up filling my time doing other things that were equally as nonproductive such as watching TV, YouTube or too much video games. Eventually, I grounded myself and realized that I could spend my time throughout the day doing activities that help me feel more present as opposed to anxious or depressed (the way social media makes many people feel). For me it was reading, coloring, journaling, going on walks/exercising, hanging out with friends or learning something online; these are just some ideas as to what activities can help someone to feel more present but really, there are a large number of activities available! Just do what you think would make you feel more productive or something that you simply enjoy doing !", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pnko5g/deleted_instagram_now_what/hcryy0z/"}
