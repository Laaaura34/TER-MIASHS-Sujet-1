It's expected that you're going to feel like your problems are multiplying right now because you're finding them faster then you're knocking them down. It's just a phase you need to get through. I still feel this way to some degree.\n\nI was really there with feeling hopeless about the future, six months later I'm feeling a lot better. I think a lot of it is self discovery and learning the difference between what I want and what society is telling me I should want. A huge part of it too was feeling trapped and thinking things would never change. My therapist was very helpful with helping me understand that I did have options.\n\nHang in there.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/izkq9g/finally_working_on_myself_struggling_with_what_i/g6kstsd/"}
