It was my goal in life to be the perfect wife and have a husband that was absolutely in love with me and wonderful family to complete it all. I had to let go of that dream and opened myself up to new dreams. Dreams of giving love to others (friends, family, my community) without being concerned if I received it back. Dreams of being an accomplished painter, rock climber, skier, and banjo player. Dreams of becoming respected in my profession. There isn't one path to giving your life meaning and happiness. If I never have a spouse or a family or I only end up with some of the things I listed above I feel confident that I would find a way to be happy with my life because I know I can't do it all perfectly and I know I'm trying my best. and I forgive myself for any shortcomings.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l5byp2/ive_stopped_needing_someone/gkulkrh/"}
