Setting small achievable goals and accomplishing them really does it for me. I literally set goals like I'm going to floss this morning and when I do it I feel like \"wow I'm really working on myself\". Another thing is I focus on performing anxiety coping mechanisms on my own before reaching out to others. A lot of times its uncomfortable and I badly wish I could be held and cuddled by someone in those moments but afterwards I know I've been strong for myself and it makes it easier to face the next tough moment. When needed I reach out to those who I know can help me in a healthy mature way, not everyone is a good support system.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l5byp2/ive_stopped_needing_someone/gkujz1z/"}
