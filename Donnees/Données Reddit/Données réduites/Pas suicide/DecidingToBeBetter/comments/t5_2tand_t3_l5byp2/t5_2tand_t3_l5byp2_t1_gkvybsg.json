I\u2019ve been single my whole life, but lately I\u2019ve been trying to date more. I find that I sorta cling to every person that comes along. I recognize this isn\u2019t healthy and I\u2019m trying to do something about it though. It\u2019s kinda hard due to the pandemic, but once it\u2019s over I want to find more things to apply myself to, whether that be hobbies, work, etc. I\u2019m alone most of the time at the moment, so it\u2019s really easy for negative thoughts to seep in. I\u2019m trying though and this post helped a lot to give me motivation. Thanks!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l5byp2/ive_stopped_needing_someone/gkvybsg/"}
