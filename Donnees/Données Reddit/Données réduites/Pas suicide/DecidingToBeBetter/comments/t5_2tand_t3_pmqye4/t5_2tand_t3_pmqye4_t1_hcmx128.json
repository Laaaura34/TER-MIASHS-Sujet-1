Going back nearly two decades with this story. \n\nThe brother of one of my wife's friends ended up on a psych ward, literally thinking he was Jesus. This just came out of nowhere. Long story short, they worked out that it was because he had given up on coffee and tobacco at the same time. Apparently there is a genuine recognized reaction sometimes. Luckily for said chap (based in UK), his dad (then living in Australia) is/was a psychologist. Got a call about son, flew back, worked what had happened. The UK doctors involved were not ever aware it was a thing. \n\nIt has been a standing joke when either me or the other half has given up smoking. I don't know the name of the condition or reaction, or how common or rare it is. But knowing this, I would think twice before giving up coffee and nicotine at the same time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pmqye4/giving_up_on_weed_alcohol_coffee_and_added_sugar/hcmx128/"}
