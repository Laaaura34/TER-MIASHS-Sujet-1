But that was an outlier time; the first time I quit coffee was after graduating university, but then the habit gradually returned.\n\nNowadays even if I start drinking a cup a day, I start experiencing diminishing returns at around day 3. I hypothesise that my body has gotten really sensitive to caffeine after the hell I put it through in university days, so now I can barely have any.\n\nAnd of course, everybody's biology is different. While I personally try not to drink caffeine and am happy to discuss this with anybody, I'm not one to proselytise. If it works for you, then it is what it is. I would simply recommend to stay mindful about its effects.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pmqye4/giving_up_on_weed_alcohol_coffee_and_added_sugar/hclruhm/"}
