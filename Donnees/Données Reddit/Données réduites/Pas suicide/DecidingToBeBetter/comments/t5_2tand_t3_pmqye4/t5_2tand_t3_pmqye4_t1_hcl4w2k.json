It's a really pernicious substance, not as harmless as might appear, judging by how accepted it is in society. Then again, it's a similar case as with alcohol\u2014also accepted in society, also quite harmful (although I guess more obviously so than coffee).\n\nI digress. Basically, caffeine really messes with your sleep, and high quality sleep is *incredibly* important for basically everything. \n\nI recommend the book *Why We Sleep* by Matthew Walker in case you're interested in how important sleep is. And I also recommend spending a bit of time researching caffeine, its mechanism of action, and testimonies of people who have quit it.\n\nTo add my 2 cents, I feel much better having quit it: much more stable energy levels throughout the day, no more energy crashes through the day; I now fall asleep within 10-15 minutes instead of tossing and turning in bed for sometimes hours; much better concentration and focus; noticeably reduced anxiety.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pmqye4/giving_up_on_weed_alcohol_coffee_and_added_sugar/hcl4w2k/"}
