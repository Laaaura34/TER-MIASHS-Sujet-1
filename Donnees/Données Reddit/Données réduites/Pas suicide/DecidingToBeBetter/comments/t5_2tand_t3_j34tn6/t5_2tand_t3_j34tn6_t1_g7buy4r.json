I'm proud of you for saying all this, even the not so perfect bits. \n\nThe only unsolicited advice I have for you is to find what works and stick with it. Not everyone is a runner, for example. If you hate it, you won't stick with it. \n\nAll that aside though I love where your mind is going. Seeing the abuse. Wanting more for yourself. That's amazing and you more than deserve to be loved for you. It's inspiring and I hope you are also proud of yourself. \n\nYou ever need a cheerleader I got you.\n\nEdit: words.
