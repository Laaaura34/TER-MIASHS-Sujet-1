I'd say don't get too hung up on that 30kg to start. That's a lot of weight and it will take a while, you'll have some ups and downs on the way. I think the most important thing is to trust the process. If you do your food diary, get in the gym or just do 'something' every day, there's no way you wont improve yourself.\n\nFor cardio, X is time, Y is distance. Each time you do it, increase X or Y.\n\nWeights, X is reps, Y is weight. Each time you do it, increase X or Y.\n\nIf that makes sense, I think it helps. It certainly did for me. Even if you perhaps aim for 85kg to be the first goal. When you get there, you can look back and say to yourself 'I'm not at my goal weight, but I feel good, and I'm so much fitter than I was at the start'. Then the motivational snowballs, you start to love the grind.\n\nBefore and after pics can be useful as well, and quite eye opening!\n\nSorry I'm just freestyling, hope you can take some good points away from my ramble.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j34tn6/today_i_joined_a_gym_and_stopped_pretending_like/g7advbr/"}
