Over time you\u2019ll figure out what work outs work best for you and there\u2019s plenty of apps to help you workout (even from home if you\u2019d like) I use an app called Daily workouts (it was $20 but completely worth it) then I got a personal trainer from the kickoff app and they provide workouts and nutrition plans for me as well. I\u2019m rooting for you, it\u2019s not easy, but it is simple. Give yourself the discipline you need and you will absolutely get there", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j34tn6/today_i_joined_a_gym_and_stopped_pretending_like/g7baaic/"}
