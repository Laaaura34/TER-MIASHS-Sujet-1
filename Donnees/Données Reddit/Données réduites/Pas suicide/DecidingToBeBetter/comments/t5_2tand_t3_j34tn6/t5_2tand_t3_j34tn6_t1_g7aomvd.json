Lifting weights is so therapeutic. Highly recommend /r/eood (exercise out of depression) as a community.\n\nSeconding everyone recommending more of a focus on diet \u2014\u00a0diet, sleep, and exercise are the three pillars of mental health. What you eat can really affect your mood. I just got those three mostly under control this year and I legit feel like a different person. Years of saying I hated salad and eating doritos for dinner and accepting that I had a 'bad sleep schedule' and it turns out I was actually in a terrible place mentally and don't like kale specifically. Having a nice spinach chicken caesar salad for lunch actually makes me feel GOOD, full, and it actually tastes good to me. Take time to discover what foods actually make you feel good.\n\nETA: I am also a girl who lifts and honestly, the weight room is great. There are way fewer girls so you don't get as caught up in comparing yourself to others, and honestly a lot of the guys are nice even when they're a bit misinformed or horny or whatever, they generally are good bros who just want everyone to reach their peak gainz. Obviously don't put up with anyone mistreating you, but if you are friendly and assume positive intent it can be a really great place.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j34tn6/today_i_joined_a_gym_and_stopped_pretending_like/g7aomvd/"}
