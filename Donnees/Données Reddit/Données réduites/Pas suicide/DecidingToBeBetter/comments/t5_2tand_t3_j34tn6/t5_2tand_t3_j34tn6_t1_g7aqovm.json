I\u2019m a COVID tester. \n\nYou know what I do everyday? I reach into the mouths of thousands of people who all possibly have COVID and come rain or shine I reassure them, and test them. \n\nI have as much risk as getting COVID anywhere as much as here. Probably less so here and the gym where they\u2019re constantly cleaning. Might as well join a gym and continue wearing a mask for a few more hours in the day and sort my life out. \n\nI\u2019m trying to change my life and do something positive with it. You just wanna be miserable. What\u2019s that say about you? \n\nI hope you have a better day friend.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j34tn6/today_i_joined_a_gym_and_stopped_pretending_like/g7aqovm/"}
