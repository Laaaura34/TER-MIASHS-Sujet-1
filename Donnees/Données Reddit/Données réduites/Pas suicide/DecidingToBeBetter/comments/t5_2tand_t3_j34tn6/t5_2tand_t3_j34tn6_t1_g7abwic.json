First thing is to get a scale and weight myself and know how much I need to lose. I\u2019d like to start a food diary and know what I am eating and drinking and monitor that too. I think firstly being mindful about how and what I eat and knowing my triggers for binging would be a good idea.\n\nBecause of my height (or lack thereof) I am classed as BMI obese. Ideally I need to loose ~30kg to be in a healthy weight. I\u2019m not sure if I need to aim for a shorter term goal or maybe a smaller amount to lose first.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j34tn6/today_i_joined_a_gym_and_stopped_pretending_like/g7abwic/"}
