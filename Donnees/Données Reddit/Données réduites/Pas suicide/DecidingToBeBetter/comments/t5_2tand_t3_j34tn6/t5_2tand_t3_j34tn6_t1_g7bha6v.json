I was obese, I smelled bad I was so big. Felt like everyone was looking at me (which was only in my head). I got a trainer for a month, he showed me the ins and outs. Im now much stronger, lost a bunch of weight, and despite Covid setback still on the right track. When I see obese people in the gym, I actually admire them. They are there to do something about it. Small steps. You are on the right path.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j34tn6/today_i_joined_a_gym_and_stopped_pretending_like/g7bha6v/"}
