It\u2019s amazing and it warms my heart and actually gives me confidence that I can do the same. My partner left me as well. All for good reason. I was not the best version of myself when we were dating, I was toxic, he was toxic, we were on and off, we argued often, I didn\u2019t let myself express my emotions in a calm manner I would yell and scream and ignore but in the end those things don\u2019t help at all. I\u2019m heart broken that he left me, but at the same time I\u2019m glad he did because I\u2019ve realized that I was not being myself while we were together. I was lost. I was angry all the time and I realized that I need to do my own healing and start loving myself too before I can love anybody else. I am extremely proud of you, you\u2019re giving me hope and motivation to join a gym and really really learn how to love me", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j34tn6/today_i_joined_a_gym_and_stopped_pretending_like/g7bfj6e/"}
