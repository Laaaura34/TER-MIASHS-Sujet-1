I edited everything, and quickly came to realize I was an asshole to him. its weird how it takes a literal third person perspective to fully reckon with your personality sometimes. later on I sincerely apologized to him. I cried because I realized I'd ruined so many relationships that could have been wonderful, and was dangerously close to alienating the only friend I've had literally since I was born.\n\nI have sincerely tried to do better, and I think I'm doing really good. he's still my best friend, and I'd say better than before. I'd die for that dude, and he knows it. I just had to fix my speech patterns and sense of humor to really show it.\n\nI highly recommend you apologize to anyone you want to fix your relationship with -- ESPECIALLY family. it will be uncomfortable, and they might not be receptive. but it's better than doing nothing and even if it doesn't bring certain people back, it's healthy for YOU to own up to your mistakes and grow.\n\nI know how you're feeling. much love to you, and keeping moving forward. \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8cdlg/it_took_watching_old_home_videos_to_realize_just/gxihgp0/"}
