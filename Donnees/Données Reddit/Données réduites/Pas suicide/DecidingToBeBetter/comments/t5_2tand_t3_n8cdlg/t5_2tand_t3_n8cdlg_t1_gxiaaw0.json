Even kids from the most attentive and loving families can become assholes. Family isn't the only influence in a kid's life. There's school peers, media (someone else mentioned the culture of sass that's in tv/film aimed at teens) and for over 10-15 years now social media. \n\nAnd parents are human and fallible too. There's an equal chance that they were loving - especially since they put up with all of that - and handled her the best they knew. Which is hindsight wasn't the best but you know what? Why assume malice when good intentions can just as easily go wrong. \n\nAnd I'm saying this as a person who had one disabled and one shitty emotionally and verbally abusive parent. He did a lot of things wrong but I can look back and see some periods of altruism and care. If anything having a shitty parent made me *more* empathetic and compassionate to others.\n\nNot dismissing your experience at all. But it isn't helpful to project that onto her from a few paragraphs describing her life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8cdlg/it_took_watching_old_home_videos_to_realize_just/gxiaaw0/"}
