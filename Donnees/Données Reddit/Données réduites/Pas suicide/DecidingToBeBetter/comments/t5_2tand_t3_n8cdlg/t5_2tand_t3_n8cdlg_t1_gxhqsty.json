I agree with the other comments here saying positive things about your progress :)\n\nI wanted to touch on the \"I didn't really know\" part of how you were mean. Just an arm-chair psychology thing here (haha), but I think part of it is that there is a certain \"culture\" in which it is cool to diss others.\n\nYou see it in series, in movies, and lots of people do it. Like being \"sassy\" is seen as funny and cool, and then people like saying things, but then they don't realise that it's not actually funny, it's actually just mean.\n\nUnlike in films or series or anything, you're not a \"protagonist\" with a spotlight, so if you say stuff like that, it doesn't come across as anything else other than dumb or mean.\n\nSorry, I went a bit off topic there, and maybe I'm WAY off - but it's something I've noticed with tons of people growing up, myself included, family and friends as well - is that sometimes they'll say these things, and be totally unaware how or why it is oppressing someone.\n\nI'm gonna end with this, it takes a lot of self-awareness and courage to acknowledge this. So, for that I commend you. You're on the right path now. Make the best of it :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8cdlg/it_took_watching_old_home_videos_to_realize_just/gxhqsty/"}
