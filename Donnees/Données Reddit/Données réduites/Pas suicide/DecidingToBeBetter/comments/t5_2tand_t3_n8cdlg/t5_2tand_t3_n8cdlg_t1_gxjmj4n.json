It haunts me, honestly. But I know they love me, and it\u2019s never been spoken but I do feel forgiven. I\u2019ve been in therapy as an adult and my therapist has pushed me to forgive myself for these things, too. I\u2019m not there completely, but I\u2019m working on it. I hope you can forgive yourself too, OP. We are not necessarily good or bad people because of these things, we are just people who have done both good and bad things.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8cdlg/it_took_watching_old_home_videos_to_realize_just/gxjmj4n/"}
