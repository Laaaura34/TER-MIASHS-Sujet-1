In 12-step work, step 8, i write don the names of people i hurt and how I hurt them. In Step 9, I wrote letters or called the people I hurt.\n\nI acknowledge that I am now aware of my previous behaviour and how I hurt them, I admit that I am responsible, and i apologize sincerely. I am not allowed to ask for forgiveness- that's up tot he recipient of my letter.\n\nSome people respond with forgiveness and acknowledgement that I am trying to change and be a better person. Some do not respond well at all. My job is to make the amend.\n\nYou're lucky and wise to see yourself clearly in retrospect. It is a gift that can help you change if you wish, and perhaps not to late to reach out to those people. With my step 9 letters, I wrote first to the people who meant the most to me, who I wanted in my life and who I wanted to know that I was working hard to change and be better. Many people on my list I cannot find anymore, and I do 'working amends', being a better person, donating to specific charities to support the type of person I hurt.\n\nCongratulations of finding your character flaw- this is a gift, and usually, i think people who are outside of recovery programs do not get this kind of insight into themselves.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8cdlg/it_took_watching_old_home_videos_to_realize_just/gxkn59h/"}
