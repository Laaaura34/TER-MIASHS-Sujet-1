I know some things have gotten worse for teen but I do feel like in general a lot of unhealthy behaviors are talked about more openly. It was very cool when I was a teen girl to not be friends with teen girls the media aimed at me was always showing that it was \u201ccool\u201d to be friends with boys and \u201cgirls were drama\u201d I see how wrong that is as I\u2019ve gotten older and I\u2019m sad I didn\u2019t have healthy female friendships when I was younger (happy to report I have them now)  and I see so much more attention in teen shows to show support girl friends and kindness. So it\u2019s not an excuse of any of our past behavior but maybe some reasoning behind it that we can acknowledge.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8cdlg/it_took_watching_old_home_videos_to_realize_just/gxiaj4s/"}
