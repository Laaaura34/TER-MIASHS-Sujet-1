My middle sister is undiagnosed but nuerodivergent. I was terrible to her. We got in fights often, leading to me hurting her, throwing things, intentionally pestering her. I thought she was always being a baby. I did not understand that her brain processes things differently than me. I was selfish and rude and hurtful. I also feel a lot of shame from that part in my life. \nToday we both understand eachother a lot better, but it took me actually being a good person for her to feel comfortable around me. And that takes time. No one is born knowing all things. But the fact you learned of your past behavior and want a better future means you can start the process. \nApologize, ask for forgiveness, whatever. But always understand, not everyone else is going to understand you either. Give them time and space to figure it out. My sister and I are close now, and I make an effort to get into things she enjoys and help her with college homework that makes almost no sense to me. She is bright and kind and very very passionate. And I'm glad I am able to talk to her now. \nGood luck on your journey of self discovery. Don't let shame hold you down. It does no good to your brain if you don't move past it. I'm sending ALL the good vibes my dude. You got this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8cdlg/it_took_watching_old_home_videos_to_realize_just/gxi8de6/"}
