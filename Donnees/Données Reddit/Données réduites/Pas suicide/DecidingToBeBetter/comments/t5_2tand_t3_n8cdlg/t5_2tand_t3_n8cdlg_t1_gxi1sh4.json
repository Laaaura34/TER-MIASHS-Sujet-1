It didn't start with you. We often overlook our parents as being the source of how we behave as children, as if a child gets to decide how they're programed, but it isn't so. As a survivor of child neglect, I look back at those times when I was mean and \"bossy\" to my friends and realize that my parents were rarely present. I was shown behaviors that perpetuated my own. If you were mean as a child, even if your parents were \"nice\", they didn't teach you or react to your behavior in a way that would have enabled you to make better choices. And I know this from watching my friends parent their own children, who interact with other people in the most kind and loving of ways, all because their parents are present enough to help them along the way. So do not blame yourself- you deserve love and compassion. That kid who was being mean deserves love and compassion, because they were acting out for a reason.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8cdlg/it_took_watching_old_home_videos_to_realize_just/gxi1sh4/"}
