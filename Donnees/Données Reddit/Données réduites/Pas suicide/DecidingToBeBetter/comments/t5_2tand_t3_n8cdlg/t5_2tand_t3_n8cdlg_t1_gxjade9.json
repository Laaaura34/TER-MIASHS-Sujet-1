I would belittle him in front of his friends, he would introduce me to people as the spawn of Satan, it was all in good friends. We get along. But we're not...*close,* really. I feel like if either of us was to bare our soul to the other, it would be out of a lack of other options as opposed to feeling like we're the people who can really emotionally rely on one another. \n\nThe thing is, for the people who might have felt you were mean or unfair to them through the years, hearing you recognize, acknowledge, and apologize for that yourself can be a cathartic experience. It may not mean that they'll trust you immediately, but acknowledging to someone that you've wronged them and apologizing can help rebuild the bridges you may have unintentionally burned. There is a path to recovery and you've already taken the most important step: self-awareness.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8cdlg/it_took_watching_old_home_videos_to_realize_just/gxjade9/"}
