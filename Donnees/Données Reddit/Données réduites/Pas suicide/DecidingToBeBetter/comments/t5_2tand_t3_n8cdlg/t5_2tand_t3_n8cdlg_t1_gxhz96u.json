And if not that, then the person is in a state of being unaware of their impact -- not meaning as bad as their actions may have actually been.\n\nSome bullies aren't aware that what they're doing is bullying. I remember one time in 8th grade, one of the kids in my core friend group was going to have a get-together, and he specifically didn't want me to come. That kinda hurt my feelings; did he just not like me for no reason? Looking back... I had been making fun of his last name a couple weeks earlier. Pointing out how it rhymed with a Pokemon, specifically, and calling him that Pokemon down the hallway. I was just playing around because I thought it was harmless fun, not realizing he may have felt more bad from it than I realized, even when he clearly wasn't amused.\n\nAnyway, maybe you can give yourself that you were coming from a place that meant well, or at least didn't intend to be as mean as you might've been. This is probably the part where you'll need to start forgiving yourself for that kinda stuff. Therapists might help if you aren't already doing that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8cdlg/it_took_watching_old_home_videos_to_realize_just/gxhz96u/"}
