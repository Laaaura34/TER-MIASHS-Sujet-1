We have an 8 year age difference and I was left to care for him when I was 12 and up while our mother went and got fucked up all the time. He didn't respect me like an adult so I resorted to being an asshole to get him to listen to me.  I regret it so bad. We just got drunk together as adults for the first time about a week ago and we laughed as friends. We aren't totally repaired yet, but he explicitly told me that if I keep doing what I'm doing, we'll be as close as I want to be. It's never too late to do the right thing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8cdlg/it_took_watching_old_home_videos_to_realize_just/gxiikus/"}
