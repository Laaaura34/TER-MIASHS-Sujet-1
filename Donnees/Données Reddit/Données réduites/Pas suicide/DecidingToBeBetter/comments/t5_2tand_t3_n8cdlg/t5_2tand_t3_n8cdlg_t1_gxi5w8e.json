Between all of us, it was an on-going contest to see who could come up with the biggest zinger to get the other ones.  Naturally, this \"game\" carried over into real life.   When I was in college, my father came to me for a little chat.  He made the observation that as a family we were sarcastic as fuck and that I seemed to take the game to, as he says, \"a never before, unseen level\".  He had noticed my sarcasm, combined with an ability to spot a person's insecurities or weaknesses, was a deadly combination.  He then proceeded to tell me a story about how he learned the hard way that not everyone treated insults the way we do.  He told me a story about how he was in a bar in college where he got into a verbal duel with some stranger, think the bar take down scene in Good Will Hunting.   The more insults he threw, the louder the cheers were.  By the end he said he left the other guy a \"sniveling mess on the floor\" and felt pretty good about having won the battle of wits.  He walked out with his best friend who turned and looked at him and said \"sfjc's dad, you are such an asshole!\" and was completely serious.  It was at that point, Dad had a light bulb moment and realized words can really hurt people.  Between that story and a few \"asshole\" moments myself, I realized how right he was.  Since then, I've learned if you use your words towards situations or things, most people will genuinely laugh along with you but if you use it towards other people real damage can be done.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8cdlg/it_took_watching_old_home_videos_to_realize_just/gxi5w8e/"}
