There's a saying I like, that I think is appropriate for something like this, \"no on can go back and make a perfect past, but they can create better future.\"  Something like that anyway.\nFor years, I was overly sensitive, highly judgemental, sarcastic smart ass, selfish, easily frustrated, and self-centered. I was like that into my 30's.  Then for some reason I saw myself, looked around, it appeared/felt like I was walking in one direction in life and everyone else appeared to be walking in the opposite direction, it's a very lonely place.  And that was a turning point to realize I need to change, not everyone else. Have I done it perfectly? Not by a long shot, but I know it's better. Now from what you said, it sounds like you recognize the traits you want to address, it could be an opportunity for you to do something different and change.  It might take awhile or it may never happen, that those relationships are mended.  If you want to mend and nurture those relationships, you'll have a lot of work ahead of you, but it won't be drudgery.  You may have to feel some discomfort by being vulnerable and biting a tongue  or too. However, the discomfort will be the worth effort of mended relationships and new relationships better.  If you want to change it's not too late.  I'll go out on a limb and say it's never too late to change. Of course it all depends if you want to change.  Either way, cheers and good luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8cdlg/it_took_watching_old_home_videos_to_realize_just/gxjb08w/"}
