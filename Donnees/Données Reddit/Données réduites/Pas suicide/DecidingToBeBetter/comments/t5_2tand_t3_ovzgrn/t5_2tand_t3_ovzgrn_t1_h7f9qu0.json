I feel stuck in my life and I\u2019m trying to focus on good things, but that mid-20s identity crisis is real. My parents are Asian immigrants, so the \u201ckeep your head low and keep working\u201d is a BIG thing. I have a therapist, wnd slowly have been working on being kinder to myself. A big thing that helped me is not moving all my fulfillment into work \u2014 I have hobbies, my biggest is swimming. But it\u2019s hard because I\u2019m unsure if I will ever find happiness in work.
