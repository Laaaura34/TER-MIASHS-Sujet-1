Stretch, get some play time in with the cat, drink a large bottle of water, then go for a walk. Coffee, breakfast, and reading when I get back, then some meditation and journaling. Usually done and ready for the rest of the day by 7.\n\nI vary it up occasionally, but most mornings run like that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/4tw6ci/what_are_the_three_most_beneficial_morning/d5l9trc/"}
