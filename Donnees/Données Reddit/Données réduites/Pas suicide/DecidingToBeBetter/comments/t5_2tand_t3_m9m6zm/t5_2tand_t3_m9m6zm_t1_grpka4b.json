Since I have given myself permission, I don\u2019t feel deprived, but a lot of the time I forget about it and don\u2019t have a second serving, or if I do it\u2019s many hours later, and again, it\u2019s only a single serving. \n\nAlso, I track all my food BEFORE I eat it. So that serving size, I put it in a bowl, and then I add the calories in my app, and THEN I eat it. I do currently have rough calorie goals, but when I started I never did, I could eat as much as I wanted, I just had to log it first. The act of having to log your food is a great motivator to NOT have a 3rd helping of ice cream. I found I ate a lot less just by being mindful of what I was actually eating, and seeing it all itemized and added up. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find your own things too. Ultimately though, you do have to WANT to put in the effort, it really does get easier after a few weeks of staying consistent.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m9m6zm/how_to_eliminate_the_bad_habit_of_not_overeat/grpka4b/"}
