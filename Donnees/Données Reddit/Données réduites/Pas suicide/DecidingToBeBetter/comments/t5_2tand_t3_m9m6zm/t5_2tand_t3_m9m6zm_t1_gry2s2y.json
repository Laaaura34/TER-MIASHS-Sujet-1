But I would go into the kitchen and pick up a snack and then put it down and walk away from it. I knew I wasn't hungry and just the act of putting it down and walking away was a huge confidence booster for me. \n\nI will *sometimes* offer myself a compromise treat (usually something like a couple crackers or 3-4 chocolate covered almonds) something itty bitty so I can still feel like I had a treat, but not enough to make me feel bad about it. But if you don't think you can control that yet, don't try it yet.\n\nI hope this helps!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m9m6zm/how_to_eliminate_the_bad_habit_of_not_overeat/gry2s2y/"}
