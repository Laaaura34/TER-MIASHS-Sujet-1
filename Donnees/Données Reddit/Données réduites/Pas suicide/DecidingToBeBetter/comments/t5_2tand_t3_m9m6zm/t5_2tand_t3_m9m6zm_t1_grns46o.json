Cutting back on sugar definitely helped curb my cravings and allowed me to eat less. The other thing I found very helpful was trying to get 2 cups of water in during dinner. Dinner was consistently the meal I would overeat in, so trying to finish 2 cups of water allowed me to feel full after 1 plate. I used to eat around 2/2.5 plates on average. Hope this helps! \nOoh one last tip, always look at the nutrition facts. I\u2019m someone who absolutely loves numbers/data, so looking at that allowed me to learn what was acceptable to eat and how much to eat. I used to finish an entire row of Oreos myself, but now I limit myself to a cookie or two when I\u2019m craving a snack.\n\nOoh aside from the food tips, what\u2019s your sleep schedule like? When my sleep is out of funk, I\u2019m prone to overeating.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m9m6zm/how_to_eliminate_the_bad_habit_of_not_overeat/grns46o/"}
