When I\u2019m feeling down or overwhelmed or stressed, etc it\u2019s usually because I\u2019m trying to fulfill higher needs while neglecting lower ones. \n\nJust learning to prioritize sleep, has helped. I *get* to enjoy it without feeling guilty. Finding ways to \u201cgamify\u201d needs has helped too. Having to beat \u201ceach level\u201d before moving on makes it fun. Finding ways to make it silly or playful. Get a fun blanket. Fuzzy socks. A sleep mask. \n\nonly drink water from fun cups with cartoon characters. Etc.\n\nObviously what works for me might not be what works for you. But ultimately finding ways to make the haveto-s in life playful and pleasant will go a long way. \n\nBut also I try not to be in denial about the bad. Doing the fun thing *in spite of* the sucky stuff is what makes it help. \n\nSome of the pop-psychology surrounding inner child stuff isnt always helpful. But there is truth in finding and embracing the child like parts of yourself. Try to remember a hobby or game from childhood. Build a fort in your living room and only eat dinosaur chicken nuggets. \n\nPrioritize yourself, no one else can or will. It really takes being intentional about finding what you enjoy because after childhood we\u2019re taught to leave play behind. \n\n\nALSO, don\u2019t do it alone. If you have access and the means, a good therapist can do wonders", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pgr8sa/what_to_do_if_you_dont_want_to_live/hbdt6nn/"}
