You\u2019re right. It\u2019s starting to feel better to know that I can let all of that go. \nMy mom had a stroke when I was born and my parents and sister openly blamed me. Around age 30 my dad took me to Burger King and once again told me that he hasn\u2019t had sex since I was born because I paralyzed my mom. He was dead serious and angry at me with us as grown men.\n\nI imagine it must have felt nice to be able to assert control of your life at 17. I have disabilities like mild Tourette\u2019s (I can hide my tics) and adhd. I can manage those but it takes a toll over time and while I can do some things really well I sometimes struggle with self esteem. I\u2019m working on it and trying to be patient. \nYou\u2019re very kind to take the time to write. I really appreciate it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pgr8sa/what_to_do_if_you_dont_want_to_live/hc9nkwv/"}
