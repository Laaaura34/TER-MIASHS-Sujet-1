Think of the people who are the very neediest and volunteer. The best way to get the fuck out of your own head, is to see/help others less fortunate than yourself.  Also, this is not about guilting anyone; but it serves two goals: 1. Getting some perspective  2. (More importantly) You're actually helping another human being. \n\nThe act of taking the focus off yourself, and actively participating in helping another being, is healing. I don't exactly why, but it has worked for me.\n\nHope this helps:)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pgr8sa/what_to_do_if_you_dont_want_to_live/hbegu91/"}
