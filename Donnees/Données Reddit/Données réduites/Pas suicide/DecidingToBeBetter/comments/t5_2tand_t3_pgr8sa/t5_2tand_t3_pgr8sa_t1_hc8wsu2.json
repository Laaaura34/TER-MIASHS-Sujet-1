Also, my mother wouldn\u2019t let me do chores. She always said I do them wrong. Once I washed the dishes for her. She made me go back into the cupboard and put them all back I. The sink. She said there\u2019s no way I could have done them right. \nThat\u2019s silly since I used to wash dishes at a cafe and I\u2019m a college grad I can handle dishes!! \nAnyway, at 19 I would escape a lot into RPG\u2019s haha! Good call. \nEventually, I was sick of wasting time playing video games with nothing to show for it.\n\nI started to take long walks, I forced myself to hang out with people even if I was being boring, and I began to play music and read a lot. That\u2019s when I went to college. When I started doing well there I think my family had some fantasy that doing well in college means you will do well in the outside world. I repeatedly reminded them that it\u2019s a free market out there and there\u2019s no guarantees. \nMy films had played on television and at festivals. My dad started to try to micromanage my life and I was a really solitary person with my work and emotions. He really didn\u2019t understand the work I was doing nor did he seem to care about my health. \nEventually he started to get mad at me. I came home to find all my equipment trashed and my clothes outside in the backyard. Everything else I ever owned since I was a child including my class ring were thrown into the alley. \n\nI was absolutely too old to be living at home but it was 2009 and the freelance jobs started to disappear. I couldn\u2019t afford to move out and that was very shameful to them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pgr8sa/what_to_do_if_you_dont_want_to_live/hc8wsu2/"}
