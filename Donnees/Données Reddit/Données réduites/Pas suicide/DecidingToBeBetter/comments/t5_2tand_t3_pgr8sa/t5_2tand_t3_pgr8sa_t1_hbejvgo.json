When I went through what you are going through I changed it up. No one can solve it for you, no prescription (critical depression is different and that needs professional diagnosis), advice nor person can solve for what you feel. It\u2019s in the head. It\u2019s not wrong or meaningless, it\u2019s just there. A demon. But you can avoid it. It takes a little effort but getting away from it makes a lot of difference. Maybe that demon hangs with a friend or at a place. Start to distance yourself from that. You don\u2019t have to abandon that space, but create a distance and see how you feel. Think about why you feel that. \n\nFor me, self evaluation when taking a walk. A two hour walk when no one was around was really helpful. No distractions and an opportunity to ask my self why. It\u2019s okay to say this is dumb to feel this way but why is it there? It\u2019s not a scientific exercise just a silent exploration. \nFeelings are valid but the hope of being better is motivating.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pgr8sa/what_to_do_if_you_dont_want_to_live/hbejvgo/"}
