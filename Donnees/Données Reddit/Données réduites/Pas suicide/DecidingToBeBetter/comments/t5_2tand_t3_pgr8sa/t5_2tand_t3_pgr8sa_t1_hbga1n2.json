There were points in progression that I wanted things to get \"better\" quicker, but I would remind myself that it took 40 years to dig this hole, it could very well take another 40 to climb out. The important thing to focus on wasn't the top of the pit, rather where I was and the the next foothold I was going to go for. Know that up, is up, but don't break your neck trying to fixate on it.\n\nI'm not sure the phrase \"time heals\" is completely true, but rather \"healing takes time.\" If time itself healed we'd just have to sit around long enough to be better. That's just never going to happen, but I highly encourage everyone to see time NOT as the enemy or something to be dreaded, but rather a companion that's going to walk along side of life with you, through the good and bad. Time is going to be there at your side through the best and very worse, so if you want to be a little bit happier learn to love yourself and time both, be compassionate with yourself and time, learn to forgive yourself and time. It's not your enemy it's your life long companion. Don't wait for the Right Time to start living, to start loving, Make this time your time to live and love.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pgr8sa/what_to_do_if_you_dont_want_to_live/hbga1n2/"}
