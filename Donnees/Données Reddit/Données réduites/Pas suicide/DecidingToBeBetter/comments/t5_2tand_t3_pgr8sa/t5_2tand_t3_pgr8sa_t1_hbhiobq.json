I used to be in the same situation as you; I sat down and thought a lot of life itself. \n\nLife can be a cruel thing, ultimately bittersweet. But there\u2019s beauty in it too. I think what really got me going was my fascination for it. I had started gardening to treat my depression and anxiety, and one thing that amazed me was how much a plant is dying, it still keeps fighting to survive. And if it does, it supplies nutrition for the next plant. It\u2019s the cycle of life that interested me, and growing things like flowers brightened up my life a bit. \n\nStart small. Smell a rose that smells like perfume, listen to music that makes you happy, see the small acts of kindness in this cruel world, feel the warm sun on a cool day, eat something you enjoy. \n\nIt\u2019s the small things in life to enjoy. Hang in there dude, you can do it!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pgr8sa/what_to_do_if_you_dont_want_to_live/hbhiobq/"}
