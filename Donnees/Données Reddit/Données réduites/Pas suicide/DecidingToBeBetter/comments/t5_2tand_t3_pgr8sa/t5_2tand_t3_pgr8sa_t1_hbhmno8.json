Not like sit down with someone because you have something to say. I went to therapy for years and years and years. Finally someone recommended me a good book and we worked on it. It was a long time coming for me to finally get through a bunch of therapy books but after this therapist recommended a good book for me and had less lectures on the agenda it kind of just worked. I would explain more but I feel ill get a lecture lol I didn\u2019t pay for my therapy. At any rate, therapy isn\u2019t the same for everyone but it\u2019s going to work and for me I needed to change therapists a few times.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pgr8sa/what_to_do_if_you_dont_want_to_live/hbhmno8/"}
