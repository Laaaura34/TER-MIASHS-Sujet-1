Those situations really suck, especially back-to-back. Totally understandable how you could lose motivation after all that.\n\nMy first suggestion would be: seek therapy/counseling. I was in about an ongoing 4 year slump due to the passing of a friend, marriage stuff, and a business deal gone wrong.

I used [psychologytoday.com](https://psychologytoday.com) to find a therapist in my area.\n\nAlso, if I may, I would suggest checking your drinking habits immediately. Drinking is allowing you to remove yourself from having to work through the issues at hand. I drank heavily for the last four years, and once I started taking time off of it, I was painstaking starting to understand the steps I needed to take to find peace.
