I went through a really similar experience (no kid though), and honestly your experience was my horror story, I prayed something wouldn't happen to my parents next. I'm really sorry you had to go through that, but I'm glad you're doing good though!\n\nI just pulled myself back up a month-ish ago, and honestly it was the same thing. I'm going to be the best, strongest, smartest motherfucker I can be and let the results do the talking.\n\nI'm not going to lie though, I know the importance of giving myself time to heal up and become whole again, but I there are times I really want to be with someone.
