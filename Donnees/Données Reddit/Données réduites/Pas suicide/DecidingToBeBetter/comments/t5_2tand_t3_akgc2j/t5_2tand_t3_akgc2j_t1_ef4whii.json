Spite is not something healthy to live with for your life but when you use it to inspire you, those actions become habits and by the time you accept what happened and move past it, you have made some killer habits. \n\nJust remember who you are. Have pride in your families last name. Focus on your long term goals and fucking crush them. Eat the weak and own your destiny.
