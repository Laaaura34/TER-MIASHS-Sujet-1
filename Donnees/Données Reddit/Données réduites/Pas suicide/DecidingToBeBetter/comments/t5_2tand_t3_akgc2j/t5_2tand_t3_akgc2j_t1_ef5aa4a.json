I got broken up with from a nearly 3 year relationship and almost a year later, I still feel upset by it, and I put myself in another relationship with someone amazing. But it doesn't mean I can't feel all these good and bad things at the same time. Went to some counseling and realized with their help that I am allowed to feel what I feel. My feelings are real and have an impact on me. YOU are allowed to feel your feelings and let them happen as well. YOU are allowed to be upset about what happened, and you never have to be okay about it, but what you do after  is what matters. You have to be comfortable with the new uncertainty in your life.\n\nWith help of a book called Unfuck your life, I've been seeing things a lot clearer and it's been helping me not be so hard on myself and what I feel. I suggest you pick it up at the bookstore. It's not going to hurt you by reading it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/akgc2j/34m_i_have_no_idea_what_i_should_be_doing_with_my/ef5aa4a/"}
