A bit of dizziness and lightheadedness in the first week. People talk about the sexual side effects of Lexapro including not being able to reach a climax (for males). This isn\u2019t the case with me although it has increased the amount of time it takes for me to climax, and hey I\u2019m not complaining about that!! \nI can compare this with first hand experience on Effexor, which for me had terrible side effects and didn\u2019t seem to fix my depression.
