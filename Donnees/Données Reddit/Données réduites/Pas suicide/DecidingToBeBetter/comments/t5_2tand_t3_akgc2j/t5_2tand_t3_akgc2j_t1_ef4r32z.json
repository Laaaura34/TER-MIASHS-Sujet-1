Read it and try it out for three months. When your life is better help the next guy who needs it. Other online philosophers that might help are Sam Harris, Patrick Bet David.\n\nI also have a book my grandfather gave me called As a Man Thinketh. It\u2019s by James Allen and it\u2019s my  favorite book to read when I find myself somewhere I don\u2019t like in my life. \n\nNever give up. Shoot for small incremental improvements and start being a hero. Volunteer, take on work and make something of yourself.
