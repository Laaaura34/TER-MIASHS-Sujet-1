I recommend you read 'Hippie', it's the closest thing that he has to an autobiography. It explains a lot of what inspired him to write The Alchemist. I read his books to feel more in touch with myself (and hell he's helping me believe in god) and I love to see so many people who find wisdom in his prose.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ll2sqd/my_journey_a_letter_to_paulo_coelho/gnnllf2/"}
