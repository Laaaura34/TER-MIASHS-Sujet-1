Like you, the books came into my life at times that felt so serendipitous and meaningful. I started with The Alchemist, enjoying the story and the illustration of what life can look like when you follow your heart. But I wanted to know more about the author and the wellspring of wisdom he shared, so I read Aleph and The Pilgrimage. Several years on, I too am still seeking, still have periods in which I feel lost, direction-less, and insecure. But the common thread I see among Paulo Coelho's books, as the tag on this post so aptly indicates, is that life is about the journey. The journey of self discovery and personal growth through our joys and sorrows, triumphs and failures. Our individual evolution and the pursuit of the embodiment of our personal power need not be measured in accomplishments but in the showing up for life--meeting life where we are and changing both it and ourselves in the process. Keep on keeping on; we're in this together.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ll2sqd/my_journey_a_letter_to_paulo_coelho/gnnl5ii/"}
