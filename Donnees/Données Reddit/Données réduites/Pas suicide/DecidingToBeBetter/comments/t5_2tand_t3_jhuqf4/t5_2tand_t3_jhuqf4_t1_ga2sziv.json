I'm 25 and I love it. No hangovers, getting to do early morning yoga/exercise, watching the sunrise, no blackouts and not knowing what is going on, saving money, remembering all the great times I've had with friends and family, and so many other great things! \n\nMillie Gooch is a millennial who is sober and I absolutely love her Instagram! She started this \"Sober Girl Society\" and just talks about her journey to sobriety. She never was a full-blown alcoholic who had to go to rehab. She just gave up casual, weekend drinking as well. \n\nPlease DM me if you need any help!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jhuqf4/i_think_im_gonna_give_up_drinking_last_night_was/ga2sziv/"}
