It is easily the best thing I've ever done in my life. It's a superpower. \n\nI read another commenter on here saying that you have to commit and not to \"try\". I disagree. \n\nGive it a month off alcohol and see how you feel. Then try for 3 months. \n\nOver the last 3 years I have done 3 month stints every year. It got better each time. \n\nIt was hard for me to come to terms with \"forever\" early on. But now I wholeheartedly embrace it. \n\nYou are showing signs of problem drinking and it's possible that if you continue to drink you'll be in a bad place by the time you're my age. Problem drinking is really common. \n\nBeing sober is rare. It's actually a super power in my opinion! Everything got better for me. I got leaner, stronger, more confident, more focused, less anxious, better at my work, hobbies and relationships. \n\nI highly recommend checking out the book \"this naked mind\" by Annie Grace. You can also get it on audible. Changed my life. \n\nGood luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jhuqf4/i_think_im_gonna_give_up_drinking_last_night_was/ga55vlr/"}
