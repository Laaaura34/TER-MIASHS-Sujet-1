I\u2019ve been homeless numerous times, rehab twice, lost friends due to drugs, suicide and violence.  I played drums in touring bands, so it was my lifestyle, my pipeline to friends and inclusion.  I\u2019m on my third sober stint and this one is sticking.  I am back in school and getting my degree.  DONT go down this road....I have a chronic illness due to excessive consumption of bad substances.  Sometimes I can\u2019t eat food no matter how much I want to, when my illness is flaring up.\n\nWas it fun?! Hell yes.  But it always gets worse and it happens FAST.  Really fast.  Next thing you know, you\u2019re waking up in your own piss in someone\u2019s bed and don\u2019t remember why.\n\nAnd when your \u201cfriends\u201d finally stop the madness and clean up, or die, you\u2019re left at a crossroads.  Sometimes the path is longer for people but it\u2019s literally life or death when you cannot stop by choice.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jhuqf4/i_think_im_gonna_give_up_drinking_last_night_was/ga45rq3/"}
