With my boyfriend and his friends. We went to a bar, I was dancing with a girl having a good time then nothing. I don\u2019t remember a thing till we got home and I threw an ugly tantrum and tried to leave him. No I don\u2019t actually want to leave him. The first thing I did was tell him I\u2019m done drinking and commit to going to therapy. There is a reason I drink to excess, to forget and to not take responsibility for shit I say or do. He\u2019s nice enough to stay with me even though I know I wasn\u2019t nice to him that night. I owe it to him and most importantly to myself to change. \n\nThat night was the first night in months I\u2019ve drank like that. But it\u2019s so easy to fall back into that pattern if you\u2019re not careful \u201cOh I was good for so long I can binge\u201d. \nIt\u2019s not easy and I still have moments of \u201coh I can go have a beer with friends\u201d fact is I absolutely cannot. Until you address some of the reasons that you drink so heavily and cannot stop, you should stay away from alcohol. It is a destructive force.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jhuqf4/i_think_im_gonna_give_up_drinking_last_night_was/ga3gxss/"}
