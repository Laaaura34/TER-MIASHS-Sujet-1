I don\u2019t see my friends at all and the only friends I hang out with are my bf and his parents and siblings. I guess I do it because they do it, I never used to drink this much before. His parents are party people and I guess I do it to have fun. My boyfriend never drinks anymore because he\u2019s too busy with law school work in the evenings, and I hang out with his parents to keep busy till he\u2019s done his work. I\u2019ll stick to water and carbonated water from now on I think. I\u2019ve been working out daily and being hungover really puts a damper on my fitness.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jhuqf4/i_think_im_gonna_give_up_drinking_last_night_was/ga379ga/"}
