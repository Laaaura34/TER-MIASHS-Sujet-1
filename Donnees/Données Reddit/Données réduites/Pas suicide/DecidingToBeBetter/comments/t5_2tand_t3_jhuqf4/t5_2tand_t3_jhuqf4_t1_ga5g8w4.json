You just need to find balance and a healthy way to deal with it. If someone offers you shots, say no. Show some self esteem and oppose an offering if necessary. Nobody will be effected negatively when you drink a glass of wine or 2 for dinner. You just need to keep it under control. If not, chances are good you\u00b4ll lose your boyfriend soon, because if he is into studying law, he won\u00b4t be happy hanging around with a drunk.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jhuqf4/i_think_im_gonna_give_up_drinking_last_night_was/ga5g8w4/"}
