You are very young, and 2. Shots are an objectively terrible way to drink, especially for women with low alcohol tolerance. I am a middle aged woman with rather higher tolerance (not really something to brag about, just longer experience) and I remember clearly the point several years ago when I realized that shots are just never a good idea for me. They're a fast track to the worst parts of being drunk, and unfortunately the people who like to do shots for some reason always want to get everyone else to do shots with them. Just NOPE never shots for me. Wine, beer, or a mixed drink, and not chosen to be the strongest possible thing, either.\n\nYou should absolutely take a break to get a handle on what you want from alcohol, but you might well find that you can enjoy the pleasurable parts of moderate alcohol consumption (taste, conviviality) by having one or two drinks, with or before meals, that you're enjoying for the taste rather than just to get fucked up. The fact that you got fucked up from doing shots does not mean you are doomed to a drinking problem. You still can choose to drink the way you want to (assuming you don't have a personal or family history of dependence). Or never drink again, that's fine too, but that's not the only option here.  And I'm sorry your boyfriend's parents seem to still be in that \"let's get fucked up\" mindset, because those people are actually not much fun to drink with.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jhuqf4/i_think_im_gonna_give_up_drinking_last_night_was/ga34l8v/"}
