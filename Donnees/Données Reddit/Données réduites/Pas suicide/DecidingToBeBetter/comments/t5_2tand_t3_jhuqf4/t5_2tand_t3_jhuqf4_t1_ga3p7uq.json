This may be the case for OP and if that is so then she shouldn\u2019t drink. However, I\u2019m also a 23 year old light weight that used to get blackout drunk every time I drank even though that was not my goal and I blame it on shots! My friends and I would drink straight from the bottle with chaser and it always ended badly for me. Now I don\u2019t drink most days but when I do I stick to beer, wine, or an occasional mixed drink. It works to do that for me, but it is different for everyone so if she can\u2019t just stick to beer and wine and pace herself then she probably had a drinking problem and should stop.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jhuqf4/i_think_im_gonna_give_up_drinking_last_night_was/ga3p7uq/"}
