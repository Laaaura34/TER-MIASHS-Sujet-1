Make it public. Tell everyone what you're doing. Set a reward for completing it and a punishment for failing. Get your b/f to hold you to account if you fail.\n\nYou can use a website like Stickk to set a public challenge with accountability built in and set your bf or someone else trusted referee, for example if you fail you donate $100 to a political party you hate (because no one wants to do that and it'll stop you from giving in).\n\nAnd be prepared for the challenges by thinking in advance what situations, moods, events etc are going to happen or might happen that could lead to you drinking and how you'll deal with them / what you'll do instead rather than falling into the usual habit of drinking. \n\nIf you want to be sociable whilst others are drinking then swap your alcohol for alcohol free drinks (there are endless alcohol free beers, wine, and even spirits these days)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jhuqf4/i_think_im_gonna_give_up_drinking_last_night_was/ga69c9u/"}
