I felt like I wasted half a year and lots of money for nothing. But hey, I know it's gonna take lots of time again, but it's going to be nice to meet someone else and see their methods or way of thinking. Who knows, you might end up with someone you'll really vibe with :) I hope you'll find the best therapist for you out there", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3h0vh/my_therapist_is_breaking_up_with_me/hfslbi1/"}
