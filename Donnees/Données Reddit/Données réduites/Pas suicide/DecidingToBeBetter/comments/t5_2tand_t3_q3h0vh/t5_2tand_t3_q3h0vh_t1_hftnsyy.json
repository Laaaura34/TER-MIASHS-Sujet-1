Try Open Path Collective. There\u2019s a one time lifetime fee of $59 but after that, you\u2019re welcome to search for a therapist that fits your needs. Many offer virtual counseling in lieu of in person. It\u2019s also sliding scale from $30-$80 depending who see and what you can afford. I\u2019ve found 2 therapists and narrowing down which one I want to see long term. I didn\u2019t like betterhelp. I found it to be pretty expensive and the quality of therapists on there were questionable.
