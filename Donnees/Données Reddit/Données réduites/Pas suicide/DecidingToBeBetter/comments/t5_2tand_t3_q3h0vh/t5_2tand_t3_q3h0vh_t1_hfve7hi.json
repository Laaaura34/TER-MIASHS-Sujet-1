I did not have good experiences with therapy, or any mental health practitioners really, until I left the south. I hope you\u2019re able to find someone who will work for you ! I check out mental health pages on Instagram and Pinterest when I can\u2019t get into therapy. Of course some are bullshit, but as someone who has been to therapy before you can generally tell the good from the bad. I do this to help me remember some of the tips and coping practices I\u2019ve learned in therapy but can\u2019t always think of in the stressful moments.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3h0vh/my_therapist_is_breaking_up_with_me/hfve7hi/"}
