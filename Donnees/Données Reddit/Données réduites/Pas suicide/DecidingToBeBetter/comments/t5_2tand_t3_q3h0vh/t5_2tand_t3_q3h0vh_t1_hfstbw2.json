This HAPPENED TO ME TOO! \n\nEarlier this year, right after my girlfriend broke up with me, my old therapist I saw again decided to break up with me shortly after, and my old BEST friend decided to break up with me (she got back together with her husband and apparently secretly loved me or something so couldn't even be my friend).\n\nIt was some of the biggest BS at once I've ever gotten, but then my therapist told me \"Well I won't just stop seeing you we'll phase it out but I am doing something else now\" and it went fine but still at the time it felt like everything was crashing down.\n\nTrust me, you'll find someone new and good. I found a guy who I was like \"hmmm do I really trust/like him\" and now he's helped me quite a bit so don't worry about it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3h0vh/my_therapist_is_breaking_up_with_me/hfstbw2/"}
