Making plans from a place where life has become burdensome may cause you further challenges down the road.  \n\nEven if medicine is not your ultimate path,  it's where you are now,  and the things that you accomplish along that journey will be valuable in infinite ways throughout your life.  \nThere are always options between the extremes.  In this case,  between grinding away at a profession you're uninterested in and returning home to unemployment.  You've looked into computer science (where your medical experience gives you a leg up professionally in medical software development),  there are probably other ways that you can solve your current dilemma that will hurt less than the two options you've outlined.  \nBe kind to yourself.  You are not the first person to find yourself thinking like you do,  others have had the exact same dilemma, and survived the experience.    \nSpeaking as someone who is a professional  computer programmer,  there is also a constant need to stay up on current technology and it is a treadmill for sure.  I estimate I spend ten hours a week just focusing on emerging tools in my field - over and above a 60 hour work-week.  If that's not satisfactory for you, there are better, more static fields to try out.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/poqw32/28_years_old_and_in_need_of_life_advice/hcyspup/"}
