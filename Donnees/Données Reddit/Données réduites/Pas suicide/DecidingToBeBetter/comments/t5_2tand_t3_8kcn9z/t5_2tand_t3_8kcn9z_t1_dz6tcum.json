I didn\u2019t see much about the \u2018why\u2019. \n\nIt sounds like you use these things to get a temporary high / numb yourself from your emotions which is an escape from feeling shitty feelings. I know because I used to also do this but I would drink. The downside of the highs / numbs is the crash when it wears off. It drops your mood to a lower level than when you started and keeps dropping with each crash. I\u2019m no doctor but I think it has to do with serotonin levels. So now your non-medicated norm is at a much lower start point than where it was before the highs. It\u2019s a gradual thing too so you don\u2019t notice you are dropping into depression. All that to say, yes, stop the numbing and replace them with something healthy (exercise, hobbies, meditation as mentioned). When you have a clear head, you\u2019ll be able to handle the relationship issues with your friends better and hopefully find the strength to break out and find new friends. \n\nAs you said, you\u2019ve been in this same rut for two years and you want to get out. You can\u2019t keep doing what you\u2019ve been doing since you are in the same rut. Time to make bigger changes and pull yourself out. It takes willpower and courage but you can do it. Coming here and chatting with us is a good first step! Looking forward to your updates, telling us how you are making changes. We are all pulling for you!
