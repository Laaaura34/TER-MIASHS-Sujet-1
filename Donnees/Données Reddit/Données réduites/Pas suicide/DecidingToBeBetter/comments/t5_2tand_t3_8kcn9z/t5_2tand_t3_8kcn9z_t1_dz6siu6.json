At 15, I think the word you're looking for is *prologue*.  \n\nFor the rest, there's the same thing as other folks:\n\n*   Set goals, pursue goals.  Give yourself some 6 month plans (i will learn mumbly peg.  i will learn to play piano).  and consider the frame of mind - this isn't learning *hobbies*, this is a goal of learning a couple things.  Then give yourself some 3 or 5 year goals - which i'll admit would likely be very tough at your age. \n* little mediocre steps forward every day will outstrip \"obsessive spurts\" of interest.   Pick the mumbly peg - you gofull bore for 3 hours a day for a a month and a half and you'll end up with holes in your feets and hands.  period.   *And* you'll likely quite long before then.  you do 10 minutes a dayfor a month and a half and you'll make some incredibly solid progress and not really impale yourself at all. \n * /r/theXeffect \n\n\nGood Luck.
