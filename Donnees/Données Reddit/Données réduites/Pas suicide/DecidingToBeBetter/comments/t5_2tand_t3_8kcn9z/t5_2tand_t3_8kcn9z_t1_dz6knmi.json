It would have affected a lot of things.\n\nIt helps you understand your mind better, and changes the relationship you have with your thoughts and your emotions. Amongst other benefits.\n\nI'm 23, and started meditating about 21. No exaggeration: it has changed my life.\n\nWish I was introduced to it when I was about 11.\n\nYou might wonder what sitting in silence with your eyes closed might achieve. You also might wonder that it's a bit strange how a lot of people swear by meditation.\n\nConsider giving it a go. Happy to recommend resources / give advice.\n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8kcn9z/im_currently_15_years_old_and_im_really_confused/dz6knmi/"}
