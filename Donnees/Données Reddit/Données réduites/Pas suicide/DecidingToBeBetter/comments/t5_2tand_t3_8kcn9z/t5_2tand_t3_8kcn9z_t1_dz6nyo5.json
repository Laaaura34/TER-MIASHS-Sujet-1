I had these feelings before I was a teenager up until I was in my late 20's. What changed it for me was growing up. Turning 18 is not growing up. Growing up, in my opinion, is not depending on anyone for anything. I always felt like shit because I lived with my parents or was bumming money to get by to the next paycheck. \n\nPut the cigs away, use the weed recreationally, get a job and start thinking about your future. No college? Nothing wrong with that. Find something you enjoy that makes you enough money to rely on no one and grow up. Shut off the internet for a month and see how you feel. don't compare your life to other people's lives on social media or the internet, build your own life and enjoy it.
