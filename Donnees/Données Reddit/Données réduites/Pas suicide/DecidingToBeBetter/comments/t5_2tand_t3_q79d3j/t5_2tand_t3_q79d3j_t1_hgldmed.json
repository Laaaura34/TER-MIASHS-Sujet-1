If people are not adding to your life then there's a change to be made. I did the same with my old friend group because they simply were not on my level in any way and that's fine because that's their own personal journey to go on.

Wishing you the best on your healing journey.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q79d3j/the_key_to_self_improvement_is_learning_to_be/hgldmed/"}
