I know plenty of people that are productive stoners. (I'm not one of them lol) \n\nYour mentality isn't black and white based on marijuana btw. \n\nI'm in a similar situation but I smoke maybe once a month, on special occasions. \n\nI think occasional use helps me become more self aware and think through some things, or just have fun with friends.\n\nI've always enjoyed weed more than any other substance, so I try to find a balance. It's ok to relax sometimes too, life isn't constantly about chasing goals.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kat3fw/finally_cut_off_marijuana_now_life_is_on_easy_mode/gfem24q/"}
