Although you can experience physical symptoms their origin lies in the psychological addiction. I cant explain it 100% because im not a scientist, not the most intelligent guy and its a long time ago i read a lot about this, but it had something to do with receptors \"flipping\" or \"switching\" because of the substance you took and then the body needs this substance to make whatever the receptors are making. Thats why cigarettes are so incredibly addictive or why you can die from alcohol or heroine withdrawals. The body stops producing these certain chemical because it now lacks the substance that activates the receptor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd although you have cannabinoid receptors, this stuff doesnt happen with weed. So if you quit weed, your body doesnt stop producing important stuff the cannabinoid receptors produce. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy this logic weed is more like a porn, tv, video game, gambling addiction than a heroine, benzo, alcohol addiction. You can have physical withdrawal symptoms from quitting your gambling or porn addiction too, but they stem from your mind and not from your receptor lacking a substance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut hey maybe they found out new stuff in the meantime and i havent checked, and a lot about weed still needs proper research. So i wouldnt swear that im 100% right ;)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kat3fw/finally_cut_off_marijuana_now_life_is_on_easy_mode/gfgojcv/"}
