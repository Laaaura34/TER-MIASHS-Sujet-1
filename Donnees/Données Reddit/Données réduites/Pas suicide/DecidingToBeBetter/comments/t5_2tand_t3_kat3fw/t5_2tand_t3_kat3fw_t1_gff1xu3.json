But unlike some people I can control myself when it comes to using my medication and I don't abuse it. I also have coping skills that I use for when times that I either can't take my medicine or in place of my medicine. The more you type the more you reveal your ignorance about the topic, it's okay cannabis isn't for everybody and not everybody can control themselves it's perfectly fine but you're blaming the plant when the plant isn't the issue it's your self-control and your actions regarding the use and abuse of the plant. If you really want to be better you need to face the person in the mirror instead of looking for an outside source to blame.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kat3fw/finally_cut_off_marijuana_now_life_is_on_easy_mode/gff1xu3/"}
