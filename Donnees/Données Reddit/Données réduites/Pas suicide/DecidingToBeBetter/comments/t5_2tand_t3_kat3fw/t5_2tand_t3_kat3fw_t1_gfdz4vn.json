It\u2019s my medication for depression and anxiety and it works VERY WELL. None of my antidepressants were able to achieve the same effect. And unlike antidepressants, weed doesn\u2019t numb me out, so I can actually process childhood trauma and shit and move past it. I use it strictly medicinally, though. But with it, I can actually enjoy things. So it\u2019s nice to be able to throw on music and feel good enough to clean or work.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kat3fw/finally_cut_off_marijuana_now_life_is_on_easy_mode/gfdz4vn/"}
