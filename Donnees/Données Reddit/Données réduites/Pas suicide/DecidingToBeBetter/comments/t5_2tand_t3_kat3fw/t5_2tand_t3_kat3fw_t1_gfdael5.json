I never realized how big the world actually was. And how clear things are. I don\u2019t have tunnel vision, I can pay attention to where I fucking put my keys, I am not overwhelmed by taking the first step. When I am sober, I just DO because I have to. I can finally rely on myself, and brush off the silly stuff because I have control. I\u2019m proud of you for realizing all of this. I hope that even on the days when you decide to slip back and try it (because you might- I did after two years of sobriety from marijuana) again to see why you left it, you enjoy the sweetness that is your high, and appreciate it for what it is, but to not make a habit of it. Do not let your vice become an addiction again. \n\nNow I make myself an allowance for when and how often to use it, because I prefer to not drink. It\u2019s good for a creative conscience. And it can be eye opening. But do not let it rule your life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kat3fw/finally_cut_off_marijuana_now_life_is_on_easy_mode/gfdael5/"}
