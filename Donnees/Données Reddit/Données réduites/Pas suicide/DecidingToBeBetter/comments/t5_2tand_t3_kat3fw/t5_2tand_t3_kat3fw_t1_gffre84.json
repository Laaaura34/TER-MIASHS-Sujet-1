Keep with it. I wanna hear about your progress soon. It sounds like you're riding the high of things being new and easy. But the thing is, weed wasn't the only thing making life harder for you. It was a combination of things, it was life itself. Difficulties will arise again that will not be as easy to overcome by \"watching what you eat,\" or \"just make a list.\" \n\nI think it's appropriate that you said you feel like a kid because this is literally the beginning. I see innumerable posts on this sub of people saying they have only just turned a new leaf. The real tests come after. The real confirmation is repeatedly passing the tests of not using weed again, not giving up on the YouTube channels, making new goals and attaining them, etc.\n\nCongratulations on quitting a drug that you felt you were abusing and that was clearly interfering in your daily activities and emotional well being. I know that at this stage, sharing with others us super important, so thanks for that too. You made a milestone by taking the first and hardest step.
