I love how your comment drips of narcissistic assumptions. First off I consume cannabis for my ADHD and bipolar which I am diagnosed with asshat. Secondly you added quotation marks and then proceeded to type nothing related to what I typed. That's not how you use quotation marks.

Your asinine comment betrays the depths of your ignorance.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kat3fw/finally_cut_off_marijuana_now_life_is_on_easy_mode/gff0x8f/"}
