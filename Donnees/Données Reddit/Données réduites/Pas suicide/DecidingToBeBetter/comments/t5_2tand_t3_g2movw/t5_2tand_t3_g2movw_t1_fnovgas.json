It's easy to lose motivation etc etc.\n\nSo I did one thing (besides forgiving myself for \"relapses\"  and doing small steps), and that is that DON'T CHOOSE A TIME FOR YOUR ACTIVITIES\n\nOk let me explain, I often have days split in two, one side is me all energetic, motivated and positive, the other is just tiredness at his most pure form. And sometimes one is in the morning and the other side in the afternoon/evening, something they switch. (it seems it has to do with sleep, food and other stuff, I'm investigating) \nSo maybe one day I just can't get up to workout, it's okay, I'll get up and do something relaxing and that I like, for example watching Netflix, listen to music or whatever. Then in the afternoon I'll exercise!\n\nIt works better FOR ME this way.\n\n(The downside of an approach like that, it's that easier to procastinate, and in the end giving up on the thing you wanted to accomplish, if you are starting, maybe consider a more hard approach on easier activities)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g2movw/i_am_following_a_routine_from_past_23_days_and_i/fnovgas/"}
