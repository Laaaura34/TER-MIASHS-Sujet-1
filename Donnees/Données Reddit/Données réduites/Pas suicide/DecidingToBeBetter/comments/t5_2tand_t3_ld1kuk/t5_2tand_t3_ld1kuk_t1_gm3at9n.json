But let\u2019s be happy that you\u2019re reflecting on yourself and able to be critical of your thoughts and behaviors.\n\nFrom here, the way you \u2018decide to be better\u2019 opens up considerably. Mindfulness meditation, while no cure-all, can help one be aware of the thoughts that naturally pop up, AND how we do or don\u2019t deal with them. Journalling allows us to take apart whole days and situations to come back to and learn from later. Apologizing in the moment keeps us humble and can be endearing. Talking to trusted loved ones about what we like about them and why they are the way they are opens up a whole new world. You have a lot of opportunities to keep moving forward. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ld1kuk/what_do_i_do_when_i_think_im_the_bad_guy/gm3at9n/"}
