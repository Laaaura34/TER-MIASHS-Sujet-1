(Also this pattern is not unique.) It is the same idea as the one behind the effort to encourage more girls to pursue STEM careers or political careers.\nAs a women, I do believe I know what sexism is. I would be interested to know whether the three people who were shocked by my comment on sexism  were men or women. (And thus, we could explore the idea that privilege is invisible to those with it. Just as, I have a privilege to be able to point this out and converse with you, but I was not thinking about this privilege when I made the comment above.) Also, just a reminder, that change only comes when people are uncomfortable. Maybe you are all uncomfortable with my comment because it would have required you to change how you looked at the list?\nAs a reminder, I really did enjoy OP's link. I think self-help is incredibly important today, I just wanted to point out something that a primarily male-dominant environment (reddit) would not have noticed right away.\nPS. I only replied to your comment because you at least bothered to explain where you are coming from. Thank you for the opportunity for a dialogue.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/5rku9y/if_you_were_me_a_few_years_ago_this_would_be_the/dd9es3l/"}
