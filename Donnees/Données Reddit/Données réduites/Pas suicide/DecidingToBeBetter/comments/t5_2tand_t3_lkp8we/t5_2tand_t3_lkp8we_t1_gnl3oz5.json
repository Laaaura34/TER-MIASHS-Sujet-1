Do it for you. Your want to feel better and move forward has to be bigger than your curiosity about your ex. Take a social media hiatus if you have to. You can temporarily deactivate almost anywhere. Delete the apps. Take some time for you. Say an affirmation. Have a tall glass of water, hot shower or bath, eat a nourishing meal, journal. Cry if you gotta... but STAY AWAY from these things that hurt you. Going back is self harm.
