I see women all the time including myself stressing over exes and men that could care less about us. They go on living their lives to the fullest and we waste so much time stressing over them. One of my favorite quotes is \u201cout sight out of mind\u201d. This one has helped me so much especially since I\u2019ve recently deactivated all dating apps because they were draining me yet I was wasting so much time on them. I recently did a round and checked on one of my exes and that was a bad idea. I\u2019m 100% over him, but I saw that he\u2019s recently made some accomplishments in his life that just made me feel behind or left behind. None of that is probably true, because a picture rarely tells the true story so it\u2019s best to leave him behind because he clearly has left you behind. Also check out this man named \u201cCoach Lee\u201d on YouTube he gives great advice on going No Contact. It\u2019s really the best thing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkp8we/how_to_stop_stalking_ex_on_social_media/gnl1eou/"}
