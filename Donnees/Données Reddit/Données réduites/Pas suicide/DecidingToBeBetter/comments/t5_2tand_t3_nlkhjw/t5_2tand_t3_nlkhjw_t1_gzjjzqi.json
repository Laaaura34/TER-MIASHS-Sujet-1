I think it took me a couple months of deep thought to figure out why I wasn't feeling as accomplished as I thought I would.  I too felt empty not having that driving force.  I figured it out though and you will too.  \n\nEverything you're feeling is completely normal.  The nice thing about your position is that you have at least a year to start figuring out what you'd like to do.  Use your elective courses to help connect you to a variety of subjects.  Utilize your college advisor and college career center to guide you to what career you'd like to go into.  If you'd truly like to go into medicine, I don't even think you need to know exactly what area of medicine until you're applying to grad school.  Take a big sigh of relief that you met this goal, it was a big one ... and embrace the rewarding opportunities you have given yourself by getting into college.  You'll be able to enjoy the reward of \"free\" college later when you don't have to pay for it :)  Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nlkhjw/feel_pretty_lost_after_achieving_a_lifelong_goal/gzjjzqi/"}
