This alone might be the biggest thing you can do to honour her.\n\nApparently, you are incredibly resilient (I envy you so much for that!). The biggest factor for developing mental resilience is by having a strong relationship to someone during childhood.  \nYou had this with your grandma, who never shunned you, who has always accepted you how you were and how you are.\n\nShe is the person who made you strong enough to help your mom with her loss.\n\n...anyways, your story had me crying and I wish for you to be as brave and amazing in the future as you are now.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l117fj/i_thought_i_used_reverse_psychology_on_my_mom_to/gjy83sn/"}
