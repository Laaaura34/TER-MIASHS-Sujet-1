It\u2019s how she communicates, I didn\u2019t realize it  and I didn\u2019t respect that because I thought she was trying to push it on me and maybe she was a bit but really it was just how she communicated. Then she stopped being herself, I always want people to be themselves and true to them. I realized I wasn\u2019t being fair to her.  And it felt terrible hearing she stopped praying daily and listening to her churchy radio stn every morning because those are things that make her who she is and what she has always loved. I just wanna her grieve not to give up her entire belief because she\u2019s upset on my behalf.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l117fj/i_thought_i_used_reverse_psychology_on_my_mom_to/gjzeic0/"}
