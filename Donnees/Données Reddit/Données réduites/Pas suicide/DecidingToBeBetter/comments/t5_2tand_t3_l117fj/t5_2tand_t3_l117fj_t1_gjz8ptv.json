I\u2019m spiritual, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s beyond but for my own sanity I have to believe I will see them again. I need to believe I\u2019ll get to tell my brother he saved my life and I made good use of it and did everything he said I would and more because he believed in me.\n\nN I got sick the same time my grandma started to show her Alzheimer\u2019s so I didn\u2019t tell her I was sick, past my mom and my good brother I have left no one knows just how sick I am. I didn\u2019t want my grandpa to worry about anyone else. I can and do handle this 95% on my own because my mom doesn\u2019t live near me so she only comes into the city once n a while. I\u2019m a full time patient with all the appointments, treatments, physiotherapy, n running around I do to get meds. It\u2019s a full time job with over time of managing symptoms. Last my grandma knew I was going to be a lawyer and I was volunteering at a local animal rescue, looking forward to a trip I was going to take to go hiking. Then I had to have my gallbladder out suddenly and I never recovered, because it triggered a dominos effect with my other conditions I didn\u2019t know about back then.\n\nSometimes I\u2019d give anything to be normal. But most of the time I feel blessed because I have the spare time to actually help people and make a difference in someone\u2019s life. To start the charity I always wanted too and get to go camping more in the summer even if it\u2019s not extreme camping like I used too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l117fj/i_thought_i_used_reverse_psychology_on_my_mom_to/gjz8ptv/"}
