Thank you for sharing.  Sending out a virtual hug!\n\nI grew up Southern Baptist....but being religious never added up in my mind.  Too many questions, never enough answers.  Anyway. i tend to change the subject, or simply remain silent, when my family tries to bring it up. But you're correct - helping somebody else grieve, using their terms and beliefs, can be a really considerate thing. Sometimes i feel fake when i try to comfort family in those terms...but in those moments, it's about helping them.  I bet it helped your mom a lot. \n\n At the end of the day, religion helps some people come to terms with death/ the unknown of the beyond (i really think that's the entire point).  Even if you don't take stock in it, you understood what your mom was upset about, and tried to provide solace in a way consistent with her beliefs.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l117fj/i_thought_i_used_reverse_psychology_on_my_mom_to/gjyc14u/"}
