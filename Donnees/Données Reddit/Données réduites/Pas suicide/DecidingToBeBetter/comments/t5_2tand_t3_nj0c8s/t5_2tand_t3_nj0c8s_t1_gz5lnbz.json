Literally. I\u2019m multiracial. My 23andMe ancestry composition is quite literally \u201call over the map\u201d.  \n\nAll throughout my childhood, my mom often told my sister and I that one of the reasons why she had children with my father (they inevitably divorced) was because he was part \u201cwhite\u201d and she wanted babies whose *\u201dnoses would be more white-looking and would have high cheekbones.\u201d* My mother\u2019s side of the family is largely Chinese and Southeast Asian. My mom\u2019s side of the family is largely Filipino and she hated this. She often made backhanded comments about how Filipinos had \u201cflat noses\u201d, \u201cdark skin\u201d, \u201cdark lips\u201d etc., we were also raised to eat more traditionally westernized food than culturally Filipino food. And my grandma was the last of her generation that came from the Philippines to Hawaii to be bilingual. She never taught the language to her daughters.  \nI never knew what this was in my adolescence, and I was never equipped to understand the concept of internalized racism. (It\u2019s heartbreaking because I know there was this pressure on people like my grandma to conform to English-speaking as the norm, especially in public VS at home..thank goodness I grew up in Hawaii where this expectation wasn\u2019t as severe as it may have been in the mainland since most of the demographic in Hawaii is Asian..)\n\nI wanted to share my story, because I wanted to let you know that you\u2019re not alone, and that you don\u2019t have to feel this deep shame. You\u2019re human and you\u2019re learning-just like the rest of us. You have the capacity to change and gauging from this post, you seem to want to. I think it\u2019s great that you\u2019re taking a look at all of this. It\u2019s the first step into true self-acceptance. In today\u2019s day and age, we\u2019re not where we want to be with diversity and cultural acceptance, BUT we\u2019re getting better. And realizations like this help. I used to denounce the Filipino side of me SO hard. It was so...misguided. But today, I am so proud. Of EVERY single ethnicity.  \n\nI can\u2019t say this will work for you, but aside from taking the 23andMe test (I wanted to educate myself and get a full \u201cmap\u201d of what I really was, since my family only kind of had an idea) I will move forward in educating myself on each of these ethnicities. Kind of like \u201creversing\u201d that trained behavior my mom instilled in me to believe *this* or *that* about Filipino culture..well, now I\u2019m taking education about this culture into my OWN hands. The result will be pride, fascination, and adoration. And I also plan on traveling to these countries soon (Philippines and others)\n\nBasically, flip it on its head and turn it into a *positive experience* because YOU have the power to do that.  \nI hope my message finds you! Have a good day! \u2728", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz5lnbz/"}
