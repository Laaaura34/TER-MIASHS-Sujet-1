We need diversity. YOU are so important as you are. If you\u2019re a brown person, a white person, a black person. Without diversity how can we all learn and grow together. It teaches us to handle smaller diverse challenges as well. And don\u2019t even get me started on culture. We need the diverse cultures. First of all they are beautiful and amazing in and of themselves. But it pushes us to seek beauty from the eyes of another. It teaches us to put ourselves in another\u2019s shoes. It challenges our perspectives. If you don\u2019t like where your from or your culture that\u2019s OK you don\u2019t have to! But it\u2019s what you do with that \u201cdislike\u201d that\u2019s important. You can allow it to hold you back, or you can grow from it. You don\u2019t get to choose who you are or your gender or your ethnicity. It\u2019s all just a gamble. But please know the moment you had a heart beat you became so important and essential to who you are. Learn about your own culture so you can teach your children. Whether it\u2019s to teach them to embrace your culture, or to learn and derive from your culture regardless you are teaching them in the face of adversity. And that\u2019s amazing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz5ryoh/"}
