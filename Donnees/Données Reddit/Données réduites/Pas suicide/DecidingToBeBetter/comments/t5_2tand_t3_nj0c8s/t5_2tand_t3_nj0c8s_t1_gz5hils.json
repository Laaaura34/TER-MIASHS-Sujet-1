I find white women very attractive. I'm not ashamed of my race or religion, but my obsession with white women and fair skin is something that really bothers me, and like you I'm also ashamed of it. I feel like I'm fetishizing them or doing white worship but I just can't help it.  I'm trying to work my way around it but it's tough. Least I could advise you is to get in touch with your own culture and value on a deeper level. Moreover, interacting with white people could also help. I'm friends with white women online here and they're also ordinary people like us tbh.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz5hils/"}
