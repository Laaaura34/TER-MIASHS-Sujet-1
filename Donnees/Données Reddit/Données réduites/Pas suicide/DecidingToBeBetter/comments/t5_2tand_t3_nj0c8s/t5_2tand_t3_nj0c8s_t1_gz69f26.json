OP didn't really make mention of reasons that they would feel this way, or people in their life that taught them to dislike their own race/identity. They made a lot of mention about what other people think of them and how concerned they are with that, so that seemed like a self acceptance issue. \nEven if it is entirely internalized racism, increased self acceptance is entirely how one would address that. Also note that the first reply to my comment is an immigrant who felt similar things and saw it as an opportunity to grow. So it definitely seems more like you're jumping to a conclusion rather than me denying the reality of anything.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz69f26/"}
