Hopefully my thoughts on the subject can shed some light on one strangers opinion. Look forward to the future and continue to discuss the more difficult topics in your life.\n\n\\- You understand that when discussing race, it's okay to be who you are. No matter anything, no buts about it. Anybody that tells you otherwise is most likely suffering from a form of discrimination.\n\n\\- It's okay to be disappointed or disgusted toward certain aspects of your culture (I've always told people that racist words exist for numerous reasons. For example, the term: \"White Trash\" can be universally understood as wife beaters, trailer parks, and a shitload of meth. I believe that most racist words can be interchanged with any other racist word, so long as the reader understands the topics broader context. Each hate phrase exists as a cultural reflection; illuminating the poor decisions, bad attitudes, and deeply rooted cultural norms that have come to cause strife among the communities in question.\n\n\\- It is not uncommon for the shade of your skin to be a point of pride, hate, and contention amongst the black community.
