Your fine dude. Realising unconstructive things in your life is the important part. Change asks time and dedication. Next time you spew hate for no reason, you will know. Also (this is my personal opinion) why not look for the most constructive way of proceeding. Yes humans do have all sorts of flaws like racism. It probably allways will be so. You dont have to become like a hasidic jew so to speak. Just nudge yourself in the right direction, and be an example. Not in an overly done way. Not in a way you start to cut of everyone in your life with an opinion (about this issue) other than you. Everything is a fase to me. Just let yourself grow naturaly, and do not develop a hate for yourself based on the collor of your skin or culture. Thats not the way forward as i see things. All the best man :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz6c62j/"}
