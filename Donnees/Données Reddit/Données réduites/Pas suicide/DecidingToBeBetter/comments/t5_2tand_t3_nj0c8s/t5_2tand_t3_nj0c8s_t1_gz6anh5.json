And (as a first gen asian american), I find that your experience is vastly shared and is rooted in systems and environments on varying scales (all the way from the global to the close knit familial) which we come from and continue to exist within. \n\nI don\u2019t have immediate resources or anything in this moment..maybe some thought exercises...\n\nWhenever you feel bad about, are taken aback by, wonder about, or question something you are thinking/feeling, ask yourself: Who/what/where told me to see this (thing) in this way? Who/what/where told them to see it this way? Apart from the propagated messages about this (thing) that has traveled to me, how do I personally see this (thing)? \n\n^ perhaps that can help you be kinder to yourself as you see yourself more clearly beyond the parts of you that are a reflection of what has been shown to you (overtly or subliminally). \n\nI think examining yourself is a powerful practice that sometimes exposes something unlikable, that\u2019s the point of this inward search...so congrats on your discoveries!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz6anh5/"}
