I don\u2019t have any resources for you,  but instead of focusing on how bad you are for thinking these things, try to focus on what is good about your culture. Your feelings are likely from messages you\u2019ve been given about race. Focusing on how bad those messages are will likely bring more shame to yourself. If you try to look for the positives in yourself and your culture/background, the racist messages will fade and won\u2019t be so important to you any more. There are also many books available to learn how to identify racism and how change your mindset. They aren\u2019t exactly what you are describing, but you may be able to learn from them and apply it to your own situation.\n\nBottom line, don\u2019t be ashamed of how you feel. The messages you\u2019ve been given are not your fault and your feelings aren\u2019t wrong. Feeling shame will only increase your feelings of wanting to be different.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz4vc21/"}
