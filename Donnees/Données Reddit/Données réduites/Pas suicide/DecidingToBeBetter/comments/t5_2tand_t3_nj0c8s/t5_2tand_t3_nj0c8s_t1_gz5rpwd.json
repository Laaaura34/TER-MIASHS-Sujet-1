I always tried to like and appear as Western as I could, I rejected and showed disinterest in learning the native language my family speaks and although most of my family speaks English anyways I feel ashamed for rejecting any aspect of my culture growing up. I never wanted to appear as a \u201cfob\u201d because they were looked down on- it\u2019s weird how even Chinese people were racist towards other Chinese people that weren\u2019t from Canada, thus identifying less Western. This is how it was where I grew up. \n\nThe one thing that I have been doing lately is try to be more in tune with my culture, learning the language and trying to improve in it (I have some skills from my childhood but they\u2019re really weak) and try to redefine my values in terms of what I look for in a partner and that I shouldn\u2019t just idolize someone because they\u2019re white. \n\nAs others have said, this is a result from society having racist values against non-white people so rather than blaming yourself (or even blaming society) I think the best way is to just redefine your values and unlearn those negative perspectives.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz5rpwd/"}
