Don\u2019t let people guilt trip you into not liking \u201cwhite people things\u201d because that\u2019s pathetic and they have their own issues. If you like white women there\u2019s nothing wrong with that either. However make sure it\u2019s not a reflection of hate towards yourself or people like you. Basically, make sure it doesn\u2019t come from a bad place. Cheers", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz7c2oa/"}
