You only moved about 5 years ago so don\u2019t be so hard on yourself. The grass is always greener on the other side during \u2018honeymoon\u2019 phase. \n\nI immigrated to \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6when I was 6 also and remember wanting blond curly hair until I realized that my friends wanted to look petite and \u2018exotic\u2019\u2019 like me lol. I hated that my mom didn\u2019t make meatloaf and pasta like all the other moms until I was old enough to appreciate that holy hell my parents left everything behind (literally paradise) and learned English for the whole family to get us citizenship and political freedom. One day you\u2019ll realize that being multi cultural is a huge plus. And btw what makes \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 so distinct is its a mosaic not a melting pot.
