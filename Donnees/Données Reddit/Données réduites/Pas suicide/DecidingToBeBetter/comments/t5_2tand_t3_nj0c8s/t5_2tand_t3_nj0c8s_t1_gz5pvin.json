Listen, we are all trying to navigate and ultimately survive this unprecedented brain melting period of human history. YOU are doing a fantastic fucking job. The vast majority of those aforementioned humans just stumblefuck through life, blaming dad/mom/ex partner for the shortcomings in character AND will never have the desire or ability to self reflect. If they do you have moments of clarity, best believe that shit is instantly repressed and buried back down deep. And that actually makes sense. Because true self reflection it\u2019s really hard. It\u2019s really hard to take an honest look at yourself and then actually make changes that you want or should make. You writing all of this is a huge step in that direction. A lot of people mentioned \"talking to a professional\" and that's nice advice. But listen, It\u2019s hard to find a good therapist. It would be even harder to find a good therapist who actually understands and empathizes with this specific situation. Please note! I think that anyone who is NOT seeing a therapist is insane! I just think baby steps in the right direction. These feelings have been indoctrinated into you from the moment of conception. It\u2019s unavoidable. And I hate that. However, there are so many fantastic resources. Take it to the streets! Get yourself involved in as much activism that you are passionate about as possible. Being around strong, like-minded people is the best medicine.\n\nKeep that chin up. \n\nIn Solidarity, xoxox", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nj0c8s/finally_admitted_to_myself_that_i_have/gz5pvin/"}
