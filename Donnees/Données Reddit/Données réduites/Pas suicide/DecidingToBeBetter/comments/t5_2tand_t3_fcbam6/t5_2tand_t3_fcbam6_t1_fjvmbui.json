Could it be that you are ashamed of being different? \n\nI mean, yeah, that's kind of the whole thing. It's wrong that I am the way I am. If I were a more traditional masculine guy like my brother, then I would have a life more like his. Instead, that life just left me behind when I got dumped and all my non-dumped friends left to go get married and start families in the suburbs. Because I decided to follow my interests and passion getting a literature degree instead of getting a business degree or something else practical that I would have hated. If I would have done that, I might have been able to commit to buying a ring and moving to the suburbs right after college instead of getting dumped.\n\nI would get along better with my parents if I had more conservative political views, I would still have the chance at a social life if I planned ahead well enough to get engaged before graduating college, I wouldn't have gotten made fun of for having romantic feelings if I was a more palatable guy. It's just... it seems like all of what makes me unhappy stems from me being myself.
