I didn't realize all the ways in which I was being selfish, indulgent, and just rotten. I disappointed my parents and was ignored or disliked by my peers. Setting rules for myself and following them is the only way for me to function. Otherwise I might act a little too excited about literature, video games, anime, philosophy, etc. All those things i care about that are trite, silly, and immature. If I were a professional writer, then the things I like would be less trite and immature. I've tried doing things only for me to enjoy, and I absolutely hated it. It was dark, lonely, and I was stuck in a bubble of self-indulgence and avoidance behaviors. It's still dark and lonely, but I'm done seeking comfort to avoid the pain of how much I hate my social ability and how easy I am to ignore. Embracing the whole \"do it for yourself\" ideology 2ould turn me into the piece of shit I was at my lowest point, and I won't allow that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fcbam6/my_life_will_not_advance_until_i_have_a_mastery/fjbh0up/"}
