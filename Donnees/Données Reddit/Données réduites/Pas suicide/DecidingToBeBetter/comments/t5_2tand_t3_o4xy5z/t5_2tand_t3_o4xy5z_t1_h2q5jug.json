Excuses are lame and realizing your options is productive. \n   \nIt's not easy to just change. This first world is designed to make you fat. 90% of everything in the grocery store is bad for you. It's normal to eat takeout everyday, it's not normal to pack and eat vegetables and turn down second helpings. Those aren't excuses those are reasons. You just have to acknowledge that and figure out what you can do about. What needs to change. It takes empathy to say this is understandable and hard but lets find some ways to change.\n   \nMy \"excuse\" for being overweight was my anxiety.  I eat instead of doing the things I should be doing. Once I found out that I had anxiety and what caused me to eat I could start doing something about it. \n   \nAnd it's not easy to just get off your ass and exercise.
