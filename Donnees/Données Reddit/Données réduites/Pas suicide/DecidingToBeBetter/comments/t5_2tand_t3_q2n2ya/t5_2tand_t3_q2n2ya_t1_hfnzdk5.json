Both of you are correct just some misunderstanding. There is a difference between thriving alone and being alone, being lonely and being alone. When you are alone that doesn't necessarily mean you have to be lonely also thrive alone. You socialize, meet with people but do your own way. Don't let others affect your behaviour, your decisions. This is being alone. So you're socializing but as an individual with your very own perspectives, ways of doing things without the influence of people to make you walk every steps you take. Once you're socializing with people you aren't lonely anymore. I hope you understand.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2n2ya/i_just_want_someone_to_talk_to/hfnzdk5/"}
