I think it's really cool you're a teachers aide and got tenure. That was one of the things I considered doing while working on finishing school. If you're unfulfilled in your job, exploring what kind of career wouldn't make you unhappy or bored is a good idea. I've changed my mind a lot and have  switched jobs and attempted college multiple times (still not finished). But it has definitely been a learning experience. It made me realize what's important and to be proud of any progress, no matter how much I worry about wasted time. Whatever you decide, it's not too late! Do you have any hobbies that could translate into something that could be profitable? Or maybe a consider certification program for a higher paying job in the meantime. I don't have the best answer because I'm still figuring stuff out too. Don't forget to try and do something to destress like writing or a quick exercise. Even just sitting outside for a minute. When you're depressed it's hard to do anything but just  something simple to be nice to yourself really helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nvhrs0/at_a_crossroadsi_guess/h27q2ds/"}
