This was a great help, and honestly.. exactly what I needed to read. I am a poster boy of chronic procrastination, not motivated and just fatigued. I can't get anything done, I'm in the first year of uni, and my gf gets all her assignments, essays, & projects done as soon as she gets them and me, on the other hand, I can't even get myself to attempt to do my assignments till few hours of due date. Not just her, but my friends and if my parents were here, they would be absolutely livid. I guess there is the pile on effect that makes it worse, I see my gf get her stuff done perfectly executed, constant As and her just chilling after finishing up her work and she tells me off for not doing my work and just procrastinating and skipping classes all the time, which makes it worse and worse every time.
