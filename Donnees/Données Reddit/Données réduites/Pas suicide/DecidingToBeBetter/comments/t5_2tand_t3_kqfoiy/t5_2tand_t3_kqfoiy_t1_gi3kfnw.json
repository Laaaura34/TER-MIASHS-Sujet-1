I am, and you may also be, extremely empathetic. A lot of the time I want to know what\u2019s troubling someone not so that I can go out and spread gossip, but because I want to help understand someone and possibly help them.\n\nThe way you talk about this in your post is very similar to how I operate so I\u2019ll just tell you a little tip that helped me.\n\nI have a nearly unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Like, about ANYTHING. One day, I could easily spends HOURS learning about some extremely niche topic that MIGHT be useful to know, but I become extremely satisfied if that knowledge is ever put to use.\n\nWhat I started doing was I looked at some things I found interesting, and instead of learning a niche thing, (although I still do this episodically) I instead try and learn a new skill. Right now, I realized that I think the piano is a beautiful instrument and am teaching myself from square one.\n\nPM me if you ever wanna talk, OP. I don\u2019t know many people that are similar to me in this way so I find it very interesting.
