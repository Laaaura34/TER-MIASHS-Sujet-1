Always went through everything courageously be it  from picking up myself from lows of life to completing an engineering degree ,that I never imagined of becoming after being tagged as a dumb kid by my own family. But this? This is something else right now happening. It feels like someone is literally making sure that I don't get a chance to even collect myself after getting punched from every side and its never ending. Like just STOP!!!! I wish if it's meant to end then just do it in one stroke but tormenting me every second of my life and ruining it all then it's better if it gets done for once and all. \nLike ughhh this thoughts are not so me but it's not in my control anymore and that's scarring me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of563p/finally_got_a_job/h4bethn/"}
