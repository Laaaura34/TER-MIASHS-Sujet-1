I wish I could see the other side but I am not able to. \nI hope i get at a better mental state than this. I want to get out of this but it feels like whatever I do none of my stars are getting aligned for it to work. I just want to quit but there is my family dependent on me potentially in near future cuz my father lost his business cuz of covid and there is no one earning anymore and my job just started a week ago.\nI just want to cry but I can't. I wanted to be with her but she left too. Lost my grandma too. It feels like all the doors of hell just broke luce on me. \nI hope it gets better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of563p/finally_got_a_job/h4bbl2s/"}
