I promise, you'll be blown away by the ability to grasp how miraculous every moment truly is and it won't seem like just floating by. I mean... yes, you're floating by just like everyone is... like what do you think planet Earth as a whole is doing? Anyways, you'll be like \"omg wtf this amazing\". If your life is perfect and you're still bla and want to feel gratitude for it, start meditating. It's the best thing you can give to the world.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mqjurw/i_feel_like_im_just_floating_thru_life/guid6fv/"}
