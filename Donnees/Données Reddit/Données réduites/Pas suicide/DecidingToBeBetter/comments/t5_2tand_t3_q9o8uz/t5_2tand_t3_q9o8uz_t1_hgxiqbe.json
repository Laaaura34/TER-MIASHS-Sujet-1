It was once I accepted myself for all my flaws and strengths. \n\nWhen I was at a low point, instead of beating myself up, I would show myself mercy. \n\nI also did some exercises each morning which really helped change things at a deeper level. \n\nI love myself now more than I ever have and my life is so much better.
