If it was wrong, then this universe/god would of never created anger in the first place. It is okay to be angry, it is okay to feel rage (so long you don\u2019t harm yourself or others). I know people in this thread will tell you to do things to avoid the feeling, but I am completely against this notion. I get it, people want to help, but if you are having intrusive thoughts than that means it should be dealt with now. \n\nNow I know you said you booked a therapist appointment for September (sucks when this happens, we are in pain right now!), so until then we will have to deal with this in other ways. I suggest you get someone who can talk to you, without telling/asking you to avoid your anger. If you can\u2019t find someone, that\u2019s okay. Anger can be scary to non-angry people, so if you have to do it alone, okay (I had to go thru my anger alone). \n\nFirst off, anger is one step above depression. It\u2019s a rather empowering emotion, compared to sadness/depression, so be thankful for that at least (hard to understand, I\u2019m sure). Anger in of itself is more like\u2026 confusion. Frustrated confusion. This is okay! Many people walking the planet feel this way. The world we live in is rather confusing, I\u2019m sure we can all agree on that. \n\nUntil your therapist appointment, whenever you get an intrusive angry thought, please please please sit with it. Consider your anger like a child desperately trying to get your attention. Would you turn your back on a child in need? Why would you do that with yourself? Anyway, sit with your emotions. Don\u2019t look at your phone/computer/tv, don\u2019t go for a jog, don\u2019t go clubbing with your buds, just don\u2019t abandon yourself! Every time you turn away from a negative emotion you are turning away from yourself. \n\nOnce you are not distracted, and you are sitting with these thoughts, begin to dig deep. Ask yourself out loud or in your head, \u201cwhat is my anger trying to tell me?\u201d You\u2019d be surprised once your start listening to your inner dialogue! Thought from your subconscious will begin to appear, and your subconscious wants/NEEDS healing. \n\nBegin to ask questions, \u201cis this anger related to this certain person/event?\u201d \u201cAm I lonely?\u201d \u201cWhat do I really want in life?\u201d Do you hear other people\u2019s voices in your head? (I still hear my abuser to this day, but those thoughts only last a moment or two because I\u2019ve developed self-love and now I can easily forget what he said/done to me.) Are those voices telling \u201cyou aren\u2019t enough?\u201d Or maybe a parent forbid you to live the life you want? Did your GF/BF cheat on you? Keep asking questions, keep digging deeper. \n\nAt this point, if you want to beat the shit out of a pillow, do it. Journal down your thoughts? Do it. Scream into a pillow, scream profanities (if your alone, of course). If you have the urge to cry, please do. Crying his a welcoming release, and it doesn\u2019t last forever. All in all, you are in a great deal of pain, I can tell because your brain is desperately trying to get resolve for something. Btw, think of trauma like this: trauma is stress without resolution. Once you resolve the issue, you\u2019d be one step closer to having a joyous life. \n\nInstead of running away from the storm, we have to stop, turn around and go through it. It won\u2019t kill you, you will always survive. I hope this helped just a little bit.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p44fu0/i_am_having_very_violent_angry_random_thoughts/h8yd4tg/"}
