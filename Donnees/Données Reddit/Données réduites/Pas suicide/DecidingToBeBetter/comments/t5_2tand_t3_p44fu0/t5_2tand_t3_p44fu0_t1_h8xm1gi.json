I\u2019ll weigh in, too. \n\nYour problem could be physical or mental. \n\nPoor physical health messes with you mental health while good physical health actually promotes mental health. That\u2019s why these guys promote exercise. If it\u2019s a mental health thing exercise will at least still alleviate your stress.\n\nIf it\u2019s a mental thing, doing things that promote mental health and dealing with the source of your anger might be ideal. Doing stuff like talking with friends, finding new interests/hobbies that you like, and building good/healthy habits would promote mental health. Relaxing by meditation, sleep, and having fun is good too. This is help to help you through the day, but also so you have the energy to deal with your issue. Dealing with whatever\u2019s causing your anger alone might be bad if handled poorly though or it might be a lot to handle so finding a therapist or at least consulting good friends (not toxic ones) might help out. This really depends on the severity though.\n\nJust my take on things. Not licensed or a hobbyist.
