And you can control your actions and what you pay attention to. \n\nBreath, look up, stretch your arms, it's only thoughts, they will pass. That feeling is not forever. It will pass.  Keep breathing. Think of something nice. Even if you still have those violent thoughts, add that it is a beautiful day, and look at the sun. No need to suppress, just flow the attention to something else.  Keep breathing.\n\nYou control your actions, your actions define you, you are in control. Your thoughts are just passing by. Your thoughts aren't you. They are just visiting. They don't control you, you are in control. They will go away and you will remain. It's going to be ok.
