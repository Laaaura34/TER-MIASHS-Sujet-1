Congratulations. It was actually being a patient under the care of a really good therapist that inspired me to go back to school and become one. Both getting help and becoming a psychotherapist are some of the best decisions I've ever made.\n\nAs for advice: the best therapists are the ones who have gone to therapy and have done the hard work of working to heal. So you're already on a great path. \n\nThings I wish I knew before:\n\n-There's no need to go to an expensive or prestigious grad program; I went to an excellent one and it literally doesn't matter. Neither clients nor clinicians care about where you went to school, they only care if you're able to help others well\n\n-The title of Dr is really seductive. It also doesn't really matter. I think for most people - myself included - a masters level degree (MSW, MFT, etc) is perfect. It takes less time to do, costs less money, and if you're good at business, you can charge the same as a psychologist.\n\n-Read about psychology and find different styles / theories that resonate with you. \n\nThere's probably more, but that's what I've got now. Feel free to DM me if you have more questions.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p44fu0/i_am_having_very_violent_angry_random_thoughts/h9hnhb6/"}
