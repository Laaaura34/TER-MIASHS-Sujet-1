Can you spend less time with them?\n\nAdditionally, when I\u2019m really riled up, physical activity does wonders. Someone mentioned boxing, which I agree with, but even a brisk walk can help me break the cycle when I\u2019m all worked up. \n\nLastly, animals help me a lot. Can you get a pet?  Maybe volunteer at a shelter?  Walk a neighbor\u2019s dog?  Something about caring for something that doesn\u2019t have a voice and receiving unconditional love from it really calms me. Careful though, a new animal can backfire. I just adopted a second dog that started crying at 5am this morning and I am the opposite of happy at the moment lol. \n\nEither way, reduce time around the things that trigger your anger, distract your mind with things that make you happy or help you grow and blow off physical energy with exercise. \n\nI\u2019d also be curious how long you\u2019ve been practicing meditation. It may just be that it\u2019s not long enough to develop a habit that affects your brain long term. Keep at it. It\u2019s probably helping more than you know.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p44fu0/i_am_having_very_violent_angry_random_thoughts/h8wiuw3/"}
