Angry thoughts are just a little juicier than the average cloud. Attempt to watch it like car goes by, keep breathing.\n\nTake care of the tension in your body. Sometimes we are sore/contorted, or sitting or standing in a way that is providing constant stress, or directly reading things that piss us off like  piece of shit sexist man redditors.\n\nDon't start sucking that juiciness out of those angry clouds, that's rumination and that will only extend your stress. Let the clouds pass. They will be juicy and you will feel things, but you have to sit back and remember its just a cloud in the sky, not a record of your unworthiness.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p44fu0/i_am_having_very_violent_angry_random_thoughts/h8x41ht/"}
