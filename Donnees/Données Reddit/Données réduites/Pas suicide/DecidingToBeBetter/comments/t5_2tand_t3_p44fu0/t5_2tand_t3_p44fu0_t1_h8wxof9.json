When I\u2019m angry I feel the urge to do something and exercise is a useful action. Run? Jumping jacks? Or even just scream or sing a wild-energy song/use music to move through the feeling? \n\nAnother useful \u201cget it out\u201d action is some form of art. Paint or sculpt or draw the feelings as they happen: random swirls? Images? Flashes of color?\n\nWhen you\u2019re not in the heat of the anger, prime your mind/thoughts with loving thoughts toward yourself and others. Actively think the thoughts that make you feel happy or proud or generous towards yourself and others. Imagine how you might offer help to people who are vulnerable. (You can extend this to action too and volunteer somewhere/how.) Also, actively think about and list the things you\u2019re genuinely grateful for. If you\u2019ve got angry thoughts that strike without warning, try giving yourself a lot of other thoughts for your brain to feed on at other times.\n\nFinally, pay attention to what you\u2019re watching/reading/listening to that might feed your brain angry thoughts and/or cue angry spell. I go through periods where I need to ignore all news for a bit or mute certain angry ppl in my life on social media.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p44fu0/i_am_having_very_violent_angry_random_thoughts/h8wxof9/"}
