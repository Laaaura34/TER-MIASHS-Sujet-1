I'm not sure how Wim Hof Transcendental Meditation is different from what I've been practicing, but what user I-Ponder mentioned here is the skill I started mastering with meditation.\n\nI also used to get so worked up with anger, and worse, I also took A Lot of time coming down from rage. Practicing meditation helped me practice distancing myself from the emotion and the thoughts that come with it, and the distance helps me keep my cool and control my thoughts better. \n\nI agree with this reply--violently trying to avoid the thoughts might make them even more aggressive, so what might help is just watching them pass and at the same time keeping your distance from them. It's a way to both acknowledge the thoughts and feelings without drowning in them.\n\nThe fact that  you've already taken steps for this is already a big step. I'm rooting for you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p44fu0/i_am_having_very_violent_angry_random_thoughts/h8w7jxv/"}
