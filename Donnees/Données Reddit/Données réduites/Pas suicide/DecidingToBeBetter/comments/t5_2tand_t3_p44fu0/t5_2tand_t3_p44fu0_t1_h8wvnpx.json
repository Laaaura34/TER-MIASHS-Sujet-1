We live in a world where people will be assholes and do stupid shit and there\u2019s nothing we can do to change that. So how do I live in a world like that without getting angry all the time? How do I get peace regardless of whatever bullshit others throw at me? If our peace and lack of anger is dependent on circumstances or people behaving in a way we find acceptable then we\u2019re fucked. \n\nBut luckily it doesn\u2019t have to be. You can google 4th step inventories if you\u2019re interested or message me and I can tell you how I did it. Spoiler alert, my anger at everyone else always comes back to me and my bullshit. At first that\u2019s an annoying thought but it\u2019s actually great news because if I\u2019m angry because of my own bullshit, then I can do something about it. Good luck with whatever you try to do and good for you for reaching out for advice!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p44fu0/i_am_having_very_violent_angry_random_thoughts/h8wvnpx/"}
