Your brain isnt that good at delaying gratification for a long time, if something will be bad for you in 3 years, thats not going to convince the monkey in you. \n\nSo try getting around this by :\nPreparing in advance to make it hard for you to act impulsively. Lock away those cookies. Announce to your friends in advance you won't drink for a few weeks, so if you do you embarass yourself.\nBy introducing some short term consequences. The lizard brain will have an easier time getting:\"if i drink tonight, i will have to pay my friend the 50 $ i bet him\" than \"if i drink tonight,  i might fuck up my liver in 10 years \".\n\nSo don't curb them when they are happening-that is hard-curb them long before that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lzj04a/how_do_i_stop_making_impulsive_decisions/gq2lfyj/"}
