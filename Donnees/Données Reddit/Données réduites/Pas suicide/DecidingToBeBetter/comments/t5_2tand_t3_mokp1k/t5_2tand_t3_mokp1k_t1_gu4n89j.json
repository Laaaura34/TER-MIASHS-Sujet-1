Even if you find someone who genuinely likes you, you may not even believe them, or worse, you may think they\u2019re wrong to like you and drive them away. \n\nSo how do you start to like yourself? \n\nFigure out who you want to be, really dig deep, and strive to be that person. Don\u2019t \u201cfake it till you make it\u201d but genuinely do your best to become your ideal self through doing things your ideal self would do. \n\nIt won\u2019t happen overnight, and your ideal will shift but you will be surprised how fast you can change when you commit. You will encounter roadblocks and struggle, but remember that the ultimate failure isn\u2019t failing, it\u2019s quitting. As you become the man you want to be you will gain the sexiest quality anyone can have: confidence. \n\nNo Bullshit, the hottest guys around can turn off a potential partner by being desperate and creepy, and an \u2018ugly\u2019 guy with real confidence can attract all kinds of interest. I\u2019ve seen it happen again and again. Don\u2019t make girls the goal, make yourself the goal and the girls will follow. Even if they don\u2019t, you will be proud of who you are and feel beautiful on the inside.\nhttps://fs.blog/2014/05/hunter-s-thompson-to-hume-logan/ this letter might help explain a bit better some of what I\u2019m trying to say.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mokp1k/ugly_on_the_outside_and_slowly_turning_ugly_on/gu4n89j/"}
