We project how we feel about ourselves unconsciously. People can tell how you feel about yourself and will react accordingly. \n\nOnce you find that redeeming quality in yourself, and I know it's in there, let that shine. Give more than you get, be the person you want to find.\n\nThe advantage of not being the most beautiful person in the room is that the friends that you do have love you for who you are, not for how you look. You will never have to worry that they like you for some superficial reason.\n\nIt's not easy going through life as an acquired taste. But if you do the work and dig deep, I have no doubt that you'll find an authenticity that most physically attractive people don't really have. \n\nConsciously or not, you will project that authenticity and people will respond positively.\n\nPost back and let us know how you're doing please. You can do this!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mokp1k/ugly_on_the_outside_and_slowly_turning_ugly_on/gu4ifv6/"}
