I go on dates rarely, people I manage to go out with via tinder, etc.. \n\nI have a good job, but I invest most of my money. I am not materialistic, but I am trying to find a way to get rid of this feeling of not having friends and feeling lonely. \n\nAt times, I reflect back on women I knew who wanted something serious but in the end, they didn't meet what I was looking for. Sometimes I want to just be with them so I don't feel lonely. Yet, I will be sacrificing my values.\n\nI worked out for a whole month, but then stopped. I don't know how to proceed. These long holiday weekends always make me feel like this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny suggestions?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/phk55t/how_to_make_more_worthy_friends_and_meet_new/", "title": "How to make more worthy friends and meet new people?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "EnigmaMind50", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630726739, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/phk55t/how_to_make_more_worthy_friends_and_meet_new/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437986.2367582, "replies_charged": false}
