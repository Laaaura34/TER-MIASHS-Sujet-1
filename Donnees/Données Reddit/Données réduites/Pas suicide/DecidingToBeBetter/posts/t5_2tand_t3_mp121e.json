And getting rid of problems, issues, postponed tasks, clutter and various baggage I've picked up over the last several years IS my 2021 goal, and the area where I desperately need to do better.\n\nSo cleaning out the storage unit containing my deceased parents stuff this weekend was definitely progress.  It's been weighing on me for months, costing money, and above all been a huge emotional burden knowing it was there and needed to be handled.\n\nWasn't sure I could do it - but I did!  And I was darn proud of myself for taking on that mountain and conquering it yesterday.  \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nBut then morning comes and I look around and all I see is all the stuff left to do (still have more of her stuff to handle, have plenty of other stuff I'm way behind doing, etc.) - and the sense of doom and failure start creeping in.\n\nSo I decided I needed something concrete to mark the occasion.  Like a lot of others I started doing houseplants during the lockdown and have been wanting a new one (since I finally got the hang of keeping the two I have alive).  So I went and bought one.  Which is huge for me since I very rarely buy myself anything - too many bills to pay, kids to buy for, etc.\n\nBut sitting here, looking at my $10 investment - I know I did the right thing.\n\nIt's not much, but it's a visual reminder I took on something really hard and I succeeded.   I may have much more work to do and progress to make, but it's a start.   And there's plenty more houseplants I can buy to mark those future successes when they happen.\n\nSo wanted to remind anyone who needs it - take a little bit of time to celebrate your progress as it occurs and find a way to remind future self of what you've managed to do so far.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mp121e/its_important_to_mark_your_successes_aka_making/", "title": "It's important to mark your successes - aka making progress so I bought a plant", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LilJourney", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618180373, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mp121e/its_important_to_mark_your_successes_aka_making/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438451.1550944, "replies_charged": false}
