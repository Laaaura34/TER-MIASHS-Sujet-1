The other day my friend reminded me that in like 6 months I\u2019ll be 21. 21 years of age and I would\u2019ve not achieved anything. Currently I\u2019ve done like only 2 semesters of community college then decided to \u201ctake a break\u201d out of mostly laziness. The big bad COVID set me back a bit and I had to work at a shitty low paying job. Then my old job hired me back finally. Which is still a less shitty low paying job where I work my ass off. I\u2019m fat, ugly, terribly single, still depressed and heart broken, underachieved. It\u2019s that reminder that I\u2019m 6 months I\u2019ll be 21 and I am currently nothing. That thought reminded me in 5 or 6 years I haven\u2019t heard the words \u201cI\u2019m proud of you\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m happy for you\u201d or anything like the sort. No one roots for me. No feeling of happiness or satisfaction I have felt in almost a decade. No luck or success in almost a decade. Last night I thought about all these things and I finally decided that I don\u2019t know how but I have to improve myself. I have to better my life somehow. It\u2019s literally sink or swim. I know it\u2019s gonna be hard but I have to do it. I have to improve myself somehow. My first step is I am probably gonna try to concentrate on the first steps of getting fit. That will hopefully improve my overall mood, self esteem, luck in finding a romantic partner,  and make me feel less lazy and tired. Anyone have any advice on working out, or anything else related to helping improve oneself drastically?
