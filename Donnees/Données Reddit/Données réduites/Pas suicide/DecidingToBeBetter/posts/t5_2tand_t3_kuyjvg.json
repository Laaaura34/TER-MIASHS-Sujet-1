Not all bad, but starting to feel how tough it can be as I lay wide awake in bed for hours. My twin br (partner in crime, love the guy) and I decided to quit alcohol and weed for a month and see where it takes us. We've been pretty bad at abusing the stuff, especially of late since the holidays are rough for both of us. Today was the first day of absolutely no alcohol and not a puff of the good stuff. We cleaned our shared basement, top to bottom and even got to some cooking and felt good for the most part. Not gonna lie, the desire for just a little something to smoke or a shot or two of vodka (poison of choice whenever tequila was too expensive) has been pretty strong, feels bad. But the real rough part, surprisingly enough, has been trying to get some shut eye. It feels worse knowing that just a shot or two of something strong and I'd probably sleep like a rock. But hey, I know this is the right choice and it should get easier at some point. Tomorrow we're going to try to work out a little, we both used to before losing motivation a couple of years ago. I know it ain't gonna be easy and at this point, I'm just hoping I can finally get some sleep. But here's to doing better and the long road that waits *raises non-alcoholic beverage* cheers reddit and wish my bro and I some luck!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kuyjvg/its_always_rough_at_the_start_right/", "title": "It's always rough at the start, right?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "GPS_ClearNote", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1610353220, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kuyjvg/its_always_rough_at_the_start_right/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435882.0340564, "replies_charged": false}
