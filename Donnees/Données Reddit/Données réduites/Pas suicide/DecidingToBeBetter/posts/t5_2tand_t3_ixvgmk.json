Due to the pandemic, they are not letting me move out of my family home, despite the fact I will be 24 in a few months and I have a full time job. My friends all live in a different town from me and I have few opportunities to meet people, as my job is all remote. I'm just worried about a few things: \n\n1) That living at home for so long will hinder my development into becoming a proper adult. \n\n2) That by the time I'm able to see them without being scared of the virus (I am extremely immunocompromised) my friends will have abandoned me. \n\n3) That living with my parents so long will ruin my relationship with them. I already feel a huge amount of anger towards them, and it builds more and more every day. If I try to talk to them they will make it feel like my fault, or emotionally manipulate me. If I leave home without their permission it will destroy our relationship and I don't want that. \n\n4) The state of the world is so frightening and awful and I'm concerned I won't be able to do anything to make it better. \n\n5) That just by feeling sad I'm being a dick cause I have a relative amount of privilege.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ixvgmk/how_do_i_keep_from_despairing/", "title": "How do I keep from despairing", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Useful_Code", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1600806114, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ixvgmk/how_do_i_keep_from_despairing/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437852.1895418, "replies_charged": false}
