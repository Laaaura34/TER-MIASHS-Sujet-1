I am disabled,but have been brought up to contribute to society at large e.g. paid work or volunteering. \n\nI have been going to a social club at a church hall. I thought it must have been tiredness or Christmas but I still have this prersavive annoyance about the general attitudes of people in the group. They have time to play board games and drink coffee,but they will winge about how hard life is and they don't have money but will always have cigerates and money for soft drink. \n\nSo I am wondering if I need to have more compassion to them as they don't have a great education or a lot of great role models. But when I even suggest talking to the pastors or centrelink about some education or training, or fiscal planning. They just reject it. But at the same time I see that they don't want to help themselves. \n\nSo do I stop being so judgmental and have greater compassion or is this a normal response when you have been taught to take responsibility for your self and circumstances,and see other not talking accountability for themselves?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ekosno/do_i_have_need_to_widen_my_outlook/", "title": "Do I have need to widen my outlook?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "knightoftheidotic", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1578284892, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ekosno/do_i_have_need_to_widen_my_outlook/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438286.5914154, "replies_charged": false}
