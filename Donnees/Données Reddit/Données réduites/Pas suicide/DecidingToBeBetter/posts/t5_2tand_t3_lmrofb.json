I see people post some truly hard to read stories and talk about the steps they have taken. I\u2019ve seen posts about things as menial as remembering to brush teeth everyday. I often shake my head and count my blessings .\n\nThe last year of my life has been a personal journey. I got divorced. Lost, what some would call, an extreme amount of weight in the time frame. And most importantly I\u2019ve been working on my mindset. Confidence. Discipline. Self love. \n\nI trimmed out things in my life that hurt me more than helped me. Gaming every free second of the day. Social media consumption, way way down. People who are negative, see ya.\n\nI\u2019ve become a mental rock and often don\u2019t even recognize the mental voice in my head.\n\nBut yesterday my training failed me.\n\nI\u2019ve always struggled with anxiety and stress when things don\u2019t go according to plan. Even more so when I am looking forward to an event and something comes up that delays me from the thing I am excited about.\n\nCut to yesterday. It\u2019s been snowing a lot and my gym has been closed. I haven\u2019t seen most of my friends in a few days and I also hadn\u2019t got my post workout hit in days. I was pretty excited about it. 10 minutes before I leave work my boss comes over and has one of those deep discussions that take forever. Next thing I know I\u2019m 30mins past when I wanted to leave. No big deal. Little annoyed, but putting in quality face time with the boss is never a bad thing.\n\nSo I leave work. Have to pickup my dog from daycare. I get hung up in the melting snow. A kind stranger drives by, has a shovel, 10mins later I\u2019m out. I thank him and the karma gods for the assist.\n\nOk, gonna be a little late. No big deal. Text the group and tell them what happened. Within seconds I get 5 messages saying they will save me a spot and get me setup. \n\nGet home. Get the dog situated and gym clothes on. Get hung up again less than a mile from my front door. This is where I absolutely lost it. \n\nPanic. Fomo. Sadness. Crushing weight on my chest. Can\u2019t think straight. I spent 5 mins digging snow with my hands. Didn\u2019t help. Took a deep deep breath. Got in my car, literally backed up a foot and got out of the snow.\n\nMade it to the gym. Had an awesome time. I got home after and really reflected on the build up and subsequent freak out.\n\nWhy? What was so bad that I felt the need to get so out of control? Nothing. Some old  ways of thinking resurfaced and my improvements in the last year cracked a bit. Here is the positive takeaway. \n\nTwo years ago a day like that would have crippled me for a month. I would have indulged in some terrible food and sit on my butt feeling sorry for myself. And to make myself feel better I would have doubled down on the food. I would have made excuses for myself and accepted defeat.\n\nToday though I can write down what happened, take a look at it, shake my head, wad it up, and toss it in the trash. \n\nMental health is not a object we can buy. It\u2019s not something you can just decide to be at any given moment.\n\nIt\u2019s a muscle that requires exercise every single day. \n\nSometimes we get injured and need medication to get better. I\u2019ve been on pills. Don\u2019t need them anymore. I see a therapist every other month. It used to be every other week. \n\nTo work that muscle I read books about success and self improvement. I write in a journal when something stumps me. I browse Reddit and other sites for a break. For inspiration. For motivation.\n\nI never stop adding to the things that make me better. \n\nAnd that is deciding to be better.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lmrofb/yesterday_i_cracked/", "title": "Yesterday I cracked", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bunnzo", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613668280, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lmrofb/yesterday_i_cracked/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435592.0606773, "replies_charged": false}
