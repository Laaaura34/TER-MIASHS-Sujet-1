Most of that time is Instagram and Reddit (mostly reddit) .The info I'm getting from reddit doesn't really enrich my life. Other social media sites like instagram and Facebook make me constantly compare myself to others especially Facebook. I don't have any real social outlet so I don't get out much except to go to the gym. I tried Meetup but didn't make any lasting friendships from it. I want to draw and read books (not even sure what to draw honestly) . \n\nHow have you successfully controlled your smart phone usage ?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pd3mst/struggling_to_stay_off_my_phone/", "title": "Struggling to stay off my phone", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AUfan36", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 21, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630126773, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pd3mst/struggling_to_stay_off_my_phone/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436446.7172956, "replies_charged": false}
