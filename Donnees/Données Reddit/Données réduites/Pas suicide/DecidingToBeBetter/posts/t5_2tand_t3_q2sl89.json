But it's harming me to ask advice so often when I should be capable of making a decision and acting on it independently.\n\nI am constantly going to my friends, coworkers, family, facebook, etc. looking for validation on what step to take next, or what words I should say, or whether or not option A is better than option B... \n\nIt came to me when I was trying to figure out what to text a man I'm interested in dating. I typed up a draft and was about to ask some friends if the wording was OK when I suddenly realized if things *do* work out and I end up dating him, I can't communicate to him through the opinions of others! Then it was like a light switched on. *Am I really living my fullest life if I only take action after I get other people's approval?*\n\nIt's been really hard to follow through, so far. Every time a choice appears, I feel the urge to ask someone what they think or to go to Facebook or google. But I'm working on it, and so far the results are promising. I'm learning to trust myself and that I am perfectly capable of making my own decisions. The payoff is when one of those choices goes right, I feel empowered and confident!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2sl89/im_not_going_to_ask_for_your_advice/", "title": "I'm not going to ask for your advice.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Indecisive_INFP", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 317, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633551498, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2sl89/im_not_going_to_ask_for_your_advice/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436958.1673396, "replies_charged": false}
