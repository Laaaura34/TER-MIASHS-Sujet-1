It represents an amalgamation of all the most important aspects of life, and how they combine to establish a happy, meaningful existence.\n\nDespite dating as far back as 800 A.D, the concept is still valued dearly in many parts of Japan.\n\nI suggest looking up the Ikigai diagram, it perfectly summarises the concept. Without meeting all four requirements for Ikigai, one may never experience absolute fulfilment.\u00a0\n\nHow do you find your Ikigai?\n\nIt can be hard to tick all the boxes, especially in the demanding and unforgiving environment that is modern society.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that finding your Ikigai is no overnight task. It can take a great deal of time and identifying what you believe is your Ikigai is merely the first step, pursuing it comes next.\n\nStart by looking within. What do you value? What do you desire most? What do you believe in? What brings you joy?\n\nBy understanding yourself, you can better envision a life that will bring you the most fulfilment, a life in which you discover your Ikigai.\n\nIf you're like me, you often get obsessed with your goals and become narrow minded. We often get caught up believing that achieving all our financial, personal, spiritual goals etc will make us happy.\u00a0\n\nThis is never true. No achievement can bring lasting joy, only the attainment of a fulfilling and meaningful life, or Ikigai.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pz5wkq/the_japanese_philosophical_concept_that_changed/", "title": "The Japanese philosophical concept that changed my life (Have you discovered your Ikigai?)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LaurentMas", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 106, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633087218, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pz5wkq/the_japanese_philosophical_concept_that_changed/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436697.8159761, "replies_charged": false}
