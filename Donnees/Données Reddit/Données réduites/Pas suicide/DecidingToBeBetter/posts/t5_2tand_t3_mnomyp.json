And I have been thinking ... why not use this motivation to start my small business? It seems like a huge step but I have always wanted to and the overhead is very reasonable. \n\nMy question to you. What was your experience with putting yourself / your ideas / your creations out in the world? I\u2019m afraid I will be rejected and it will push me into a bad place, that fear is holding me back from many possibilities. \n\nWhat helped you take that step? Tbh I just wanna hear other experiences starting a business / putting yourself into the world. What was your biggest setback? How did you overcome? \n\nAll thoughts are welcome!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mnomyp/afraid_to_step_outside_my_comfort_zone/", "title": "Afraid to step outside my comfort zone", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Shananiganman", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617996226, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mnomyp/afraid_to_step_outside_my_comfort_zone/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435969.0982802, "replies_charged": false}
