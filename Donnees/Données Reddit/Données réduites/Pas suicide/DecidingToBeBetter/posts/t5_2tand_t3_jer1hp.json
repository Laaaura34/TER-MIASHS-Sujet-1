I never genuinely liked who I was, which got my into a constant depressive state. \n\nI coped with that by smoking weed and watching porn on a daily basis. It got my dopamine up for a few moments but in the long run made things way worse. \n\nThree weeks ago I quit the weed cold turkey, two weeks ago I went on Nofap. For the last few days I\u2018ve felt worse than I ever had before, because suddenly I had to go through all those negative emotions I\u2018ve been hiding from for years. I was crying everyday and to be honest, I thought about getting back into my old habits because all these emotions felt like being too much to handle at once. \n\nBut this morning I woke up and suddenly felt better. Not amazing, but different than the last days, weeks, months and years. There was an energy inside of me I\u2018ve never felt before. I decided to go to the gym and had the most powerful workout ever! I pushed through all my exercises and even did additional ones. Right now, I feel genuinely happy for the first time in years.\n\nWe all have our demons. I just wanted to tell you that it\u2019s possible to fight them, even if it feels impossible.
