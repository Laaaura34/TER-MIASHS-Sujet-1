This resulted in me withdrawing from society. \n\nI've been a high achiever all my life with scholarships through high school and college. I've always been in control and (I felt) on a path to success. This last year threw me. It shook me to my core and made me question my very existence. I frequently contemplated suicide.\n\nToday, I went out solo to a comedy show followed by a jazz bar. Granted, it's not much but it is the beginning of my journey of healing.
