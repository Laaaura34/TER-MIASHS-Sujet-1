I was crying uncontrollably but silently into my pillow. \n\nToday, I had a conversation with a classmate/friend. He\u2019s someone who\u2019s changed tremendously since the pandemic in mindset, going from a C to an A student. He has told me before that I inspire him. (I\u2019m a straight A student despite battling depression).\n\nSo we were talking, and I could see how hard he worked and what kind of difference he made. Sure, he had cheesy moments with listening to motivational audios, but he stuck to it and he was able to self-motivate. \n\nI saw how much confidence, self-worth and ambition he had, and realized he really did look up to me. I decided I didn\u2019t want to be that \u201crole model\u201d that committed suicide or that ended up allowing myself to tear myself apart. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy how just one person can make such a huge difference in your life. Hes motivated me to chase my goals and focus on myself and my life. \n\nThat being said, It\u2019s time for me to stop trying to live for others and finally live for myself. So what if I\u2019m insecure? It\u2019s time to realize my self-worth, practice self-love and radiate confidence. Cause really, all we have are ourselves. And if I\u2019m mean to myself, no one else will be able to convince me or help me. I have to do it myself. I\u2019m also going to try counselling again.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n6qkoy/yesterday_i_wanted_to_end_my_life_today_i_want_to/", "title": "Yesterday, I wanted to end my life.
