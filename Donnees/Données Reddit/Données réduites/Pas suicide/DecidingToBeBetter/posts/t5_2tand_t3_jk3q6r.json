I started this journal feeling powerless and overwhelmed, and you can see that in my first entry. Tonight, my last entry, is overflowing with an overall sense of trust in myself and the universe. To be able to look at a physical object like a journal and SEE your progress and your journey is simply priceless. It\u2019s so transformative.\n\nTo anyone who thinks that it\u2019s soo much of a time-suck to journal; to you I say: try it. I\u2019ve found that it has led me to my strength and power that has always been there, that sometimes gets obscured by passing clouds of fear. \nYou have this same strength and power in you too.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jk3q6r/just_finished_a_giant_journal_in_only_2_months/", "title": "Just finished a giant journal in only 2 months after a relapse in OCD and anxiety.
