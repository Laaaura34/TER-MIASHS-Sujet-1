Yay, right?      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\nWell, long story short, I need some sort of replacement. I have a small baby who still wakes frequently to nurse at night. In the past, browsing reddit and Instagram were the only things that could keep me awake enough while nursing, but not provide too much stimulation to wake me up fully.\nI tried staying awake out of sheer force of will but it has led to many, many hours falling asleep while holding the baby in the rocking chair, and I'm not willing to do that anymore. Not only is my sleep quality terrible but it doesn't seem like the safest option for my little bundle.       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there some other way to keep myself gently awake? Podcasts put me to sleep and I don't want to summon up the energy to read a book because I'll have trouble falling back asleep. Maybe there is an app out there that I'm not aware of, or some sort of pleasant site I can browse.        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway I'm just trying to make the best of my situation. I'm striving to be a problem solver, and this community has shown me time and time again that people can really help each other if that's what they want to do. I always love getting new perspectives from this group, so thank you in advance :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hp2ega/alternative_to_social_media/", "title": "Alternative to social media?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "deeeelightful", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 17, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1594434986, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hp2ega/alternative_to_social_media/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437677.0760293, "replies_charged": false}
