I wonder how I ended up where I did, while simultaneously being a loving partner, a caring son and a good co-worker. How did I live such a \u201cdouble life\u201d? Aren\u2019t I bad?\n\nWell, I\u2019m not \u201cbad\u201d. But I did a bad thing. Or, many bad things. And in my life, I will likely do more bad things. But I will also do good things. And I will try everyday to do more good than bad.\n\nYou are the sum of your actions, both good and bad. Everyone does both. But today, and each day is a new one. What will your actions be?\n\nGood luck to you all. I am still scared, ashamed and frightened. But I won\u2019t let that stop me from being the person I can be.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pqbwef/easier_to_tell_others_than_to_tell_myself_you_are/", "title": "Easier to tell others than to tell myself: You are neither a bad person or a good person", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AmIAwful222", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 173, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631923550, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pqbwef/easier_to_tell_others_than_to_tell_myself_you_are/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436917.5793033, "replies_charged": false}
