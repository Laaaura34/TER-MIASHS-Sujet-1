With people you\u2019ve known for years there is always something I found to ask \u201chow\u2019s your gran\u201d etc if I needed a topic.\n\nThe result is if I meet new people I tend to keep quiet or am blunt, to the point which makes people uncomfortable. I\u2019d say I\u2019m at the point I\u2019m borderline socially anxious, as if I\u2019m forced to talk to people for something other then work I\u2019ll beat myself up for hours or days afterwards that I came off as weird, boring, annoying, big headed etc etc.\n\nI want to stop beating myself up, I want to feel able to talk to people and leave a neutral, if not positive impression afterwards. \n\nCan anyone recommend books or videos which covers making small talk with strangers, or at least coping with the need to kick yourself in the arse after every little interaction??\n\nI\u2019ve tried Dale Carnghes how to make friends book and didn\u2019t find it very helpful.\n\nEdit : just wanted to say a big thank you to everyone who\u2019s offered their advice on this!!! When I posted I was hoping for a couple people to give up their time to offer some advice, so I\u2019m totally blown away by the number of people who\u2019ve offered some advice.
