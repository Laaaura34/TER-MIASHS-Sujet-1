Out of nowhere I experienced a hardship that I could have never seen coming: I had to become my dad's full time caretaker while we tried to find him an assisted living facility. Since he is a blind amputee suffering from diabetes, kidney failure, and the aftermath of two strokes it was incredibly emotionally and physically hard. The one silver lining I could find was that it taught me my strength as an independent person who was dedicated to my family member. Through this difficulty I didn't reach for others to support me I supported myself through it. Now that my dad is in a safe situation and I turn back to focus on my life I'm carrying this self esteem and unwillingness to upset the balance of my life for just anyone that I could cling to. I'm going to wait for someone who is a healthy choice for my life and in the meantime I'm going to accomplish my goals of living a healthy lifestyle and working on my hobbies while maintaining deep connections to my friends and family.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l5byp2/ive_stopped_needing_someone/", "title": "I've Stopped Needing Someone", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "terribleoatmeal44", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1215, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1611659576, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l5byp2/ive_stopped_needing_someone/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435270.4061978, "replies_charged": false}
