I used to just lie around all day playing games and switching among my social media apps. BUT TODAY, I GOT TO CROSS OUT AN IMPORTANT TASK I HAVE BEEN WANTING TO FINISH. It's just a small important task but it's still progress. I missed the feeling of satisfaction of getting things done. I know it's still a long journey to achieve my goal but hey, one step at a time.\n\nI hope this continues and that my bad habits will be replaced by good healthy habits.\n\nHope you guys had a good day too!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mkquo4/it_feels_so_good_to_have_crossed_out_an_important/", "title": "It feels so good to have crossed out an important task in my to do list after more than a month", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "himurakii", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617645914, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mkquo4/it_feels_so_good_to_have_crossed_out_an_important/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438114.553945, "replies_charged": false}
