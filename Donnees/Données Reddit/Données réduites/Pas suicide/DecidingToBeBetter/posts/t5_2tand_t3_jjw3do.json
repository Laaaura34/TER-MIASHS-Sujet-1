I\u2019m 30, with Asperger\u2019s and I feel I have no direction. No friendships, no relationships, no particular skills, nothing.\n\n10 years ago, I was much more optimistic. I was a year away from graduating with a bachelor\u2019s degree in broadcast journalism. I was burning out, but I felt it would be worth it once I landed a job at a news station and one day become an anchor.\n\nWhat a fool I was. Me, landing a job like that? What was I thinking? I could never even get my foot in the door, let alone be offered an opportunity.\n\nNow, I\u2019m an estimator. And after 6 years, I\u2019m done. I\u2019m sick of it. I need to do something else with my life.\n\nBut I have no idea what to do. My only real skill is anchoring, but how can I do that if I can\u2019t even get the chance? I\u2019m utterly useless. I\u2019m sure if I had an anchoring job, I feel like my life would change instantly for the better, but it\u2019s not going to happen. That dream has long been dead.\n\nPlus, I want to move out and finally live on my own. Thought about visiting San Diego but then COVID happened. Besides, it\u2019s too expensive and California is a hellhole at this point anyway.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. Life sucks and I feel old as hell, I may as well be 65 at this point.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jjw3do/i_turned_30_today_and_i_feel_miserable/", "title": "I turned 30 today.
