We\u2019ve been together 4 years and I\u2019ve always felt confident in our relationship, but for whatever reason my anxiety has completely broken that down. \nI worry all the time that I\u2019m too much, or he\u2019s not understanding enough, or my issues are going to ruin everything. \nI am in therapy, and of course I\u2019m trying everything I can think of to overcome this. \nBut today it dawned on me that I lean too much of my personal well being on him. I expect him to navigate my every mood and be a perfect man, to be my rescuer and confidant. No one is perfect and I need to be my own savior. \nI decided it is ok to express my insecurities, but that ultimately I have to be better and heal my own wounds. \nFigured I\u2019d put this somewhere public to hold myself accountable.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lv2knk/healing_is_my_responsibility/", "title": "Healing is my responsibility.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bigbobgirl", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 23, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614582189, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lv2knk/healing_is_my_responsibility/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438454.2167976, "replies_charged": false}
