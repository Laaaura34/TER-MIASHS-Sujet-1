It's a small amount, but I figure that means one educational/semi-educational book every 3 months, which is more than I did last year! I started reading Disability Visibility (edited by Alice Wong). I like it so far!\n\nI've been having a bad week but this is a small accomplishment. I have some people in my life who plant lots of seeds of doubt (about work, school, mental health) in my head but am trying to remind myself that I am making the best decisions for *me* right now, not them.
