Struggled with depression, broke up with my girlfriend, lost some people, had my days packed with things to do between high school and conservatory (music college) and of course whatever there is to do in the average person's life. Since I graduated from high school, I find a lot more free time to do what I like. May it be making myself a culture about movies, art, playing some videogames, things that I once had to deprive myself of because I honestly couldn't make time for it. And when I wake up in the morning and at a certain point finish all the things I needed to finish for college, I feel so guilty about just wanting to do nothing. Nothing at all. Even stay on the couch and stare at a wall. Even though I'm done with deadlines and work, I just can't face the fact that I'm finally free. I have anxiety while watching a movie that I need to stop it and do something else, same with all the rest really. My mind can't accept this freedom, and I need to do something about it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jc6lct/i_want_to_learn_how_to_take_time_for_my_own_well/", "title": "I want to learn how to take time for my own well being and not feel guilty about it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AngeloTYork", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1602839259, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jc6lct/i_want_to_learn_how_to_take_time_for_my_own_well/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438413.2839718, "replies_charged": false}
