I\u2019ve always been self conscious of the size of my feet after getting picked on relentlessly by my family. (Everyone has size 6, im a size 9 but also almost a foot taller).\n\nI was trying to squeeze my feet into 9, 9.5 but my feet hurt so bad after work. Finally, I went to a 10 and can barely feel them at all until closer to the end of the day.\n\nEdit: can\u2019t believe how many tall women out there felt the same.
