In college I did therapy thru the school but they give you limited sessions and I left unfulfilled. \n\nAfter graduating and working internal roadblocks kept me from reaching out such as the cost. I always assumed i'd have to pay out of pocket. Maybe corona changed that. \n\nI also had a dumb idea that if I get diagnosed with anything I won't be able to own firearms. After resolving all these thoughts (finding therapists in-network, realizing I am only affected if I am a danger to myself and others) i decided, THREE years after graduating I cannot wait any longer.\n\nI cannot be a side character NPC in my own life. So I submitted a form, got a paired and my first intake session is Thursday.\n\nI am riding this high all week baby. I am so so proud of myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nudpji/my_first_therapy_session_is_scheduled_for_later/", "title": "My first therapy session is scheduled for later this week!!!!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Baby_venomm", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 79, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623075647, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nudpji/my_first_therapy_session_is_scheduled_for_later/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437465.270332, "replies_charged": false}
