No details because they don\u2019t matter anymore. \n\nAround thanksgiving we moved across county and started over. We are still living with family but we are caught up on our bills and have saved some money. We will be moving out this next month when we find a house. \n\nI\u2019ve been hitting the gym and lost 50 fucking pounds since Black Friday (I was broke, no money, so used my FIL\u2019s home gym and have been every other day since)! We\u2019re doing Christmas for our kids this weekend because we were too broke to do anything on the actual holiday. I can\u2019t explain how good that feels. \n\nI feel great. My family feels great. \n\nMy old account reflected all the pain and trauma we went through. I decided to delete it. I was still rereading all my posts and comments from the dark times and it was not doing me any favors. So I\u2019m deciding to be better. I\u2019m not living in the past any more. \n\nI still don\u2019t have friends, but I wanted to share this with someone. I\u2019m not letting my past pain leash me anymore. Thanks for reading my dudes, you\u2019re all fucking awesome for wanting to be better! :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/euqq9e/i_have_changed_my_life_i_lost_50_pounds_started/", "title": "I have changed my life.
