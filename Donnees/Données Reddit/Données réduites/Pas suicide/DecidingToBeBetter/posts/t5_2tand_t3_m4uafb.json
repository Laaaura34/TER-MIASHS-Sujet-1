Because I haven\u2019t found a special someone yet. Because my body isn\u2019t the right shape. Because I\u2019m poor. Who I am is not good enough.\u201d\n\nWhy do so many people relate to those words? Why is the default mental narrative of so many people \u201cI\u2019m a failure and I have no hope of getting better\u201d?\n\nWho put those poisonous words in your head? Who taught you to feel so much shame? I don\u2019t think this is you. I think you\u2019re trying to live someone else\u2019s life, walk in someone else\u2019s shoes and stumbling because they don\u2019t fit right.\n\nBecause society has a lot of expectations about your life. Society has a scoring rubric about what a good career looks like, or a happy relationship, or a flawless body. Society projects a lot of ideals onto us about the \u201cright life.\u201d And I think you\u2019re breaking your toes trying to fit into a shoe that was never made for you.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to tell you that you\u2019re a special star in your own way and you\u2019re better than society\u2019s stupid ideals. If you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ve got issues, you have scars, and there\u2019s a lot you want to do better. And it\u2019s good to try and get better. But you\u2019re not going to go very far while you keep hobbling in that ridiculously poor fitting shoe.\n\nYou are not a failure just because you don\u2019t fit the mold life tried to force onto you. Everyone has different experiences growing up, different skills, different passions, different fears. How insane is it that we could all turn out the same way? The mold society has is just a guide that helps society survive. \n\nIf everyone in a society tries to be healthy and climb the ladder at work then the society will have a good economy and prosper. That\u2019s the point of the mold. It\u2019s not designed to make you happy, it\u2019s not designed with an individual in mind, and it is impossible that more than a handful of random people could fit it perfectly. That\u2019s why we glorify workaholics and people that volunteer and successful entrepreneurs. These are all individuals that happen to benefit the economy or their community. Society teaches us to value the things that are good for society - not us.\n\nYou are not a failure. You are just trying to wear someone else\u2019s shoes. So stop tearing yourself apart. Stop saying \u201cI\u2019m a failure because X\u201d and ask if X is actually important to you or if society just said it was. Ask yourself what is really important to you, and focus on that. \n\nI spent so many nights hating myself because my career was mundane. I felt broken because I was introverted and didn\u2019t like going out. I thought I was hideous and ugly because I didn\u2019t have a six pack. I thought something was wrong with me because I didn\u2019t know how to be what society wanted.\n\nThat\u2019s horseshit. Working 80 hours a week isn\u2019t actually important to me. Going to bars or clubs wasn\u2019t important to me. And I could be perfectly healthy without having a six pack. So why did I treat those like failures? \n\nI don\u2019t know you. I don\u2019t know things about yourself you really want to change and which parts simply don\u2019t match the blueprint society gave you. But I need you to think about it. I need you to ask yourself what is really important. Ask yourself who you want to be. Because society doesn\u2019t know what is best for you. And life won\u2019t get better until you figure that out for yourself.\n\nThe best you is someone who enjoys each day. Someone who doesn\u2019t tear themselves apart because their values are different than society\u2019s. Someone who learns what is important to them and tries to be a better version of themself - not someone who tries to be someone else.\n\nAccepting who you are doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re perfect and shouldn\u2019t try to improve. It just means **you\u2019re not a failure for who you are today.** We\u2019re all works in progress. And if we stop hating ourselves for 5 minutes we can look around and enjoy taking one step forward today even if there\u2019s a lot of steps left. \n\nWhen you get to the end, it\u2019s over. When you get to your last step you\u2019re going to wish you had taken your time and smelled the roses along the way. You\u2019re never going to be perfect. So don\u2019t wish away the days that you\u2019re getting better. Try to accept who you are and enjoy them. \n\nStop trying to live someone else\u2019s life. This is your life, and you can\u2019t get it back once it is gone.\n\nFurther reading: If this resonated with you then I highly recommend \u201cThe Alchemist\u201d by Paulo Coelho. It\u2019s a short novel about finding what is important to you, and it\u2019s helped a lot of people disengage from the society life gave them that they never wanted. You will never be happy while living someone else\u2019s life. Take off those horrible shoes. They\u2019re causing you so much pain, you\u2019ll go much farther when you live the life that fits you.
