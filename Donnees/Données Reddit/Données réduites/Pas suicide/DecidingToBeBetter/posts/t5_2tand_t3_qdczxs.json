However, there were a lot of \"bad moments\" there which I reflected back now (mostly my behavior and how I came across socially). for one, when I came late and walked into the room full of mostly people i have yet to meet and know, I didn't know what to do, so I interrupted people's conversation by inviting myself into the conversation due to nervousness and not wanting to be \"that guy\" that hovers around the table by myself. The i shook everyone's hand (can I get anymore awkward?)\n\nthen, instead of staying around for the conversation I leave the group and order myself drinks ( just to get away from awkwardness) and then i saw someone i sort of knew and approach him to start aa conversation. I was already sweating at that point. We got to talking and since I havent seen him in a month, I figured ill revisit a conversation we had in the past. I only remembered bits and pieces of it, and to make it even more awkward I couldn't come up with a coherent conversation with him. it was all jibber jabber and i could tell he wanted to get away from the conversation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nbecause this is a social group I see regularly, how do i get over the embarassment of that party?\n\nhow can i be self assured and confident in myself after this?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdczxs/how_do_i_get_over_embarrassment_in_the_past/", "title": "how do i get over embarrassment in the past?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Registeelurgirl", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 57, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634893977, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdczxs/how_do_i_get_over_embarrassment_in_the_past/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435937.7629676, "replies_charged": false}
