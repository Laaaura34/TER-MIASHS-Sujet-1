I currently have a tumor that has been eating me alive for 8 years. But today I was like fuck that, I am so sick and tired of living like this. So I  got my ass up to the gym and started to workout. I wish someone told me this sooner, but always do what you can. Even though it's not your 100% percent effort, doing something is much better than not doing anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you for the award <3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: If anyone else is struggling feel free to PM me. I will do my best to be there for you.
