Some nights I have had to lie on my bed for hours and tense all the muscles in my body to stop myself from moving and doing it again. The last time I relapsed I was hospitalized. It had been 11 months before that time so I thought I was doing well and wouldn't do it again. I was wrong. Maybe from that experience I have been more compelled to stop. Idk. Either way I'm proud of myself for coming this far. \n\nRight now I feel like I might never do it again, although I am worried other behaviours may develop. I keep wanting to self destruct in other ways; stealing things, drinking/drugs, dangerous activities. I have resisted most of it so far. \n\nI just hope I can keep this up. It's exhausting but I'm fighting like hell anyways.\n\nEdit: thankyou for your kind words of support. I know a lot of people are going through similar shit, and I'm rooting for you too\n\nEdit 2: you're all so awesome. Feeling kinda emotional damn. For anyone reading this post who is struggling with this or something similar, the support in the comments applies to you too, not just me. Whether it's 1 day, 12 months or 12 years, we're all fighting, and there is support out there.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ohapi5/24m_it_has_been_12_months_since_i_last_self/", "title": "(24M) It has been 12 months since I last self harmed; the longest time I have resisted it since I started at age 18", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "jessiejohn", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1424, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625886288, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ohapi5/24m_it_has_been_12_months_since_i_last_self/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437931.8707557, "replies_charged": false}
