I told myself I got it prescribed so I needed certain drugs in order to function. I didn't. I thought addiction was something that happened to others, not to me. Then I overdosed on Benzodiazepines and it almost killed me. My father carried me down the stairs. My mother and sister cried. I can't remember anything for 3 days. I realized, okay I had fucked up, it won't happen again. I'm more careful now. No, fuck that, there's no such thing as taking small amounts of drugs. And no, I don't have it under control. In fact, ever since I started with the drugs, my life has been spiralling out of control. Fucking idiot. I gave my sister (who's conveniently a cop) my entire stash. I was high yesterday and did stupid things again. Then, I realized, I'm an addict and I have to start treating myself as one. Here's to being clean.
