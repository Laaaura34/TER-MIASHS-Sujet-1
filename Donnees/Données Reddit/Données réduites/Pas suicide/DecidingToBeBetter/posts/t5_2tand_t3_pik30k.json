For some context I am a 20 year old college student in America and I also plays a division 1 sport at my uni. I don\u2019t have much of a problem being healthy like working out and eating well because I play a sport but I\u2019m so stuck in my comfort zone and I love to spend time with myself. I also smoke weed daily in the afternoon after my day is over. I have a mix of really healthy habits with bad ones like getting high and not doing anything productive. My real goal is to start a business while I\u2019m in school so I can really dive into something with my time but for some reason I just can\u2019t take the first step. I\u2019ve started small businesses before but something within me is holding me back from diving in. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if this turned out as a jumbled rant but in essence, I feel dissatisfied with myself and want to push myself more in my life. I\u2019d appreciate any advice y\u2019all have.
