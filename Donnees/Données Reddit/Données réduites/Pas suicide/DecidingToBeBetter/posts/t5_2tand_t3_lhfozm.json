I\u2019ll be studying gemology at GIA. I\u2019m beyond shocked that this is actually happening. Moving across country to Cali is scary as hell. I\u2019ve never moved out of state. It\u2019s gonna be a big change but I think that\u2019s exactly what I need. I was waitlisted for April but found out the other day I got a seat. It\u2019s pretty late notice so I\u2019m starting a get a little anxious but I\u2019ve been in a rut for many years now. Feeling lost and hopeless. Getting out of my element and comfort zone is probably a good thing and something I\u2019m really in need of. This is the first step to my future. This is the first time I\u2019ve looked forward to my future since I can\u2019t even remember when. I\u2019m so thankful and feel blessed to have this opportunity. Well I just wanted to share! Hope you\u2019re having a great day :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lhfozm/first_positive_step_ive_taken_in_6_years/", "title": "First positive step I\u2019ve taken in 6 years.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "saaspi", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613029192, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lhfozm/first_positive_step_ive_taken_in_6_years/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435566.148565, "replies_charged": false}
