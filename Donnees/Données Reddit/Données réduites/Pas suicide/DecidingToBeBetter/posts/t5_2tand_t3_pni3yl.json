I need to quit drinking. I love beer, & I'm scared.\n\nMy boyfriend broke up with me this morning because my drinking has gotten out of hand. I honestly didn't know I had a problem, or didn't think it was that bad, until he brought it up. I didn't listen, & now I'm a little hungover, single, & heartbroken. \n\nI've never tried to quit drinking before. I can hold off for a few days here & there, but usually have a few beers daily, & even more on the weekends. I know I can do this. It's going to be hard, & I am a little scared. But, I've got to do this for my physical & mental well being.
