First slowly, then the past 3 days it went straight down hill. \nWe battled it as hard as we could. But the spreading and the nature of the medicine finally caught up. \nI am sitting here with him in hospice care today. Talking about everything he's taught me. All the good times and lessons. All the good whoopings he gave me. (If you had a good whooping before, you know the mindset and laughs it brings now) \nThis man, will always be in my heart as the strongest man in the world!\nAnd I'll miss him dearly. So until I can't be here anymore, I'll sit right next to him. And we'll keep fighting as long as he wants. \n\nI've done my crying for now and I know there's more to come. But for now, we show our love!\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8qefu3/another_update_sad_one/", "title": "Another Update!
