That\u2019s where my question fits in. \n\nBasically I\u2019ve recently been exercising daily, I\u2019ve started taking vitamins and have cut sugar ( especially sugary drinks out of my diet ) \nI\u2019ve been working out. So hard to get started, but I can feel results in the last 2 weeks. They aren\u2019t strenuous, but I\u2019m a lot farther then I was as I want to and decided to be better. \n\nI do have psych problems. Anxiety and depression. Also I am tired so much of the day. So my question is in your opinion if I\u2019m taking a medication ( which I am ) completely as directed, would you consider that getting better?\n\nThe medication is called Modafinil. Ive abused it in the past and that is why I feel really guilty taking it and feel like I\u2019m doing the wrong thing every time I take it. \n\nIt helps me stay up 12 hours rather then sleep all day. ( 12 hours is just an example. ) it is prescribed for chronic fatigue / daytime drowsiness. \n\nI abused it in the past to where I stopped using it. \nNow I take it exactly as prescribed and it works for me really well. It is a medication to promote awareness. It\u2019s considered a stimulant, but not like adderall etc ( which I used to abuse as well ) \n\nBy taking the dose as prescribed do you consider it something I shouldn\u2019t take at all because I have abused it. \n\nLiterally have problems keeping my eyes open for more then 60mins during the day. Always tired. \n\nI want to make sure I\u2019m getting better. Maybe you have to be a past addict to know why I feel guilty just taking it. \n\nIt\u2019s all opinion, can I have yours please.
