I'm not really looking for cosmetic results, and honestly imo that's a dangerous reason to be working out anyway. I started to excercise because I wanted to feel more functional and energetic, and also to lower potential health issues. The results have been amazing so far! I feel much more confident and my posture has improved. I also don't get digestion pains after eating and my water intake has been up to par! My friends and my mother have been telling me that I have more of a glow to my face lately as well. I think I may be sticking with excercising for a looooong time :) it makes me feel so happy and I've grown accustomed to feeling the burn and warming my buns with dem squats lol", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/accw3f/excercising_has_made_my_life_a_little_bit_more/", "title": "Excercising has made my life a little bit more joyful :)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bunny6902", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1546565581, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/accw3f/excercising_has_made_my_life_a_little_bit_more/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437343.6078975, "replies_charged": false}
