Things that make them popular. \n\nBut no. I don\u2019t have to be charming to make friends, I don\u2019t have to be a model to date, I don\u2019t have to hang out with drug dealers to party. \n\nThinking about it now, it\u2019s truly silly. \n\nI just have to calm down and do what I want to do. Which, I can do anything. I don\u2019t have to be this kind of person to do this kind of thing.\n\nI only need to believe in myself.
