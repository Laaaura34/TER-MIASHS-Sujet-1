The challenges I set myself tend to be 30 days long and so far, I've been able to stop drinking alcohol for a full month, eat completely healthily for a full month, meditate for 30 days and I'm currently journaling and doing appreciation exercises for 30 days. I'm really happy with my progress and I've already got a more positive outlook on life and feel more optimistic. \n\nIf you're spending a lot of time with a pessimistic mindset and think everything's terrible in the world, I really recommend you set yourself challenges to improve this, particularly things around fitness, meditation and appreciation as they've completely moved me from a pessimist to an optimist and my head hasn't felt this clear for a long time!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ltq696/ive_been_using_challenges_to_try_and_help_me/", "title": "I've been using challenges to try and help me become better, healthier and happier!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "HammerTime1966", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614438989, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ltq696/ive_been_using_challenges_to_try_and_help_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437599.3552902, "replies_charged": false}
