It keeps me in track whenever I notice that my mental health is sinking, but I'm still having a hard time making it consistent. I tried using the habit sandwich thing (cue habit, habit have to do, habit enjoy doing) but I don't have enough habits that I do consistently everyday/cues and reward not enough to make me do the needed habit (especially during bad days/week). You can say that I don't have enough discipline yet, but I work at home and have bills to pay. I'm on optional meds, but I don't like drinking unless I'm already at a bad state. What do you guys do during bad days to make sure you're still productive enough?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/omn39n/people_with_anxietydepression_what_technique/", "title": "People with anxiety/depression, what technique worked the best for you?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "madreloidpx", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626599226, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/omn39n/people_with_anxietydepression_what_technique/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438036.606147, "replies_charged": false}
