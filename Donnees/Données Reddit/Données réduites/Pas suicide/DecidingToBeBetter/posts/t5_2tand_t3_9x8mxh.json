I\u2019m often disappointed as my expectations rarely meet reality. I get laid off, im broke, im not where I want to be. I\u2019m often left angry and bitter as I try to control the situation.\n\nI want to learn to not grip so tightly and be a bit more accepting of the situation. The one time I was able to do this consciously was when I was afflicted with tinnitus. I developed a terrible ringing sound in my ears three years ago that drove me insane for about 6 months. I looked for every cure in the world, but finally after a long time of suffering, I just told myself that it is what it is and the ringing was a part of my life now. After giving to fix the affliction the ringing became less prominent and stopped bothering me as much. I moved on and I wouldn\u2019t hear the ringing for weeks at a time. Unfortunately I haven\u2019t been able to be so accepting over other psychological and/or mental barriers.\n\nPlease no Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck references. I want to know how you personally deal with this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/9x8mxh/how_do_you_let_go_of_control/", "title": "How do you let go of control?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Poptotnot", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1542262931, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/9x8mxh/how_do_you_let_go_of_control/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437693.5611053, "replies_charged": false}
