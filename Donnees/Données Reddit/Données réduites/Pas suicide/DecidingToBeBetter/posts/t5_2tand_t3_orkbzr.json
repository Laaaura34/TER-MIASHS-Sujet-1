There was a point where I was getting fast food for lunch everyday and I've basically been eating nothing but carbs since April. I've been feeling really ill physically and I think it's because of my diet and dehydration alongside my normal mental issues.\n\nSo I decided to force a change and go to the store. I stocked up on vegetables, some protein, water jugs, and lightweight snacks. It feels strange to think about how most people don't struggle to get groceries while it drains me mentally but I'm going to force it into becoming habit. I've also set up meal plans for the week, including lunches and dinners. They're quick and easy, but relatively healthy. There are a few prepackaged things, like yogurts and trail mixes, but those are mainly for my lunch or snacks when I'm high so that I don't end up going out to get anything.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/orkbzr/i_went_grocery_shopping_for_the_first_time_in/", "title": "I went grocery shopping for the first time in months", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Cosmic-Blight", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627248194, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/orkbzr/i_went_grocery_shopping_for_the_first_time_in/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436148.7329922, "replies_charged": false}
