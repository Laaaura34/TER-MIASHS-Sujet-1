I'm a dreamer, escapist so I get pleasure from lonely rides on my motorcycle or hiking while admiring the sceneries. This doesn't mean I don't like people though, I often spend time with my family and bunch of close friends. \n\nThe thing is, I've never been good at developing new relationships. The thought of meeting someone new has always made me anxious and scared, even if I wanted to meet someone. \n\nWell, this summer things has changed, maybe because of the lockdown or whatever. Got a long time neighbor who's always been pretty kind to me and wanted to hang out in the past, but I've always been quite cold and rejectful towards him. Decided to just get out of my comfort zone and start being more friendly. \n\nNow after half a year we see each other every week or so and go hiking together and such. This made me realize that I wasn't really that anxious or scared. I was just too comfortable with myself and lazy to do something about it. \n\nAltough it is still not easy and natural to me to speak to strangers, I'll try to be more active and willing to make friends. Ultimate goal being finding a GF.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l6f7uh/i_got_out_of_my_comfort_zone_and_made_a_friend/", "title": "I got out of my comfort zone and made a friend.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Cold_Wilderness", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 257, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1611783926, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l6f7uh/i_got_out_of_my_comfort_zone_and_made_a_friend/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435943.5434587, "replies_charged": false}
