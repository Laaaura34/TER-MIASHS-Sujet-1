I've been on autopilot for too long and now that I decided that this era has to end, there are too many things I have to deal with and fix at once. I'm trying to concentrate on only one thing at a time, but sometimes it gets overwhelming (anxiety) and/or I have to gather my basically non-existent motivation to take the necessary steps (depression).\n\nNot here to victimize myself, or if I am already doing that, then I want to stop treating myself that way. I know the best advice here would be to just push myself anyway, take action and do things, and that's what I'm trying to do everyday, but at the same time I feel myself \"wanting\" to go back to autopilot and just go with the flow because that's more comfortable and easy, I guess. But I can't keep doing that and I don't want to do that anymore.\n\nHow do you break down your own barriers? How do you get motivation out of nowhere? How do you stop making excuses for yourself? And how do you find the healthy balance between trying hard and taking mental breaks? I want to change my situation - sadly that alone won't make my mind and old habits adapt to that mindset immediately though, that's why I decided to write here, maybe someone had gone through the same things and can give advice from their own experience.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o488me/im_my_own_biggest_obstacle/", "title": "I'm my own biggest obstacle", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "anxiety___throw", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624203305, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o488me/im_my_own_biggest_obstacle/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435263.7586892, "replies_charged": false}
