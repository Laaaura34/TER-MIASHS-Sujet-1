It was becoming a huge problem in my life. I would just stare at it all day looking at pics of Dua Lipa and other beautiful women trying to figure out why I didn't look like them (spoiler alert: it's not because I'm ugly, it's because I'm broke). I've noticed it's been a lot quieter in my head and I'm actually getting really, truly bored for the first time in years. It's pushed me to look into new hobbies and evaluate how I spend my time. I don't want to waste it scrolling, trying to get validation from people online that I will never meet. I've also just been exploring more of who I am and trying to learn how to be comfortable as me. My boyfriend and I played cards last night and had a blast instead of scrolling on the couch next to each other while a TV show plays in the background. I already spend 40hrs a week sitting in front of a computer, why do I choose to spend my free time on my damn phone?? It's baffling. Anyways, I am going to go bake cornbread now instead of watching my peers from a tiny screen and hating myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1mm0t/deleted_my_social_media/", "title": "Deleted my social media", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DifferentPilot6", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 27, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633405156, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1mm0t/deleted_my_social_media/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435345.1544666, "replies_charged": false}
