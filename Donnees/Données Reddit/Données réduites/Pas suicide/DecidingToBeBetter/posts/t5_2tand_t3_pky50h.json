So i got invited to a program that piqued my and my parents attention.\n Its an exchange student program. To select students they are gonna invite us to a hotel for 2 days. There will be all kind of tasks that will test your determination, motivation, flexibility, problem solving ability (so what would you in different situation etc ..), and there will be group tasks too. For the countries i want to go only has 5 spots and there will probably be  100+ kid with me.\n Luckly i had these kind of tasks in my past life, but i have never taken a test this serious. So i would like to ask you, yes you dear reader, to give me advice, or yt videos about these topics.\nThank you very much for your attention.
