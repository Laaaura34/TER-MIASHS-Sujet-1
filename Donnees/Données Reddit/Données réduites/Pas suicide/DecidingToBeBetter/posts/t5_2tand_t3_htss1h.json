My parents keep pushing me to go to university n I'm in it right now. They said this opportunity is limited n not everyone is privileged to have it. I understand that but I don't find joy in it. My mom encourage me if I want to work. But with my qualifications right now it's hard to survive in nowdays economy. I doubt that I can last more that 5 months out of my parents house. I can do all the assignments but I need lot of support. I'm more comfortable to work in a team than going solo. When I'm alone people didn't help much, they just give roughly ideas where as in group we discuss everything. It's hard for me because I don't find joy in it and I have to do it alone. And I don't want to keep asking for people help because at some point they will feel fed up and eventually will try to avoid me. So any suggestions what should I do? I'm afraid of to go either of both way (uni Vs work) because the reality is always different from what we expect.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/htss1h/im_lost/", "title": "I'm lost", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "iamPrunus", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 0, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1595124517, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/htss1h/im_lost/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437857.6222029, "replies_charged": false}
