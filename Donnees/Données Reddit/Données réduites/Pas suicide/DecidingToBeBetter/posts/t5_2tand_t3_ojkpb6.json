I signed up for a CrossFit foundations class that starts the first week of August and I\u2019m so excited to take a big step toward my goal of getting stronger. I won\u2019t back out because I can\u2019t afford to lose $160!\n\nI\u2019ve been deeply depressed for years and feel like I hit rock bottom recently. I eat like crap, I don\u2019t exercise, I don\u2019t have a full time job anymore, and my marriage is falling apart. I tried and failed to sell my art full time over the past year. I knew I needed to reevaluate my life choices. \n\nLast month I started a part time job. It\u2019s not much but I\u2019m feeling good about getting out of the house and having social interactions while I continue applying to full time jobs. \n\nI also started learning Spanish online and am working on doing that more often in my downtime instead of just scrolling the internet.\n\nCrossFit feels like a big step in all this because I know it\u2019s going to be demanding and I\u2019ll have to truly push myself at it. I hope to feel better physically and feel more confident in my ability to overcome challenges. \n\nBasically wanted to make this post as a reminder of my optimism and hold myself accountable. Hopefully in a few months I\u2019ll look back and be proud I actually followed through.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ojkpb6/making_changes_signed_up_for_crossfit_ready_to/", "title": "Making changes, signed up for CrossFit, ready to put in the work", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "behindasynthesizer", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 15, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626198109, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ojkpb6/making_changes_signed_up_for_crossfit_ready_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437468.5873687, "replies_charged": false}
