I can\u2019t do anything without my phone not even eat breakfast without checking social media.I keep mindlessly scrolling and it\u2019s not even that I enjoy what I\u2019m viewing or take interest in it it\u2019s just that I\u2019m super addicted. I\u2019m so addicted that I stay up all night on my phone messing up my sleep pattern (like right now) if anyone has any tips on how to get rid of a SEVERE social media addiction please comment because this is seriously taking over my life.
