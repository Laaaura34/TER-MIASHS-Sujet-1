But I'm trying to do a lot less of the former and cut out the latter entirely, and I'm finding that nothing else honestly sounds like much fun.\n\nI used to love playing music, but I find myself looking at my instruments and thinking, \"What would I even play?\" I know how good it can feel to exercise, but it feels more like a boring chore than something I actually look forward to. I used to do martial arts, but that's expensive to get back into. I love video games, but I get bored of them so quickly these days, and don't want to have to spend $60 on a new one that I probably won't like anyway. I have friends I could Zoom with, but I can't shake the feeling that they don't really want to spend time hanging with me, or they would have reached out already.\n\nIt seems like nothing can replace the two destructive habits I'm trying to remove from my free time. But I know that's not actually true. How do I get past it? Are there new things I can try? Or new ways to approach my old hobbies that might help me enjoy them again?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/md7bkb/how_can_i_spend_my_free_time_instead_of_drinking/", "title": "How can I spend my free time instead of drinking and watching porn?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "goddamnithurts", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616703313, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/md7bkb/how_can_i_spend_my_free_time_instead_of_drinking/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437742.9091098, "replies_charged": false}
