Over the years i have really let myself go. I am slowly seeing myself descend into an obesity spiral. I am fully aware of it and I for some reason I can't get out of this struggle. I often told myself I need to do something about my life. I've tried hitting the gym, I even bought home equipment, tried to start a routine but it always fails.\n\nI know I need a calorie defecit. I need to track calories. Get active, do HIITS, or basically any form of exercise even small walks.\n\nI simply can't bring myself to do it yet I am fully aware that I have to do it.\n\nI'm not sure why it seems so difficult. Am I just really freaking lazy and unmotivated or is it something else?\n\nMaybe I just don't have what it takes. Maybe I'm just not strong enough. Maybe I'm just whining about being unable to lose weight while not doing anything.\n\nHow do I stop it all before I destroy myself?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2xzdb/how_to_i_stop_myself_from_spiraling_into_obesity/", "title": "How to I stop myself from spiraling into obesity before its too late?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TheBoundedNutShell", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633568868, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2xzdb/how_to_i_stop_myself_from_spiraling_into_obesity/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435944.3913012, "replies_charged": false}
