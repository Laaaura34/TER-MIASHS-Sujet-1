Here's a little update on how I've been. Recently my business has been doing well and I landed my first two clients after weeks of cold calling. The biggest improvement I've made to my life is my new value in education. I've actually reinvested my efforts back into learning, I'm starting with relearning the original course that helped me start my business, But my advice to everyone is to value education and always continue to be a student. I'm not someone who is successful yet, but I do know that all the success I have had comes from learning and being a student", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lgcu8z/never_stop_learning/", "title": "Never Stop Learning", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "JustinManningR9Z", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612903111, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lgcu8z/never_stop_learning/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437556.5770035, "replies_charged": false}
