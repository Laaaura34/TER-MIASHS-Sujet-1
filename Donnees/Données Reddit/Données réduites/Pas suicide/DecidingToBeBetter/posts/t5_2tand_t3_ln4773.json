I don\u2019t have a label for what I have chosen. But for me personally, it\u2019s the right decision. Once you get past the lonely phase and work on being comfortable with your own company, everything works out. I love living my life without sex and relationships and spending my time and energy on the things that are important and being around, really, just good people and awesome company. That is all.
