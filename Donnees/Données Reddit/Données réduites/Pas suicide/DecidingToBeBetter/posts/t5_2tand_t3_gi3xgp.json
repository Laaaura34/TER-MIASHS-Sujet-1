I suppose I was very naive and egotistical to believe that I was okay and didn't need to improve my habits. The quarantine hat just made me realize how much I consume on a daily basis and how little I move. There are very few things I'm insecure about but my weight is the biggest one. I was in the trap of mental or motivational masturbation without putting actions to my words and I'm deciding I will finally do so. \n\nMy goal is to stop the binge eating and eat proper portions, which will be extremely difficult, and I want to get outside every day. Walking isn't the best form of cardio so to compensate for that I will run a mile at least 3 days a week and see how low I can get my mile time. Personally I hate running and I'm terrible at it so this will be good discipline.\n\nAlso something I've noticed about myself is that I will do a reflection or meditation towards the end of my day when it would be more beneficial for me to start out my day mediatating. When I've done this I am more mentally sharp and I am more motivated to get my work done. \n\nBut anyway the main thing I need to change is my binge eating. I know for the future this is a very detrimental habit to have and I would like to squash it as soon as physically possible. If anyone has any suggestions to help me with that I will be very appreciative.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gi3xgp/im_stopping_the_binge_eating/", "title": "I'm stopping the binge eating", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "logicxalchemy", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1589257246, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gi3xgp/im_stopping_the_binge_eating/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435492.331702, "replies_charged": false}
