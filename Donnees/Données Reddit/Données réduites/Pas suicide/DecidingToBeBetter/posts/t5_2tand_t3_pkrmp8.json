I'm upset at the fact that she wants to take a break from the friendship that she's been putting a strain on not ever saying atleast a sorry to me for everything she's done, she doesn't get to be happy I should be happy, I should be the one to say I don't want to be friends anymore, she doesn't get the right to say that WHEN SHES THE REASON WE ARENT HAPPY! Not even a sorry not even anything. Ugh I can't believe I wasted my four years of this I can't believe this. \n\nHow can I move on from this what can I do?, all my friends are linked together if I drop her I drop EVERYONE, I'll be alone. I can't, I don't want to do this anymore she doesn't get to say that when she's the cause. I'm so upset, I don't know what I need to do to move on from this. I feel so childish because she's just ugh\n\nEdit:\nWe aren\u2019t friends anymore, she said she couldn\u2019t wait to take a break but I said that she could but I\u2019m not participating because I wasn\u2019t planning on going back to her. I left yesterday or maybe the day before that but I still left. There is no \u201cwe\u201d just \u201cyou\u201d \n\nThe audacity is uncanny.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pkrmp8/how_can_i_be_better_how_can_i_just_act_like/", "title": "How can I be better, how can I just act like nothing happened?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Remarkable_Lynx_9601", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 0, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631165819, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pkrmp8/how_can_i_be_better_how_can_i_just_act_like/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437384.903695, "replies_charged": false}
