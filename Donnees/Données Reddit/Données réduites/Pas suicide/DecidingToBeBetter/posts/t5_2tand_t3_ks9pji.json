While I have used Microsoft Office software broadly in the past it has been several years and I'm rusty. I started online courses maybe three days ago and got my first Certificate of Achievement in Microsoft Word tonight. The site is accredited and held in high esteem so the certs will actually mean something. Looking forward to adding \"Proficient in Word, Excel, and Powerpoint\" to my resume. I might even dive into learning the basics of some coding next!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ks9pji/i_have_started_taking_online_courses_to_increase/", "title": "I have started taking online courses to increase my software skills.
