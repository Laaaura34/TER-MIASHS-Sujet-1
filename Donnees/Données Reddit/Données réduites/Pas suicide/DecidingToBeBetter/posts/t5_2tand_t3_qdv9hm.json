I was seriously considering whether we should be together. I gave it some thought, and I realized that I did not need to break up with him without hearing his side.\n\nI wanted to get my feelings out on the table and then hear his perspective. So I said, \"I don't think we should be together if you can't support me as I deal with X. I think I need to do this, and if you don't support me, maybe we shouldn't continue.\" I said something to that effect. He then said he couldn't believe I was giving him an ultimatum. I don't think clearly in conflict, unfortunately. I wasn't quite sure what he meant by that, I wasn't sure if it applied, and I was a little annoyed that he was accusing me of something rather than discussing the issue. I didn't address it though because I felt overwhelmed and I wasn't sure how to respond to that. I knew that I had said something that bothered him, so I asked him, \"What do you need from me?\"\n\nThe conversation did not end well. He broke up with me. \n\nI am still learning social skills and conflict resolution skills. I am still learning to share my needs and learning to share them in a tactful way. Could someone help me understand what I did wrong? What is a better way to start a conversation like this?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdv9hm/i_want_to_get_healthier_at_conflict/", "title": "I want to get healthier at conflict.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "HolyLung32", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634953507, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdv9hm/i_want_to_get_healthier_at_conflict/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438189.636222, "replies_charged": false}
