Everytime I see something that I find cool, funny, interesting, insightful or odd, I have a instinctual urge to want to repost it on my story. Even when I put my phone down and try to take a break, I start looking for things in my everyday life that I can post.\n   \nI do think there's value in sharing these things with your friends, but I have reached a level that is driving me insane because of it. It's becoming harder and harder to just go on a hike and enjoy the scenery without having to constantly whip out my phone and get a perfect shot of the mountains.\n   \nI know a lot of this stems from my insecurities such as my loneliness and need for attention. I've basically been by myself this entire pandemic so it makes sense why I'd be more lonely and hungry for social engagement. \n\n   \nTo be fair to myself, I do try to post original content or at least content that most people would never normally see. Still, I can't continue  with this toxic, mentally draining way of thinking. I need to get better and change. And if it helps at all I do excersise, yoga and meditation everyday.
