I've been through a fair amount of change and upheaval in my life, but I would be considered privileged by most.\n\nI'm white, raised in white suburbia by two loving, involved parents. They divorced when I was 13, but they both remained involved with my life, and though we've fought plenty, I've never really been on bad terms with either of them.\n\nRight now, I'm trying to become the best person I can be in preparation for my daughter's arrival. So I've been confronting some deep issues of mine.\n\nA recent reddit post about hallucinogen use brought up a lot of feelings in me, and [my comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5jzwt0/serious_people_who_tried_lsd_or_any_other/dbkc4ao/?context=3) ended up being my biggest contribution to reddit since I joined. When I was in my 20's, I smoked a lot of pot, used hallucinogens, and occasionally dabbled with a host of pharmaceuticals, mostly opioids and adderall. I managed to avoid any serious addictions or legal trouble, although I did have one spectacularly close call that I'm really not sure how I walked away from.\n\nI no longer use any kind of drugs, and I drink very moderately (about once a month). But for a long time, I held onto some positive feelings about some drugs, most notably hallucinogens. There's a subculture around these drugs that regards them as an edifying experience that makes you a better person, and I have to admit that the illusion is very convincing. It took me nearly ten years to really shake it off and see that all the stuff I \"learned\" about myself and the world was ultimately empty. Tripping made me feel like a better, more open-minded person, but I can't really point to a single thing I did as a result.\n\nOverall, I've come to realize that drugs are an entirely selfish pursuit. Some are relatively benign, but none of them give you lasting, deep happiness. And no drug has ever made anyone a better person, peyote-induced vision quests included. I've been there, and after ten years of gaining perspective, I'm just not buying it. It's all bullshit, and no one will ever convince me otherwise.\n\nI was never physically addicted to drugs, but I've recently realized that addiction has played a deep role in my life for years. I'm a porn addict.\n\nMy generation is the first to grow up with free, plentiful internet porn. Our parents could never have been ready for it, so they never had a chance to protect us from it. By the time they caught on, it was too late.\n\nPorn has shaped so many of my attitudes, so much of my personality, that I can barely tell where the damage ends and I begin. I've watched [videos about the effects of porn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oFVOJf0TzY) on the brain, and it's plainly shocking. I can trace so many of my selfish, destructive behaviors to those brain changes, and it makes me really mad that I did this to myself without ever knowing it was happening.\n\nThe problem with porn addiction is that it teaches you to get your jollies from something that isn't human. You're not really even getting them from yourself, because once the addiction sets in, you can't get off without porn. It's worse than selfish, it's a mechanical, person-less abyss of waste.\n\nDrugs, even the benign ones, kept me thinking about myself all the time. Porn kept me from engaging in healthy romantic relationships when I was young. These things have separated me from other people in subtle ways. I'm not socially awkward (anymore), but I am aloof, and I can trace it back to porn and drugs, and really, I can trace the drugs back to porn.\n\nBut here's the thing: Both problems are misguided ways of seeking happiness. And the solution to both boils down to redirecting your thoughts to other people.\n\nI'm probably going to lose some of you here, but rest assured I'm not writing this to proselytize: I believe in God, and I consider myself a Christian, though I don't attend church. And a lot of what Jesus talked about boiled down to thinking of others--or God--instead of yourself. It's been right there under my nose this whole time. It's one thing to hear it, and another to understand it.\n\nHere it is from another angle: There's an idea out there in psychology called non-complimentary behavior. It's basically the idea that you can change a situation by flipping the script: meet hate with love, meet anger with compassion, etc. Fight fire with water, not fire. Even nature teaches us that this is true.\n\nIn social interaction, the key to flipping the script lies in thinking of the other person. If a man holds a gun to my head and demands my money, my natural instinct is to fear for my own life. But [there are stories](http://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/485603559/flip-the-script) of people doing the exact opposite in that situation, and totally turning it around. Think about the terrible things that must have happened to this man to bring him to a place where he's mugging people. Even if you wind up giving the guy your wallet just the same, you're bound to walk away with a different perspective.\n\nI'm not saying you should try to hug your mugger. The point is that peace and happiness comes naturally when you think of others before yourself.\n\nI did drugs because I thought they'd make me happy. But they didn't. I'm happy now because I love my wife and my dogs, and I enjoy taking good care of them, and I look forward to being a father. 100% of the happiness I currently enjoy comes from me thinking of them, not myself.\n\nI got into porn because it was an easy substitute for real romantic relationships, which require much more effort. Porn has adversely affected my marriage, but my streaks of \"sobriety\" have brought about profound positive changes for us. Now that we have a baby on the way, I want to make those good streaks permanent. I love my wife, and I'm very attracted to her, and I want to have a real, flesh-and-blood relationship with her. Because my sex life is better with her in it. Again, it's thinking of others that enables me to rise above my problems.\n\nI'm starting to think there's something deeply wired into the human brain, perhaps the fabric of the universe, that means that happiness and fulfillment of all kinds are directly traceable to selfless lifestyles. Directing your energy to self-serving things leads to unhappiness 100% of the time. Maybe it's subtle, tolerable unhappiness, but it's unhappiness nonetheless. Thinking of others, however, seems to always lead to happiness, EVEN WHEN IT HARMS YOU.\n\nSome people knew this instinctively. The Ghandis, the Jesuses, the Martin Luther Kings of this world...they knew this. Whether they KNEW they knew it or not. And the happiest, most fulfilled, most self-actualized people do not achieve that state of being by thinking of themselves. Even people whose lifestyle is sustained by money--they had to do or make something that benefits others to acquire that money. Obviously money alone won't make anyone happy (quite the opposite). But I look at someone like, say, Elon Musk, and he strikes me as pretty fulfilled and self actualized. Guys like that make their billions by having great ideas that positively affect the world. Their energy is directed OUTWARD, and I think that may be the secret.\n\nSelf-help is great, but I think maybe it's possible to spend too much time on yourself. And I think that positive emotions follow quickly and reliably when we do something for someone else. There's a deep magic there, and I wish I knew how to see it every day, in every situation. I wish I knew how to respond to every stimulus with love. It's too easy for selfish thoughts to cloud my judgement, and mar my perception. I wish I knew how to focus on others all the time. Because I'm starting to think that's all there is to happiness.\n\nFor what it's worth, these are my thoughts.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/5qq2rx/im_starting_to_believe_that_thinking_of_others_is/", "title": "I'm starting to believe that thinking of others is the key to all self-impovement", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "petertmcqueeny", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1485639522, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/5qq2rx/im_starting_to_believe_that_thinking_of_others_is/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437869.0888839, "replies_charged": false}
