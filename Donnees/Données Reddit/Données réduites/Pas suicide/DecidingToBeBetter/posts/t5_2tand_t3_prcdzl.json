And sometimes I behaved very badly with my colleagues or friends that should not be done in any corporate culture. Even my previous relationship was destroyed by my thoughtless anger. I always said sorry after that, but until then damage has been done.\n\nI already visited the psychological doctor. The doctor told me to do meditation and breath in breath out at the time of anger. But the problem is when I became angry the solution goes out of mind. I became like \"about to explode an atomic bomb\". And as result, everything goes down to zero. \n\nI really want to change myself. And want to control my anger.
