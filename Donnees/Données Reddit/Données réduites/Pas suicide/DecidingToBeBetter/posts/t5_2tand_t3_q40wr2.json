I\u2019m pretty emotional tonight and am feeling like a complete failure. Last weekend I was hospitalised for nearly taking my own life due to realising the fact that I spent over 15 thousand dollars last month on cocaine. I would consume and still do two grams a night. It is consuming my life. Tonight was a breaking point, I actually asked my partner for money to buy some as every bit of money I get I seem to want to spend it on the drug. I\u2019m currently starting to take modafinil to try and gain motivation to get off the drug and it has helped, but the usual nightly cravings are still stronger than ever. I am lost. A few months ago a friend gave me Ritalin and Dexedrine and I was off the stuff for nearly three weeks. Once I ran out of that medication the addictive feelings came back and I relapsed worse than ever. I feel like a total failure to my family, my mother, my partner and my beloved father who passed away three years ago. I am at my end whits. I need some advice, any would be a god send to me. \n\nThank you all for reading and god bless.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q40wr2/severe_cocaine_addiction/", "title": "Severe cocaine addiction", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Outrageous_Witness_8", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 157, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633709454, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q40wr2/severe_cocaine_addiction/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435542.0292368, "replies_charged": false}
