Mostly with the idea of improving my mental health (and hopefully physical) in mind. \n\nMondays are often dreaded, and don\u2019t get me wrong, the clock is still ticking down to work time. That said, I\u2019ve decided to be mindful instead of anxious. \n\nThis week is working on being mindful and in the moment. I struggle with this often in my daily life. I am constantly losing things, forgetting things, ignoring others, etc. because my mind is always somewhere else, often thinking about what is coming next. Whether that\u2019s 10 minutes or 10 months from now, it doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nToday I started with a morning walk. I then decided to do yoga. During yoga I found my mind drifting to next Monday, my first day of college classes since I graduated with my associates 2 years ago. \n\nI stopped myself. I consciously reminded myself that I am doing yoga right now, this is not next Monday. This is now. \n\nI then journaled for about 10 minutes. I have been trying to hold myself accountable to this, as I always say I\u2019m going to start doing something, and then quit a week or two in. So far, I\u2019ve managed to journal several times a week for about a month now. \n\nI\u2019m working on many things that all come back to the same idea. Life is happening now, not tomorrow, or next month. To assume happiness is only found in the future is to declare there is no happiness in the moment. We all know that isn\u2019t true. \n\nToday I will be here, and no where else ahead or in between.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5i2up/what_a_beautiful_monday/", "title": "What a beautiful Monday!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "roolyons32711", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629126894, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5i2up/what_a_beautiful_monday/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435337.157667, "replies_charged": false}
