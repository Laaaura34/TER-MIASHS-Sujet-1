I\u2019ve been teleworking and the most I\u2019ve done is pick up groceries with the car pick up so I was unexpectedly nervous. I wasn\u2019t like this before covid... right?\n\nDoc asked about how I have been coping or if I was. I said that I had been smoking more recently and kind of had a revelation in the room that since covid I have been REALLY relying on it. It\u2019s legal where I live and I\u2019ve been telling myself it\u2019s like when people have a happy hour drink, I\u2019m just smoking a bowl nbd..But a couple times a week has gone to every day to several times a day. I can feel myself getting closer to the end of the work day and my anxiety is just building waiting to clock out and relax. \nThe doctor suggested that I should see how I am with scaling back a bit/quitting for a while and now I have someone with behavioral health reaching out to discuss other coping mechanisms. Not ready to talk them yet.\n\nI don\u2019t even know how to feel... I told my partner I think I could quit if I want to but I\u2019m not ready... then as I said it I realized that\u2019s probably what someone addicted would say. \n\nI\u2019ve decided I\u2019m not going to smoke today. \nI\u2019ve cried twice already just trying to process and on the verge now.\nI\u2019ve always been \u201cyou can\u2019t get addicted to weed\u201d type...\n \nI know that there are way worse things out there to be addicted to. I don\u2019t want to offend anyone on that journey. \n\nI just feel like I\u2019m ashamed that I have a problem. \nI\u2019m not even sure if I want to stop smoking completely. I love it so much... I just don\u2019t like how dependent I am on it. \n\nTLDR: not going to smoke today but getting anxiety about it", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrz014/doctor_recommended_i_quit_smoking_weed_for/", "title": "Doctor recommended I quit smoking weed for anxiety and I\u2019m getting anxiety about it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "RAThrowaway356", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 747, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1594856962, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrz014/doctor_recommended_i_quit_smoking_weed_for/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438067.4712868, "replies_charged": false}
