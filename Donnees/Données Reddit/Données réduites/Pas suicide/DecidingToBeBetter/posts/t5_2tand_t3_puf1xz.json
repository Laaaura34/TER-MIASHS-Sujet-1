I wouldn't even ask the teacher doubts in fear someone would judge me.\n\nToday, i asked to use the restroom after finishing my exam early and infront of my whole class i walked with my back stright and my head held high. Some people were staring at me. There was a really strong urge to hunch but i didnt. When i came back my bestfriend had a big smile and said that i looked elegant. A word someone first time associated me with.\n\nIt might not be that big of a deal but im moved to tears everytime i remember that. I feel im finally starting to stop caring about what others think of me. Writing this too, i feel my eyes about to burst with happiness.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/puf1xz/one_step_forward/", "title": "O\"ne step forward", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lonely_girl_7", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632469903, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/puf1xz/one_step_forward/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436335.626265, "replies_charged": false}
