I journaled on it this morning and it made me realize what I truly want and what is important to me.\n\nThen I realized that despite not being entirely out of reach, it was extremely different from how I spent yesterday (Saturday), and that I need to make real changes to reach that \u201cgoal Saturday.\u201d\n\nSo here I am! I encourage you to sit down and write your ideal Saturday.
