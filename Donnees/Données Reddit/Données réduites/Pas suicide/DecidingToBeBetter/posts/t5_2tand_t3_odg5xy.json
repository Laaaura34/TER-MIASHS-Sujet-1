They knew about her this whole time. My family and I went through a long and violent process before we reached this point where I can openly tell them who my girlfriend is and I can live as authentically as possible without feeling like I will lose my family. So I was eager to tell them about the engagement. Also told them that we plan to get married in Nov 2022 so they can save up money to come home (I live in Asia, they're in North America). Took them more than a day to respond, only to tell me they can't come home. They did congratulate me, but my sister later spilled the tea about how they really didnt want to come home for the wedding because they don't accept my decision and they don't \"get why everything needs to be about me all the time.\" Dunno where that came from.\n\nNow I really want to be the better person here. So we're keeping the date just in case they change their mind. But if they don't, I'm not even going to stream the wedding for them. If they don't come to my wedding, I want them to carry that in their conscience forever. Does that make me a bad person?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/odg5xy/parents_dont_want_to_attend_my_wedding_because/", "title": "Parents don't want to attend my wedding because they still can't accept that I'm gay", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "forkmegood", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1173, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625386851, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/odg5xy/parents_dont_want_to_attend_my_wedding_because/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436120.250909, "replies_charged": false}
