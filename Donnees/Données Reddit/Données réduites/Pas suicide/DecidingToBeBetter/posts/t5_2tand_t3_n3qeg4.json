I was always regarded as the \u201ctherapist\u201d friend because I was so good at advices. \n\nBut then I found out I was codependent. So yeah, my bubble of being \u201ckind & helpful\u201d was destroyed, as I recognised my codependent behaviour. \n\nThen, I had a break up. A messy one. We held on to each other for months after breaking up. He was depressed and I thought I could \u201cheal\u201d him or least, I wanted to help him no matter what. We both turned toxic. We said things we probably didn\u2019t mean. I\u2019m not gonna talk baith his flaws, just mine. Because that is what I wanna improve. I was constantly victimising myself. I tried to make him feel guilty. I didn\u2019t know how to be with someone suffering with depression, but I tried my best. However it wasn\u2019t enough. \n\nI also have a habit of ranting (my ex used to think that\u2019s a very bad habit) but somehow it helps me. To let it out. \n\nI wanna be better. And I\u2019m trying. I do mediation. I write everyday. And I feel it\u2019s working. But any advice is more than welcome. \n\nI wanna be better for myself.
