Had a realization recently I wanted to share thats helped me a lot. \n\nBeen going on dates and talkin to new people trying to put myself out there and have fun. Was in a long term relationship and it ended poorly which left me feeling guilty and beat down\u2026 and if Im being honest like I failed them and myself somehow.\n\nSo I\u2019ve been on a quest of self improvement, self love, traveling, finding and rediscovering myself and my interests etc. \n\nThere\u2019s a saying you hear from a lot of people \u201cWhen you stop looking for love you find it.\u201d \n\nAnd before at face value I just always interpreted that as in - I\u2019m trying too hard and if I stop looking the world will magically grant me what I want - which is always illogical to hear.\n\nWhat I\u2019m discovering is that what it really means, when you stop looking for love\u2026 is you find it in yourself. \n\nAnd that\u2019s enough.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o8k2p6/something_i_realized/", "title": "Something I realized", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "portrayaloflife", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 66, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624744997, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o8k2p6/something_i_realized/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436979.3345068, "replies_charged": false}
