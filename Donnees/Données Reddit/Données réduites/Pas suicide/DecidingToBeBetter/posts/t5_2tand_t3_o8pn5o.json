Scared shitless and  afraid a small cavity has already made to to the pulp chamber even though there is no signs, got on anti anxiety meds which help some with general anxiety. All said I am still scared shitless \n\nStarting my own business and about go big with partners and advertising\n\nAbout to go and and get GED and maybe look into service or college education \n\n\nPlus I am getting back into shape and dieting.\n\nNow all these might seem basic to you but for me my life has been a unproductive mess these past 2 years and I got fucked up by a previous dentist and my best friend died and I went into a state of depression dropped 46 pounds below my recommended weight. I also just abandoned my social life and started half assing my job and today/yesterday I learned my next paycheck is my last, so WOO HOO for me! I am mainly making this post to look back on and will probably do a monthly update of what\u2019s happening and such.\n\n\nEdit; I don\u2019t know who left rewards but thank you! Just know, there\u2019s no need to spend money to give me awards and you have free ones please give them to a more deserving post", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o8pn5o/i_am_actually_starting_to_get_my_shit_together/", "title": "I am actually starting to get my shit together after 2 years of a unproductive mess", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "CatholicismManism", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 839, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624766378, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o8pn5o/i_am_actually_starting_to_get_my_shit_together/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437443.1737206, "replies_charged": false}
