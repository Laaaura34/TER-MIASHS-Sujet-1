This situation played out the way it did due to me being triggered and black out drunk, either way, it doesn\u2019t change the damage I made to this persons life. After much back and forth, they\u2019ve completely shut me out. We were best friends and they were really my only support system. Idk how to process this loss along with losing family members, being sexually taken advantage of by a friend, constantly worrying about money, and dealing with general anxiety and depression. \n\nThey shut me out a month ago and I\u2019ll be ok for a while and then have intensely dark weeks. I\u2019m in a dark week now and suicide is heavy on my mind in a new way. I\u2019m feeling more and more sure of/comfortable with the idea. I have a therapist for a couple more weeks, I\u2019m in group therapy for aggressors, I\u2019m taking a course on accountability and transforming violent behavior but I still don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m doing enough to be better. I know I need to be patient and just do the work but I hate myself so much. I\u2019m so tired from all the abuse and death that\u2019s haunted me this past year. I feel so isolated and unworthy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mevx0k/its_getting_too_hard_to_live_with_myself/", "title": "It\u2019s getting too hard to live with myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TophMorningstar", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 0, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616912273, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mevx0k/its_getting_too_hard_to_live_with_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435191.459876, "replies_charged": false}
