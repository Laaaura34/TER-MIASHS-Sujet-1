I was really not that optimistic kind of person. That's why everytime this thoughts will cross my mind I don't really think i can make it. I wanna leave Facebook, ig, and twtr for the meantime coz I'm getting toxic. I can't focus on myself nor my studies. Wanna go to gym, make myself better coz I know it will help me boost my energy all day long. Wanna get serious with my studies coz I wasn't doing well lately. Everything was a distraction. So yeaaaa starting from now I'll make it happen, one step at a time ofc. I needed to see some of ur thoughts and advice, if it's okay tho. I'll make a note of it.
