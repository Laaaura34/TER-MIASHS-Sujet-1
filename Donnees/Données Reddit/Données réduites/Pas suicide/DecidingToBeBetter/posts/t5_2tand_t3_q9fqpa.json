I found that some creators are quite technical while others are biased being too advanced to teach to noobs.\n\nFind the most relevant equipment for my budget. For coffee I learned I need an espresso machine, a grinder, a scale and a tamper, apart from the specialty coffee beans. Not sure what is the best way to decide what would work apart from reading user reviews on sites such as Amazon. However, some user reviews seem to be fake so any tip here would really help.\n\nI realised I need to spend more time with myself and adopt more hobbies, but am not really looking forward to the daunting research and trial/error to learn this things.\n\nHopefully some people here already been there before, so their experience and tips would be much appreciated. Whatever your can share in a one or two liner would be much appreciated \ud83d\ude4f", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9fqpa/best_tips_and_practices_for_finding_diy_resources/", "title": "Best tips and practices for finding DIY resources and equipment", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "alexbadut", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634402988, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9fqpa/best_tips_and_practices_for_finding_diy_resources/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435071.0445669, "replies_charged": false}
