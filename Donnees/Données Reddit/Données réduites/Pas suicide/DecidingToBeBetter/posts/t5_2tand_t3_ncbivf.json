I\u2019ve never made any kind of progress. Normally when I go, I just pick a random weight and a random exercise and then just doing and it feels meaningless, and then I stop going for months. It\u2019s a viscous cycle. \n\nBut I have 2 amazing friends who have been pushing me non stop to work out with them. They are always asking me to go with them, even though I know I can\u2019t do the same weights and activities that they can. One of them even takes the time to put together a workout plan FOR ME. I\u2019ve been going been going to the gym with them about 1-2 times a week for the last 2 months. \n\nBut 3 weeks ago it really hit me. I was at the zoo and I stepped on a scale that compares your weight to a hippo, and discovered I was 15lbs heavier!!! I looked in the mirror when I got home, and realized that I\u2019m growing a belly, I\u2019m getting fat!!! \n\nSo ever since then, I\u2019ve taken every opportunity to hit the gym, and yesterday was a break through I never thought I\u2019d have! ACTUAL PROGRESS!!! I\u2019ve never ever been able to bench over 135 my entire life, and I just beat my record by TEN POUNDS!!! My whole body is sore, but I can feel myself building muscle!!! I\u2019m also making a conscious effort to stop drinking sodas, and I set a goal of no soda at all until after July 23rd. \n\nMy next step is to take up walking/jogging. I\u2019m building muscle in the gym, but I also need to shed this fat. I\u2019m going to go on a walk as soon as I\u2019m done making this post, and I\u2019m excited about it!!\n\nPart of me wishes I could have found this motivation without the help of my friends, but the other part of me is just so grateful that I have friends like this who care enough about me to help me be better. Now I just need to harness this motivation and discipline, and continue forward one step at a time. Time for my walk!
