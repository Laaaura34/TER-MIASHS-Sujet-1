Then at some point I was told that everyone is worthy of being loved and I thought \"Hey that sounds nice\". However eventually I'm pretty sure I became an incel because of it as I was constantly jealous of others and there really was no proof that I actually was worthy of it, so now I'm back to accepting that I'm forever alone again. This pessimistic mindset isn't exactly healthy and I really want to be somewhat more optimistic about it, but somehow I end up being sad about not finding any love and I want to avoid that somehow", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lp3ucd/how_can_you_believe_youre_worthy_of_love_without/", "title": "How can you believe you're worthy of love without being an incel?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "yellowpeanut22", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613933802, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lp3ucd/how_can_you_believe_youre_worthy_of_love_without/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437593.1068368, "replies_charged": false}
