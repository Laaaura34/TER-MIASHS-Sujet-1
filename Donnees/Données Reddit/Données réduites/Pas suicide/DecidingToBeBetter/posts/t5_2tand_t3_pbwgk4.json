I'm getting tired of the treatment, I'm tired of it destroying mental health, I'm tired of making sacrifices that people feel entitled to shifts while knowing I could just leave if I want to.\n\nI don't want to be unemployed, but it could take forever to leave otherwise. You have to understand I have stuck out this hell hole for 6 years already.\n\nI think I have some advantages of the time on my hand to proactively seek a better and more fulfilling career option; with the 6 years of experience I already gained and some financial security with the help of my parents also if necessary, naturally I don't want to be in that situation for long.\n\nOr do you think no matter what I should stay; despite it practically destroying me? The staffing situation is getting worse, and no one is willing to acknowledge it so, just routinely blame the staff who are already breaking their backs making ends meet for a job which shows no remorse.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pbwgk4/should_i_just_leave/", "title": "Should I just leave?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "_alexotoole", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629972395, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pbwgk4/should_i_just_leave/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435138.3143868, "replies_charged": false}
