Yes. I have. I\u2019ve realized that I have let my pain define me as a person though. I don\u2019t who I am outside of that pain. I didn\u2019t wanna heal because I was comfortable with it. Instead of growing, I drank too much. I became toxic to my loved ones. I was so blinded by my own emotions I let my relationship fall apart in front of me while I was the one screaming that my spouse was the problem. I\u2019m deciding to be better. \nI\u2019m putting the drink down. I\u2019m putting the self pity party away and I\u2019m growing as a person. It\u2019s time to heal. It\u2019s time to flourish.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g99poq/done_with_my_own_toxic_ways/", "title": "Done with my own toxic ways", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "desir33_", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 62, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1588022424, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g99poq/done_with_my_own_toxic_ways/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436548.700764, "replies_charged": false}
