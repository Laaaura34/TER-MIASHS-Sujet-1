Let's say , one of the important goals i have is to write . Some subgoals have to do with writing articles , others have to do with self reflection and analysis .some has to do with writing scripts for youtube that i still want to create  But , when i use paper and pen i always feel frustrated and slow . I got bored and i give up . I had a laptop once and i was writing faster and got things done way faster . \n\n\nWhat are you advices for me who wants to accomplish projects i set in mind  but gets frustrated by the simple pen and paper slow process ? I want to feel calm and not rushed . \n\n\nA note : my hand writing on paper is bad so if only i wrote in an elegent way i could have put effort into papers .", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lgyhe7/decided_to_be_better_but/", "title": "Decided to be better BUT", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Alter-ego-johanne", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612977447, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lgyhe7/decided_to_be_better_but/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436336.4313025, "replies_charged": false}
