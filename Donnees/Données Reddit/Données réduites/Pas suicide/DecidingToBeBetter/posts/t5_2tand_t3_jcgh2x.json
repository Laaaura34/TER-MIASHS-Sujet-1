I was surrounded by family who constantly put me down and as a kid, I believed every single thing they said about me. It became my thoughts and my beliefs about myself. I always told myself that I never wanted to be like them. So I guess in a way, I am grateful that I was surrounded by them because I learned about the kind of person I should not be and that I can be better. I want to be better. It took me so many years to develop my own thoughts and beliefs about myself. Sometimes I still struggle with it, but I'm aware of it and I'm able to snap out of that mindset (at least for the most part).\n\nIt took a lot of heartbreak to get to where I am. And not in the romantic relationship type of heartbreak, but more of the relationship with myself and my past type of heartbreak. Something that happened recently took a toll on me. But that forced me to work on myself and the amount of growth I've seen in me - oh my gosh it's pretty freaking amazing. I'm still healing from certain things but it pushed me even more to do something about it. It wasn't always like this though. Before, I never did anything to get myself out of a rut and I constantly pushed good things/people away, but I've slowly been changing that habit. \n\nI've had people tell me how great I am and what not, and I always appreciated the compliment but I never believed it. I really just had no love for myself. But I met 2 people on reddit a few months ago. They helped me realize that I am worth it and that I deserve good things. It wasn't them saying that; it was actually how they treated me. And there were many people before them that treated me kindly, treated me right, but for some reason (that I still cannot figure out), it was different with them. These 2 people care(d) about me and I was always able to be my weird ass self with them without feeling judged. It took some getting used to - having someone who constantly checked on my well-being and would be tough on me about it. I'm not giving them credit for my hard work on myself (haha), but they are a huge part of why I even started to love myself and I will be forever grateful for them. \n\nI always thought that focusing on myself simply meant doing things I love but damn was I wrong. Self work can be difficult but it's so necessary. There's more that I have to do of course, but I have finally reached a place where I know my self-worth. I actually value myself! WHAT?! haha who am I!? I know what I deserve, I know what I want and I know that it'll only be growth from here on out. So much growth ahead of me and I'm so excited! I know there will be hard days, but I got through some of the hardest days so I know I can get through it in the future, too. I know I will struggle with certain things, but at the end of the day, I will choose myself no matter what. I'm proud of myself for how far I've come, but there's still a long way to go and I'm ready. I have so much more to learn about life and myself. I can't FREAKING wait. \n\n\\*happy sigh\\* \n\nHappy 22nd birthday to me!!! (: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo whoever is seeing this, thank you for taking the time to read this.
