But you have the great  *FRIENDS* with you the ones like roots [  Root like Means the ones who will never leave you as the branches and leafes will leave one day. { they can't come sometimes but that doesn't mean they aren't your friends }  ]. When you attend any event or anything with your best friends . The event doesn't plays the role in making a memory . Your friends they create it . Even though if you will attend a bore lecture with your best of best friends they will turn that boring lecture into a  souvenir lecture that you ever had . Not only a lecture but an event or a program . Your friends have that capability of doing it . They fill you and your surroundings with a high level of enjoyment ,  entertainment , excitement  and you will be extremely  satisfied , gratified . It  doesn't mean that they will  do something that is always  Hilarious  . They will make you emotionally charged too. \n\n Second condition  is that when you don't have the Root like friends or those who have these type of qualities that can change your boring event . You need to have the purpose of attending the event. The actual purpose / Aim , Why you are  going there?  that is what exactly  going to happen there Will  that event  make you feel happy ? Or give you something that you are in search of it ? Will you gain something that is worthy ? If you are clear with this mental state then you will not only  be satisfied but also be happy that you spent a valuable time . This was the one reason to attend any event. \n\nResults of it : \nIf that event gives us something for which we were in search or  the happiness or a  desired happy moment then we respect that event  we Owen it . And we thanks ourselves for taking good decision by going there and if that event goes wrong gives us that we hated or that we didn't ask for . An undesired outcome. We point  ourselves to take such a bad decision ( not everyone very very very few ) .A we  don't stop here we blame others because of you I was here , you forced me to come here and many more things occur in this. A  bad feeling comes that it was pointless going there..... I shouldn't have went there.... I wasted  my  time etc etc ....\n\npurpose vary from person to person why to go?  why not to ? what will be the results of it ? ...... happiness....... or timepass ........ or boring...\n\nSolution: \nYou must have a clear vision , a  clear purpose to go on a event function or program.( When you don't have Da type of  friends ) \n\nThird condition is not for everyone that is... when \"couples\"  they decide to go to for themselves not for the friends neither  for the event.They just want to spend their time with their beloved ones they don't care for the event they look for the happiness and pleasure . \n\nLast condition there exist one more category  that is when we  don't have any friends neither purpose/aim  of attending an event . so a t this point  We are going  for *just* ( same as when we look our phone without any reason without any notification )  we don't have any reason to go there. we are going for just a timepass . We  don't judge the event till its over as we  don't have any idea of whether the event will be memorable or not . Sometimes we get influenced by others that is by the mob or by any good leader. Here we have nothing to do whether the  event navigates to  best or to wrong .\n\n\nThese were the four  types  of mental make-up that  we have while  catch any event .\n\n\n*Conclusion:* \nWhenever you attend any event , program, function . Always go with a mind set of learning new things exploring new opportunities. Not with the having  poor mind of \" there is nothing gona happen\" , \"it's all same ,nothing's will be new about this event\" . \n\"Every day is a new day\" . Go with a mindset of  its okay that if this event doesn't makes you  happy , it doesn't gives you  what you  wanted ,  still it will let you teach something , something that you haven't learnt till now , something that is new . You need to search for it . And if you cannot then you are going in the  wrong direction  . If you don't find it then  look at the things that has happened today . Is this something that occurs  Daily ?? No doubt that this was not the  last but the things that happened today , will it be repeated again ? with the same people ?on  that same place? Not at all things keep changing . \n\n\n\n*what If you had a bad time with any event :*\n\nIt's okay good and bad ,  both of this things have to come in life and if always good things  will happen with you then you will forget the taste of bad.  Bad ones is also very important with the good ones .so that in future  if bad one comes to you , you will already have an  experience  of it . \n\nAt last I would just like to say that  \nBe happy , be positive\ud83d\ude07 ,Stay  blissed\nDo not let the air of sadness ,  air of negative ness,  air of badness  comes  to your artries , veins, lungs  and last your delicate heart and sharp mind .", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/d4oie0/how_can_you_have_a_positive_mindset_while_you_are/", "title": "How can you have a positive mindset while you are going to attend an event", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Andromadatheorem7", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1568572669, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/d4oie0/how_can_you_have_a_positive_mindset_while_you_are/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435645.4066453, "replies_charged": false}
