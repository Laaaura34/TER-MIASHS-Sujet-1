I hated my previous jobs and complained constantly about them, but they all were better than the one am in. \n\nAm beginning to feel that my spiral downwards was probably because I complain about everything in life. \n\nApart from that, I did work pretty decently in my previous roles, so no reason why I shouldn\u2019t have gotten ahead when my peers all have went on to better jobs and positions. \n\nWhat can I do to complain less and be thankful?\nAlso, won\u2019t being thankful make me complacent in my current role?\n\nPlease reply.
