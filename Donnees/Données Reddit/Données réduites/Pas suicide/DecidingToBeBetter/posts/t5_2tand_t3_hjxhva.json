Been working out and strictly watching my diet, trying to get obsessed with fitness as a distraction. Almost cracked and went out and bought a pack of juul pods yesterday but I just mediated for 15 minutes and felt much more relaxed afterwards. The withdrawals and cravings have been shit but I\u2019ve already saved over 50 bucks not smoking anymore and I can feel my baseline mood without it starting to improve. If anyone else out there is trying to get over a cigarette or vaping addiction, just know that it gets easier everyday.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hjxhva/been_able_to_stay_away_from_nicotine_for_10_days/", "title": "Been able to stay away from nicotine for 10 days now", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MahpiipiIshaaad", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 651, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1593698311, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hjxhva/been_able_to_stay_away_from_nicotine_for_10_days/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437764.0189817, "replies_charged": false}
