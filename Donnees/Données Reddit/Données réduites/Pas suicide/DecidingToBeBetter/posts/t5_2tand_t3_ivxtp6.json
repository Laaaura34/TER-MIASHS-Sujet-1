I feel like all they talk about are othere people. I dont even share my ideas and plans to noone, because when I did in the past they were telling me those basic BS like I should be more realistic and etc. Then I started cutting those toxic people off. But my problem is that the most toxic people are in my closest surrounding. I heard one beautiful quote once, it says: \"Don't let getting lonely make you reconnect with toxic people. you should not drink poison just because you are thirsty.\u201d But how can I cut people which I have to see daily (high school, at home,etc..)?\nI am working hard on my self and on my goals. I am trying to be as much positive and optimistic as much I can but this thing bothers me. Please help me to find some kind of solution or what can I do?
