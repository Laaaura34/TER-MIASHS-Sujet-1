I go really quiet and feel really hot (blush a lot). I suddenly become super aware of my movements to the point of insanity. I become really clumsy and feel like I can't breathe. It's like I'm just waiting to mess up. Eye contact is impossible bc the moment a guy looks at me I glance away really fast, but super obviously to the guy. It makes me look weird, like I'm super scared (which I am).\n\nI know guys are only humans but I'm asking for future friends and possibly getting to know a guy enough to have a boyfriend. I feel like a loser (simp) writing this, but it's something I wanna move on from.\n\nThanks, lovelies x", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k8gaw4/how_to_comfortably_talk_to_boys/", "title": "How to Comfortably Talk to Boys?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "GhostKingThrowAway", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 34, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1607346423, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k8gaw4/how_to_comfortably_talk_to_boys/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435970.4298236, "replies_charged": false}
