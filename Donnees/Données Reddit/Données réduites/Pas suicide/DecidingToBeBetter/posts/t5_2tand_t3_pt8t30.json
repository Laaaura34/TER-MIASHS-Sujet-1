I\u2019m so proud for the weight loss and love my body so much now. But, the biggest lesson from this is that you constantly have to be improving. Complacency kills progress. I have done pretty much no real consistent workouts since losing the weight except a run or walk here and there, and have begun to show symptoms of venous insufficiency amongst other things. Just because you lose weight and are good at not overeating doesn\u2019t mean that other factors (nutrition, fitness, mental health) won\u2019t come back to bite you later. I\u2019ve started going to the gym again and decided I want to gain about 10-15 LBS in muscle by the end of 2022 year. I\u2019m 5,11 and 145 LBS and honestly my noodle arms are beginning to make me self conscious, I feel delicate and like I\u2019m gonna break in half bc of my lack of muscle mass, and my health symptoms do worry me and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re from a combination of poor nutrition and sedentary lifestyle. \n\nAny beginner weight lifting / calisthenics fitness tips are appreciated. \nThanks! :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt8t30/im_changing_things_up/", "title": "Im changing things up.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "anothercreativemind", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632321212, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt8t30/im_changing_things_up/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436018.583688, "replies_charged": false}
