But these efforts were fruitless. I spent far too long carrying conversations with people who were probably not even interested in me. \n\nI\u2019ve spent too long being ignored, unloved, unappreciated, forgotten.\n\nI\u2019ve finally given up. \n\nI can no longer live my life waiting on other people. \n\nI enjoy traveling and exploring and I\u2019ve decided I will do just that on my own. I will begin focusing and putting effort and hardwork into my personal side projects. I will begin reading books to learn new things. I will just focus on myself and work to become a better person and stop waiting and relying on others to make me happy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j7n6v9/deciding_to_not_be_lonely_anymore_and_not_let/", "title": "Deciding to not be lonely anymore and not let others be responsible for my happiness", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "danielr088", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 56, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1602196717, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j7n6v9/deciding_to_not_be_lonely_anymore_and_not_let/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437080.3949156, "replies_charged": false}
