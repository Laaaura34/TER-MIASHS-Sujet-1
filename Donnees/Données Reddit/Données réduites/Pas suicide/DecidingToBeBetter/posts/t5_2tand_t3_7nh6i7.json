I graduated halfway through 2016 from college and found myself back at home after this. I found a job pretty quickly at my at-the-time girlfriend\u2019s dads company. I took the job because he offered it and I didn\u2019t think there was any reason to be picky. \n\nI lost myself since that time. Since that day I haven\u2019t grown as a person. At the time I had been with my girlfriend for 2 years and I loved her a lot. I wanted to marry her. The relationships with my friends suffered because of how much time I was spending with her. I only spent one or two days a month with them, even if that. I started to lose all the close friends I had and only hang with my girlfriend. \n\nShe ended up moving into the city near our hometown about 6 months after we were first back from school. It\u2019s about a 40 minute drive from where we were and I didn\u2019t think it was that big of a deal. \n\nFast forward 6 months from then and I gained 25 pounds since college, I don\u2019t hang with any of my friends, im addicted to porn, I\u2019m in 5k credit card debt, I live at home with my parents, and then she decided to break up with me. The things is, I don\u2019t blame her. Im a shell of who I used to be. I lost who I was. I lost everything I\u2019ve loved and I\u2019m here in a pile of shit. I still haven\u2019t found it back. \n\nI\u2019m two months out of my ex dumping me. I\u2019m starting to get my head in a better place than it has been but progress has been hard to come by. I\u2019ve been trying to rekindle friendships with some people out here but it hasn\u2019t been going that well. I feel like they all have their own lives and then I\u2019m just here trying to squeeze my way into them. I feel like I have to force everything. I have to force myself to go to the gym, force myself to go hang with people, force myself to be pleasant around them, force myself to not watch porn, force myself to not spend money, it\u2019s an endless list of forcing myself. \n\nI miss loving life. I miss not having to force it. I miss being in shape and being around people who care for me and want me there. I miss having the financial freedom to not have to think about it all the time. I miss being in harmony with myself. I\u2019m in such a dark place and I\u2019m having a hard time seeing the light. It\u2019s nothing I would ever act on, but I\u2019ve had thoughts of killing myself.\n\nWith all that said, here is the moment I\u2019m deciding to take it back. I\u2019m crying in my car as I write this because I need to take my life back. I won\u2019t let myself keep going down this path. I don\u2019t quite know how to take it back but the best I can do is live my life day to day working to make progress. I don\u2019t know how to fix the things I\u2019ve created but sitting here wallowing in my pain is no way to do that. I want to do anything else. I don\u2019t even care what it is but I just need to get out. \n\nHere is the moment where I finally make the decision to put all this shit behind me. I don\u2019t care if I put this weight on, I\u2019m gonna work my ass to get it off. I don\u2019t care if my ex left me, I\u2019m going to be happy without her. I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m addicted to porn, here\u2019s to being porn free for the rest of my life. I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m in debt, here\u2019s to working my ass off to get out of it. I don\u2019t care if I still live at home, I\u2019ll find friends to move to the city with. I don\u2019t care if I haven\u2019t hit rock bottom yet. I\u2019m making the choice right fucking now to change my life and to get back on the path I need to be happy.\n\nHere\u2019s to making the choice to get my life back. Here\u2019s to a better year than last. Here\u2019s to finding harmony in my life and the world around me. Here\u2019s to keeping my head up and working with everything I have to get what I want. It\u2019s a choice to get it back and one I\u2019m capable of making. \n\nEdit: Thank you so much everyone for the support. You have no idea how much it means to me after yesterday.
