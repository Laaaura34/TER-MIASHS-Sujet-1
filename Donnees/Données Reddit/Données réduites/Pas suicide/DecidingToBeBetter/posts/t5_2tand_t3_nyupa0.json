It\u2019s like you\u2019re impatient for the struggles and uncertainty and pain of life to be over. You just want to get the missing ingredient so your life can be easy/simple/better. \n\nIt\u2019s never going to happen.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how much you read, who is in your life, what your weight or bank account look like. The default human nature is to look for problems, focus on pain, ideate on worst case scenarios. That nature will never go away. You can\u2019t turn it off, you can\u2019t unlearn it. And you\u2019ve worked so hard making yourself better any remaining problem or pain feels like you\u2019re not done.\n\nYou\u2019ll never be done, my friend. That vigilance for problems is an evolutionary tool that kept us alive. It\u2019s an overactive alarm system looking for tigers and trying to push you to store more grain for winter. It\u2019s not designed to keep you happy, it\u2019s fear and anxiety trying to keep you alive. A lot has changed in the last 2,000 years and we don\u2019t need this constant alarm shrieking anymore, but our DNA is what it is.\n\nThis is not a nihilistic post, it\u2019s just a warning label on your brain you\u2019ve never seen: \u201cAnxiety Engine Light Always On.\u201d You need to recalibrate your expectations. Don\u2019t expect life to get easy. Don\u2019t think that an easy life is a reward you get for working hard enough.\n\nLife is struggle. There are always challenges, always things we could do better, always some discomforts. We master one level and suddenly we\u2019re on a harder one. We \u201cfigure out\u201d how life works and then life changes. It\u2019s okay. That\u2019s the nature of life and I just want you to stop thinking it\u2019s your fault. And just because it\u2019s hard doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a screw up.\n\nAnd even though life is a struggle, you can decide to make it mean something.\n\n* Anxious because you want to try something and you don\u2019t know how it will go? You can feel scared home alone or you can feel scared as you try it anyway.\n* Scared because you don\u2019t feel qualified for your dream job? You can feel terrified and paralyzed or terrified as you click \u201cSubmit application.\u201d\n* Terrified of what might happen if you ask that person out? You can feel terrified of the possibilities and sit still or feel terrified as you walk up and do it anyway.\n\nYour life won\u2019t ever get easy. But you can make it worthwhile.\n\nStop expecting life to get easy. Don\u2019t wait to enjoy life until the struggle is over. Decide to be present and smell some roses today. Work hard but take some time for gratitude and message someone you care about. Your life is happening right now. You can\u2019t get today back. It\u2019s not going to get easy later so make sure today matters. What are you waiting for?\n\n**Further Reading**: If this post resonated with you then I highly recommend *The Obstacle is the Way* by Ryan Holiday. This is one of my favorite books because it shows you how to look for the hidden opportunities in every situation - both good and bad. It takes a little effort to learn but once I saw that I could learn from everything that happened to me, it was way easier to stay positive because even when life gave me a curveball I could get something out of it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nyupa0/stop_expecting_life_to_get_easy/", "title": "Stop expecting life to get easy", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MattTheMentor", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623585260, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nyupa0/stop_expecting_life_to_get_easy/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436247.78831, "replies_charged": false}
