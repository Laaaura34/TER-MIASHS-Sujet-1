We are all different just like our beliefs. There job is to guide us through hard times, leaning on our morals helps us to find peace and harmony when changes come at us fast. The Universe  will give us hints when life is about to change, example being overly emotional. Know when this happens that it\u2019s your turning point that life will change. The best thing that you can do is to look inside of yourself and lean on your morals. If you meditate, then meditate, spend some time alone. If done in this manner you will succeed and walk right through this, if not you will feel at a loss. Feeling constantly emotional and having a negative perspective of life. Your strength will come when you look at your accomplishments. Illusions will fog your thinking trying to keep you bogged down. Keeping your eyes open to new beginnings, because endings bring about beginnings.\n\n \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/5320hc/creating_a_way_out/", "title": "Creating A Way Out", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MakingLifeAllBetter", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1474034327, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/5320hc/creating_a_way_out/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437148.4704094, "replies_charged": false}
