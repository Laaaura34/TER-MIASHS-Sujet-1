I\u2019d cry all day instead of doing my work (don\u2019t ask, it\u2019s a long story). Basically I have these really bad habits and I\u2019ve turned into some kind of toxic person. I was a mess. Since I couldn\u2019t work, I was failing so many things at school. I\u2019m extremely body conscious and I measure my weight and other measurements on a daily basis. My self-confidence was at an all-time low, and I was super grumpy. Anyway, that\u2019s all done.\n\nAfter the unholy emotional, sleepless nights, today I pampered myself and fell asleep for a short while. I woke up and cleaned my room. I did everything, for myself, as though I were doing it for someone I love.\n\nAll I can say is that I\u2019m super proud.\n\nHope you guys are doing great too! If not, that\u2019s okay. Wherever you are, what you feel and what you do makes sense. We\u2019re all rly just a work in progress, anyway. \n\nAlright, that\u2019s all! :> \nIt\u2019s time to finally start working. Thanks for celebrating this small victory with me!\n\n*a big hug*", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n0ymja/oh_nothing_much_but_im_just_so_proud_of_myself/", "title": "Oh nothing much, but I\u2019m just so proud of myself for getting by", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "happicramper", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 25, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619678738, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n0ymja/oh_nothing_much_but_im_just_so_proud_of_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437930.0844207, "replies_charged": false}
