I got an exam in a week, but I'm so behind in the class, I don't know how catch up. I'm worried I'm going to fail all my classes and not graduate or get a job. All I do is sit in my room on my computer, trying to study, but then I just end up spending hours on reddit or youtube. I try to sit down and study, but then I get distracted and don't get much done. I feel like I can't focus and concentrate at all, or I just don't understand anything.
