I'm currently reading The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg and I highly recommend-VERY good!! In it, he suggests changing only a few small \"keystone\" habits instead of too many at once so they truly become habits and are not overwhelming. I'm trying to choose ones that are a little more all-encompassing, so I'm trying to focus on stress management, decreasing negativity, and trying to become more comfortable with spending time alone.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips for improving their lives in these aspects? Any suggestions or tricks to make it easier or more doable?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nau88v/habit_change_seeking_tips/", "title": "Habit change- seeking tips", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "drawingsbykale", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1620840294, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nau88v/habit_change_seeking_tips/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438041.1256316, "replies_charged": false}
