What I\u2019ve found so far is that, despite what some people who know me might claim, I\u2019m not a fully nice person. I do nice things, and I\u2019m nice to just about everyone, but I don\u2019t know if that translates to me being \u201cnice\u201d at my core. Above all else, I hate confrontation. I can barely handle two people having a vocal disagreement in the same room as myself. I\u2019ll always do whatever necessary to keep the peace and ensure that everyone remains fairly calm. For the most part, that just involves me keeping my head down and making myself as \u201csmall\u201d as possible. I\u2019ve been doing this for years, and now that I\u2019m only a year away from graduating college, I\u2019ve realized that I can\u2019t live like that forever. I need to be more assertive and outgoing, but I don\u2019t know how to do that without worrying about overstepping my boundaries and hurting or disappointing people I care about.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o2g7nt/i_dont_think_that_im_a_good_person_im_just_quiet/", "title": "I Don\u2019t Think That I\u2019m A Good Person.
