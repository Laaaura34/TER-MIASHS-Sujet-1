When I was 15 my parents never really talked to me about jobs, they never talked to me about my goals or careers I wanted to have. But one day they decided to force me to get ready and go apply for McDonalds. I have no idea why but they were mean about it to me. They just said I need to grow up and drove me their, forced me to write that I get paid $9.00hr. I had the manager laugh in my face and tell me most people don\u2019t make that there. That kind of left me scarred. \n\nI applied for the same McD\u2019s and got the job. It sucked because everyone from my high school went their and I\u2019m a shy person so I\u2019m easy to pick on. Well the girls in school would come to McD\u2019s and make fun of me while I was working. I was going through major depression at the time and my parents fighting/almost getting a divorce and them fighting with me. My grade we\u2019re all F\u2019s.\n\nSo I quit that job even though I was loving the money. I didn\u2019t get another job until I was 19. That job wasn\u2019t bad but my manager sucked. She basically left 16 year olds in charge and they had more power than me who was 19 at the time. I did everything right and she gave credit to everyone else. And then my third job was at my uncles. He was the most horrible boss, great uncle but terrible boss. I would get hourly lectures about how terrible I was if I did something wrong, if I was sick (legitimately sick) he would threaten to fire me if I didn\u2019t come in. He wouldn\u2019t pay me half the time. \n\nAnd my fourth job that lasted me 3 days, my anxiety was high af because I had to wake up at 4am to go to it which didn\u2019t even pay me what they said they would and I told them I wanted night shifts. \n\nNow I\u2019m not here to complain about any of these jobs or sound like a privileged kid but I\u2019m trying to get some advice on how I can overcome my fear of getting a job. I don\u2019t want to hear that it\u2019s apart of life because I know it is, I know everyone goes through crap jobs but this isn\u2019t about crap jobs it\u2019s about anxiety, depression, and fear taking over me getting a job. \n\nI\u2019m absolutely terrified, I can\u2019t even go online and look at jobs without having a panic attack. One reason is I really don\u2019t want to see anyone I know from high school. I never want to see or talk to anyone. I\u2019ll start shaking and my voice cracks, fear flushed over my whole body. Number 2 is I\u2019m struggling bad with my depression, it drains me to even go to the grocery store. The third is my parents put a fear in me to actually go out and do stuff because they would always say I\u2019m lazy and my mom told someone she knows I\u2019m not going to get into college because I\u2019m too stupid. They would tell me I have no work ethic and say I\u2019m irresponsible. And last it\u2019s a little one but I don\u2019t like the environment of any work place in my town, everyone is fake nobody\u2019s their to make genuine connections and they all end up bullying me. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do, I want to run into bed and just watch YouTube until I fall asleep because my fear is so bad.
