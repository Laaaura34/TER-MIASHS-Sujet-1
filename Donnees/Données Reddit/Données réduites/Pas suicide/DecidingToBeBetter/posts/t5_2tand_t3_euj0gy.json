It's got some really good exercises in it, I'm on the first \"pillar\" chapter and I've already had a breakthrough. \n\nI realised I turn to eating food as a default reaction to myself experiencing strong emotions. \n\nHappiness? Order in! Sadness? Definitely want to binge eat a bag of chips. Stress from work? Grab a bowl of chips and Oreos. Bored? Food again. Ironically just after I had this breakthrough I had the urge to order McDonalds in :( \n\nThis is unhealthy and I'm grossly overweight with a BMI of 32+. I've been overweight for the last 5 years now - I rapidly gained weight after I left my parents house and it hasn't dropped since. \n\nHas anyone got experience breaking this thought pattern? Is there something intermediary I can wedge in to help express my need for emotional release without turning to a substance? \n\nAbout a year ago, I quit drinking and I quit smoking. Those were fairly easy to do. \n\nFood habit I have not been able to break as yet, and I'm not sure where to start with this. \n\nThanks in advance.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/euj0gy/six_pillars_of_self_esteem_breakthrough_and/", "title": "Six Pillars of Self Esteem: Breakthrough.
