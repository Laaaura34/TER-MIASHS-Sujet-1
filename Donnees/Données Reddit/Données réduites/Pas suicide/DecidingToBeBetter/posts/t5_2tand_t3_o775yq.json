I feel very blessed that I have had the opportunity to go so long without working, however, It has mentally done the opposite and I have formed a dependence on others because of it. I am a month away from graduating from school and am feeling very motivated to work and start a life for myself and becoming independent from my parents. The problem is I am entirely lost on where to start and how to learn to become financially independent; ie credit, 401ks, taxes, saving, credit cards etc. \n\nI feel very embarrassed about this and have so much to learn in such little time and would love any advice. Even if there are any Youtube crash courses, point them my way. I am ready to stop letting my mental health control my life and start a new chapter.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o775yq/financial_advice_needed_for_becoming_independent/", "title": "Financial Advice needed for becoming independent", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "clamchowderlove", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624560096, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o775yq/financial_advice_needed_for_becoming_independent/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435559.3936787, "replies_charged": false}
