Was there anything you did to help take that leap? I\u2019m constantly unhappy in my career. The problem is it pays very well and has great benefits so it\u2019s hard to find the courage to enter a new field at ground zero. \nI\u2019m nearing 30 and I\u2019ve got all the normal bills to pay. My wife and I are looking to start a family very soon so it feels like my window to make a move is closing quickly. I get anxiety thinking about losing my good health insurance, not having a big enough emergency fund, not finding happiness in a new job etc... \nit feels like an impossible choice between comfort and happiness when it comes to a career. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s anyone else who has gone through this situation and can give some advice or words of wisdom.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lfqc7w/comfort_vs_happiness/", "title": "Comfort vs. happiness", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bpayne1991", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612831074, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lfqc7w/comfort_vs_happiness/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435984.0623114, "replies_charged": false}
