I posted here about 2 months ago about having signed up for a gym and regularly going to pilates classes and i've been doing really well haha another thing i started in june was saving up money. i never really had an idea in mind for why i wanted to do it, but i just realised that my recent spending on useless things has gotten a little out of control lol so i figured to help curb my spending and to help set me up in the future a little bit was to put away $100 of my $200/week allowance and put that into my savings account and every week i've been slowly building up and transferring money into that account not really looking at it. until today when i checked for the first time since i started regularly putting away the $100/week that i realised i'd saved up more money in that account than i've ever had in my savings account ever and if i keep going the way i'm going for the rest of this year i'll end up with 3k more than i did at the start of last year which is nuts to me!!! my new found self control from forcing myself to workout and go to pilates ended up helping me curb my reckless spending haha\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni'm thinking of picking up 1 new habit for every month of the rest of this year alongside my workouts and my money saving and even though i haven't picked up a new one for july yet i'm thinking of reading (and finishing) 1 new book a week since i have a bunch of books that i bought a while back but havent really read yet (my guilty pleasure lmao)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cgbirz/i_started_saving_100week_every_week_since_june/", "title": "I started saving $100/week every week since June and I've already saved up more money in my savings than I've ever had before!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "aspici0", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 858, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1563791530, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cgbirz/i_started_saving_100week_every_week_since_june/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437849.3417099, "replies_charged": false}
