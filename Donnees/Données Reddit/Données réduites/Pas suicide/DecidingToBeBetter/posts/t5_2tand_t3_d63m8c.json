I also consider gym to be a necessary part of my routine.\n\nOn work days, I\u2019m either super tired after work or just want to be lazy on the mornings before my closing shifts.\n\nHow do I energize myself so that I can accomplish my goals? The retail job is just for money. I don\u2019t consider it a career path, but it seems like I am structuring my life around it in a way that I dislike.\n\nThank you for your advice.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/d63m8c/how_to_balance_45_hour_work_week_with_masters/", "title": "How to Balance 45 hour Work Week with Masters School and Gym", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "CaptainFlowers09", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1568838287, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/d63m8c/how_to_balance_45_hour_work_week_with_masters/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435272.2497387, "replies_charged": false}
