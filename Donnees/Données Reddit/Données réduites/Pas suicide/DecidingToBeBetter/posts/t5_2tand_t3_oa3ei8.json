My teachers and authority figures respect me, as I respect them, but other than that, I'm usually left alone. \n\nThe only friends that truly valued me are in other countries. I am unsure if I should reach out to them again and ask for their support. \n\nWith being a lone wolf I understand that there are special challenges that no one else has. I've faced them, and they are very tough.\n\n\nWhich is why I have come here to seek help. How can I live a fulfilling life, full of happiness and success, on a lonely road? Where there is no one else but yourself?\n\nI am young, and I know the road ahead of me, my life, is going to be full of potholes and times where I want to give up. I want to be ready for the challenges ahead.\n\n\nSeeig other people being happy in their own groups hurts, especially when you realize you may not be able to experience the same thing!\n\nAll advice is welcome. I'm willing to work hard for what I want, and I won't change myself just to please someone else or to become \"more social\". I'm my own unique personality.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa3ei8/how_can_i_achieve_happiness_by_myself/", "title": "How can I achieve happiness by myself?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "jammyturtle208", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624951766, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa3ei8/how_can_i_achieve_happiness_by_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436722.9862595, "replies_charged": false}
