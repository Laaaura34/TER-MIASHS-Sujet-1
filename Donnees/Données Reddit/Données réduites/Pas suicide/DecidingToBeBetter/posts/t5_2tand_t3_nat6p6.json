I\u2019m not happy with my current physique and want to hit the ground running. I am 28 y/o, 5\u20199 and weigh 175. When I was regularly working out 6-7 years ago 5 days a week, I had a very effective routine. Dieting is just as important, or even more than working out. Can anyone share a detailed, effective workout plan? Ideally, I\u2019d like to have a general overview of the most effective workouts for each muscle, which muscles to workout on the same day for the best results. Cardio is something I absolutely despise, so instead I used to speed walk 1.5 miles on 15.0 incline at a speed of 3.7 each day after my workout. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nat6p6/28_yo_male_looking_to_get_back_into_shape_asap/", "title": "28 y/o male looking to get back into shape ASAP.
