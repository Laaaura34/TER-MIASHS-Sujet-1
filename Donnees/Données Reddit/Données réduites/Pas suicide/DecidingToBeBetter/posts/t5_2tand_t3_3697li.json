More than once in my life I have been blessed with love and though I have lost it I maintain a healthy nativity to believe in it still.  My laugh comes easy and my worries are few but I'm missing something and I want it back.  I have lost my spark.\n\nI used to be an motivated, I was on overachiever.   Once my mind was set on something I would work until I reached the goal.  I took pride and joy in doing things well and seeing projects completed.   I've gotten fat and lazy and have a half finished projects scattered about.  I have the time and the ability yet I'd rather just curl up on bed and pet my dog and try to ignore the pangs of guilt for not walking her.  I validate myself saying I work with teenagers all day and it's exhausting so I've earned the right to relax.  On weekends I justify my embracing of lump like status because I do more work than anyone in my department so I should not work on my days off.   How do I get back to who I used to be.  How do I sustain the vigor and excitement that used to come so easily.
