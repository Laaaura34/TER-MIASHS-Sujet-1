I\u2019ll be real, I\u2019ve done shitty things, but I\u2019ve done really kind things. I think we\u2019re all capable of both good and bad, and today I\u2019ve decided who I want to be. This person doesn\u2019t get anxious in social settings, this person doesn\u2019t get stressed over the unknown or what could be. This person has forgiven himself and recognizes the awful things that have happened to me in my past. I mourn for the old me but I\u2019m not going to dwell on it. \n\nWish me luck.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p65dke/no_more_stress_no_more_doubt_no_more_past_wounds/", "title": "No more stress, no more doubt, no more past wounds", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Figure-Stick", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 70, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629212025, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p65dke/no_more_stress_no_more_doubt_no_more_past_wounds/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437442.788692, "replies_charged": false}
