My original plan was to graduate with a degree in Biology and go to medical school. In my last semester, I changed my major to Sociology because I was having second thoughts about becoming a doctor and I thought Sociology would give me more career opportunities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I'm considering an accelerated nursing program, but it is very expensive. My parents are not supportive and think I should explore things in my degree field.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not opposed to going back to school if it will guarantee a career I love. I'm a hardworking and motivated individual and I'm open to any ideas anyone may have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm having trouble figuring out what that could be. I'm passionate about kids, healthcare, and traveling. I would love to help kids in the foster care system as fostering/adopting is a dream of mine. But I. wonder if the salary is sustainable (I know that money isn't everything, but I do think it's something to consider). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you made it this far and have any ideas please drop them below.
