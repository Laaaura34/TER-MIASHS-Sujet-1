I loved it, but it was hard at first. Talking to customers, learning where everything was, how everything worked, the menu, etc. Especially difficult because there are only two kitchen staff, including myself... It's a small restaurant. And I'm 17.\n\nNow, the boss fully trusts me to work in the kitchen on my own, I can do anything, and my own dessert is getting put on the menu.\n\nCooking is something I have always enjoyed. I had showed her some crepes I made, and somehow, I don't know how I had the bravery to do this, but I said I wanted to make them for her, and since our menu is still in development (new restaurant), I said if she liked it, maybe we could put it on our dessert menu.\n\nHere we are a month later. I'm making food for customers, and they're all loving it. I get to make something I'm proud of every single day, and I never thought a small part time job could bring me so much joy. I'm so grateful.\n\nIf you ask for something, you might just get it. Be brave.
