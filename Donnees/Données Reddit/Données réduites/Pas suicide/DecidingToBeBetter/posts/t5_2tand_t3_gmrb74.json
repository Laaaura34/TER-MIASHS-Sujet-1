Due to the pandemic, we have detoured slightly to specifically treat COVID-19 but we have made great progress on developments towards psoriasis, lupus and MS already. Hopefully we finish all phases of testing for our first 3 indications (MS will take some time still for the product completion) within these next 12-18 months! \n\nWhile my co-founders and I have been working on this platform for over a year, we just became incorporated last month and moved into our own lab & office space yesterday! This is both the most exciting and scary time of my life, and it was really hard to quit a job with a stable income especially during these wild and unpredictable times. \n\nThat being said, there isn't a doubtful bone in my body that I am supposed to be exactly where I am right now. This is the way.
