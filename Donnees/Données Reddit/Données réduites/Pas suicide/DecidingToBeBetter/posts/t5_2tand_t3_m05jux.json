She was a 3rd grade teacher who LOVED helping children. She once said \u201cif money were not needed, I\u2019d teach for free\u201d. That\u2019s how much she loved helping kids learn. \n \nWhen my mom died I struggled so hard with my relationship with God. People kept telling me \u201cthis is Gods plan\u201d over and over.. and I started to think \u201cokay so it\u2019s Gods fault I lost the most important person in my life\u201d.  WRONG. I wrestled with this for years. \n\n\nIf someone hit her car I could blame that person, if an error was made in surgery I could blame the surgeon, etc. \nSo when people said \u201cwell it\u2019s God\u2019s plan\u201d they gave me someone to BLAME. I have stopped people mid sentence before and said no.. don\u2019t say what you are going to because if you do all it does is make me mad at God and I need him to get through this. \nI was questionable with my faith for a long time.. but I realized that I had to believe in God and heaven if I ever want to see my mom again. \n\nI told friend this past week who also just suddenly lost her mom, that while God is at work, so is the devil and he will do anything to make you question your beliefs...To tune out the people who give you God on a platter as the person to blame, because in reality they\u2019re TRYING to help. Trying to comfort.. but it isn\u2019t. So I won\u2019t ever say that to anyone grieving. I clung to God being the person who took my mom from me for too long to do that to anyone else. \n\nFreak things happen and I truly truly believe it has nothing to do with God. He gave us free will. So when we die, his job is to just let us into heaven or we go to hell. \nI don\u2019t think he points and says \u201cthat person- they\u2019ll die today\u201d he doesn\u2019t do that. \n\nThis has been on my mind for so long and it felt nice to get it written out.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m05jux/keeping_faith_after_losing_a_loved_one/", "title": "Keeping Faith after losing a loved one.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "KalaJuly", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615169974, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m05jux/keeping_faith_after_losing_a_loved_one/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437163.3378258, "replies_charged": false}
