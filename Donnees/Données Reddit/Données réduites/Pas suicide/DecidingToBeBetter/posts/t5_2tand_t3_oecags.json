I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m cutting soda out of my life. To be honest, I\u2019m cutting all high sugar drinks out. I\u2019ll wean myself off sugary drinks but the Dr Pepper I just had is my last soda. I\u2019m starting a weight loss journey and I\u2019m going to try and move for natural sugars (fruit & milk) and cut out carbs where I can. \n\nI\u2019m not *fat* fat but I feel like if I don\u2019t get a handle on things, I\u2019ll get there. I\u2019m overweight and I can feel it affecting my health - I sweat more than I should, I get sugar cravings, my legs get tired after not much walking, etc. I\u2019ll probably start going for long walks and then jogs and then runs too. \n\nI last dieted last year, I lost a stone in 4 months doing keto, I\u2019m considering doing that again too. \n\nWish me luck!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oecags/i_just_drank_my_last_soda_so_begins_my_attempt_to/", "title": "I just drank my last soda - so begins my attempt to lose weight this summer.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AA005555", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 147, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625506835, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oecags/i_just_drank_my_last_soda_so_begins_my_attempt_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436264.7895474, "replies_charged": false}
