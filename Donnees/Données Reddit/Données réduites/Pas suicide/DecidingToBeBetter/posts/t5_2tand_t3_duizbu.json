But no matter what, you must honor what you are going though. Always give yourself kindness and compassion no matter what.\n\nThe mental weight of suffering never feels good but you must use that feeling and leverage it into a learning experience. Difficult circumstances makes one ponder and inquire about things while comfort and satisfaction leads to complacently. Profound personal growth is very often the result of suffering.\n\nYou always have to believe that things are working out for you no matter what. Being patient and trusting the process that you life is bigger than what you see right now. Don't let worry, fear, and anxiety destroy any progress you have made.\n\nMay the Universe bless you with prosperity and happiness. Peace to everyone :)\n\n*Quote of the Day: \"We are more often frightened than hurt; and we suffer more from imagination than from reality.\" Seneca*", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/duizbu/a_message_for_those_are_going_through_difficult/", "title": "A message for those are going through difficult times right now?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "world_citizen7", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 426, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1573426785, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/duizbu/a_message_for_those_are_going_through_difficult/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436050.2079701, "replies_charged": false}
