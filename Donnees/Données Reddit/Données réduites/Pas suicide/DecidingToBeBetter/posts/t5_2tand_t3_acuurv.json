I read books, and I read on my phone. I read about anything and everything, save for fiction/novels. I just like learning and thinking and reflecting.\n\nMost mornings, I get up, grab my coffee, get on the couch, and immediately something enters my mind that I want to read more about. Sometimes it\u2019s practical stuff like DIY home projects (I love me a good project, especially home organization!) and other times I\u2019ll read about psychology or politics or spirituality or culture...literally anything that pops into my head or mind that I feel like reading about.\n\nI also love to read posts on Reddit and respond with my experiences/insights and try to help people.\n\nIf I have nothing I \u201chave\u201d to do that day, this could go on for hours...like maybe 8am to noon, longest.\n\nUsually after 3-4 hours of doing this, I finally get tired of reading and will get up to do something, either a chore at home or a project, like drawing or working on music or organizing something. Rarely, I might think of something I want to go out and buy, and I\u2019ll get dressed and leave the house. (Obviously, I\u2019m describing a typical weekend.)\n\nThe problem is that I have a family. My daughter will eventually get up and want me for something. My husband will get up and want to come out in the living room to watch TV, which disrupts the silence. (I get up before everyone in the house just so I can read and drink my coffee and perhaps write privately.) \n\nAnd when I get disrupted, it makes me feel grouchy and irritable. At least, in my mind. I don\u2019t usually respond to my family with any irritably, but I\u2019m sure my response is \u201cdistanced.\u201d Like my energy is to just listen quietly, while inside I\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll leave me alone again soon. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m very engaged with them because I just want to be left alone again to read.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a 100% thing. This is more like 80% of the time. I CAN put down my phone or book, take a deep breath, let go of what I\u2019m reading, and start to engage in the real world. But the problem is that it just doesn\u2019t...excite me? I always just wish I could have kept doing what I was doing.\n\nIt can affect my work as well. On weekdays after taking my daughter to school, my husband has usually also gone to work and I\u2019m alone again. I work at home, remotely, so I can technically start working whenever I want. My goal is 9am, but if I\u2019m alone and engrossed in my reading and writing I might not start work until 10 or 11, which reduces the number of hours I have available to get work done.\n\nToday, for example, (Saturday) would be a great day to take my daughter to my parents\u2019 and visit with them. My dad invited me to help him and his Boy Scout troop build derby cars.\n\nBut I don\u2019t want to stop doing my things\u2014reading, or my house chores, or my independent hobbies.\n\nIt often feels like my need for alone time can\u2019t be satiated lately, I guess is what I\u2019m getting at.\n\nI feel this urge to just let go of all the independent stuff I want to be engrossed in, forget it all, and engage in the world around me. I feel like my constant drive and desire to do independent stuff is impacting my relationships, or at least it could. I have anxiety when I can\u2019t get the freedom to work on those projects at my leisure, especially since my life around those hours I\u2019m doing those projects is really so, so busy.\n\nIt can also affect my marriage. My husband loves to get up and get out of the house, especially on sunny days. Oftentimes he\u2019ll want to go to breakfast or brunch with me, which means I have to get up and get dressed (or at least decently presentable, not looking like I just woke up), and stop doing what I\u2019m doing. I know he can tell that I\u2019m doing it because I feel like I should, not because the prospect of having brunch with him, out, seems pleasing to me. But I do it, because I know it will be fun once I\u2019m out, and it\u2019ll get me out of my head...but nevertheless, the cycle starts again the next day. Knowing that putting my things down and leaving the house will ultimately be pleasurable and is also \u201cgood for me\u201d isn\u2019t usually enough motivation for me to want to change this habit. \n\nHas anyone here had any experience that\u2019s similar? Pushing people away to work on independent hobbies and feeling guilty about it, not taking much joy in \u201cexternal\u201d activities with family/friends because you\u2019d rather be alone reading or creating, etc?\n\nI\u2019m thinking it might help me to either set a schedule or to just let go of some things I want to do and hope I find time for them more \u201cnaturally.\u201d\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/acuurv/i_never_want_to_do_anything_and_i_feel_guilty/", "title": "I never want to do anything, and I feel guilty about it.
