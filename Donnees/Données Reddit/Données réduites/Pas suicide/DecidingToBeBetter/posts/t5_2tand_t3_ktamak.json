My daughter needs me, my dad's health is declining, I have too much work around the house, I don't have time.\n\nBut so far, the first week into this new year, I'm already down 8 pounds from changing the way I eat. I finally went to the doctor to get medication that I haven't taken in over a year that I need for my thyroid. I'll be going back soon to get my other health issues in order, one step at a time. And today I committed to finally start studying for my medical coding certification so I can get back to work and doing what I love as well as helping my wonderful husband in contributing to our mutual dreams.\n\nThis is my year and my outlook on life has never looked so optimistic.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ktamak/i_made_the_conscious_decision_to_make_this_my_year/", "title": "I made the conscious decision to make this my year", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "jellyfishpopstar", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1610136625, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ktamak/i_made_the_conscious_decision_to_make_this_my_year/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437603.243582, "replies_charged": false}
