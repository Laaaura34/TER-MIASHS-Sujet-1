Do I accept myself for who I am and never try any new foods and stay eating junk food? Or do I admit I have a bad habit of eating unhealthy food and try to change?\n\nIf I try to change I just feel bad because I'm admitting a flaw but if I don't do anything then I just stay where I am?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m6g36y/how_do_i_reconsile_accepting_myself_for_who_i_am/", "title": "How do I reconsile accepting myself for who I am while also recognizing that I have flaws that I need to work on?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ehesemar", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615920081, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m6g36y/how_do_i_reconsile_accepting_myself_for_who_i_am/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437996.6775694, "replies_charged": false}
