His struggles with mental health were pretty intense before the pandemic, but in the first couple months of the pandemic they took a big downwards swing.\n\nIt\u2019s been challenging for me to be supportive of him through this. How can you remain supportive about a problem that seems so unrelenting?\n\nYesterday, he told me that he felt like I was withholding my thoughts, feelings, and experiences from him.\nI think that\u2019s true. \nWhen he\u2019s upset, he gets into this frantic state where the only thing he can think about is how upset he is, but past experiences have shown him that trying to talk about those feelings, will never move the needle about them. Thus, at this point he refuses to talk about them with me, and I don\u2019t know what he talks about with his therapist.\n\nI\u2019m still working on why I hesitate to disclose things to him. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to be a burden to him when he\u2019s upset, I don\u2019t want him to feel like a burden, or that I\u2019m afraid that he\u2019s going to be unreceptive. Maybe some of all them.\n\nWhen I think he\u2019s upset, I worry about making things worse. Which paralyzes me. Of course I want to make him feel better. But past experiences have demonstrated that he\u2019ll often feel worse after talking to me, or to a professional.\n\nHe\u2019s told me that he doesn\u2019t want to be in a relationship with a filtered version of myself. And I agree, I want to be real with him. I think by sharing how I feel, I\u2019ll also be able to better be there for him during his times of need.\n\nI\u2019m making this post as a pledge to myself to be open, honest, and brave about sharing my feelings.\nOf course, I need to be mindful about when I\u2019m sharing those feelings.\n\nIf anyone has advice about being more open during challenging times, I\u2019d appreciate that. Additionally, if anyone has advice about consoling, cheering up, or otherwise helping someone who is extremely distraught, I\u2019d appreciate that as well.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lt3qvx/sharing_feelings_being_vulnerable_to_partner_in/", "title": "Sharing feelings, being vulnerable to partner in need", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "PepperMinkCoat", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614362678, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lt3qvx/sharing_feelings_being_vulnerable_to_partner_in/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435910.116187, "replies_charged": false}
