I\u2019m a 20 year old brown Muslim dude who\u2019s LOST. I feel like I\u2019m a bystander just watching life pass by trying to plan everything to perfection and not actually DOING anything. For the past 4 YEARS, I haven\u2019t exercised... I used to be outside playing sports all the time but ever since I stopped playing organized sports in sophomore year of high school I\u2019ve been gaining weight like crazy. Combined with the fact that I\u2019ve never really dieted or taken care of myself otherwise. I\u2019m in university and I have no idea what I\u2019m doing... I have no personality. Porn has hijacked my life and I developed an inferiority complex because I feel like I\u2019m supposed to be some big black dude to be masculine. I don\u2019t know what masculinity is. Am I supposed to transform into some sort of fuckboy to impress girls? Chase money, manipulate people and try to get to \u201cthe top\u201d? I don\u2019t know if I am a liberal or conservative. I don\u2019t really have social media but I spend all day on my phone. I have no friends. I\u2019ve really been into conspiracies and don\u2019t know what\u2019s true or not. Is God real? Do we have an afterlife? Will I be reincarnated? Or will I just disappear? I act like I believe in Islam  but I really do not know. So I act fake in front of my family because I don\u2019t want them to be disappointed in me but also because I\u2019m scared that if God really does exist, will I not make it in heaven? Is heaven even worth it? If I decide to come out, I \u2019ll probably be disowned by most my family but maybe my parents will still stick around because they want to live nearby me when I get married. If I do decide to stay, I\u2019ll most likely get an arranged marriage but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll love the person... is love even real? Is it just some chemical reaction? Should I try to blend in with others and follow trends? Get the new iPhones? But the new trendy clothes? Will I fit into them? Could I pull it off? I\u2019ve been wearing the same 2 hoodies for the past few months, no one has really said anything. Is it selfish for me to take care of myself? Should I put others before myself?\n\nI\u2019ve been trying to plan my life but it never works because I don\u2019t have the answers. I\u2019m too perfectionistic and haven\u2019t done anything as a a result.  Should I just go with the flow?\n\nThank you for tuning into my existential crises lol", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ea1hhi/i_dont_know_who_i_am/", "title": "I don\u2019t know who I am...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "idkdjvdibdub", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1576226462, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ea1hhi/i_dont_know_who_i_am/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437175.2944508, "replies_charged": false}
