Even if a path doesn't work out, at least I've tried. So, with that said, I've finally taken a leap of faith this year to pursue my entrepreneurial dreams. I was inspired by how Covid disproportionally impacted the female workforce and wanted to find a solution to help my fellow female professionals. So, here I am bootstrapping the development of my digital coaching mobile app solution as a solopreneur.\n\nIt's been an exciting and nerve-wracking journey. I feel all emotions - excitement, joy, fear, anxiety, etc. As a former executive, it's great to know that I can still get my hands dirty, learn new tools and technology on the fly, and make things happen myself. It's great to see how far the idea has come along as I'm getting ready to launch my beta in a few weeks. At the same time, I fear failure. What if no one is interested? What if people don't find value in my product? What if.... \n\nYet, every day, I remind myself to be mentally and emotionally strong and to persevere. Regardless of the outcome, I've grown more through this journey.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q7posf/conquering_my_fears/", "title": "Conquering my fears", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "jeancachu", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634175885, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q7posf/conquering_my_fears/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437293.6848116, "replies_charged": false}
