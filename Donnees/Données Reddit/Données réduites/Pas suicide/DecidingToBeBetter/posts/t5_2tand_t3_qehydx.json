I got way more responses than I anticipated, and I appreciate all of the help so much. I\u2019ve gotten a lot of helpful responses that I plan on incorporating into my life. Hopefully it\u2019ll help others in the same situation as well. \ud83d\udc96\n\nI\u2019ve (22f) got an insecure/anxious attachment style. When I\u2019m taking care of my mental health and doing things I enjoy, focusing on myself and enjoying others as extras in my life, things go really well. I\u2019m able to interact with others and enjoy my time with them, but not cling to them. \n\nBut often, I\u2019ll have a really good interaction with my friend or SO, and I\u2019ll cling to that feeling. I\u2019ll become obsessed. It\u2019s almost like I mistake the good feelings for them being like the \u201ccure\u201d to my unhappiness. I\u2019ll begin to neglect myself to focus on how often they respond, seek reassurance if they\u2019re mad/still like me, worry about the future of the friendship/relationship, have extreme positive mood swings when we talk then crash when we\u2019re unable to, etc. \n\nI\u2019ve also noticed that when someone is anxious to talk to me, or gets very serious, I become very anxious and distance myself out of fear.\n\nIt\u2019s a very destructive cycle. I\u2019m in therapy, and improved a bit. I\u2019ve been told that self-love and enjoying spending time alone will help. But it always comes back. I\u2019m not sure how to truly love myself without depending on others. I\u2019m also worried that if I don\u2019t have a tight grip or my relationships and friendships, they\u2019ll go away. Or that I don\u2019t care about them enough.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if any of this makes sense. But any advice or guidance would be really helpful. \n\nDo I just need got give myself permission to put myself first and love myself? \n\nWhy do I randomly start clinging to others and depending on them for reassurance and validation, when other times I\u2019m ok? \n\nTldr: Off and on anxious avoidant, it\u2019s exhausting and self-destructive, need advice.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qehydx/how_to_overcome_insecure_attachment/", "title": "How to overcome insecure attachment?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lavender-witch", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 379, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635038266, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qehydx/how_to_overcome_insecure_attachment/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436936.3539927, "replies_charged": false}
