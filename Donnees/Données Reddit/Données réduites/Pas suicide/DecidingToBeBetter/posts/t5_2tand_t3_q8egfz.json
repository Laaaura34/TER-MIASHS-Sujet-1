I have few friends and my close family has their own load of problems to deal with, so I end up keeping things for myself. \n\nThing is, some days I\u2019m very proud of myself, some other days, I fail to complete the tasks I set out to do, which is fine, but sometimes I just feel down and wanted to be listened to. It\u2019s not that I feel bad about it, I accept things as they are, but I just wanted a bit of attention from someone and a word of encouragment, something.\n\nI\u2019m just posting this to vent a little, overall I feel good about myself and I know that I\u2019m headed in the right direction. I\u2019m optimist in general, but bad days are rough, it\u2019s like all my efforts aren\u2019t noticible. It\u2019s hard to see light at the end of the tunnel, but I keep on moving.\n\nFinally I\u2019d like to share that I deleted all social media (apart from instagram that I had already deleted before) and will try hard to no fill my mind with garbage.\n\nI would also like to wish the best of luck to anyone on a similar position, stay strong my friends!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8egfz/staying_motivated_after_bad_days_feeling_lonely/", "title": "Staying motivated after bad days & feeling lonely", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Lonesav", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634264361, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8egfz/staying_motivated_after_bad_days_feeling_lonely/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437447.3892589, "replies_charged": false}
