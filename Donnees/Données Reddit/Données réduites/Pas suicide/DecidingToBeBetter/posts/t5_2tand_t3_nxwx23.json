About 3 years ago my depression returned.  Curiously, 3 years ago I fulfilled one of my dreams which was to live abroad (Japan), but when I returned to my country I began to rethink many things about whether I had studied the right career, that finding a job would be difficult and many other issues, finally I lost my motivation for all the things I used to like.  \n\nI didn't want to go to therapy because my parents hardly helps me to pay for my medicine and I don't think they want to support me with the idea of \u200b\u200ba psychologist. \nAt the moment I am self-employed and my income is not good\nFortunately I found a government institution that provides free psychological therapy. \n\nI hope everything gets better and I can find again a motivation in my life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nxwx23/i_just_made_an_appointment_to_go_to_the_therapy_i/", "title": "I just made an appointment to go to the therapy i need to treat my depression", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Sabishiinone", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 19, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623466599, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nxwx23/i_just_made_an_appointment_to_go_to_the_therapy_i/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436620.3910203, "replies_charged": false}
