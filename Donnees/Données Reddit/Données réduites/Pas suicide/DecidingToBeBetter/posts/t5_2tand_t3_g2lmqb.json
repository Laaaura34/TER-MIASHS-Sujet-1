I want my mom to stop drinking. I want my dad to stop getting so sucked into politics. I wish some people in my life would stop doing drugs and take their lives into their own hands. I want so many things from my friends. \n\nBut then, I am never so critical of myself. Who\u2019s to say I know any better? Lately I\u2019ve tried to work on this and just accept people for who they are and their faults. They won\u2019t change just because I tell them to or want them to. They accept me for who I am so I need to return the favor.\n\nEven after a few days it\u2019s made me feel so much better to catch myself when I enter this headspace.
