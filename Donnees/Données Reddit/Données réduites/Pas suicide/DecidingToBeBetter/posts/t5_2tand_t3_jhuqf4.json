The only time I drink is on weekends, or so I thought it would be. Last night was the 3rd night in a row that I drank alcohol. I hang out with my boyfriends parents and they both drink too, and we like to do shots and dance to music, but I cannot pace myself. The moment I do shots, I am blackout drunk. I can handle wine but not shots, and we did shots last night. I was supposed to spend time with my boyfriend and watch a movie since he\u2019s busy with law stuff most of the day and night, and I rarely get to see him. But I was way too drunk. I woke up in the bathroom at 3am, confused as fuck, and still drunk. I\u2019m still a bit drunk right now to be honest, and I hate it. I cannot handle alcohol and I\u2019m 21 years old, and it\u2019s ruining my quality time with my boyfriend, the little quality time I have with him. I\u2019ll save drinking for special occasions, but I am done drinking alcohol casually. It\u2019s gonna be hard, really hard, since the people I care about and hang out with all drink, but I think I can do it. I\u2019ve been wanting to do this for a while and this was the last nail in the coffin.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jhuqf4/i_think_im_gonna_give_up_drinking_last_night_was/", "title": "I think I\u2019m gonna give up drinking.
