I have been trying to go into autism-related therapy for months, but I need a diagnosis to move forward and my parents cannot find the original one.\n\nA while ago my dad (he's a psychologist) gave me his coworker's phone number and said that she is trained in providing the diagnosis. So I called her and left a voicemail. She called back and we ended up setting up an appointment. So now I will get a diagnosis soon!\n\nI have no idea how it will turn out. But I feel like it would be very beneficial. Not only would this allow me to find out which types of therapy I can seek, but it would also give me personal closure on why many things in my life are the way they are.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwws7y/im_getting_an_autism_diagnosis_soon/", "title": "I'm getting an autism diagnosis soon!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "CEO_Of_Rejection_99", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632796895, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwws7y/im_getting_an_autism_diagnosis_soon/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435435.655449, "replies_charged": false}
