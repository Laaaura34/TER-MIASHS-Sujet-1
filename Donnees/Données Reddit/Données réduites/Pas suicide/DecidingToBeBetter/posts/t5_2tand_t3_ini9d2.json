In 2016 I found myself without a single friend I\u2019d call \u201cclose\u201d. And since then, much of my spare time has been dedicated to fixing this.\n\nThis post (and all others) is nothing more than a fun project where I write about things I\u2019ve found. I am not \u2013 nor in any way \u2013 claim to be an expert on making friends or any crap like that.\n\nToday\u2019s post is about small-talk.\n\nI used to find myself stuck in small-talk all the time, and was genuinely crap at it. Seeing as my goal was to make new friends, I figured I had to get better at it...*right?*\n\nWRONG!\n\nThere's no such thing as better small-talk. Small-talk by definition is terrible conversation. And as you'll see, there's a much better way.\n\n**The Secret to Fun Conversation**\n\nHave you ever found yourself stuck in crappy small-talk?\n\nEveryone has. It\u2019s boring, goes nowhere, and leaves a feeling of awkwardness with whoever spoke with.\n\nThe reason this happens is because most people approach meeting new people in the wrong way. It\u2019s too rigid and formal.\n\nYou solve this by changing your mindset when meeting strangers. From here on I want you to\u2026\n\nAssume everyone is already your good friend\n\nLet me explain.\n\nHere\u2019s how a normal conversation begins:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*You: Hi, good to meet you, how are you?\\**\n\n*Bob: I\u2019m good thanks. What about yourself?*\n\n*You: I\u2019m great too. So I heard you\u2019re an architect.*\n\n*Bob: Yeah for 7 years now. I work in \u2026.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCongrats, you\u2019ve now entered small talk land. The home of the bored and depressed. Instead here\u2019s how a better conversation goes:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*You: Hey what\u2019s up man, how things?*\n\n*Bob: I\u2019m good thanks. What about yourself?*\n\n*You: Ahh man, I\u2019m bored as hell. I got stuck in a conversation with my wife\u2019s uncle. He lectured me for best part of 10 minutes about selling propane. What about you \u2013 anyone bored you yet?*\n\n*Bob: Actually, see that woman by the statue? I had a chat with her about her daughter\u2019s graduation. She wouldn\u2019t stop\u2026*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSee the difference?\n\nBy treating Bob like a friend and speaking accordingly you give him a chance to do the same \u2013 which opens the door to a potential friendship.\n\nOf course, the other person isn\u2019t always going to respond with something good. Some people take time to warm up \u2013 and others are just born boring!\n\nBut the point is you lose nothing by speaking to them with the same ease you would with a good friend.\n\nI remember when I first tried this. I was worried I would look like some socially inept odd-ball. But to my surprise tons of genuine, fun guys have loved the humour and openness.\n\nIt was a relief, but made sense right away.\n\n(After all, wouldn\u2019t you love it if someone spoke with you like this?)\n\nSeriously give it a go.\n\nI bet you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised by the results ;)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ini9d2/i_suck_at_smalltalk_and_used_to_think_i_had_to/", "title": "I suck at small-talk and used to think I had to master it to make friends as an adult.
