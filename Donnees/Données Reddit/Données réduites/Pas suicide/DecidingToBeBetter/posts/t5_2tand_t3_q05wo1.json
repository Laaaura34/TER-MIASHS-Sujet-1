Here are just a few highlights: I've worked on overcoming my codependency in therapy, I've attended a bunch Tony Robbins virtual events, I'm pushing myself at the gym more than ever (5x/week + cardio), I quit my job as a corporate lawyer because it didn't align with my life purpose, and I started a YouTube channel focused on mindset, mental health, relationships, and productivity. I believe every person has a gift to share, that we are each capable of truly incredible things when we have the right mindset, and that life is meant to be enjoyed and explored. My current life focus is on understanding myself more and improving my content so that I can help empower millions of people to live their best lives. \n\nI'm a big believer in knowing what you want, so I would love to attract people who are optimistic, ambitious, kind, self-empowered, passionate, empathetic, friendly, and humble. Bonus points if you're into any of the following: \ud83d\udcf7 content creation, \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f fitness, \u2728 spirituality, \ud83c\udfae gaming/nerdy stuff, and \ud83e\udd73 EDM/raves.\n\nI'm going to move to LA soon, so it would be amazing to make friends who live there, but I'm also open to making online friends or even creating a mastermind group! Comment below, DM me, or add me on IG (link in bio) if interested. Btw no pressure at all, we can chat and see if we vibe, and I've already learned that I'm not meant to be friends with everyone \u2764\ufe0f Let's make our dreams come true together!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q05wo1/hello_im_looking_to_make_some_new_extraordinary/", "title": "Hello!
