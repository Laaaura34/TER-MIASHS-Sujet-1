My biggest step in doing this is to kick my weed addiction. I've been high for too long, and I need motivation to do my schoolwork and study. I need to start working again on my free time, and learning how to balance school and work. I owe it to her and my mother, who supports me. \n\nThat is all, and this is day 1.
