It made me remember my most recent relationship: the good , the bad and the growth we both made. It made me acknowledge my feelings more and to just let it, to let myself feel. There is a particular high / happiness I almost forgot from letting myself feel and by just being blatantly honest with myself.\n\nSince we broke up, I haven't been doing anything else but to constantly challenge myself to become a better person particularly for myself and what kind of person I want to become with or without someone. I've been getting to know me more and more ea passing day.\n\nIf I may be honest at this very moment as I am writing this, I hope he is doing better. I hope he is also growing. I hope he is taking care of himself, most especially his sister and his family. I hope he is filled with peace to where he is now at his current stage in life. I hope he feels that even though I have my own ego trips when it comes to him, there is nothing but love and light I wish for him. I hope he is full of love", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5b283/tonight_im_so_happy_to_just_let_myself_feel/", "title": "Tonight, I'm so happy to just let myself feel", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tiarasmalls", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629097923, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5b283/tonight_im_so_happy_to_just_let_myself_feel/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437101.91318, "replies_charged": false}
