My coworkers are derelicts and would not be able to function outside of this tiny bubble of a job they are in. It is the only real just I have worked at in my adult working life. I feel pigeonholed in it now. I am 32. I am currently going to school but the coofening has made it difficult to find a job in a new field (I am applying to help desk) and while I would be taking a massive pay cut I can't even get a interview.\n\nHow do I stay motivated to get my schoolwork done and not be depressed 40 hours a week at my job?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ji53lx/dealing_with_awful_job/", "title": "dealing with awful job", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Comprehensive-Let884", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1603673841, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ji53lx/dealing_with_awful_job/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438137.2919097, "replies_charged": false}
