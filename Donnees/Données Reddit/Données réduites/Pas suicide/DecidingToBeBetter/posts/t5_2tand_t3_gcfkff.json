Its like okay I\u2019m single and my friend groupchat isnt even always active so its like I\u2019m just playing with my phone for nothing. Like, yes, I should definitely be sleeping but sleep is boring but social media is boring too, yet I still choose to waste time on my phone. This sucks!!!\n\nI honestly have no idea what I\u2019m actually seeking for from the constant refreshing of my twitter, tiktok and instagram feed. It was known to give dopamine right but now I feel like its just ??? Idk and I\u2019m sad, I feel so useless although in reality I do help around alot but when I\u2019m alone I find myself feeling lethargic and doing nothing on my phone for hours.\n\nAnyone else can relate?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gcfkff/social_media_doesnt_give_me_satisfaction_or/", "title": "Social media doesn\u2019t give me satisfaction or anything anymore", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "princezznichii", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 19, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1588459537, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gcfkff/social_media_doesnt_give_me_satisfaction_or/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438104.0295062, "replies_charged": false}
