It can reach from something falls off my plate, my laptop's not cooperating, some clothing falls down, I hit my foot, etc. I am ALWAYS cursing I am cursing at least 30 000 Times in a day when not more.\n\nI want to stop cursing. How could I achieve that? I tried to like breath slowly and told myself \"Okay ms\\_ryoko\\_chan calm down it was nothing don't get mad\" but that only makes me rage even harder. I tried to use cuter words to \"curse\" but kinda after a day or 2 I am again at F\\*ck, Sh\\*t, or any of my native Language's cursings.\n\nHow can I achieve to not curse so much? It is driving everyone so insane especially me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfiqce/how_can_i_stop_myself_from_cursing_so_much/", "title": "How can I stop myself from cursing so much", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ms_ryoko_chan", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 35, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635174303, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfiqce/how_can_i_stop_myself_from_cursing_so_much/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435766.4504795, "replies_charged": false}
