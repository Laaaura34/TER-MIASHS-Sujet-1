I have been suicidal for about a decade now and after surviving two attempts on my life, I feel like I\u2019m finally learning the lessons that not only would have saved me a lot of pain but also could have seriously reduced my depression, helped me stay in school, maintain healthier relationships, and not be reliant on drugs and alcohol. So whether you\u2019re struggling with self-confidence, body positivity, mental illness, or you\u2019re just plain miserable, these ideas could turn your whole identity inside out. I\u2019m currently trying to take my own advice and really practice what I preach because even though sometimes I hate myself, I cannot leave the people who love me behind in this world, not yet anyway. So If not for yourself, be better for them.\n\n\nIf you ever find yourself feeling lost, depressed, hopeless or even just discontent with where your life is at right now, you need to take a good look at what your values have been and be honest and realistic with yourself about what you want them to be. I don\u2019t mean your morals, I mean what gets you up in the morning. Everybody has a thing, belief, purpose, that affects every single decision they make more than anything else. For some people it\u2019s god, for some people it\u2019s themselves, for some it\u2019s family or money or sex. Reflect on what gives your life the most meaning, and be brutally honest. \n\nNext, think about the qualities you want to have instead, ask yourself WHY you want to have those qualities, and then plan the actions you have to take to get there based on what you value the most (or want to value the most even if you don\u2019t right now. You think you care about your wife but looking back, you realize you wouldn\u2019t have cheated on her if you didn\u2019t care about your own happiness more). \n\nThis does not work if you are not honest and realistic. If you value having friends that care and support you, you have to realize you need to value and support others first (and yourself). You ask yourself \u201cwhy do I want good friends?\u201d And the answer is pretty simple. Because you\u2019re a human who has social needs and you want to feel supported by and connected with people who share similar values as you. If you decide your top priority is to be beautiful, ask yourself why? What is \u201cbeautiful\u201d to you, is it just being prettier than your friends? Because if you define success based on how superior you are to others then you will always feel like a failure because there will always be someone more attractive, smarter, stronger, etc. than you. So if being beautiful isn\u2019t about being more or less attractive than other people, does it simply mean being attractive to everyone? Because in that case you\u2019re fucked again. Everyone has their own preferences, there will always be people who find you attractive (or funny or cool or annoying as fuck) and always will be people who don\u2019t, whether you look like hallie berry or marge simpson. So does that mean beauty is getting attention, money, and instagram likes? Also a big nope. Danny devito is one of the most famous people in the world and he\u2019s not exactly a model but god damn is he a beautiful human (Attention is not a need, real connection is). \n\nWe need to feel apart of a community to stay sane, just like we need nutrition, exercise,  intellectual challenges, and a stable environment. (All of our goals are to thrive, not just survive.) So what does beautiful even fucking mean if it\u2019s none of this? Well look at it this way. Almost nobody wins the genetic lottery but it doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t beautiful. Yes it can be advantageous in society to have a symmetrical face, an hourglass figure, large muscles and nice hair. But what will really get you far in life is MENTAL GROWTH, SELF RESPECT, and WORKING TO ACHIEVE YOUR newly evaluated and not-so-shitty GOALS. So unless you consciously decide that all you want in this short life is to be a narcissist, surround yourself with people who don\u2019t value you, and/or constantly seek pleasure instead of real fulfillment, you NEED to forgive and accept yourself. Accept your flaws in your genetic code because they\u2019re not your fault (fault\u2260responsibility. You have to choose how to handle whatever cards you were dealt) nor can you do anything to change them! It\u2019s your \u201cflaws\u201d that make you perfect. Love what makes you different from other people because that is what makes you beautiful. \n\nIf you stop beating yourself up for not being \u201cgood enough\u201d and start acting on your goals that you have made based on your values, all of a sudden you will find that you are good enough. If you want to stop caring about one thing and start caring about another, you have to change your actions because actions are what dictate our emotions, NOT the other way around. Unfollow those artificial instagram models, stop talking to people who are toxic, start working out your mind and body, treat yourself with love and you will start loving yourself.\n\nEdit: created paragraphs, hopefully it\u2019s easier to read. I hope what this lacks in structure is made up for by its content.\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for the award, anonymous user.
