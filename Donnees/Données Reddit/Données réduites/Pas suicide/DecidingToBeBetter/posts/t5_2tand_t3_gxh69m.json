I want to be my own person and not lose myself in others or a relationship every time you know? It ruins me and I did think, why am I giving someone so much power over me like this?\n\nBecause of my own insecurities, jealousy and paranoia as well I have always been scared to lose my partner. I am always trying to control our situations making sure he's not losing interest or he's acting right. Im always thinking what if it fails? But now I have replaced it with the fact that there's actually 7 billion people in the world, and who's to say that there aren't others out there who can reciprocate back the same energy? And when I am saying this, there's a group of people in my mind that gives me hope. Not because I fanatsize them or see potential, but because I know that there are people out there who are gentle, loyal and soft.  \n\nSo they give me hope. I know it is always easier said than done, but it does comfort me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gxh69m/the_thought_of_other_people_existing_comforts_me/", "title": "The thought of other people existing comforts me?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "cl0udnin3_", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1591405266, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gxh69m/the_thought_of_other_people_existing_comforts_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438277.577796, "replies_charged": false}
