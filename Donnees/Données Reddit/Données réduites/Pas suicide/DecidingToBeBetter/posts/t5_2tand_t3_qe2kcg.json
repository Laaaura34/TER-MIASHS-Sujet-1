Ive progressed  so much through it and it sparked that drive within me again the moment I realized that first- 1 hour free trial class went by so quick because I was so into it. \n\nI\u2019ve became obsessed with the art. I would study film, train on my off time as much as I could planning to just step into the ring at least once.\n\nI\u2019m aware that my chances of fighting at the top stage is to none. I just know that I will be happy to at least step into the ring doing what I love to do, no matter what. \n\nI want to live with no regrets. No \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d. I already know I would drown into suicide probably living with \u201cwhat if\u2019s\u201d. \n\nThe issue is, financing my passion. I know I cannot get by with a 9-5 job minimum wage job in CALIFORNIA. I plan to go to college soon, of course through the GI Bill. \n\nAnyone else gone through anything similar? I want to pick brains and learn!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qe2kcg/passion_or_bullshit/", "title": "Passion or bullshit?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ThuggerLeFlamo", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634985978, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qe2kcg/passion_or_bullshit/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437111.2219014, "replies_charged": false}
