Currently I'm close to 31 (M), have pretty good finances and career. I'm not rich, but I have more money than majority in my country. I also have great hobbies like playing guitar, learning languages, running etc...\n\nBut I still think I'm in the comfort zone and trying to challenge myself to go to the next level. Problem is, I don't know what is next level for me, and where to start. I want to make big risks in my life to be honest, but can't specify what.\n\nMy question to you is, do you have some life examples when you said okay its enough I'm going to flip my life over and do things differently?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9wa33/how_to_get_next_level_in_life/", "title": "How to get next level in life?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "harvey_croat", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 23, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634467041, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9wa33/how_to_get_next_level_in_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435967.5831816, "replies_charged": false}
