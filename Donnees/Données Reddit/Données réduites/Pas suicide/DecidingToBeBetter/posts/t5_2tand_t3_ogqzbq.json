I was always busy mentally, always tired and always anxious. \n\nMy friend had been telling me for years to try meditation but I never even considered it. I thought it was something people did when they had too much time and money on their hands (of which I FELT I had none).\n\nOne day after hearing about meditation in a YouTube talk, I decided to try it out. My idea of mediation was to silence my mind and not think anything. It was incredibly difficult. I didn\u2019t have much success doing it either. So I reached back to my friend and asked advice. What he told me was a game changer. Meditation isn\u2019t about quieting the mind but about observing the mind. Pay attention to what you\u2019re thinking and let the thought pass (don\u2019t hold onto it or associate with it) - just like a cloud in the sky. \n\nI tried it and that\u2019s when everything changed. I realised all of the negative and self limiting thoughts that were floating through my mind without me even noticing. Once I started noticing, they started quieting (as I let them pass away without attaching myself to them), and my life started improving exponentially. \n\nThis message won\u2019t be for everybody but hoping anyone out that is currently living how I was, sees this and overcomes this battle.\n\nPs this isn\u2019t a one time thing, it\u2019s a constant practice and habit. Just like daily showers clean the body, daily meditation cleans the mind!\n\nAll the best", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ogqzbq/how_i_got_my_anxiety_and_overthinking_under/", "title": "How I got my anxiety and overthinking under control", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "BlackPlato", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 82, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625817752, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ogqzbq/how_i_got_my_anxiety_and_overthinking_under/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435769.6323333, "replies_charged": false}
