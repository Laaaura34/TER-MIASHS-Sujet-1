After what happened last week I wanted to start trying harder to show affection. just a simple \u201clove ya/love you guys/love you too\u201d when ending a conversation. I\u2019m more of an \u201cactions speak louder than words\u201d kind of person, but I understand not everyone else is that way. Ive emotionally cut myself off from just about everything and I\u2019m trying to work on it but I get embarrassed when I\u2019m shown affection so I want it to become more natural. This way, I can say the words and be willing to back it up so they know for sure.\n\nOTHER PROGRESS\n-took over the monthly bills for my mom as part of a plan to feel more responsible and become an adult.\n-bought a coworker a soda, told me that a relative of his died recently so Its not much but I thought I\u2019d try and cheer him up a little just in case he was still down about it\n-gave a coworker socks, noticed that they weren\u2019t wearing any and I got a chance to leave work early, so I left and brought back some socks for him. He said thanks but he came back the next day with a different pair of socks. I\u2019m hoping he didn\u2019t think I was calling him poor\ud83d\ude05\n\nGood luck to everyone here on a journey, have a wonderful week!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n3h9vf/i_started_telling_my_family_i_love_them/", "title": "I Started telling my family I love them", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Diggydog323", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 61, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619993424, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n3h9vf/i_started_telling_my_family_i_love_them/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435865.571049, "replies_charged": false}
