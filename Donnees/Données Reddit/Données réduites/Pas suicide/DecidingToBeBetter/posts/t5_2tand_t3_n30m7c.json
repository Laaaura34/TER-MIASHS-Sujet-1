For about a week i have been driving myself to work and for running errands. I feel great and really proud of myself! I didn't drive out of town yet, but i probably will today. \n\nMy advice for anyone going through the same problem : take it one day at a time, try going back and forth on an empty parking lot to \"warm up\" , have a friend nearby for support and to correct your mistakes, when you feel overwhelmed stop and take deep breaths until you calm down and continue whenever you can. \n\nP.S. the car is old (made in 89.) and definitely not beginner friendly so i feel like that makes the whole thing more impressive.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n30m7c/i_started_driving/", "title": "I started driving!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tyna_96", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 31, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619936748, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n30m7c/i_started_driving/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435802.709778, "replies_charged": false}
