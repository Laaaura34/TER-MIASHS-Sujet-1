I rarely hold to what I say, I am annoying and I tend to hurt peoples feelings without really thinking. I tend to say bigoted things for the sake of a 'joke' knowing full-well it's not OK. I also realized I tend to be closed minded and I tend to gatekeep. I really just want to think about how I come off to people, I have lost many friends through arguments and it's finally hit me that the problem probably isn't them, but me. \n\nEdit: I didn't expect this much attention. I really appreciate all your advice, I will work on this with a therapist.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/khi92q/i_want_to_be_better_i_am_a_toxic_person/", "title": "I want to be better.
