Conflicts are part of our lives, you can't satisfy everyone (As Jordan Peterson said: Delayed conflict is multiplied conflict) \n\no Fear of abundance? People who don\u2019t respect your time doesn\u2019t belong in your life\n\n\\- In which situations you have a problem in saying NO? is it work? Family members? Partner?\n\n\\- If you don\u2019t have boundaries and rules, you will always play by others rules \n\n\\- People will push your boundaries as long as you let them\n\n\\- Revise your values and remind your self \n\n\\- How to find out your values? Use this technique\n\no Think of someone whose actions make you angry\n\no For example, if someone makes you angry by lying your value is honesty\n\n\\- Reactions when someone asks you to do someone for them:\n\no Passive \u2013 you agree to avoid conflict\n\no Assertive \u2013 let's talk about it, I don\u2019 want to do it because \u2026. (I don\u2019t have time or I have something else to do)\n\no Aggressive \u2013 you say no but in a very aggressive way \n\no Passive-aggressive \u2013 oh really? You don\u2019t have time to do this for me? Heh (sarcastic laugh)\n\no Manipulation \u2013 oh so you don\u2019t want to help me? Ok, I will remember this if you will need something from me later!\n\n\\- If you were raised by parents who were always helpful and never said NO, you will tend to think that it's correct, people will sense that and they will use you.\n\n\\- Manipulators will always make you feel guilty \n\no They attack your emotions\n\no They act like a poor person who nobody wants help \n\no They act aggressively (threatening) \n\no They will want to be above you\n\no They will compliment you a lot \n\no They will degrade you \n\no Intellectual bullying (for example they use advanced/professional words to make you feel stupid)\n\no They pressure you by the time \n\n\\- ALWAYS STAND UP TO THE MANIPULATOR, never ever avoid eye contact\n\n\\- Some manipulators don\u2019t even know they are manipulating\n\n\\- Phrases to use on manipulators:\n\no I feel you are pressuring me now, I need time to think it over (repeat if necessary) \n\no Put yourself in my position, would you do it?\n\no I feel you are trying to scare/threaten me? Am I right? \n\no What you are doing right now is clear manipulation/emotional abuse, that does not work with me, if you don't change your way/tone there is nothing to be discussed between us\n\n\\- Rights of assertiveness:\n\no I have the right to judge my behavior thoughts and emotions and to take responsibility for their initiations and consequences. Others may influence my decision but the final choice is mine.\n\no I have the right to offer neither the reason nor excuse to justify my behavior. Others may try to manipulate my behavior and feelings by demanding to know my reasons and by trying to persuade me that I am wrong but I know that I'm the ultimate judge.\n\no I have the right to judge whether I'm responsible for finding solutions to others' problems. If I fail to recognize these assertive rights others may choose to manipulate my thoughts and feelings by placing the blame for their problems on me.\n\no I have the right to change my mind. Others may try to manipulate my choice by asking that I admit or by stating that I am responsible it is never the last unnecessary for me to justify my decision. \n\no I have the right to say I don't know. \n\no I have the right to make mistakes and be responsible for them. Others may try to manipulate me having me believe that my errors are unforgivable that I must make amends for my wrongdoing by engaging in proper behavior. If I allow this my future behavior will be influenced by my past mistakes and my decisions will be controlled by the opinions of others. \n\no I have the right to be independent of the goodwill of others before coping with them. It would be unrealistic for me to expect others to approve all my actions regardless of their merit. \n\no I have the right to be illogical and making decisions. \n\no I have the right to say I don't understand \n\no I have the right to say I don't care. \n\n\\- Assertiveness rules:\n\no Show understanding:\n\n\u00a7 I understand your situation but\u2026.. \n\n\u00a7 Thank you for choosing me to help you but\u2026\n\n\u00a7 I would love to help you but\u2026.\n\n\u00a7 I don\u2019t think you will like my response but\u2026.\n\no Say your point of view \n\no Offer an alternative solution\n\n\\- The scratched CD technique: \n\no You need to be calm\n\no Repeat your request or sentence", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n5hgyf/saying_no_defines_who_you_are/", "title": "Saying \u2018No\u2019 Defines Who You Are", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Posty1111", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1620225605, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n5hgyf/saying_no_defines_who_you_are/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435104.5811856, "replies_charged": false}
