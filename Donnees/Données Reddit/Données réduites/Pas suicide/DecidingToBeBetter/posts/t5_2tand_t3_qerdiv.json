After many long months, I finally decided to tidy my room yesterday. It wasn't an easy task at all. It took me about 4 hours to do so. Perhaps that is the case because I took long breaks while cleaning the room.  \n\n\nI feel so relieved after tidying. I cannot really explain it.  After such a long delay in cleaning the room, it feels so good that I finally did it.  \n\n\nToday, I plan to make other changes in my life as well. And of course, I plan to keep my room clean from now on. I don't whether I will succeed or not, but I shouldn't really worry about that. It is important to try, no matter what.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qerdiv/finally_tidied_my_room/", "title": "Finally tidied my room", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MrMarduk1518", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 100, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635079187, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qerdiv/finally_tidied_my_room/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436252.4356313, "replies_charged": false}
