I'm *incredibly* sensitive, probably due in no small part to the fact I grew up privileged, largely avoided conflict, and psychoanalyzed myself up a massive inferiority complex. I want to be a therapist, listening to people and helping their tough problems, but I can't even handle the idea of someone preferring to talk to someone else without starting to well up. My school has counseling, which I've used and intend to use again, but how can I put myself into situations or cognitive habits where I \"toughen up\"? Am I doomed to a necessary trial by fire, where I have to consistently embarrass myself by crying until I learn to stop?  \n\n\nO, ye Reddit gods, please help me stop being a little bitch. /s", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iuad5j/how_do_i_stop_crying/", "title": "How do I stop crying?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "and_consequently", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1600309334, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iuad5j/how_do_i_stop_crying/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437852.9123108, "replies_charged": false}
