I went from being a cheerful kid with some of the best grades in my class to your average depressed teen who just doesn't care about school, to the point that last year i was literally 0.1 points away from failing arts class. I don't know what happened. The only thing that slightly motivates me is the fear of having to spend more time in school. But the biggest thing to me is that i can't focus in online class.
