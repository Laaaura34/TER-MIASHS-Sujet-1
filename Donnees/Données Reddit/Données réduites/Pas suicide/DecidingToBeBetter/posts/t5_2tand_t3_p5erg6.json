It really feels like the past 3 months were nothing but an absolute waste.\n\nHowever, that's not true!\n\nMy abilities have improved immensely since this project.\n\nThere are still two orders on the works.\n\nAnd I am incredibly lucky to have the support of my parents in such an unsustainable business.\n\nThis is an extremely soul-crushing defeat... but I know I have talent. This is one of the many obstacles I will face as an animator and through this experience, it is evident where exactly I need to improve.\n\nI procrastinated immensely.\n\nI did not prepare the shot correctly, beforehand.\n\nI spent money on advanced tools, without mastering the principles of animation.\n\nAnd I am grateful for such a beautiful opportunity in order acknowledge this!\n\nLife hurts, but that's how you know you're alive!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5erg6/i_spent_3_months_working_exclusively_on_a_single/", "title": "I spent 3 months working exclusively on a single 3D Animation offer that just got cancelled... and I can't wait for the next one!!!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "compadre_goyo", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629115716, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5erg6/i_spent_3_months_working_exclusively_on_a_single/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435084.477628, "replies_charged": false}
