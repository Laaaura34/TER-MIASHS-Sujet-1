Stuff but i do associate myself with them, i am a gentlemen with interests in the victorian era and interests in maybe restoring the better and more practical parts from it, and that last thing has got me into some flack, last night i got into an argument with a reddit user for saying i don't want traditional dining saloons to close for good due to COVID, he thought i was wealthy, and grew up with privilidge, i told him i grew up with anything but and he said i didn't understand, he also said that society needs to move on and that there's no need to keep tradition, i found him frankly a disgusting figure, what will life be like without weddings too? what a strange world we live in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd this is how my life goes, mostly called worthless by other people, i recently bought myself a new coat and am doubting wether i should wear it when i get it, its a formal coat and people tell me i shouldn't wear formal its bad, i've also been called an \"affectation\" before, whatever that means, my brother also mocked me for learning how to speak irish, and he mocks me all the time for using a fountain pen, i need some motivation reddit, please, i will appreciate your advice, no one likes me for what i am\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSl\u00e1n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gb06vm/i_feel_as_if_my_victorian_lifestyle_is_going_to/", "title": "I feel as if my victorian lifestyle is going to get me nowhere", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "NoCommunication7", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 0, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1588267900, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gb06vm/i_feel_as_if_my_victorian_lifestyle_is_going_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437848.1289213, "replies_charged": false}
