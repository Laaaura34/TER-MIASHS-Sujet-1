I literally only learned one measure of a piano piece, but if I learn another tomorrow that's way more progress than I usually make.\n\nMaking yourself better is not only about realizing what you need to fix, but also getting pride from what you can accomplish. Even if it's something small.\n\nThe craziest thing about it is that I was out late last night partying.\n\nThis is a good feeling, it's one I should be chasing.
