I think I have a pretty good mental health, healthy habits, I try to be kind with people and with me but sometimes I feel like I\u2019m too selfish with the excuse that \u201cI have boundaries\u201d also deep down I dont trust people and I\u2019m bad at building deep friendships because I\u2019m quiet and dont know how to properly communicate when I care about someone. My best friend has this easy way and charm of being liked since she talks about her life and people trust her easily as someone who could help them with deep personal issues or just talk about whatever with her. I dont know how to be this charming and feel people good when they are around me, it feels very forced for me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0nihc/i_want_to_improve_myself_but_not_sure_where_to/", "title": "I want to improve myself but not sure where to start", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "sxltynights", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623788097, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0nihc/i_want_to_improve_myself_but_not_sure_where_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435817.9615867, "replies_charged": false}
