It's something I didn't like to believe, I mean how could I-- somebody so outgoing, with a big personality, and loves talking to people-- be insecure? Well, it's probably because of my insecurity that I am the way I am. No, definitely. I have an extreme need to be liked and the center of attention.\n\nI'm not looking to change those aspects about me, I really like the person I am, but rather I want to change my reasons for being myself. Rather than faking it until I make it, I want to know what steps I need to take in order to actually \"make it\". So, how do I overcome my insecurity? Any advice or input would be well appreciated.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ltz3gz/ive_accepted_this_part_about_me_so_whats_next/", "title": "I've accepted this part about me; so what's next?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwaway021321", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614465500, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ltz3gz/ive_accepted_this_part_about_me_so_whats_next/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435165.517997, "replies_charged": false}
