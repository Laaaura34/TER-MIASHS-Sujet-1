I was using a combination of these 2, plus alcohol almost daily, and that was for about 2 years straight. I feel so much better. Sure I still have some lasting side effects, and mental issues that are from the prolonged use, but damn this feels good. I was hospitalized for an OD, and still used after that for about 6 months.   \n\nI was in a super bad place, and while my life is by no means great, its so much better now. \n\nBut now, here I am. 1 year clean. 2 is next!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l6k6dx/one_year_clean_from_hard_drugs_2_is_next/", "title": "ONE YEAR clean from hard drugs. 2 is next!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "BurrStreetX", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1993, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1611796790, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l6k6dx/one_year_clean_from_hard_drugs_2_is_next/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436145.5027585, "replies_charged": false}
