I even wanted to invite my family and friends to join there. However, I saw a post saying bad things about this group opposing their belief. And part of me felt discouraged and started to get confused. I was born without religion so i have no basic foundation about the bible and stuff. Just because of a single hate post, I started doubting it even though it has proven me wonderful things and helped me improve my life. This reveals that I am easily influenced by others opinion and afraid that I would also be hated for being in this group. It gives me anxiety. I am always afraid and a coward. I only think of myself. It seems like I betrayed them. I feel fake, selfish, and weak. I was aware of it and wish I could change it :( I never wanted to be this type of person but this nature is stuck in me. I want to improve my personality so I will always have a firm standpoint in any situation in the future.. :((((", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o6xbq1/why_is_it_so_hard_for_me_to_stand_on_my_own/", "title": "Why is it so hard for me to stand on my own decisions?
