I\u2019m just about to 30 days clean and sober, and I just wanted to say thank you to all the sweethearts that left comments on my original post \ud83d\udc97\ud83c\udf38\ud83d\udc95 The little push from you guys really helped me step over that threshold, and now I\u2019m only getting better everyday! I\u2019m so glad I made the decision to be better. And I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t have to do it alone.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the award omg \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\udda4", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jk2ur8/update_i_left_my_alcoholic_fianc\u00e9_and_went_to/", "title": "Update!!: I left my alcoholic fianc\u00e9 and went to rehab!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "trashbagrunway", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 82, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1603942379, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jk2ur8/update_i_left_my_alcoholic_fianc\u00e9_and_went_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437546.3055775, "replies_charged": false}
