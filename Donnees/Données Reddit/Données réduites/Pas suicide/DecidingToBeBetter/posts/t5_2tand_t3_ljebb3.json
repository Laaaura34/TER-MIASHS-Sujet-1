This company was so toxic and unhealthy for me. I got shingles from the stress, put on anxiety medication and had many sleepless night; but for some reason I stayed.\n\nOver the past year, I started to care less and became exhausted over what I perceived were my failures (they weren\u2019t failures). Plus plus a lack of connection/communication to my former co-workers/management.  \n\nMy work suffered and it became a self-fulfilling-prophecy and I was let go due to \u201cjob performance\u201d Friday morning.\n\nI want to say I\u2019m shocked, but I\u2019m not. I want to say I\u2019m relieved that this 3 years nightmare is over but my ego has other plans.\n\nI\u2019m going to take this time for myself. My mental and my physical health. I\u2019m fortunate to be able to take a few weeks off before job searching and I\u2019m going to get my mind right.\n\nI will not allow a company of job to determine my worth. I will not let people who do not care for me, or care about me make me spiral they way I allowed them to.\n\nI am deciding to be better; I\u2019m not sure how long it\u2019ll take\u2014but I\u2019m making this promise to myself.\n\nWish me luck!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ljebb3/fired_from_a_job_i_hated_determined_to_make/", "title": "Fired from a job I hated, determined to make something of my self.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "iackjeeeee", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 26, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613266406, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ljebb3/fired_from_a_job_i_hated_determined_to_make/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436622.074448, "replies_charged": false}
