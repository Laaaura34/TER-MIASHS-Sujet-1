I could never maintain an exercise habit when I lived in my tiny basement apartment.\n\nI moved back home with my parents because at the end of January, I went to court to testify against my rapist. It was hellish. Since then, my PTSD symptoms have relapsed to almost as bad as they were at the time of the assault four years ago.  I could no longer work or basically function, so I sheepishly moved back home with my parents. \n\nIn the past, they were generally been dismissive with attitudes such as \u201cyou just need to get over it.\u201d  or \u201cdon\u2019t let him take more away from you. Although since I\u2019ve moved back home, they have been woken up by my nightmares, my crying at night, and they\u2019ve also witnessed just how hard I work to combat all my illnesses.\n\nI\u2019ve had a hard time with making exercise a regular habit because of my ptsd. I\u2019ve had panic attacks at the gym, I\u2019ve had rage or panic induced from a hard run on the treadmill, sometimes even something like yoga can trigger feeling discomfort in my body and flashbacks. I never really liked working out from home, for some reason there was strong repulsion to the idea. \n\nIn spite of these challenges, I took it slow. I started off with walking on the treadmill for 10-15 minutes 2-3x a week. Now I\u2019ve got a routine of strength building exercises, cardio, and stretches.\n\nI\u2019ve been tracking my progress on my Fitbit and I am so proud to say I\u2019ve been exercising 2-3 times a week for 6 weeks! I know it doesn\u2019t sound like much, but for me this is huge. I actually like how exercise makes me feel. I jog and run on the treadmill!!! And I hope that in the next while I will be able to feel the antidepressant affects of exercise in the long term!\n\nWhen you are depressed, it\u2019s really easy for your mind to ruminate on what\u2019s wrong with yourself. Today I choose to celebrate a win.
