For most folks there was a slow down but for me it has been the opposite. I have never been busier in my life because my work is essential and I own my endeavors. That cost me taking care of myself - I managed to hang on till about midyear with balance but then I found out that a chronic illness that could cost me my fertility had advanced and I needed surgery. The surgery failed and I was stuck with a difficult recovery and even more damage. This almost broke me and with no way to process I just threw myself into work even more, started drinking more and completely stopped caring for myself (foregoing or delaying hygiene, not resting, no exercise, eating junk etc). Since January I have bern struggling to get back on track. My illness has been kicking my butt - fortunately I have an infusion friday. I got so sick of how I have been feeling last night and wrote a plan for this week. So far I have gotten up early and my exercise for the day is complete (cardio, strength exercise and pilates class). Now comes the hard part - healthier food choices and making sure I shower etc before I get sucked into work. I just need to see myself complete a week of what I have decided is important. Usually I fail every time. I am tired of succeeding for everyone else but failing myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lfcpoa/last_year_knocked_me_down/", "title": "Last Year Knocked Me Down", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Fyghter1", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612793911, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lfcpoa/last_year_knocked_me_down/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436630.1200397, "replies_charged": false}
