I went to Florida with my family and I tried really hard to socialize with them, but I just stay quiet. It\u2019s very frustrating.\n\n\nI think most of it was because of my family\u2019s religion(Christianity) mainly my older sister. I won\u2019t go into detail, but I get extremely tired and discouraged of hearing them talk about Jesus and I don\u2019t want to argue with them about what I\u2019m feeling because I know I would get backlash from my sister. (Just to be clear, I  believe I\u2019m god but it\u2019s hard for me to respect him and that is the reason why I\u2019m not a Christian).\n\nSaw a lot of comments suggesting  I work on myself(among other things) before I do anything else, so I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do first\n\nMy plans for this week are too\n\n1. Start a diet and begin eating healthier\n\n2. Get back into the gym\n\n3. Look into volunteering\n\n4. Talk to more people at my job\n\nI think one plan for the entire month is too seriously think about where I\u2019m going with religion, if I just keep putting it off and flip flopping on what I\u2019m doing, it will screw me over in the long run.\n\nThe fact that I want to give up so soon really worries me. Was my resolve really  that weak? I\u2019m not completely beat yet so I\u2019m still trying for it. I don\u2019t think my feelings about being a light to others were fake, but it\u2019s like I\u2019m going in blind and it\u2019s discouraging. \n\nI\u2019m hoping this week will be different", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mu86sy/becoming_a_light_i_already_want_to_give_up_week_1/", "title": "Becoming a light: I already want to give up (week 1 progress)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Diggydog323", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618859870, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mu86sy/becoming_a_light_i_already_want_to_give_up_week_1/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437529.3082063, "replies_charged": false}
