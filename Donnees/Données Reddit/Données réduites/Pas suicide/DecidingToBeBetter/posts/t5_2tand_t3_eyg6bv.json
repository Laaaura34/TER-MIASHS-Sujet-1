I was really struggling before when I didn\u2019t tell anybody what I was going through. But last month I told a few close friends and a teacher I\u2019m really close with. I guess my teacher remembered because he care up to me at lunch with a cookie and told me how proud he was of me. I feel like I\u2019m on top of the world and I hope I can keep it up.  Self harming took up so much of my time, brainspace, and energy and I feel like a weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. That\u2019s not to say that on the hard days I don\u2019t feel a pull to ruin all my progress. I\u2019m finally feeling a difference and enjoying high school!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eyg6bv/self_harm_free_for_6_months/", "title": "Self harm free for 6 months!!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "constantlyconcerned6", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1133, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1580772318, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eyg6bv/self_harm_free_for_6_months/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438001.9064813, "replies_charged": false}
