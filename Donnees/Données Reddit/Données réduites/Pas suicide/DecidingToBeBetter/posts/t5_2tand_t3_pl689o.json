I seem to have done well from the perspective of the society, ykw, do good at school, college, get a nice paying job, etc. Been hustling since a long time, chasing things that I think I want. In between all these, I still don\u2019t get satisfied even if I get what I want. Have wonderful parents and gf but no mental satisfaction. So I come here to ask you all, has anyone been there? What should I do differently in my 24th year to probably change this?\n\nThanks in advance!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pl689o/looking_for_things_to_do_at_the_age_of_24m/", "title": "Looking for things to do at the age of 24[M]", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "calm_warrior", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631220236, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pl689o/looking_for_things_to_do_at_the_age_of_24m/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435081.6224647, "replies_charged": false}
