But otherwise it\u2019s been a constant argument. I have a brother, friends and colleagues who all smoke and it\u2019s been so hard being around them but I\u2019ve powered through, held cigs for them and not taken a puff and today is 6 months!\n\nThis week I also graduate with my Masters degree, and I have had the good fortune to line up several gigs over the last couple weeks for work, including with a local franchise of an international show. Like The Block or Married at First Sight, but not either of those haha.\n\nIn January I will finish filming my first self-produced short film, and I hope that will increase my career prospects. \n\nThis sub has always been so motivating, and I want to thank all of you for sharing your successes.
