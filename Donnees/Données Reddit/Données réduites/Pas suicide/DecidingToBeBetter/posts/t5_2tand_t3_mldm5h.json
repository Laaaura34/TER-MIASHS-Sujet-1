It has not improved considerably since cause my life structure demands me to open it and check messages as all the college related messages pop up on there.\n\nBut that's not the only thing is it? All this has become a sort of escapism for me or so I have discovered. I watch youtube to escape my thoughts, I don't read books anymore. I'm a bit of a loner anyways so I have online friends and now due to covid, my usual friends are online as well.\n\nI vent here when things get overwhelming and sneak a peak even during school work. So, thats that.\n\nI deduced few things here:\n\n1. IDK How to be ideal with my thoughts. I have lost most patience and can't be left alone with my thoughts. I need to learn how to calm myself and be in a serine space without having an anxiety attack.\n2. I need better ways to cope with life...things besides meditation as well.\n3. I need to start laughing more. I discovered I haven't laughed at all today.\n4. I need to ditch my phone....even if a message checkups are required.\n5. I need to stick with the plans I made. Stick with the reforms I had decided to make and remind myself that I need to be better.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mldm5h/how_to_be_ideal_and_most_importantly_how_to_not/", "title": "How to be ideal and most importantly, how to not reach for you phone?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Early-Department273", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617721230, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mldm5h/how_to_be_ideal_and_most_importantly_how_to_not/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437205.7074294, "replies_charged": false}
