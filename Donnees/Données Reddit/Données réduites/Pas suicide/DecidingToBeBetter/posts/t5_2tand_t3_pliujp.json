Whether that\u2019s giving up my job, splitting up with my girlfriend, basically anything that means I can live under a metaphorical rock like I used to before all this. I feel like life is so much work in general. I have got some factors going for me that have really helped but on a spiritual level I don\u2019t think it\u2019s changed me as a person. I still feel weak and like I\u2019m on the verge of giving up some days. Other days I\u2019m very grateful for what I have but sometimes life just feels overbearing.
