I took multiple IQ tests (for what they\u2019re worth) in the past and scored above average which proved my abilities. \n\nThe problem is people close to me wouldn\u2019t describe me as smart. They would choose knowledgeable aka a walking encyclopedia. Sometimes I fish for comments (so low of me) to validate it. It hurts. \n\nWhy do I care about looking smart? We live in a superficial world. For the better part of my life people would think of me smart, because I was shy and wore glasses. \n\nMy biggest problem is that when I converse with others I overshare, go on tangents, stutter and jumble my words. It\u2019s the biggest reason why I\u2019m not perceived as intelligent. I even recorded myself and cringed at how stupid I sounded. I\u2019ve been more aware of my behaviors, started meditating and journaling. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that I purposely act stupid or say things to get a reaction from others. It\u2019s some sick twisted shit. Even in public, I pretend to be naive so people don\u2019t get to really know I am. It\u2019s all very perverted and sick.\n\n\nI talk to various people online. We have long chats. Often times they call me smart. I feel like maybe I express myself better through text or it\u2019s easy to misjudge me. \n\nI would love to be an eloquent speaker with a warm calm demeanor. Maybe I should shut up and do something about. Sorry, for being too negative. I\u2019m laying it out as how it is. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ncp91j/i_feel_stupid/", "title": "I feel stupid...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Rich_Ad_788", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 30, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1621046999, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ncp91j/i_feel_stupid/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435792.6735017, "replies_charged": false}
