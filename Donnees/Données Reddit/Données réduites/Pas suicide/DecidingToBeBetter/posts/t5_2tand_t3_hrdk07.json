That is you. Everything else is your brain wanting things that feel good in the moment. Went from being depressed to having a bright future ahead of me :) \n\nIf you want something keep going!\n\n\nEdit: After my exam I said I should celebrate. I smoked weed, drank alcohol, played video games for the whole day, ordered junk food, tripped on acid, had sex, basically did every guilty pleasure I wanted.\n\nIt was fun for a weekend but none of it made me truly happy. The only thing I could think about was what my next goal in life is, and how I could be the best version of myself.\n\nThe true happiness lies in chasing the goal. Once you reach there it\u2019s just extra credit. It\u2019s like playing Assassins Creed or Legend of Zelda, once you 100% what do you do next?\n\nFor me personally it will be making YouTube Videos :) Life is very much like a video game. Only question is how will you play it?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrdk07/quit_social_media_drugs_alcohol_video_games/", "title": "Quit Social Media, Drugs, Alcohol, Video Games, Masterbation for 3 Months = Perfect Score on PCAT (Pharmacy Admissions Test) + Straight A's in Summer Classes", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "YBNSean", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2346, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1594773175, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrdk07/quit_social_media_drugs_alcohol_video_games/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437248.3038516, "replies_charged": false}
