Dumped a few months ago and decided to make this my comeback, and slowly over the months ive been pushing my interest in moving back up to a position i used to have, but with a new company. Just had my second interview today, and on the way there i kept trying to stop myself from thinking \"this could be it. I could finally, FINALLY, move back out and be on my feet again,\" but i was turned down for the position. \n\nI know what i need to do, and I've gotten pretty good at keeping forward progress despite bipolar depression. I could just really use a good pick-me-up story. Some kind of a reminder that i can change my life for the better despite how old i am and how stuck. Thank you, reddit\n\nEdit: Thank you all. This helped me a lot, seriously. I'll always have this sub to come back to and read through from time to time.
