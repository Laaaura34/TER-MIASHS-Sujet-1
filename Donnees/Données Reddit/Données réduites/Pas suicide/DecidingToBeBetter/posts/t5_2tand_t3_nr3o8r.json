Roundabout ways of running away from it likely made the bottom hole....should I say, much more *familiar.* And it's been all the same. I'm so tired of declaring making a change.\n\nMy main motivation is curiosity and doing things just to watch it happen. And I am a very visual person, creation is my passion. I think I'm wallowing and submerged in boredom being in the same spot lurking in the internet to feel a sense of journey and movement. \n\nI don't know which way I'll be going, or where I'm headed. But I wanna grab life by it's horns. I'm gonna crawl out of this hole rock by rock. I think I should stop caring if this is really what I want. People keep telling me to do what I want. But I don't fucking know okay??? I've been feeling so much guilt for not knowing. Worrying about where I'm headed and if it's aligned with \"who I am\" just made this hole much more real to me.
