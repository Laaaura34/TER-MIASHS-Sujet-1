I lost contact with many \"online friends\" I've been talking to, but most of them were either toxic, very dry or pathological liars and I constantly felt pressured to reply to them. I really don't know man, I just had a problem with replying to people. Weeks would go by with me not replying and I grew more and more anxious. Now I feel relieved.
