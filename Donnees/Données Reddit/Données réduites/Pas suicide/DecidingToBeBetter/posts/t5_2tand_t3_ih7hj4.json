Namely after my freshman year, I read 10 self help books. Afterwards I felt so much more secure, I was focuses and was genuinely happy. Not as much as usual but, I don\u2019t  know how to explain it. Usually I cycle between like euphoria and depressive states (but i\u2019m not bipolar), but after practicing self care I had a long lasting happiness. But, I actually lost a few close friends. They told me they don\u2019t like how I\u2019m changing. I am afraid to start my journey again because I have people who love me with my flaws, I have a ton of friends and I\u2019m popular at school and although I want to better my flaws, I can\u2019t help but have some fear as to who I will become once I fix my flaws. For example, I have anxious attachment, I still text toxic ex girlfriends and people who bullied me. If I overcome my attachment style, I might end up becoming less outgoing and selective with who I spend my energy on, but I have a reputation of being extremely outgoing. Long story cut short, I\u2019m scared my flaws and imperfections define me. Without the chinks in my armor, who will I be? And will I be the same? I\u2019m just scared of losing my identity in the name of \u201chealth\u201d.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ih7hj4/scared_a_little_of_recovery/", "title": "Scared A Little of Recovery \ud83d\ude14", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Butnerrr", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1598476037, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ih7hj4/scared_a_little_of_recovery/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436381.384232, "replies_charged": false}
