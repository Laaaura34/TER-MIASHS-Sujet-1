In a way I feel I\u2019ve already got it made, but there\u2019s just enough negative aspects that make that positive light seem a bit more dim. \n\nEvery day for the last week I\u2019ve been prowling through my Reddit account and unsubscribing from subs that do little to promote anything other than toxicity. Been doing the same for my YouTube feed. \n\nThese channels/subs usually don\u2019t add much to my life other than \u201cWoah that person did a shitty thing\u201d or \u201cyeah let\u2019s bash the other side of the political aisle.\u201d  Just negative all around. \n\nMaybe one day I can pull the plug on everything, but this way I\u2019m slowly whittling out the bad rather than just cold turkeying all of social media. \n\nAnyways. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been up to.
