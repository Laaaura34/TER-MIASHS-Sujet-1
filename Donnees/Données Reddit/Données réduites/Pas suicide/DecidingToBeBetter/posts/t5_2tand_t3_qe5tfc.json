I\u2019ve been in the real world for almost 2 years now (!) and have turned into a sad shell of a human. I have no motivation and, even worse, no discipline. I go to work, scroll on my phone for hours, take my dog for a walk, and waste another day of this precious life.\n\nI want to run a half marathon but feel like crap running a mile and get discouraged, I want results without putting in the work. I want to go to fitness classes but let my social anxiety and fear of failure rule my life. I wanted to talk to my doctor about getting on anxiety meds but - you guessed it - got too anxious and cancelled my appointment. \n\nEnough is enough. I don\u2019t want to be a bystander in my own life. I don\u2019t want work to be my only hobby. I don\u2019t want fear to rule my existence. I have the time and money, so it\u2019s time I do something with it. The one thing I have going for me is that I always try again no matter how many times I fail.
