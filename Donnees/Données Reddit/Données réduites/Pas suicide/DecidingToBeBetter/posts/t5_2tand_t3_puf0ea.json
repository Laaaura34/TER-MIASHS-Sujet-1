Basically I tried calling a few therapists and get an appointment but failed to reach any of them at all, I tried calling for weeks by now and it makes me feel like I'm just forced to handle my depression and everything all by myself and I just don't know where to begin, what to do, and how.\n\nI graduated high school this year and it's been around 3 months ever since. I have zero interests, probably no skills, no will to live and I have to live with my parents who make things so much worse for me. I went to some sort of agency in my country that was supposed to help me with mental health stuff and they gave me the numbers of those doctors whom I attempted to reach, but they can't do much else apparently. I refuse to work because I don't believe in this \"once you start working everything will get better\" mindset. I don't even know what I'm expecting from this post, I feel like I'm just ranting my frustrations away.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/puf0ea/how_to_deal_with_depression_without_going_to/", "title": "How to deal with depression without going to therapy?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "yellowpeanut22", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632469690, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/puf0ea/how_to_deal_with_depression_without_going_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438194.4169412, "replies_charged": false}
