I have realised I am always distracting myself with infinity pools (mainly Reddit and YouTube) whenever I have free time. When I am not on these I tend to always get lost in thought thinking about the past and the future and these sessions can last hours if I am not interrupted by someone else. \n\nThese thoughts come in all shapes and sizes. Sometimes they make me very anxious about something and other times it's like I have been enlightened by some higher power. I also get extremely creative ideas sometimes out of nowhere.\n\nHow do you overcome this habit loop? Is this normal or do I have some underlying issues?\n\nEdit: info", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ph5cfa/what_are_some_good_excercises_andor_meditations/", "title": "What are some good excercises and/or meditations for staying present in the moment?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "_asetsunai", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 25, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630676321, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ph5cfa/what_are_some_good_excercises_andor_meditations/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436924.1597052, "replies_charged": false}
