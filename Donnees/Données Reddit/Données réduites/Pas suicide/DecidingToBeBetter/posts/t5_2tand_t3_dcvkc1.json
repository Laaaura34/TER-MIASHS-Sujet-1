It got a bunch of comments, and I\u2019m four letters in and deciding it\u2019s one of the best things I\u2019ve ever done. \n\nI find when I\u2019m in a rut it\u2019s so helpful to put loving attention on other people. This practice is reminding me of our shared struggles and our shared gifts, and as I write to other people I feel proud of my writing and imagine them seeing something special about themselves through my eyes. It\u2019s a much more pleasant imagining than the chatter in my brain telling me my life could fall apart at any moment! \ud83d\udda4", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dcvkc1/love_letters/", "title": "Love letters", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "hannahpropriate", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1570130002, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dcvkc1/love_letters/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437695.219409, "replies_charged": false}
