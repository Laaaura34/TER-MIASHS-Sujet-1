At least broadly, if not exactly what needs to be done. Have a goal (or goals), be consistent, keep getting better, adapt when needed, form a team, be grateful, avoid burnout, work, work, work. Work.\n\nWork. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work.\n\nWork. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work. Chill. Work. Work. Work. Work. Work.\n\nWe know this, we dread it, we look for distractions, we procrastinate. Why? Because we simply don\u2019t want to put in the work. Or maybe we don\u2019t know what needs to be worked on. Or maybe we don\u2019t feel like progress is being made. Or maybe we don\u2019t feel the work is getting recognized. Or maybe we don\u2019t see the value in it anymore. Or maybe\u2026\n\nThe fact is there\u2019s no way around it. When at a job, we seem to work easily, or there are others to hold us accountable, or X amount of money is enough of a motivator to get us docile and working for 8 hours a day. When it is for our own goals, it seems to require so much more effort. We easily procrastinate.\n\nNothing you read here will get you closer to your goals. Only work. The actual action part of putting your goals and plans into action, consistently, obsessively. Work. Stop reading here and work even if it\u2019s only for ten minutes on a project or goal.\n\nWe seem to forget and think that work needs to be fun. It doesn\u2019t; it takes effort, which isn\u2019t always fun. But if you don\u2019t put in the work now, you may never get around to it. It\u2019s amazing how much progress can be made if we dedicated full time to our projects like we do at work. These goals may make us financially free, healthy, have better relationships. Things that are invaluable. Yet we don\u2019t see the value when we aren\u2019t getting paid per hour. Every hour you put in towards your goals may bring hundreds or thousands of dollars of value to you in the future. If you knew you would get paid X amount per hour working on your habit, would you do it? Would you procrastinate? Would you work on it only when you feel like it? \n\nPerhaps, it\u2019s still work after all. But it\u2019ll never happen if you don\u2019t work. All the planning, all the discussions, all the thinking will be a waste and bring you mental stress for no reason if you don\u2019t act to bring them into fruition. It would almost be better to remain ignorant of what you could accomplish if you don\u2019t start, or continue, putting in work towards making it happen. \n\nDon\u2019t let yourself down. There is no shortcut.
