I am using this pain as fuel to my healing and growth.\n\nLooking back, on the first three days of the break-up, I thought I'll die. I couldn't imagine then that I will one day come in terms with reality and accept that 'this is what it is'.\n\nI had depended the big aspects of myself to other people and accomplishment, and they all failed me. The break-up was the last thread which kept me hanging on my illusions and when it snapped out, I felt like it's the end of me... But.. I was wrong... Instead, it's the beginning of a new me: a matured, mentally-healthy, gorgeous me... \n\nThere were still hundreds of things that I will have to change. And I know I will never reach full completion at any point in my life.\n\nBut I will definitely become an actualized individual in time. :)\n\nAnd the time will come when I will feel I am ready to love again, true love will surely come: the love that I deserve, the love that I have been transforming for now to be worthy of. \n\nI am sure. I will definitely be found by love again.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m5hjth/10_weeks_after_breakup_and_i_am_only_getting/", "title": "10 weeks after Break-Up, and I am only getting better and better.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "EngrMyla", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 52, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615803323, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m5hjth/10_weeks_after_breakup_and_i_am_only_getting/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436164.178865, "replies_charged": false}
