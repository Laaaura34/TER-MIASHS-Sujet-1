I apologize if I'm posting out of bounds for this sub.\n\nThis year for christmas I want to give all my friends and family a list of 30 sentences all about positivity and self betterment. I'm not sure what kind of media to use, as it is too big to put on a tiny business card, but I don't necessarily want to hand out full sheets of paper. I will most likely be using Staples or something to get this stuff printed.\n\nDo any of you lovely people have any suggestions of what to print my list out on? Maybe some different ideas of delivery?\n\nEdit: I am looking to make 25-50 of these.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/e8fvzg/christmas_gift_idea/", "title": "Christmas Gift Idea", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SooperDooper7", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1575924908, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/e8fvzg/christmas_gift_idea/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436856.736956, "replies_charged": false}
