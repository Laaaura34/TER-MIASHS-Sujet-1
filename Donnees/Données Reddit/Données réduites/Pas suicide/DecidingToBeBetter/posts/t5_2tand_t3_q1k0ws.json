I don't feel like this life is for me because nothing sounds appealing or enjoyable and I'm so anxious every day and I have no friends and I'm scared that I'll never be able to truly feel comfortable or be able to relax and live in peace because I don't love myself or feel comfortable with myself or anyone. I've been feeling so low I took a month off from work and am planning on starting an intensive outpatient treatment program. i just want to be able to love myself and be at peace and feel like my life has meaning and I hope that IOP helps me but I don't know what else I should do this month? I spend most of my time smoking weed and scrolling through my phone and I want to change so many things I don't know what all to do and I'm scared of wasting this month.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1k0ws/dedicating_a_month_to_working_on_myself/", "title": "Dedicating a month to working on myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "kuwisty", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633396226, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1k0ws/dedicating_a_month_to_working_on_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438038.3651776, "replies_charged": false}
