After all, they wanted me to get a degree that would guarantee me a job that would continue the family tradition. No useless distractions.\n\nSo I became a teacher.\n\nI didn\u2019t hate it at first, I worked with many wonderful people, slowly climbing the ladder and getting more into educational field beyond teaching.\n\n5 years have passed like a minute, and one day I woke up feeling weird. It was the first time I\u2019ve questioned my career choices, more accurately, the lack of MY choices.\n\nI thought it was just a phase, maybe just a burnout. I tried to love it, I did - I switched a few positions even, attended courses to further my education, took a few vacations, but the outcome was always the same \u2014 whenever I thought about my career, I wanted to cry. Panic attacks soon became the norm. I felt out of control.\n\nIt was too late for me to change things, I\u2019ve invested too much time, money and effort. Art school that had been my dream for as long as I can remember wasn\u2019t a choice, not for me at least. It\u2019s for kids who are stubborn and passionate, not for a pushover that I used to be.\n\nI don\u2019t know what happened, but last year it clicked. So what if I try to apply and fail? Nothing will change. So what if I\u2019ll be 34 when I graduate - I\u2019ll be 34 anyways. So what if I won\u2019t like it \u2014 I can come back to teaching anytime.\n\nAnd so, folks, I did it. I took the entry exams and got the confirmation today \u2014 I\u2019m gonna start college this fall!!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pehjmf/my_parents_made_me_quit_art_and_not_even_think/", "title": "My parents made me quit art and not even think about art college.
