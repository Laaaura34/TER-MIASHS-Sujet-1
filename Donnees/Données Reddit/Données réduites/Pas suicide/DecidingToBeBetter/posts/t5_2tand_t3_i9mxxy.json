I'm 5 dollars short of a there and back bus ride to both of my appointments for today and tomorrow. \n\nI've been in a bad pace the past few months and am really looking to break the cycle but something as minor as not having any funds for the bus to make it to and from bith my interviews is going to be what completely details my momentum.\n\nI need help or advice or what I can do in order to help myself decide to be better. I don't have all the answers and am overwhelmed with a mixture of fear and uncertainty.
