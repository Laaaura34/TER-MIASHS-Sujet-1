I want is to feel more free and be willing to tell the truth at all times, to be more like Jesus, but I find that I'm a failure at that, I'm a failure at life. I let the little things get to me and I don't really understand why I do what i do. I just do it so I can feel understood. So i can feel whole. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday I'm going to stay true to myself and do what i feel is right within myself, I'm going to dedicate this entire day to me and see where it goes.
