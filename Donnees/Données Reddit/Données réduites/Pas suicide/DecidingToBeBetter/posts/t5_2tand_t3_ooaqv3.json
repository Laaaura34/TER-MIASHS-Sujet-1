Not sure if it\u2019s because I know I should be out enjoying the warm summer sun on my skin, doing the the things that I love but I\u2019m consistently working, or if it\u2019s just a bad habit I\u2019ve developed (or force this to happen because I\u2019m used to this never ending cycle). \n\nI stopped doing \u2018general maintenance\u2019 things like brushing my teeth before I go to bed, saying I\u2019ll just do it in the morning. \n\nI\u2019ve been doing my best to get back on track so I can actually enjoy things that I used to enjoy. Now all my hobbies seem to be a chore. \n\nI\u2019ve just been so overwhelmed with trying to do the right thing; making sure my finances are in order, having the food in the house, taking care of the animals that I have. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to decompress. I don\u2019t know how to relax and \u2018take a breather\u2019. I\u2019ve tried meditating. I started walking my dog every night to get that breath of fresh air and take my mind off something for 20 minutes, but it only lasts 20 minutes. I only feel good while I meditate, not after. I don\u2019t know how to make my hobbies hobbies again. I don\u2019t know how to enjoy life. I\u2019m only 24 years old and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt this lost. \n\nI feel incredibly guilty because I have everything I\u2019ve ever wanted, everything I\u2019ve worked so hard to get, yet I\u2019m more miserable than I was before. \n\nI\u2019ve come to Reddit because posting this stuff on my personal Facebook account is super out of the question. I don\u2019t want everyone I know, know that I\u2019m suffering as badly as I am. It\u2019s nice to use something like this to seek help. I know the correct answer is to go see a therapist, but the one I saw since I was 13 is now retired, and the thought of completely starting over with someone new is overwhelming. Plus I\u2019ve been in between jobs so waiting for health insurance is a huge pain\u2026 \n\nI\u2019m just hoping to relate to someone, or that someone can give me some advice\u2026 \n\nThanks in advance x", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ooaqv3/tryingtobebetter/", "title": "TryingToBeBetter", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DesperateConcern3899", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626814034, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ooaqv3/tryingtobebetter/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435106.0758364, "replies_charged": false}
