I found myself getting addicted to spending money on these girls that I would never be able to get, just to get a sense of love and being in some kind of relationship.\n\nIt's been my I don't know how many month that I've been in serious money problems because of this. I know I don't have any self control and I hate that about myself. I need to find a way to get better discipline in these kinds of things. Any advice would be nice.\n\nI've decided to delete my account on that site and to never go there anymore. I've cut all ties to what I have left on that website and I'm trying to get better.\n\nIt feels like a big relieve to have finally done it. I'm just scared that it's easy for me to create another account whenever I feel the urge again. Let's just hope it won't come to that and that I'm able to control myself.\n\n(sorry for my English it's not my first language)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgf5nz/i_deleted_all_my_toxic_accounts/", "title": "I deleted all my \"toxic\" accounts", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Snickerwithbeans", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635279350, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgf5nz/i_deleted_all_my_toxic_accounts/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635436268.3719637, "replies_charged": false}
