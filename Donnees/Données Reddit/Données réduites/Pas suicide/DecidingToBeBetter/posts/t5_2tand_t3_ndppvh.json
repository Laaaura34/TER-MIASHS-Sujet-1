I had goals and ambition and felt like I knew where I was heading in life, or at least where I wanted to go. Now a days,  I find nothing I was ambitious about appealing, I have little to no passion or drive for anything except for design but even that has been a struggle to find reasons to want continue investing my time and energy into it. I don\u2019t see any other path for me though and everything I\u2019ve tried has just not given me that same feeling I used to have. Would like to hear what inspires some of you to keep going or what motivates you to continue with whatever it is you all are passionate about.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ndppvh/whats_your_motivation/", "title": "What\u2019s your motivation?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "_aleksxcv", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1621175983, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ndppvh/whats_your_motivation/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437498.587782, "replies_charged": false}
