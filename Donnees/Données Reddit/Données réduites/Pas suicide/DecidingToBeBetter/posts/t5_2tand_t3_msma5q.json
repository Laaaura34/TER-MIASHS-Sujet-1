Too hard for the normal people and gone too soft for the drug people so to speak. I felt alone, shit I was alone. Ive seen too many other addicts get to this point and can't take the loneliness and discomfort of living a new life as someone new building new habits. Taking everything you know and throwing it a side for new beliefs, attitudes. Its fuxking hard. If the drug withdrawals aren't bad enough there's the depression, not feeling good enough, not trusting anyone or even yourself for that matter. In the recovery process there will come a time when you have to decide what side your going to be on. And once you finally choose a side, you know where you stand and that is where you build the foundation of your new life. On one side is the known, and the other is the unknown and that is where we can create something new.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/msma5q/when_its_time_to_finally_choose_a_side/", "title": "When its time to finally choose a side...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MindIsMaster", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618644217, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/msma5q/when_its_time_to_finally_choose_a_side/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438250.1276114, "replies_charged": false}
