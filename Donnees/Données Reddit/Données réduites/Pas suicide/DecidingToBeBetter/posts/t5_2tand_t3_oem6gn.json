I also deserve to be surrounded by people who genuinely want to be around me and not make me feel left out. I deserve to have friends who contact me first once in a while. I deserve friends that think of me to go to brunch, for a coffee/tea, or for a girls\u2019 trips not just when they need to vent or when they\u2019re lonely/heartbroken/ down. I deserve friends who also realize sometimes I also need a listening ear.
