I disabled my own Instagram account 4 times so I couldn\u2019t see his posts before I could muster up the courage to actually hit \u201cunfollow.\u201d It\u2019s beyond time to move on. I\u2019m deciding to be better, to give myself the opportunity to enjoy life and social media instead of letting him and what he\u2019s up to consume my every thought. It\u2019s a tiny step, but hopefully it will lead to greater fulfillment and happiness down the line.\n\nIf someone doesn\u2019t serve you, hit the unfollow button. It\u2019s been 3 minutes and I already feel huge relief. Why would you put yourself through torment every time you open an app? Out of sight, out of mind.
