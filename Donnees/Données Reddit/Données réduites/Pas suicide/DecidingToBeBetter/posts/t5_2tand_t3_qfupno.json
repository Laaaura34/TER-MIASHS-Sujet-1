I have the most warped and outrageous sense of humor you\u2019ve ever experienced. I can turn anything into a joke and laugh at it. I\u2019m also the absolute most intense, fiery, hardcore, relentless, and driven person you\u2019ll ever meet.\n\nI\u2019m new to Reddit, but I\u2019ve been around the internet a lot over the past 12 or 13 years. I\u2019ve been seeing some of the posts about being motivated and inspired and staying consistent and I genuinely don\u2019t get it.\n\nI\u2019ve mentored/spoken to over 150,000 people in my time about subjects like this.\n\nIt is completely impossible that you are motivated by little sayings on a pretty picture. That\u2019s just stimulation. It makes you feel good.\n\nMotivation is something only you can do, and it only comes from progress.\n\nProgress = Motivation\n\nWhen you can tell you\u2019re really getting something and getting better at it, you get way more motivated to do it, don\u2019t you?\n\nSometimes what we have to do is stop trying to be this individual living life internally, just us and our attitude and our phones, and we have to grow. \n\nSeeking out motivation is an endless road going nowhere. You need to seek out new information.\n\nLife has a way of telling you it\u2019s time to grow and when our vocabulary is limited to just a few words, we generalize everything into these few categories and just repeat things that were never the solution before and they aren\u2019t going to be now and we feel a little bit better for the moment, but tomorrow it\u2019s right back into the same in constructive patterns.\n\nYou\u2019re not \u201cunmotivated.\u201d It\u2019s time to grow. It\u2019s time to learn. It\u2019s time to stop googling it and go ask someone who knows and actually learn something this time.\n\nWhat you\u2019re calling, \u201cunmotivated\u201d seems a whole lot more like, \u201cunfulfilled\u201d.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfupno/if_i_may_share/", "title": "If I may share\u2026", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "RealChrisWoodward", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635209107, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfupno/if_i_may_share/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436792.1069884, "replies_charged": false}
