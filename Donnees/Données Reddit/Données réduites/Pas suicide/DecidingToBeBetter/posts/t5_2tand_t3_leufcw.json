I am a 24 year old grad student and had to live with my parents, move back home (moved from a big city on the east coast to small conservative town on the west coast) - and let me tell you.. in the beginning I felt like a failure, because I thought I was going to be super successful living on my own. The pandemic hit, and in order to save money, and be smart- I moved back home. In the beginning it was an adjustment, but now after living at home for about 6 months.. I am SO thankful to have my family. I am so thankful to have a roof over my head. To have my mom's home cooked meals.. to have this safe space to study... I think I got so wrapped up in my head of having this \"ideal,\" but even when stay at home orders are lifted I am going to try to stay at home the most I can.... so if you see your friends on social media living it up out and about... just know you are doing your best... and be grateful for what you have, here and now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/leufcw/normalize_living_with_your_parents/", "title": "Normalize living with your parents....", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "minimalismemma", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 76, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612728706, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/leufcw/normalize_living_with_your_parents/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437238.4099033, "replies_charged": false}
