Said she had a bad day. Asked what was wrong. Said she lost her laptop charger, an Airpod, her lip was sore, and her boss yelled at her for work. Said that was rough and I hoped it got better.\n\nI'm not picking at her for what happened but for some reason this conversation was slightly beautiful. I'm glad she was brave enough to list whatever happened. If the same thing happened to me myself I would have been afraid to say those things out of fear of people judging me. Also, It's nice to actually talk to people in real life instead of scrolling through posts on social media. It's good to understand that people are actual complex beings with feelings and emotions and experiences, not the fake, manufactured lives that you see on social media.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3shvj/talked_to_a_friend_today/", "title": "Talked to a friend today", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "CEO_Of_Rejection_99", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633676550, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3shvj/talked_to_a_friend_today/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435356.6318095, "replies_charged": false}
