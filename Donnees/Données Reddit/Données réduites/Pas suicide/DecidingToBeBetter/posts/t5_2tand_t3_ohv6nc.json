I\u2019m pretty much alone because I can\u2019t trust others. I so badly want to reach out, but when I do, I lash out to protect myself and drive others away. I absolutely loathe myself and have no idea why anyone would want to be near me. I think about suicide every second of every day, and I\u2019m only here because my death would make people sad. I don\u2019t enjoy anything so there\u2019s no escape from the darkness. I can barely function. I have panic attacks and cry suddenly, even at work. I can\u2019t afford therapy or a counselor. \n\nI don\u2019t want to be this way anymore. I can\u2019t escape this vicious cycle alone. \nThis morning, I woke up with the tiniest iota of\u2026\u201dmotivation\u201d? Latched on like a gator before returning to the murky depths.\n\nMy hopes:\n\n\u2022 Stop wanting to die\n\u2022 Gain confidence\n\u2022 Trust people or at least not be controlled by every good or bad thing they do\n\u2022 Function like a human being (go in buildings instead of passing them out of fear, stop freaking out then freaking out about freaking out, etc.)\n\u2022 Stop thinking I\u2019m in love with someone just because they\u2019re the tiniest bit decent to me\n\nI\u2019ve been at rock bottom for a decade. I have constant chest pain and probably will die before I\u2019m 40. Please help, any little bit of advice or\u2026anything. I\u2019m so lost.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ohv6nc/help_im_having_a_rare_moment_of_hope_and_want_to/", "title": "Help.
