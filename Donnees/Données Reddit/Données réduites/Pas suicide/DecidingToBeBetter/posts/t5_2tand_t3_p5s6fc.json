I mean, not entirely, but I know I have a serious issue with phone/internet addiction. I\u2019ve known this for a while but today was the day I stopped to think that man, I\u2019m losing so many fucking years of my life to this little shithole. \nFor further context, I am a senior in high school and I\u2019m taking my university entrance exams in a couple of months from now, the university i\u2019m applying for is pretty hard to get into and\u2026 I haven\u2019t even started studying yet. And I\u2019ve tried basically everything these last few months. Every single morning I wake up and tell myself that I am finally going to start following a steady routine for my studies and not waste all day mindlessly scrolling through social media, except I never actually manage to follow my schedule and just end up spending the entire day watching useless shit on youtube.\nI\u2019ve already deleted most social media apps from my phone, but my brain is one stubborn fucker so instead of just forgetting this stuff even exists I keep using them through fucking Safari, which is the epitome of ridiculousness. Now, I\u2019d love to delete all my accounts but I\u2019m kinda afraid of doing so because, I mean, I\u2019m a senior in high school who\u2019s possibly about to go to college in another state, and unfortunately the easiest way to make friends and meet new people nowadays is through social media.\nI basically wasted my entire junior year doing fuck all at home because the schools were closed the whole year round where I live due to the pandemic, I learnt absolutely nothing and did nothing of value.\nSo now here I am, four months away from my university entrance exams still trying to get a hold of myself so I can start studying for good. \nI like to think of myself as being, well, fairly intelligent (not above average though, but somewhere in between) and a pretty fast learner, the issue is that I am chronically lazy and can\u2019t force myself to do anything because I know I can just\u2026 well, not do it. On the other hand though, unlike most people here on this sub, I have no problems whatsoever with reading, as a matter of fact I absolutely adore it and read an average of 3~4 books a week for funsies.\nI feel lost, you guys. I want to get into this university, move away from my shitty little town and start living for good, but I know I can\u2019t do it unless I force myself to study and to stop spending so much of my precious time on this stupid phone of mine.\nToday, I spent 10 hours on the internet. I don\u2019t want this anymore. I want to get better. How can I start to go on about this?\n\nTL;DR: I have to study for my university entrance exams but I can\u2019t stop wasting my time on social media. How do I start forcing myself to stop being such a lazy bastard?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5s6fc/im_fucked_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/", "title": "I\u2019m fucked and I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Facelift90", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629157693, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5s6fc/im_fucked_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435086.3696048, "replies_charged": false}
