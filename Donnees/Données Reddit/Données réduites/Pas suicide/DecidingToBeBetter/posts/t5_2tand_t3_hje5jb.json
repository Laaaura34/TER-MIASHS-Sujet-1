(I\u2019m on mobile so apologizes if this is formatted funny).\n\nMy parents (who are great people) are overweight and growing up I only ever ate pretty crap foods. I only really learned how to cook pasta. I now live with my boyfriend and he\u2019s also overweight, but does try to help himself. He\u2019s taught me how to cook healthier dishes and such. I will have ADHD and medication which causes my appetite to not be too big so my weight has never really been a problem. (I\u2019m 5\u20196\u201d and weigh around 145 lbs, which is the biggest I\u2019ve ever been, up until last year I was max 128lbs).\n\nHowever, what is a problem is I\u2019m extremely weak. Like I get winded going up any stairs and can barely carry in groceries because I have no strength. I work from home now and never leave my apartment and I don\u2019t know how to improve it. Gyms are terrifying (especially now because of the pandemic) and I\u2019m moving across the country in August so it\u2019s not like I can join one right now. \n\nI\u2019m get so anxious and stressed because I have no idea how to start working out or maintain working out and am really not sure how to even begin this. I know if I don\u2019t start working on healthy habits my metabolism will wear off as I get older (it already has started) and I\u2019m terrified of becoming complacent and taking on my parents lifestyles and becoming extremely overweight. \n\nSo I guess my question is, how do you start working out/healthy living when you can\u2019t join a gym or anything and have never done any of it before? I don\u2019t have any friends/people to help me stay accountable either so I\u2019m terrified of starting and not keeping it up.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hje5jb/im_extremely_weak_and_i_dont_know_how_to_help/", "title": "I\u2019m extremely weak and I don\u2019t know how to help myself but I want to", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "gotmespacingout", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1593622611, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hje5jb/im_extremely_weak_and_i_dont_know_how_to_help/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436055.341487, "replies_charged": false}
