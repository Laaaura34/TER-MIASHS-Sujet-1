They have such a negative energy to them and have dug themself in a pretty deep hole. They were into drugs and ended up going to rehab over it. Typically I know people say \"Oh, well you should stand by them and help them get through it\" but they've pressured me for a long time to get in on what they've been doing with their life. I've always felt like no matter how kind and inclusive I've been to them, I'm always second place to someone else. Me and my family have always made sure they're included and cared for, and my mother always makes them cakes for their birthday and etc. They were going through some really rough patches but I still choose to break it off with them. I feel like I did the right thing, since they are leading themself down a dark path with drugs and theft etc. But somehow I feel as I'm the bad guy here, for trying to better myself and my life and surround myself with positivity instead of the negative energy I feel around them. I talked through my decision calmly and they attacked me and guilt tripped me over and over. And I can't help but think I've made the wrong decision for wanting better for myself because of it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k78fw8/i_finally_cut_ties_with_a_toxic_person_in_my_life/", "title": "I finally cut ties with a toxic person in my life for my own health", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dyebaby", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 720, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1607178680, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k78fw8/i_finally_cut_ties_with_a_toxic_person_in_my_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436166.9697895, "replies_charged": false}
