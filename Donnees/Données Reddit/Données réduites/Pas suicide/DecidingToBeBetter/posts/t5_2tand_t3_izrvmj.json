I had two parents with angry tendencies & I lived in fear of them being mad. I was never abused physically but emotionally I can say a lot of my upbringing was toxic mixed with abandonment issues from a few hard circumstances, I always felt it was needed for people to like me so they would stay around. \n\nI\u2019m recently discovering that self love isn\u2019t necessarily what I thought it was. I think main stream makes it this pretty package of bath bombs & face masks & affirmations that say \u201cI love me!\u201d. \n\nWhile that\u2019s all beautiful & it can be really great at times, it\u2019s also a shallow picture of what self love is. \n\nMy self love journey has been really gritty recently. It\u2019s actually looked a lot darker than people make it out to be. It\u2019s literally going into the dark corners of my mind/body I repressed for years and seeing what exists there. It\u2019s scary and it hurts sometimes. I\u2019ve been in a little black hole of old stuff lately and while sometimes I want to shy away from it - I know that is really not an option anymore because on the other side of this is freedom from mountains I\u2019ve been carrying for way too long. \n\nAlong this journey I\u2019ve also found that I\u2019m willing to be disliked in order to stay true to myself. This is huge because I\u2019ve always thought that one of my biggest \u201cassets\u201d was being agreeable & well-liked because I\u2019m typically cool-mannered on the outside. I can be crumbling internally but I\u2019m usually very aware of my interactions with others because I had a traumatizing experiencing in my early adulthood of being completely rejected of a group of girls pretty publicly that I vowed I would never do that to someone else after that since growing up I wasn\u2019t kind to a few individuals due to internal battles which I don\u2019t excuse but am working on forgiving myself. \n\nI recognize that everyone has their own judgments and opinions coming into situations. Something I say or do might trigger people. Sometimes I\u2019m ignorant and while I do my best to keep an open mind and lean into learning instead of conforming to old mindsets I might fall short in that. I can\u2019t take to heart that while I have best intentions in mind that I sometimes just don\u2019t know enough. I can\u2019t keep letting everyone\u2019s opinions of me hold more weight and allow them to back me into a corner of a room I didn\u2019t want to be in the first place. I\u2019ve found myself in so many situations because I said yes when I wanted to say no, out of fear of someone else not liking me. I\u2019m done. \n\nI\u2019m choosing to be ok with my words and actions that are authentic & aligned even if they disappoint, trigger, or are not acceptable in someone else\u2019s world. I\u2019m understand more each day that each time I take action out of fear of someone else\u2019s reaction- I am typically more likely to forgo my own desires, wants, values, and authenticity in the process which is something I am unwilling to participate in. \n\nI\u2019m tired of living through the lens of someone else. It\u2019s time to live my life - regardless of whether another can accept it or not. This is how I can practice self love with myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/izrvmj/self_love_means_being_disliked_by_someone_else/", "title": "Self love means being disliked by someone else doesn\u2019t matter much if it means staying true to yourself.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "erinpanzarella", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 75, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1601067431, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/izrvmj/self_love_means_being_disliked_by_someone_else/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436844.843744, "replies_charged": false}
