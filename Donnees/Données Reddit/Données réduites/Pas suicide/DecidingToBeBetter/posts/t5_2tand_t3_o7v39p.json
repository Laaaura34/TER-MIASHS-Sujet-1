However, when I was slender I still didn't appreciate how I looked either...\n\nI know that this means that the *main* problem isn't my weight/appearance, it's only a part of it, and that the main issue is a lack of confidence and self esteem in myself. However, I'm not sure where to start with disconnecting the idea of that and taking care of myself purely bc it's good for me and knowing I'll feel better if I do.\n\nDoes anyone have any mantras/blogs/etc they go to to reassure themselves and learn how to have confidence no matter what their appearance is (as long as they're taking care of themselves)?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o7v39p/disconnecting_the_idea_that_happiness_with/", "title": "Disconnecting the idea that happiness with appearance equals happiness about myself in general", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "gggloe", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624650600, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o7v39p/disconnecting_the_idea_that_happiness_with/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437058.6930337, "replies_charged": false}
