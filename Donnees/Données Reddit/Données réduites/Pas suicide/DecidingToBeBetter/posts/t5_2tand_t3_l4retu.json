But if y\u2019all are ever in this situation the best choice for you mentally and in the long run is to let go. \n\nMy best friend who I loved for months who already found someone just last month crushed me to death,  and being sixteen year old boy, the torture was so immense, I never knew this much pain can come from love and I haven\u2019t felt this beaten or mentally drained since 2017. \n\nI told her I needed to distance myself and she accepted though I do feel like I hurt her and still I feel the withdrawals. We\u2019ve always been there for each other and for now we are no longer talking. We even had plans to visit Japan after high school, but right now I need to keep it on hold so I don\u2019t get hurt anymore. \n\nTo you men and women know that you deserve better, don\u2019t give up on love and don\u2019t give up on yourself, learn from it and prosper! Love is there, its true, and you will find it eventually once you make the changes and keep moving forward, but also knowing when its okay to take a break for yourself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l4retu/i_finally_let_go/", "title": "I finally let go..", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Nyruki", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1611592301, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l4retu/i_finally_let_go/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437882.6991506, "replies_charged": false}
