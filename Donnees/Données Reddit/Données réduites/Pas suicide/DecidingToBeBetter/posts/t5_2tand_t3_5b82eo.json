Left with memories swirling around in our head. When does the hurting end and the grieving is complete? My opinion it's when we quit fighting the pain and walk through it, believing that growth is in the suffering. Every tear we shed fills the oceans in heaven and then to believe that this pain is in vain, would be too much to bear. The abundance of memories at this time is a gift to help us move forward and grow. But if we don't care for ourselves, it would be easy to slip into a depression. To avoid this let all your emotions out, cry if you need to, take time for you.\nmakinglifeallbetter.wordpress.com", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/5b82eo/an_excerpt_from_better_life/", "title": "An Excerpt from Better Life...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MakingLifeAllBetter", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1478316528, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/5b82eo/an_excerpt_from_better_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437193.2277176, "replies_charged": false}
