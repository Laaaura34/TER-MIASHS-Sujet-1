My anxiety is through the roof and I feel I\u2019m going to fail or be fired.\n\nI tried to fix these feelings by having a meeting with my boss who feels that I am actually progressing well and will be an asset once I\u2019m past the probation period.\n\nHow can I do better to let that positivity sink in? I feel like everyone around me knows more and I\u2019m failing, though my manager says otherwise. And if I do pat myself on the back, it feels like I\u2019m taking the easy way out because I\u2019m still making mistakes. \n\nI have an appointment with my therapist next week but any feedback would be appreciated.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8dkp4/fighting_imposter_syndrome/", "title": "Fighting imposter syndrome", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Tangledupinblue67", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634261399, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8dkp4/fighting_imposter_syndrome/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436274.6712804, "replies_charged": false}
