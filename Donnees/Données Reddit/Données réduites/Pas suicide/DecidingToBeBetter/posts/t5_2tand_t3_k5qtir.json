Planning on keeping this up.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy depression has gotten worse lately, and school hasn\u2019t been helping. My family and I fight a lot, and I\u2019m not moving out any time soon. I feel so much more introverted, and I\u2019m looking back at my younger self. The confident, friendly, hilarious me. The one that was happy and optimistic.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve decided that I can\u2019t get stuck in the stupid loop, so I\u2019ve started excersizing more and I\u2019m doing more homework to get my grades up. Sure, it\u2019s work, but I\u2019m getting slightly happier whenever I do it. After everything is done, I treat myself to a nice game of Town of Salem and read WEBTOON until I fall asleep.\n\nIt\u2019s nice.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k5qtir/keeping_myself_out_of_the_rabbit_holes/", "title": "Keeping myself out of the rabbit holes", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "calliel_41", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1606971699, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k5qtir/keeping_myself_out_of_the_rabbit_holes/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437601.599589, "replies_charged": false}
