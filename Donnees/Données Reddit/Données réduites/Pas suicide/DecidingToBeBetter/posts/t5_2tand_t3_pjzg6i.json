She said that due to me experiencing withdrawals, I'm basically going through a huge dip in serotonin. Probably explains why I feel so horrendous.\n\nI'm also having awful flashbacks/panics of videos I watched (for those who saw my previous posts, this is about porn addiction). Not even about anything that bad - I'm talking hokey, BDSM-themed, solo performer stuff where it's literally a person talking to a camera. I won't drop names, but these are some of the bigger performers out there you're likely to find on a tube site. Many of these videos of which I saw and at the time thought \"yeah that's weird but you do you I guess\" and moved on. But it's all freaking me out now. Which is...unusual for me. Even when I didn't used to watch porn or was into more vanilla stuff, I have always been of the opinion that people can watch whatever they want as long as no one is hurt. That's just how I approach life. But right now, everything is terrifying.\n\nThis bloody sucks haha. But we'll get there. As my therapist said, I've \"come to my senses\" - now I guess it's time for my senses to come to me. Or something.\n\nGood luck today everyone. Whatever you are facing, I believe in you. And I'm so proud of you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjzg6i/finally_saw_a_therapist/", "title": "Finally saw a therapist", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AmIAwful222", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 269, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631060097, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjzg6i/finally_saw_a_therapist/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635437443.9182212, "replies_charged": false}
