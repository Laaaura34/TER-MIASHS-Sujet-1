This fear haunts me constantly in my professional life and often leads to procastination... a self fulfilling profecy in which I always \"confirm\" that I'm not a good employee in my mind.\n\nToday I just decided to stop trying to preview the outcome of the call. I told myself: \"You don't know what it is going to be about, it could also be something good AND whatever it will be, you are going to be able to handle it professionally.\" So I opened the meeting invitation and accepted right away.\n\nThis is my first time consciously deciding that I will be able to help myself in a situation like this.\n\nAfter, I was no longer dreading the call, I had no particular feelings about it to be precise. And guess what? It was actually to inform me that I will get a pay rise :-)\n\nI am so happy for this little success over my constant fears that I needed to share it here. You guys have already given me so much inspiration, I wanted to give something back!\n\nEdit: Typos", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nljzo4/i_decided_to_stop_dreading_a_call_with_my_boss/", "title": "I decided to stop dreading a call with my boss today and it felt so good!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "_DrSoft_", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1204, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622043574, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nljzo4/i_decided_to_stop_dreading_a_call_with_my_boss/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436709.8791625, "replies_charged": false}
