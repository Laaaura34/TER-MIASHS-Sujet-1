It's the longest I've ever continuously seen a therapist and definitely the best therapy relationship I've had. They have decided to phase out doing telehealth and are leaving Talkspace completely by November.\n\nI am absolutely heartbroken. I don't want to start over with all of my shit again with a new person. It takes a few tries to find a therapist that seems to really understand you, and they always made me feel like they knew where I was coming from. Plus, I COULD SEE THEM VIRTUALLY! I'm a single mom with zero downtime. Seeing a therapist IRL is impossible for me.\n\nI am trying to remember that this is the opportunity to gain another perspective on the inner workings of my brain. I just have a go through another couple months-long \"getting to know you phase\" before I'll hear it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3h0vh/my_therapist_is_breaking_up_with_me/", "title": "My therapist is breaking up with me", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mothertothemax", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 555, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633636060, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3h0vh/my_therapist_is_breaking_up_with_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436949.14198, "replies_charged": false}
