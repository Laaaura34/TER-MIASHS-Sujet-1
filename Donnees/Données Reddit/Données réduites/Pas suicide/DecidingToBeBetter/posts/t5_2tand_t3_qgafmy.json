First off, I\u2019m writing this post for my buddy on his account. The long and short is my friend has not had a good life. But he has remained vigilant and resilient. He is currently without a vehicle after having one repossessed due to covid, and he accidentally hit a deer and totalled his other vehicle last night. Luckily he has full coverage, but it\u2019s a weird situation and there is a chance he may not be able to reacquire another vehicle at this time. He currently works retail, but had a job lined up driving which may no longer be available due to the accident. \n\nSo what are some potential vehicle solutions?\n\nHowever, that\u2019s just one thing. Dude cannot catch a break. He\u2019s trying really hard to be a musician but due to perfectionism and identity crisis type stuff he\u2019s been unable to release a single. Granted he\u2019s about to.\n\nSo. I guess the question is. When most of your existence is getting stabbed in the back and stepped on, and nothing seems to go right at all, what do you do? How do you persevere? Dudes at the end of his rope. Any and all thoughts are appreciated. Thank you for your time.\n\nOh his goal is in fact to become a traveling musician full time.
