I just managed to get by on the bare minimum. I'm in my late 20's and I'll spare the sob story.\n\nI figured with this time during COVID, I should use it to learn skills that I was never taught. I wish there was a \"Life Skills\" or \"Home Economics\" class in my high school or even college, but the best we got was half a semester of half-assed Sex Education.\n\nI want to make up for lost time. I want to be vigilant and take control of my life by taking action, but I can use some advice. What are some things that we should know in life? I want to collect them and make a \"syllabus\" or a \"course plan\" for myself that I can learn through the future.\n\nI know that \"basic cooking\" and \"basic sewing\" are two that I see often, but what other things should I know as an adult?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l7cjqu/what_would_be_on_a_syllabus_for_a_life_skills/", "title": "What would be on a syllabus for a \"life skills\" course?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SilverSquare", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1611876855, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l7cjqu/what_would_be_on_a_syllabus_for_a_life_skills/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438218.0725834, "replies_charged": false}
