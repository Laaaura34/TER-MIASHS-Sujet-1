My behaviour and actions have always deeply hurt the ones that I loved most. I've spent way to many years of being defensive whenever someone confronted me about my shitty actions, trying to scout for reasons why in my scattered brain.\n\nActing like a deer in the headlights when the scary sobering reality hits me in the face. Aside from the alcohol, I still don't really know why I have acted like this so many times but what I do know is, this year more than ever I have been actively taking control of the things that were burdening me about my self and little by little, day by day I'm learning to forgive myself. I've had to really work on building those friendships back up again (the very few that stuck around anyway) but I'm so happy they still love and care for me like I do them. \n\nI know I'm not out of the woods yet and it's not been easy by any means but reflecting on all the shitty things I've done has really taught me I can't take my friends, my loved ones and my life for granted anymore and it just sucks I ever did. Its time to grow up now.
