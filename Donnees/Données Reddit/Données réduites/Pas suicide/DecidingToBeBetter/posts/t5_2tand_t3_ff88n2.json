I\u2019ve typed many paragraphs but nothing seems just right. Honestly because what the real truth is I don\u2019t want to let go. I don\u2019t want to give up..one of my fears in life is losing you forever. I\u2019ve always thought you will always play some part in my life. All I\u2019ve ever wanted N was for you to love me the way I love you. I\u2019ve wanted the love I feel for you to be reciprocated.\n\n I remember when we were dating you said to me that you felt bad because you didn\u2019t care as much as I did. You never loved me as much as I loved you. I always knew that deep down but I avoided it because it truly does hurt. Throughout the years I always came up with excuses for you to as why you didn\u2019t want to be in my life. Maybe he needs time. Maybe he\u2019s too busy. Maybe he\u2019s just not ready. Maybe he needs to date other people. Maybe he needs to focus on himself. Maybe it\u2019s just not our time. \n\nI\u2019ve waited for years for you to message me and say I want you. I\u2019ve waited for you to want me to be apart of your life. Not only have I waited but I\u2019ve done crazy stuff just to try and be apart of your life. I\u2019ve drove thousands of miles and spent thousands of dollars just to be in your arms again. Just to be able to touch you. Just to be in the same room as you. When I was with you in Boston you said some stupid things to me. We were walking and you mentioned my laugh \u201cThere\u2019s that laugh\u201d. You also said that I should start singing. I\u2019ve never been able to sing my whole life. \n\nYou\u2019ve always made me believe in myself. You\u2019ve always made me feel like I can be anything I want to be. If N thinks I can be a singer then I can be anything right? Before I was with I never saw a future in my life. When we were together I saw such a bright future. Anything that involved you to me was a bright future. As long as I had you by my side. Remember how you promised to take me to Dubai one day? It\u2019s funny all the little things I remember. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to understand you N for a long time. I\u2019ve tried to understand you while you were hurting me over and over. None of it will ever make sense to me because I could never do what you have done to me. It\u2019s okay though. I\u2019ve now started to realize that I can\u2019t make you love me. I can\u2019t make you see my worth. All I can do is let you go. Let go of all the good and the bad. I can\u2019t fight anymore. I have to accept that our story does come to an end. Even though I never wanted it to. I have to do this for myself. I can\u2019t settle for less anymore. I used to be okay with having you in my life for the wrong reasons but I\u2019m not okay with it anymore. The best thing I can do for myself and for you is to let you go. \n\nThis year I realized I don\u2019t want anyone in my life anymore that doesn\u2019t bring me nothing but happiness. Unfortunately you don\u2019t bring me happiness anymore. It\u2019s weird because you made me the happiest I have ever been in life but now you bring me nothing but pain. I truly appreciate everything you\u2019ve ever done for me. I cherish every moment we\u2019ve spent together. I will never not love you because thats just not who I am. I honestly wish you nothing but the best in life. I don\u2019t know what your dreams are anymore but I hope you achieve everything you want and more. I hope you wake up everyday with a smile on your face and go to bed every night with a smile on your face. \n\nI want you to find true happiness. I want someone to light up your world like you once light up mine. I want you to experience that even though it won\u2019t be me. Because you deserve all of that and more. Never let someone shine down on your parade no matter what role they play in your life. Be true to yourself and never stop fighting for what you want in life. Surround yourself with positive, forgiving, caring, and honest people because anyone other than that doesn\u2019t deserve a moment of your time. All I ask for is happiness. That\u2019s my goal in life is to be happy and for the people I love to be happy even if it doesn\u2019t include me. All I have left to say is to just let me go please..So we can both heal and flourish.
