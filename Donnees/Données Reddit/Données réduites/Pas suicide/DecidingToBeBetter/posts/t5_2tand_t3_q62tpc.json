On the inside, I am unfulfilled and feel like my life is passing me by but I can not seem to ever make a decision to fix it.  It\u2019s like I\u2019m always torn between staying married or getting divorced.  (The marriage is more of a friendship than a romantic relationship and he agrees.)  I\u2019m torn between staying at my job (that has become very stressful the past few months) and going back to school to finish my teaching degree.  (I only have student teaching to complete.) My husband is a great person and a great provider.  We could get by with me working part time but I never can commit to making the marriage work or leaving it.  I\u2019m stuck in a terrible rut/depression right now and see no end in sight.  It\u2019s like my mind is constantly thinking and weighing my options but I can never commit to one thing or the other.  How do I pull myself out of this rut, stop overthinking, get off the damn fence, and commit to doing one or the other in my marriage and career dilemma?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q62tpc/how_do_i_stop_being_so_wishywashy/", "title": "How do I stop being so wishy-washy?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Nousername1003", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633978356, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q62tpc/how_do_i_stop_being_so_wishywashy/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437209.308279, "replies_charged": false}
