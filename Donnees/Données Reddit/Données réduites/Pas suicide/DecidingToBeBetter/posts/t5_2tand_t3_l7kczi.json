Consciously, I said to myself \u201cToday is the first day you can skip your new routines,\u201d but when I was about to head to bed, I zoned out and my body, absent-mindedly, went to the bathroom sink. And when I was in front of it, I thought, \u201cI\u2019m already here, might as well feel good and do it.\u201d \n\nJust goes to show how powerful (for better or worse) muscle memory and habits are. I will definitely keep this in mind moving forward. Next goal - untangle muscle memory with my phone and procrastinating.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l7kczi/day_30_subconcious_muscle_memory_success/", "title": "Day 30- Subconcious muscle memory success", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "laurathegreat12", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 19, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1611898045, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l7kczi/day_30_subconcious_muscle_memory_success/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436510.4072642, "replies_charged": false}
