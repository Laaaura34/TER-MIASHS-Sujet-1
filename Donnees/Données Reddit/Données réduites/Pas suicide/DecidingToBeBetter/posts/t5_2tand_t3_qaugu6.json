I was running slides at my church back by the sound board when mid way through the sermon I realized that the computer controlling the slides was about to die.  So I grabbed a charger and searched for an outlet to plug in to.  This is when I found an extension cord and carefully (because that's where all the sound stuff was plugged in) took the charger and plugged it in.  Right then and there the preachers mic went silent.  And everybody turned their heads and looked at me.  Keep in mind that our technical section is on the same level as the congregation and I was the only one back there so everyone could see I was the culprit.  There I was, a 15 year old confused and terrified of everyones faces.  I unplugged the charger thinking that maybe the audio would come back after that.  It didn't so the sound guy came running and searched for the problem.  After about 2 minutes he found that an essential plug on the extension cord that I had plugged into had been unplugged.  So we plugged it back in and the sound returned.  \n\nThis was obviously a very embarrassing moment.  And I can't get it out of my head.  Any advice on how  to forget and move on from this?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qaugu6/how_do_i_get_over_embarrassment/", "title": "How do I get over embarrassment", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Comprehensive_Cow742", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634586560, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qaugu6/how_do_i_get_over_embarrassment/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438381.7247467, "replies_charged": false}
