So whenever I was on the Internet, I would often find gay couples and straight couples being lovey-dovey. My natural response during those moments were often pure jealousy and anger (mixed with sadness).\n\nI hated how they are so happy an loving with their partners while I am here single and nothing. However, that changed for me last year. I found BL \u2014 it's basically a genre of TV shows or movies where it revolves around homosexual romances. Whenever I watch the couples being loving towards each other on my phone or TV screen, I begin to feel happy to the point where I would giggle or scream. Even though they are merely fictional the effect they have is still triggering in real life for me. Now whenever I'm scrolling through Instagram or whatever and see cute couple photos, I would feel genuinely happy for them instead of feeling sad and envious.\n\nPersonally, I feel great from this ongoing experience because I am able to develop a feeling of happiness from others' source of joy. I feel happier for feeling happy for others.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0zovt/to_be_happy_for_others/", "title": "To Be Happy For Others", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Far-Matter-2458", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 26, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623830495, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0zovt/to_be_happy_for_others/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437111.6220424, "replies_charged": false}
