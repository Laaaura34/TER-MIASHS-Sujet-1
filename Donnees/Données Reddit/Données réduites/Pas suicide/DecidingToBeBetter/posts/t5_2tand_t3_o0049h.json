Lately I quit my job to pursue my own goals, but naturally the more time I spend at home especially without any solid schedule pummels me into a cycle of anxiety. I find my self control nonexistent, and I distract myself by spending a lot of time on my phone. Sometimes up to 6-7 hrs, a few years back it was more like 15 hrs.\n\nI know exactly what I need to do. I need to meditate, I need to make to-do lists, I need to get off social media, I need to \u201cjust start\u201d. But I feel like the harder I push myself, the more anxious I get, and the more I reach for my phone. It becomes a miserable cycle that I know ALL TOO WELL.\n\nSo tomorrow I\u2019m switching out my SIM card to this block of plastic. It won\u2019t solve all my problems but I do think it\u2019ll be the start to a more productive and happy lifestyle :).
