I don\u2019t know what it is. I\u2019ve only had one relationship in my life go a little over a year. And all of them have ended in big, nasty breakups.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to connect to others, not just for relationships but I feel also for friendships. I try to be very friendly to people and I genuinely care about those in my life and I actively want people in my life. But, there is something about my personality or demeanor or something that pushes people away, and often times say terrible things. The thing is I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not because, when I think about it, I try to act in service to others. I\u2019m not perfect and I\u2019ll fail sometimes. But for every relationship to take a nosedive off a cliff\u2026there is only one common denominator in all of this. And it\u2019s me.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I feel so stupid and incapable of recognizing what I\u2019m doing wrong. \n\nSo\u2026yeah I need some help on this. Because there are great people out there that I have in my life that I want to keep and some potentially other great people that I want to add to my life and enhance, and hopefully theirs.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2064m/im_afraid_im_not_a_good_person_the_people_i_have/", "title": "I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not a good person.
