No matter how much time I invested, no matter how many memories I had, I just knew it was time. Sometimes you just know that you are ready to take that step, to make that move and there is nothing you can do about it. When it\u2019s over, it\u2019s over and there\u2019s no changing or stopping the outcome. Nothing can make things to back to the way things were, no matter how much I wished they could.
