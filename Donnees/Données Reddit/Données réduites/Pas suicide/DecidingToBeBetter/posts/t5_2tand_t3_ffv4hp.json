Throughout college, I smoked marijuana almost daily however the past few months I have been practically a vegetable when I smoke. I've taken SSRI's for my anxiety throughout the years but I have smoked weed alongside and cannot say the meds have worked well for me. With that being said, I am aware that in order for me to work as an adult I shouldn't be getting high all the time, regardless if it is after work smoking. I haven't felt healthy in a very long time and I hope that quitting weed will change that. Unfortunately, I have come to the realization that most of my social interactions with my \"closest\" friends are for the purpose of getting high. I feel that its best for me to distance myself from that crowd for the time being however it is very depressing and lonely. I simply do not see a prosperous and healthy life if I am dependent on a substance, but the depression from quitting has been tough to bear. This will be my first time stopping in almost 5 years, so I think it's safe to say that my body isn't in a great place at the moment. I am a few days into my sobriety and it's been hard but is it worth it? Any insight and motivating words are greatly appreciated.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ffv4hp/trying_sobriety/", "title": "Trying Sobriety", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "FshIce", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1583762635, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ffv4hp/trying_sobriety/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437883.8578358, "replies_charged": false}
