These last 18 months have been the absolute hardest of my entire life and I'm thankful I found the strength to finish. I lost my best friend March of 2020 to overdose, my wife left me in July after only being married a year yet we were together for over 12yrs before hand. I haven't seen my two kids since that day but finally have my day in court next month to fight the alienating. I ended up losing almost 30 pounds from stress between July and January of this year but have focused on making a conscious effort to lift/eat and i finally hit my goal weight of 185 just this week after 3 months of diligence. I also completely stopped taking suboxone after being on it for over 5 years. Been off for over two months and doing great. I've got a long way to go still at rebuilding myself and it's pretty difficult some days but I think I'm making good progress. If i can do it, you can do it", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/my2xyw/i_finally_graduated_college_today/", "title": "I finally graduated college today", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Dewthedude22", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 128, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619334231, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/my2xyw/i_finally_graduated_college_today/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436150.7808917, "replies_charged": false}
