Ive decided that I want to improve my life; start chasing my goals, start learning better habits, start living life more fully! \n\nAnd I\u2019m seeking a buddy around my age that\u2019s on the same boat! I want to help you with motivation and goals!\n\nHave you been wanting to improve too? Do you have a hobby or passion or creative projects that you\u2019ve always wanted to make, but lack of motivation or life/procrastination gets in the way? I want to help you! \n\nI want to help you with your goals, cheer you on, share our struggles, and our successes! One of the coolest feelings is having someone to show off what you\u2019ve achieved!\n\nMe: I like creative stuff, anything from drawing, to writing to game making, to music making! As well as outdoor activities (mountaineering, rock climbing) science, and pretty much everything :D\n\nI can offer a lot of optimism, enthusiasm, cheerleading and laughs, as well as understanding and support when you\u2019re a little down :D \n\nOf course, talking about stuff other than self improvement is also very welcome, be it casual banter or deep conversations, just general friendships stuff! \n\nPlease don\u2019t hesitate to reach out!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pccce4/23m_looking_for_motivational_friends/", "title": "23M looking for motivational friends!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "embracechaoswithin", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630024503, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pccce4/23m_looking_for_motivational_friends/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435858.4036438, "replies_charged": false}
