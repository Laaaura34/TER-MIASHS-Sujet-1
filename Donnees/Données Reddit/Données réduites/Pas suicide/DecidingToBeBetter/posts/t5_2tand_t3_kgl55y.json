I got a first class honours from a top uni and won everything going but I was so burned out, depressed an anxious that I didn\u2019t apply for any jobs. I had an awful time during my degree and lost all of my confidence. I\u2019m in recovery now, I\u2019m about to get a therapist and I\u2019ve just got the courage to start working on my CV and portfolio so I can start applying for jobs next year. \n\nHow on earth do I explain this gap on my CV? Since I graduated, I\u2019ve done about 12 mini classes/courses, I\u2019ve had some of my graduate work in a couple of magazines and I had an idea for a film that interested a few but good film producers. I didn\u2019t major in film (I majored in fine art from a top uni) so this was a pleasant surprise. \n\nI\u2019ll be 32 by the time I get applying but I feel like I\u2019ve totally fucked up my life and all of those entry level positions will look at me like I\u2019m a joke. I\u2019m trying so hard to put what I have learned into practice and not catastrophize something that hasn\u2019t even happened yet but i really worry it\u2019s too late. I know in the grand scheme of things I\u2019m not old at all, but I\u2019m an ambitious perfectionist and I can\u2019t help but shake the feeling that by 32 I should\u2019ve had at least 8 years laying the foundations of my career  and I should be much further ahead of where I am now. \n\nAny advice on dealing with this? Has the door really closed? How do I face this?\n\nI\u2019d be more than happy to intern my way into a job if needed or go and do a masters.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kgl55y/i_feel_like_ive_messed_up_ill_be_32_by_the_time_i/", "title": "I feel like I\u2019ve messed up.
