I have \"too much brain\", as my psychotherapist told me, which is in no way a compliment. Just not in my context. \nMy brain is a piece of shit, to put it lightly. It hyperventilates on every single detail, yet doesn't let me do the obvious stuff, like doing stuff I actually want to do or letting my body react the way it wants to. That is just how I function. Every single day for me is a struggle to not fall into my habitual depression. That is, I don't *really* function. I just try to \"exist the best way I can\"! What an awesome reality! \nI go to a therapist now, and it's really working. But it's soooo freaking tough, man. I just wish I could vent to someone. I'm so tired of constantly trying to compromise with people. And so tired of myself being a weakling, who is scared of doing THE MOST basic things, like talking to a person. So sick of myself. But I am on a path of improvement, so there must be something good in store for me in the future. \nI am unusually optimistic in what I've just said, by the way.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i645r0/finally_getting_over_myself_but_also_forgiving/", "title": "Finally getting over myself, but also forgiving myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "durakivivse", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 19, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1596911518, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i645r0/finally_getting_over_myself_but_also_forgiving/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437606.5346699, "replies_charged": false}
