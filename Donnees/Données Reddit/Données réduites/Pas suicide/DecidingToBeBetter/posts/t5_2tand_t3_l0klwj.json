I have never loved any of my service jobs enough to see myself doing it long term as a career. This has lead me to be bummed out over my degree choice since I felt like I had so much potential as a straight A student. \n\nWell I just came up with an idea for my own business that I actually see potential in. I haven\u2019t been this excited about something in a long time and to think I could be running my own business and have something to put my name on that I\u2019m actually proud of is incredible.\n\nI have been reluctantly applying for more hospitality jobs even though the idea of getting back to work just makes me sad. I believe in myself and I know if I put in the hard work in that creating and having this business will fulfill me more than working for someone else ever could.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l0klwj/i_finally_got_an_idea_of_a_business_i_could/", "title": "I finally got an idea of a business I could create and I feel so hopeful and excited!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "al_x_and_rah", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1611065663, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l0klwj/i_finally_got_an_idea_of_a_business_i_could/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435870.7019422, "replies_charged": false}
