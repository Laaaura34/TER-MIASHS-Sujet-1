My family hasn't exactly been in rough spots when it came to money, so whenever i got something, like maybe a particularly large portion of money or a somewhat expensive gift, it felt like less appreciation and more, \"Oh nice! I got something!\". I want to start appreciating things more, and learn the value of money for what it really is. Maybe it's just because I'm younger(19) that I don't really fully understand how hard it is to manage everything in life while keeping a steady paying job, but I want to start being one of the people that goes genuinely insane when i get things from people, especially now that Christmas is coming up. Big or small, I just want to be more grateful for what is being given to me. Can anybody help with this, or will it just take time in order to fully put myself in others' shoes?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ki3esg/any_help_being_more_grateful_for_what_im_given/", "title": "Any help being more grateful for what I'm given?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Ok-Excitement970", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1608635736, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ki3esg/any_help_being_more_grateful_for_what_im_given/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436619.7412229, "replies_charged": false}
