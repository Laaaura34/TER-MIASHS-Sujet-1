I am on my journey to being a contributing member of society. \nThat is my goal and that\u2019s what I will do. \n\nI\u2019m struggling though. I don\u2019t use anymore but I\u2019m still far from perfect. I still have a lot of the same habits as before when I did use. \n\nNow my days are filled with me mostly sleeping and watching Netflix. I just can\u2019t find the motivation that I need to move forward. I get amazing advice from ( Reddit ) & if I could take half the advice I give out I would be on the right path right now. \n\nI will not lose though! I am in this world with a purpose. Regardless if I know it now or If it\u2019s something someone will find out when I am gone. I\u2019m here to help other people. I know it\u2019s kind of hard to help other people if you\u2019re not helping yourself. I can sit and answer other peoples questions all day and find a way to make them feel better. It\u2019s not because I like hearing other people\u2019s misery it\u2019s because I really know that I give sound advice and can put myself in almost anyone else\u2019s shoes. \n\nAfter this being my \u201crock bottom\u201d anniversary tomorrow ( Easter Sunday ) for those who believe I will start working out and exercising as I need to and have been procrastinating on it for years. I\u2019m 41 years old if I posted a picture I probably look like I have everything going right and am good looking. My problems are inside me. That\u2019s where I am beautiful. \n\nWe are all beautiful in some sort of way. \n\nRegardless of myself on this struggle I just want to remind everyone that if you are reading this and you are deciding to be better you made the first step. I realized that I can\u2019t take anyone else\u2019s advice. I would be wasting someone else\u2019s time there is no solution for me to get better unless I take the steps I already have been given and do them. \n\nI\u2019m going to. I\u2019m going to make myself better because it is a decision I made. \n\nIf anyone younger then 41 is reading this remember, it is easier when you are younger. If you are older remember it\u2019s never too late. \n\nWe can all do this. None of us don\u2019t have the ability to get better. \u201cDeciding to be better\u201d it\u2019s a 6 letter word and that would be choice. \n\nI will not give up. I will do whatever is necessary if it\u2019s the last thing I do. \nI will try harder and I will make it more of a priority. \n\nRemember we can all do it. Know matter are background, race, gender, living condition we can all do it. \n\nI hope you all have more motivation then I do. Good luck on your journey I know that you can do it ( you if your reading this ) \n\nIf your struggling you are not alone. It doesn\u2019t happen over night but you have to take steps forward instead of backwards. \n\nBe safe everyone and continue your journey.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mj9xvc/3_years_ago_today_i_hit_rock_bottom_and_went_to/", "title": "3 years ago today I hit rock bottom and went to the emergency room & Im so thankful for today and tomorrow but....", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Zombiefood40", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 167, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617461321, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mj9xvc/3_years_ago_today_i_hit_rock_bottom_and_went_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435395.7031682, "replies_charged": false}
