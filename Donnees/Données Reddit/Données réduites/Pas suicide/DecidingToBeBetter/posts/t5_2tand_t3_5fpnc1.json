When you first meet people, try to see their eye shading while smiling at them. It may be on account of you looking a second or two longer, it is assured that people really respond to it in a positive manner.\n\n2.) Asking someone to do you a small favor trains their brain to believe they like you.\n\n3.)Foot-in-the-door phenomenon, People are more likely to agree to do a task for you if you ask them to do something simpler first (Gradual commitment makes people think you like them). Alternatively, you ask them to do an unreasonable task and they\u2019ll say no. So then you should ask for a more reasonable task and they will be more likely to agree.\n\n4.) Remembering Names, if you can get into the habit of not only remembering someone\u2019s name when you first meet them, but using their name in the subsequent conversation you have, they\u2019ll find you terribly charming and wonderful. Isn\u2019t that awesome?\n\n5.)When laughter breaks out in a group of people, each one will instinctively glance at whichever other individual they feel closest to in that group. This is a good way of spotting who is more closer to whom in the group.\n\n6.) Chew gum when you\u2019re approaching a situation that would make you nervous like public speaking or bungee jumping. If we are \u2018eating\u2019 something, our brain trips and it reasons \u201cI would not be eating if I were danger. So I\u2019m not in danger\u2019\u2019.\n\n7.) People\u2019s feet are often an insight into what they\u2019re thinking. For example, if you approach two people talking and they turn their torso to you but not their feet, they\u2019d prefer you leave them alone. Similarly if you\u2019re talking to someone and their torso is turned towards you but their feet are facing in another direction, they want the conversation to end.\n\nSource:http://mysoultemple.com/15-clever-human-psychology-tricks-that-everyone-should-know/\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/5fpnc1/15_clever_human_psychology_tricks_that_everyone/", "title": "15 Clever human psychology tricks that everyone should know", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "yash131997", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1480513292, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/5fpnc1/15_clever_human_psychology_tricks_that_everyone/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435844.0793586, "replies_charged": false}
