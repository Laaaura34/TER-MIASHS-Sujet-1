Probably wouldn't be here writing this if it wasn't for my two most important people in my life that stuck around through all of 2020.\n\nI know that this happiness is temporary, but I just wanted to appreciate this moment and share it with you all.\n\nI hope you all are well and healthy\n\nEdit: you all are a great community. Thank you all for the kind words. Took me by surprise when I woke up haha.
