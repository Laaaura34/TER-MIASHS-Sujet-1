I always loved art and design seemed cool. \n\nI found a field called user experience design and it interest me enough to finish my associates degree and now working towards bachelor\u2019s degree to work in this field. \n\nPortfolio making seems essential for applying to this position, but I can\u2019t get my shit together. I know I need a case study, a way to show your thinking and working progress for the project, but I can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m not spending the time to do it. I have at least 3 concrete projects I can put in my portfolio and still can\u2019t put my stuff together.\n\nI\u2019m graduating in May2022 and still no internship, or even an interview.\n\nHow can I manage my time to do this? How do I get it DONE?
