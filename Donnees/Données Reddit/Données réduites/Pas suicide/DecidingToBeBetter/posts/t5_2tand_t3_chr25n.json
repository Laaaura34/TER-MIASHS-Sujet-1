I deleted social media so i don\u2019t have any place else to share it. \n\nThese past two months following my Dad passing away have been the most productive ones in a while. I finally realized what\u2019s important and that I\u2019m not okay with being complacent in my own life. I took time everyday to take this course and I can see the positive impact already. I know there\u2019s a lot more changes happening within and they continue to grow more over time. \n\nAbout to embark on another class called \u201c10X effective learning: speed reading and memory booster\u201d since I plan on taking more classes and improving myself, figure it would be helpful. \n\nOnwards and upwards! \n\nHope you all are having a great day \u2764\ufe0f", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/chr25n/i_finished_my_2nd_class_in_2_months/", "title": "I finished my 2nd class in 2 months!!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "erinpanzarella", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1564077039, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/chr25n/i_finished_my_2nd_class_in_2_months/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436066.1782362, "replies_charged": false}
