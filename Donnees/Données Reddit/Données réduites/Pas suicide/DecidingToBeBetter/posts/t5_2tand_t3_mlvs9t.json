You need to put yourself first, and the best way to set precedent for this is the START of your day.\n\nYup, I\u2019m going to talk to you about morning routines, because subconsciously, when you dedicate 30 mins to an hour to yourself every morning, you tell yourself: You are important. By the way, I absolutely mean WITHOUT your phone, because when you wake up and look at your phone, you\u2019re being reactive. As an entrepreneur, our greatest strength is to be proactive, at all times.\n\nSo mornings, I like to follow a little schedule which I\u2019ve broken down to accommodate an hour\n\n* Yoga whilst checking in\n* Run whilst doing affirmations\n* Cold shower\n* Gratitude practice\n* Reading\n* Journaling\n* Meditation\n\nThat means I\u2019ve started my day, and done 7 tasks (8 including making my bed - which is very important to do), amongst those tasks I\u2019ve done one of the most difficult things, you\u2019ve got 1 guess which that is, yup - the cold shower. NOW what this has done is set your intention for the rest of the day, you've done what is rated to be one of the most difficult tasks ever. Any challenges that come up during work, you\u2019ve got it!\n\nOn top of the start of the day, you need to understand who the most important person in your life is, the person who has been there from the start, who has been there through every up and down\u2026 I\u2019m talking about you.\n\nWe often put others above us because of status, because of what society says, don\u2019t get me wrong our parents, best friend, partner etc, they\u2019re very high up there, but even our parents haven\u2019t been there through every single point of your life, but you have!\n\nThat\u2019s why that validation you seek from others? Seek it from yourself.\n\n# Embrace failure, HUG IT.\n\nI know, you\u2019ve heard it before, many times before. It's either doesn\u2019t fail or embrace failure\u2026 but do you truly understand why?\n\nWell, I\u2019m going to explain it through the best way I know how - experiences: Now failures are actually gifts but it's the way we have to perceive them.\n\nYou see every single day, I\u2019m facing failure, but instead of letting it get on top of me, I get on top of it\u2026 I welcome it with love, and by that, I mean from a position of love and abundance,\n\nOftentimes we see failure with a scarce mindset, coming from a position of hate, and that means we\u2019re not able to see the opportunity, the lesson that the failure is teaching us. What if\u2026 Every single thing that happens was actually supposed to happen exactly like that? Including the adversity... Guess what? It was. You see your journey is not smooth sailing, and no one\u2019s ever is, and that\u2019s not a bad thing at all! So next time something \u2018bad\u2019 is happening, understand that it is not happening to you, but instead FOR you.\n\nWould you like a part 2 to this?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mlvs9t/2_things_all_entrepreneurs_should_enforce/", "title": "2 Things ALL Entrepreneurs should enforce", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "thecampereira", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617776090, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mlvs9t/2_things_all_entrepreneurs_should_enforce/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436865.0006251, "replies_charged": false}
