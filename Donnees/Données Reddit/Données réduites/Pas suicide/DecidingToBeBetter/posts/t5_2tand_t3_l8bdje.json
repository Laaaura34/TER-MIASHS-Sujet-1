I\u2019ve said \u201clet it go\u201d before, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll say it again with the best intentions in mind but I\u2019ve finally come to the realization that focusing on letting go keeps me holding on. Oh, the irony of life, amiright? \n\nI\u2019m sure if you scroll through my posts you\u2019ll see me talking about letting go, and I\u2019m not going to pretend it\u2019s not a practice I\u2019ve tried to stick to. I\u2019ve burned pieces of paper with lists of things I\u2019m \u201cletting go of\u201d, I\u2019ve done the ceremonies focused around letting go, I\u2019ve set intentions during yoga practice to let what isn\u2019t serving me fall away forever, and then, the things I wished away stayed. \n\nI\u2019ve found through my journey that focusing on getting rid of something: whether it\u2019s feelings, expectations, moods, thoughts, habits, whatever- always leads to me somehow gripping to it even tighter for some reason. When you make something bad, or forbid it, it becomes this thing you need to hang onto. \n\nI\u2019ve found this true in so many ways, whether it was in my addictions to adderall + nicotine, unhealthy food mentality, relationships, victim mentality, anxiety, depression, emotions that just wouldn\u2019t \u201cgo away\u201d, I could name a million different situations in my life that I constantly wants to \u201clet go of\u201d and as hard as I tried, I just couldn\u2019t. \n\nOne day, I stopped fighting to let go. I accepted my addictions. I accepted my mental health (or lack of it at times). I accepted the thoughts and habits that had led me to the moment. I accepted the grief I once wished would go away. I accepted the feelings that were coming up that I didn\u2019t want to feel. I accepted my body. I accepted my situation. I just accepted my present moment as it was and realized that I was surviving with all of the things I thought I needed to let go of. \n\nI truly feel that we don\u2019t just magically let go of things. Time passes and we learn to live with certain situations. And in terms of the addictions to adderall and nicotine, I accepted that was my situation and I would feel uncomfortable feelings when I stopped taking them. I didn\u2019t let go of addictions or habits or feelings, I accepted they were what they were and I had a choice in what I decided to do with that fact. \n\nLetting go always seemed like this impossible task and I think often it is. We don\u2019t let go of grief. We don\u2019t let go of pain. We learn to live with it, and with that realization I understood it had less power over me and my actions than I thought it did. It became a back seat passenger in my life instead of the driver. \n\nI\u2019m here to say maybe it\u2019s time to stop focusing on letting go and just focus on accepting where you are and adding things you want instead of fighting what you don\u2019t want. I\u2019ve realized all emotions have purpose and they\u2019re not meant to be let go but felt, and in that feeling, like the true duality this life presents to us, it\u2019s grip on us lessens immensely. \n\nI know what it\u2019s like to hold on so tightly to everything. I know what it\u2019s like to feel like I have to just let everything go and the pressure that came with the realization that I didn\u2019t even know how I could possible do that because it literally was out of my hands. \n\nIt\u2019s time to focus on what you can do instead of forcing clich\u00e9s like let it go on yourself and others. I\u2019ve learned saying this actually is invalidating my and others\u2019 experiences causing me to hold on even more. \n\nLetting go isn\u2019t a choice. It happens over time sometimes. Sometimes it never does. So instead of working on letting go, work on accepting what is. And see where you can go from there. \n\n_\n\nTLDR; \n\nIt\u2019s time to focus on what you can do instead of forcing clich\u00e9s like let it go on yourself and others. I\u2019ve learned saying this actually is invalidating my and others\u2019 experiences causing me to hold on even more.\n\n_\n\nEDIT: hi friends!
