Further, we know more about how our minds work than ever before an we have access to physical resources which previous generations simply could not imagine \u2013 indeed that we could not imagine only a few years ago.\n\nBut our societies are less happy \u2013 and more depressed - than ever. This conundrum is multi-dimensional. In this short piece, I suggest that one thread of this conundrum is that happiness has three dimensions and we have come to focus on only one of these.\n\nDimension 1 \u2013 Pleasure: Rapture, ecstasy, warmth, comfort, pleasantness. The pleasures can be externally stimulated, can often be bought, tend to require little effort. They typically experience diminished returns and their pleasures are short lived. Here-in lies the hedonistic treadmill.\n\nDimension 2 \u2013 Gratification: a feeling of time stopping, being totally absorbed in an activity as we effortlessly lose our self-consciousness. This requires concerted effort \u2013 there are no shortcuts.\n\nDimension 3 \u2013 Purpose: belonging to and serving something we value and perceive to be bigger than ourselves. Again, this requires effort and often creates a legacy of some form.\n\nMy suggestion here is that our culture has lost sight of Gratification and Purpose in favour of short-cuts to the pleasures \u2013 partly driven by our obsession with disposable mass consumerism. Perhaps our societies would be happier \u2013 and less depressed \u2013 if we did more and consumed less.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ljlnwn/who_doesnt_want_to_be_happy/", "title": "Who Doesn't Want To Be Happy?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "EERMA", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613296342, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ljlnwn/who_doesnt_want_to_be_happy/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437671.8304565, "replies_charged": false}
