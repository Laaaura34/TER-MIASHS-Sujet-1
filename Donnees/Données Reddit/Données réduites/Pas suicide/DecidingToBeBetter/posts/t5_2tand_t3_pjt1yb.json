I'm graduating a year late and I really love what I'm studying but I've been so burnt out for the past few years now. My entire routine has been: go to classes, work, sleep, repeat. I have no friends...and when I say this I'm not exaggerating. I literally mean none. I can be outgoing but even when I try, I just can't make friends...people already have their own friend groups and are not interested in a new friendship with me. My routine has left me no time for socialization, hobbies, or anything that makes me feel human anymore. I just feel like a lifeless robot that is programmed to work until I crash.\n\nThis got in the way of my grades at school, I've been struggling to pass. By the time that I'm home from work, I completely crash from exhaustion. And no, I can't quit my job for \"soul searching.\" I am blessed with an amazing and supportive family, which seems to be the only good thing in my life right now but my life is just dull and exhausting and I don't know what to do about it anymore.\n\nAny advice?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjt1yb/almost_22_years_old_and_i_am_burnt_out/", "title": "Almost 22 years old and I am burnt out", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ochemgenius", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631039871, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjt1yb/almost_22_years_old_and_i_am_burnt_out/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435546.6140995, "replies_charged": false}
