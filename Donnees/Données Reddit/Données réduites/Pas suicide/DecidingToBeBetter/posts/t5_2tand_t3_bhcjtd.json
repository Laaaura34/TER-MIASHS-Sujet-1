From my view today, to achieve confidence it is necessary to internalize a set of qualities and behaviors that require a strong identity, emotional intelligence, and self awareness.\n\nBeing confident is good, great actually, but one does not just decide to be self confident, to be self confident you have to have certain thought processes, personal values and awareness, the structures that allow for confidence. You develop these over time, with the right guidance, reflection and support, not just by deciding to be confident.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bhcjtd/what_did_you_think_when_you_were_told_to_be/", "title": "What did you think when you were told to be confident?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "nakamuri01", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1556219376, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bhcjtd/what_did_you_think_when_you_were_told_to_be/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437132.3389966, "replies_charged": false}
