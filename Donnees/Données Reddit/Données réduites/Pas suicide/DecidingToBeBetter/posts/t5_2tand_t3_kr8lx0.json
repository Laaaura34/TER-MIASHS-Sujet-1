With the pandemic I'm sure many people are struggling with this, but when I get lonely my PTSD and GAD get worse. I feel like I'm always living in my head and out of my body with worries about the future and thoughts of past trauma. My therapist suggested something and I'm really dedicated to giving it an honest shot. She said make a list of affirmations that ring true to me and go over it for at least 15 minutes in a break in the day. I did it yesterday and started with just \"I am calm, I am kind, I am pleasant, I am present, I am beautiful.\" And afterwards I felt so much less alone. Today I made flash cards with affirmations and I'll pick one or two a day to repeat like mantras to myself. I think this simple step could help a lot of people if they take it as seriously as I am now. There are so many to choose from and it really helps me feel sure of who I am and what I am here to do on this Earth. I hope this reaches someone else who needs to hear it: you are valid, wise and brave. You are a light in the darkness. Each and every person and moment counts in their own way. Deciding to be better is the hardest choice to make every day, but with a little self-encouragement it gets easier.
