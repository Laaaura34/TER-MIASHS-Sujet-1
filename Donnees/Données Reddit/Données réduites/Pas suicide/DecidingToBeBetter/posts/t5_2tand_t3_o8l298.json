I feel responsible for things I'm not responsible for. And I'm afraid if I don't fix the problems of my partner they don't love me anymore. \n\nBut it's not the fault of my current partner that I feel like that. She's pretty self reliant and doesn't really expects me to fix all her problems. And for that I'm greatful. \nIn fact it was ex girlfriend who always made me feel like shit whenever she fucked something up. \nBut nonetheless that's in the past and now it's my responsibility to change my thought pattern and to do things for my girlfriend because I sincerely want to not because I feel like I have to in order to feel like I deserve to be loved. And of course to say no to things I don't want to do.\n\nBut now my realization:\nI have to allow myself to receive unconditional love.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o8l298/i_had_a_realization_about_myself/", "title": "I had a realization about myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "babaria_", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624748372, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o8l298/i_had_a_realization_about_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436163.8575757, "replies_charged": false}
