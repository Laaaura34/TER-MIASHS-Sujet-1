I am a huge mess. There's about 200 items on my work desk right now, going from: Kirby plushie, albatros boxing pen, plastic bottle, coffee cup, vitamin c tabs, a ball of yarn, jewellery etc.. none of it is dirty, none of it is even trash, it's just that I have so many hobbies and interests but just one desk. Then in addition, I rarely, if ever, put stuff away, sometimes I even leave drawers open after I take stuff out. Of course I then buy too many things cause I even forgot I already bought tissues and those cute cat earrings.. Why am I like this? I am not asking as an act of self-critique, I am actually wondering what drives such behavior? my mother just always says I am lazy but I don't think I am, I work super hard and I am always.. well, achieving stuff. Also, any advice on how to help myself? A podcast or YouTuber or a book that resonated with you?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pefq1o/how_to_be_more_organized_and_tidy/", "title": "How to be more organized and tidy?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Haldenbach", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630320859, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pefq1o/how_to_be_more_organized_and_tidy/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437984.369215, "replies_charged": false}
