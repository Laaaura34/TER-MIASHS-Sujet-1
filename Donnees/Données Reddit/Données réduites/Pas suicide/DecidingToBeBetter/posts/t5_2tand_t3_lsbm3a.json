Since I was bullied a lot because of my skinny body. Living with a single, absolute narcissist dad and ever since I dropped out of high school, I\u2019ve become addicted to weed, porn, and cigarettes. I only go out for buying cigarettes to a tiny market 2 minutes away from our home. I\u2019m suffering from ADHD and social anxiety. Sounds terrible, doesn\u2019t it? lol \nSo today was raining cats and dogs and I told myself I either stay home as always and feed the monsters in my head, and constantly scroll down Instagram seeing how others live or I\u2019ll find the guts to go out and learn to live like a normal human being. I decided to ride my bicycle and hit the street. Initially, it was frightening a bit. Before I open the door and go out I started to panic and bad thoughts were bombarding me in seconds, but I said \u201cscrew it, I\u2019ve got nothing to lose\u201d and I DID IT. I put on the headphones and went around my neighbourhood and rode for almost 20 minutes and it was awesome!!! I didn\u2019t give a single flying F about what the people would think of me, my body, my bicycle, my peddling, or anything else, I just enjoyed myself doing something appropriate and beneficial in order to get out of the pathetic situation I\u2019ve gotten myself into. It\u2019s not much but I haven\u2019t done something like this in years and I\u2019m really proud of myself for what I did. I decided to do this everyday.\nI desperately want to go out, find a girlfriend, study languages, do crazy things, find friends, bring home the bacon and etc. \nWishing the bests for everyone here\u2764\ufe0f", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lsbm3a/went_out_of_home_after_4_years/", "title": "Went out of home after 4 years", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LittleLegion", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1750, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614273449, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lsbm3a/went_out_of_home_after_4_years/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435437.2416725, "replies_charged": false}
