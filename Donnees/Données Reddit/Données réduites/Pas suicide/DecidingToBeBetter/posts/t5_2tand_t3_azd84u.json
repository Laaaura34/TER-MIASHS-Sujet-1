I\u2019m very kind, I\u2019m very compassionate, I\u2019m very good at helping people through their most difficult times, but I\u2019ve never done anything with MY life.\n\nI\u2019ve been working to change that lately. Last year was spent working on my \u201cinsides.\u201d I started therapy, I learned how to love myself the way that I love other people, I learned how to be happy, and I\u2019m very proud of the progress I made in that area.\n\nThis year, this MONTH, actually (well, February) I began working on my \u201coutsides.\u201d I\u2019m still a waitress at 29; I\u2019m certified in Phlebotomy, but there\u2019s an overabundance of medical workers in my city, so I\u2019m still trying to really break into that field. I did finally leave the horrible job I\u2019ve had for 5 years, though, and got a job at a busy bar/grill downtown, and so far I love it. I\u2019ve started trying to spend my very limited funds more wisely, plan ahead for bills rather than see what happens the week they\u2019re due. I\u2019ve changed my sleep schedule and am now getting plenty of consistent sleep. I\u2019ve stopped getting on Facebook and talking about all of the plans I have (because I am very much one of those people who get satisfaction just from the recognition of what I \u201cplan\u201d to do) and have started just...doing. When obstacles come up, I\u2019ve started facing them and getting them done. I\u2019ve stopped trying to find ultimate fulfillment in my relationships alone. I\u2019ve stopped pining after the guy that doesn\u2019t love me back, and I\u2019ve stopped believing that he\u2019s the only way for me to be happy. Every day, I actively try to make the SMART decisions, the decisions that will bring me success and happiness someday.\n\nI\u2019m building myself up. I\u2019m working on NOT being a lazy, irresponsible hermit. I\u2019m just getting started, but I\u2019m actually doing it for once. I\u2019m trying SO hard this time.\n\nAnd it\u2019s so. SO. lonely.\n\nEveryone in my life that I love and who loves me has found their \u201cperson\u201d. So while I know that I have so many people who care about and support me, and while I am abundantly grateful and recognize how lucky I am and how good I\u2019ve already got it, it just doesn\u2019t fill that one thing that\u2019s missing. I haven\u2019t found my \u201cme and you against the world\u201d partner yet. That\u2019s something that I CAN\u2019T have until I get my crap together and become someone that somebody could depend on to build a life together with. So I\u2019ve stopped looking for it, that\u2019ll come someday when I\u2019m ready.\n\nBut, I guess I would just like some advice on how to push through the absolute loneliness of reinventing oneself. Nobody can do it for me, and I have to do it alone, and it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s very hard to feel this alone. And I would really appreciate any tips anyone has on how to maybe just calm that feeling down a bit. I know it\u2019s a given, and that it\u2019ll eventually feel more like strength than it does \u201calone-ness\u201d, but for now, I just need to be able to bare it without being crippled by it.\n\nI\u2019d just really be grateful for advice on ANY of this, I guess. Thanks.\n\nTl;dr \u2014 What are some healthy ways to cope with the loneliness that comes with building yourself and your life up from scratch?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/azd84u/its_a_lonely_road/", "title": "It\u2019s A Lonely Road", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Megan1tRain", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 377, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1552201168, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/azd84u/its_a_lonely_road/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438139.658165, "replies_charged": false}
