It\u2019s reasonable for me to think that that environment solidified certain unhelpful beliefs I have. I don\u2019t have a victim mentality and overall am always proactively shaping the life I want. However, in doing so, I struggle embracing the core belief that there\u2019s kindness in the world, that good things happen to good people, that there\u2019s an animated spirit or collective spirit out there that wants good things for me - the sort of things that help you establish psychological safety and move through difficulties with grace and courage.\n\nI am quite open to religion as one of the means by which to acquire this belief - and many teachings and ideals of christianity, buddism, etc resonate with me, but I ultimately feel like an impostor because this fundamental faith in the universe or specific deities being generous and loving towards me is missing from my worldview and I don\u2019t know how to expand it - since it\u2019s rather an intuitive, not a rational thing.\n\nDoes anyone have advice on how to think about this? Of note, I have tried therapy and engaged in therapy over extended periods of time so I am not seeking that particular advice at the moment.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qf3fh1/learning_to_believe_that_the_universe_is_kind/", "title": "Learning to believe that the universe is kind", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "hryu15533", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635116459, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qf3fh1/learning_to_believe_that_the_universe_is_kind/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437206.0268183, "replies_charged": false}
