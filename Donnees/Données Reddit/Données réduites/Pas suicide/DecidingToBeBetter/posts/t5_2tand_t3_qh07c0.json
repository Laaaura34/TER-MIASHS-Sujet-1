As a result, I've been reflecting upon things I can start doing to become the person I finally want to become. I've always had episodes where I got rid of Instagram but I found myself reactivating my account again because I simply have nothing to do! But now, I've set myself a goal to be Twitter and IG free till the end of the year, at least. Social media has always been the bane of my existence. Without it, I doubt my relationship would have ended at that moment because it was the root of all my insecurities and problems with self love. As a result, this led to a lot of self-sabotage and hurt on my part. I'm glad I've made this move but I think I'm going to struggle with withdrawal and feeling left out.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any tips?, esp because I've become so used to having IG and Twitter there all the time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNevertheless, I'm super excited about this. I hope to stick to it and eventually actually delete my accounts for good in the future.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qh07c0/i_have_deleted_twitter_and_instagram_from_my_phone/", "title": "I have deleted Twitter and Instagram from my phone!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "notpetersmj", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 670, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635351122, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qh07c0/i_have_deleted_twitter_and_instagram_from_my_phone/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436928.6191812, "replies_charged": false}
