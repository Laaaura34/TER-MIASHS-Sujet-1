It affected my most important relationships, and the most important one being the one I had with myself. It sounds cliche and a little daggy but lets face facts, it really does start with a healthy relationship yourself first, so the decision was made to do some soul searching, dig deep and re-align myself with what made me fall in love with waking up every morning full of beans and grabbing the bull by the horns!\n\nFor as long as I can remember I have always been fascinated about self discovery, creativity and really learning what makes people \u201ctick\u201d and fall passionately and deeply in love with life, what they do, and the people they choose to surround themselves with. You know, those stories you hear of those rare people discovering their true identity and purpose in life. So being fortunate enough to enjoy the company of so many different and unique people, professionally and personally, I decided to explore and genuinely get to know, learn and really understand what made these people authentic.\n\nWhat I discovered was there was one re-occurring theme - the more someone was totally and absolutely free to immerse themselves in what makes them truly who they are, the more they attracted the right crowd, right type of people, people who were on the same page, same chapter actually just in the exact same book. Don\u2019t get me get me wrong they all had and still have their challenges, we all do. And it\u2019s damn hard sometimes to follow that heart of yours in this noisy and contradicting world, but it seems to me life truly is a confidence game, and what goes around comes around, especially when it comes to the way we handle and treat other people. Now I\u2019m not spinning some self development fluff here, or comparing it to the law of attraction, but you\u2019ve got to admit, whether it\u2019s they way mother nature, or the universe intended it, there\u2019s an uncanny connection with being truly authentic, like really not giving a shit what other people think of your biggest, most boldest pursuits and the type of people, and relationships you attract and build along the way when you\u2019re totally in tune.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just the lens I\u2019ve chosen to see life through, either way it\u2019s definitely built much stronger more meaningful connections and overall happiness both personally and professionally. Whether its just creative pursuits like writing music, being more present with my partner, or professionally in meeting and surrounding myself around the right people, no matter how I look at it, the more authentic and true to myself I am the deeper more genuine my relationships become.\n\nWould absolutely love to hear thoughts and feed back on this topic, maybe even some personnel experiences.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dx201e/has_anyone_else_thought_about_how_real_genuine/", "title": "Has anyone else thought about how real genuine authenticity helps create deeper and more meaningful connections and relationships?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "write_your_own_story", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 22, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1573877323, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dx201e/has_anyone_else_thought_about_how_real_genuine/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436737.1939976, "replies_charged": false}
