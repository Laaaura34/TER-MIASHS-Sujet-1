I posses a lot of free time, due to the pandemic and my homeschool that I recently transferred into. Right now I spend some of my time advancing my subjects, but I want to ask - is there anything that I should get started on while I\u2019m young? What do you regret not doing as a young teenager?\n\nI want to be able to effectively maximize all this free time. As of now, it\u2019s mostly spent on relaxing and just doing nothing. Aside from my plans to advance in school, I\u2019m pretty lost on what is the best course of action to make the most out of this.\n\nAs for suggestions, the small problem is that due to the situation, I can\u2019t really go out. I\u2019m stuck at home for the time being, and only go out to buy food whenever I reward myself. I\u2019m pretty much stuck at home with about 12 hours of free time everyday, and the days seem so long without any idea of what to do with them.\n\nI would really appreciate any advice, or any stories you may want to share!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p0smqy/15f_what_are_some_things_i_should_do_while_im/", "title": "(15F) What are some things I should do while I\u2019m still young?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Amberthms", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628476931, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p0smqy/15f_what_are_some_things_i_should_do_while_im/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435081.0686147, "replies_charged": false}
