I think I related to those beliefs because I was misunderstood and an outcast my entire life, and so were they. After events last year, not just in the news, but in my personal life, I began the process of eradication, little by little. Working on emotional intelligence and having a better group of friends really helped me to let that stuff go. And there was a LOT of it to get rid of-books, movies, memorabilia, etc. Last week, I finished by putting the last of my Confederate and other similar white supremacy stuff in the trash. I can\u2019t change the past but all I can do is move forward.\n\nEdit: I am extremely humbled by the outpouring of support.
