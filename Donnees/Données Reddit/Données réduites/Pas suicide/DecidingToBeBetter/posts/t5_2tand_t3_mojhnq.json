I\u2019m fortunate to have recently gotten vaccinated for covid, so my anxiety (I am high-risk) has subsided enough for me to walk outside now. After a year of being sedentary. Before all of this, I hiked a lot for mental and physical wellness. Not having that really messed with me.\n\nSo I\u2019m getting back into it and taking it a step further than before. Now I\u2019m mixing jogging into my walks with the goal to be able to just go for a jog, as others do (I never have in my life). Something interesting is that I\u2019m having mostly involuntary crying fits after my sessions. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just processing trauma or if it\u2019s just my body flipping out. I feel better after and am committed to doing this. Any jogger insight out there\u00bf", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mojhnq/started_jogging/", "title": "Started jogging", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "cupcakesyall", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 34, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618112084, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mojhnq/started_jogging/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436621.506326, "replies_charged": false}
