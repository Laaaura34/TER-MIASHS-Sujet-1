In college I  would literally study sitting on the toilet when things got too rough and when I had trouble remembering stuff, I was trying to study hard to earn a perfect score and sometimes time wasn't enough. I was miserable but I was giving my best I guess right? Is that it? Is that what \"giving your best\" should be like? When the exam was too hard to study, I was like \"fuck I said I was going to dedicate 5 hours everyday to prepare for this exam but I still struggle understanding stuff, fuck! now I have to study even when I'm eating, shitting, brushing my teeth, showering, skip the gym and skip many sleep hours\" is that it? Is that what giving your best looks like? I remember feeling empty after achieving my goal  because I was like \"damn I literally had to drive myself insane in order to get a perfect score while others probably didn't have to bother too much in order to achieve the same goal, how miserable is that?\"", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8wuvk/so_many_people_say_just_do_your_best_but_how_do/", "title": "So many people say \"JUST DO YOUR BEST!\ud83d\ude0a\" BUT how do you even know what \"your best\" is?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Admirable-District-9", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634329995, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8wuvk/so_many_people_say_just_do_your_best_but_how_do/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437382.743618, "replies_charged": false}
