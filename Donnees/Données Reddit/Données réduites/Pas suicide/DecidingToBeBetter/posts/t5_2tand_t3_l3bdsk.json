Most nights, especially during this pandemic, I have stayed up until at least 5, and during these stints, I really tap into my worst habits, and I\u2019ve known this about myself for a while. The later I stay up, the more likely I am to do things that I will regret or feel crappy about in the morning. Whether that is feeding into my sexting habit, or going into a server and getting into a conversation where I say things I don\u2019t mean, it often correlates with me staying up super late. Also, getting so little sleep is not doing any favors for my body, nor my mental state. \n\nTwo nights ago, I decided that I was going to treat myself well, just as a test. I would take care of what I had to do, then after a bit of leisure, I\u2019d go to bed at one o\u2019 clock. I did exactly that, and i woke up the next morning feeling so rejuvenated. Now, I just want to seek more nights like that. Where I get to sleep as quickly as I can, and I can wake up the next day not feeling like crap. Hopefully, in the process and I can shake down a portion of my bad habits through this small change in my routine, and maybe, it will even improve my mental state. Either way, I just want to treat myself better and really take care of myself, because for the last few years, I haven\u2019t really been doing that and it\u2019s been a weight on many of my relationships. There\u2019s a ton of people in my life that I love, including myself, and I want to make sure that I can give them something good.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l3bdsk/moving_forward_i_will_be_going_to_bed_in_a_more/", "title": "Moving forward, I will be going to bed in a more timely manner...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "landfliquids", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 21, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1611405506, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l3bdsk/moving_forward_i_will_be_going_to_bed_in_a_more/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436513.2629082, "replies_charged": false}
