What if there was someone that could say \u201cIt\u2019s okay, take a breather, I\u2019ll handle this and you can rest and close your eyes for a bit.\u201d What if you could believe them?\n\nDon\u2019t take it personally, I\u2019m just thinking out loud. You\u2019ve been on your own for a long time. You\u2019ve had to cover every base. You\u2019ve had to think about all the worst case scenarios, you\u2019ve had to stay in control constantly because you were the only you trusted to do things right.\n\nYou see, this made a really big impression on me at one time. I had been so used to being and doing everything. I was the one who had to plan everything, to be superman in a crisis, to always be the shoulder to lean on. It\u2019s like I wasn\u2019t allowed to have problems. I couldn\u2019t have a weakness because that would mean I couldn\u2019t be there for someone who needed me. I wasn\u2019t allowed to be human.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t sustainable. I did that for so long and I got so used to pretending that I didn\u2019t have problems. But blocking a dam doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no water. It just means that the water pressure builds up. It builds and builds until it\u2019s too much. And then right as the dam was about to break, I met someone who I could trust. This sounds so small, and yet it was everything. It\u2019s like walking a tightrope your entire life over lava and then suddenly the lava becomes pillows. Like all of this incredible pressure and the horrible consequences behind every possible mistake evaporated. Like I could finally be myself instead of being whatever others needed me to be.\n\nHaving someone I could lean on made me realize how much I had been pretending for so long. How long I had been trying to be everything for everyone. It was a massive relief, but it was also scary. I could see what a painkiller life I had been living. Pretending to be okay means never getting to say \u201cI\u2019m not okay.\u201d It means never admitting when you\u2019re in pain. It means you\u2019re covered in wounds that never get to heal because you\u2019re busy bandaging someone else. \n\nHaving someone who could hold the world together while I caught my breath reminded me that I was human. I wasn\u2019t a superman. I never wanted to be one. Being superman means you\u2019re alone, saving the world one crisis at a time. I\u2019d rather be on a team with someone who fights for me and saves me when I need it, and vice versa. \n\nI\u2019m not criticising you. I\u2019m not saying that you need anyone\u2019s help. I\u2019m just asking if you\u2019ve ever had that luxury before. How long have you been on your own? Maybe the last person who helped you also hurt you. Maybe you\u2019re scared of leaning on someone. I wouldn't blame you, I got hurt really bad too. I trusted someone who I thought accepted me. I thought they would always have my back because they said they loved me. I thought that I was never going to have to be alone again. I was wrong. \n\nThere\u2019s a thousand thorny paths we can take, I\u2019m not telling you what to do. But shouldering all the world\u2019s problems on our own is such a hard path to choose. I simply ask that you keep your eyes open. Especially if you\u2019ve felt the comfort of a helping hand in the past. Especially if you understand how nice it is for someone else to be picking up slack where you can\u2019t. There\u2019s a lot of people out there who could treat you right. There\u2019s others who want to fight in the trenches for you. But you have to find them. You have to separate yourself from bad fits to find better ones. You have to put yourself in the room to find the person who will fight for you. It\u2019s not easy, and it won\u2019t happen overnight, and who knows if that\u2019s even the right path for you. \n\nI just ask the question: Can you remember when you trusted someone? When you weren\u2019t on your own? When you didn\u2019t have to be everything? I remember. And I\u2019ve decided I want to find it again.\n\n\\--------\n\n**Further Reading:** If this post resonated with you then you might benefit from \u201cThe 7 Principles of Making Marriage Work\u201d by John Gottman.
