I want to be active and do productive stuff but I cant get myself to do anything, I seriously have no motivation to want to do anything. Even showering and brushing my teeth, I just did that 2 days in a row after not showering or brushing my teeth for probably 4-5 months and i highly doubt im gonna start again tomorrow unless someone motivates me enough to wanna do it. Plus ive eaten like shit for years and never gained any weight and last year in may I was skinny with a nice jawline (looking back i miss how slim my face looked) and now my face looks like a literal potato and I have stretch marks and have A cups and a double chin and i fucking hate it, im like 180 lbs right now (last time i weighed myself i was 180 pounds but then i tried to start eating healthier and dropped down to 175 and started looking skinnier but since i can never stick to anything for a long time i stopped and went right back to unhealthy food im sure im back 180 or more pounds). While writing this by the way I just realized its probably my weight thats keeping me from doing anything and I should ask for advice on how to get in better shape even though im living a pretty sedentary life right now. I can walk just fine i just lay down on the couch and in bed more than i walk during the day and whenever im just walking up the stairs i get out of breath. Also another thing just accured to me. I dont get morning wood anymore (it stopped at 14-15 i think), i dont get random boners (which stopped probably around 14-15), i dont get turned on by ANYTHING, it takes forever for me to get it hard and when i do i cant keep it up for more than 30 seconds, especially when im standing up and moving it goes down within the first 5-10 seconds im up (which makes me sound like an old man but im not im 19 and im going to be turning 20 in november, going to college next year in august, and hopefully i can fix myself by then), i dont really even feel anything down there even when im doing it and its hard i dont feel a tingly sensation or whatever i feel nothing. Im pretty sure all that has to do with the fact that ive been eating like complete shit for years and its finally caught up to me and its gonna probably take 7 years of healthy eating and exercise (assuming my bad eating habits and sedentary lifestyle started at 12, which is around the time i started getting bullied/picked on and getting fake friends and shit which probably made me turn to unhealthy/binge eating and doing nothing all day besides watch youtube videos to cope with what i thought at the time was torment). And another thing, sorry but for some reason my rants and really good thoughts always seem to come out at 2 in the morning and i wont be suprised if no one responds to this, but if you guys would read my earlier posts from 2014-2016 (from when I was 14-16) thats when i started drinking because i thought at the time it was helping me with my depression and i really liked the feeling that being drunk gave me, it made me feel happy and made my problems kind of go away for awhile and it was just great for awhile but then it started getting emotional and then one night (at 16) i overdid it and drank way too much and im suprised im still alive cause apparently i drank almost a whole vodka bottle and my bac was high but my parents took me to the hospital and i was fine but still drunk the next day, i was in trouble though. And now were starting to get to the present. Dont worry were almost done. I had my back surgery in may 2019 a day after i graduated from high school but i had a stroke from it which (luckily) only made my arm go limp and i needed physical surgery to correct it and thankfully my arm is 100% restored now but during the proccess of healing my back my mom got me some homemade thc honey from my cousin that he got from his friend. He gave her enough to last until i got out of the hospital. The honey she gave me wasnt the first experience with weed though, thats a whole other story. I was at this party and I took my first ever 2 hits from a blunt outside the house of the party then i walked inside where the party was and sat down because i started feeling weird. My heart started beating like crazy and i started getting freaked out that i was gonna get a heart attack and then remembered weed never kilked anyone but then i thought but what if it was laced with coke or something which freaked me out then i remembered water would calm me down so i went to the stairs that led upstairs and told the person that ran the party that i needed water and he said they dont have water but im pretty sure i was too high to think clearly so i just walked away in a panic and sat back down and thats when things started getting freaky. My heart was beating fast as fuck, people started crowding around me and recording me laughing at me while i was asking for water the whole time, and time looked like it slowed down a bit for a second and this dude handed me a vodka bottle when i asked for water and i was like wtf why is everyone being such a jackass and again since i wasnt thinking clearly in my high state i had the idea to call the ambulance but i was too stupid to think if i call them the police would come and surely enough the police did come, which resulted in the party getting shut down, everyone getting pissed at me and no one inviting me to a party ever again. Before the police did come a girl did eventually give me some water and calmed me down and with just that sip or gulp of water i took my head spun and i was back to normal and when i got home i had the munchies like crazy and ate shit that i would normally never eat. Anyway, sorry for that long story let me get back on topic. After my back surgery my mom started supplying me with edibles from her work friends that she was in control of and she would give me 10 mg everytime but since i loved the feeling of getting stoned I started trying to sneak more, and bribe her to give me more, and try any way to get more than 10 mg because my tolerance eventually went from getting really high at 10mg to needing at least 20 mg or a couple hits of a dab pen. A couple times i went into a dreamlike state and freaked out but over time i think im starting to get used to them, cause i was at incredible pizza (arcade/food place) which my brother and i got stoned and started tripping if i stared at things like a cinnamon roll that i was eating. But then again we we started exiting the dining room and thats when I tripped the fuck out and things were so weird but not in a bad way, like if i were at home at that time listening to music it wouldve been great but not then. Also i keep asking my brothers friend for hits of his dab pen on snapchat and i know he gets annoyed by it but i cant help it. Everyone thinks im addicted to weed even though you cant get addicted to it but i think its only because i had this feeling of pure bliss, this feeling that i was a god/the universe when i took a hit of this dab pen that was for my moms friend that she was giving to her that i found and i just felt amazing on it. I was vibrating, my head was light as fuck, like there was nothing there, my eyes were closed and i was seeing visuals whenever i thought of a picture (like spongebob for example) and i just felt amazing as fuck and i just wanna go back to it. Im sorry this post has gotten long and confusing its literally almost 3 am and im writing everything that comes to my head now. I hope someone can read all this and give me advice on how to motivate myself to eat better and be more productive during the day because i honestly already have goals and i know im creative and ive drawn alot, made comics, and written stories before but i stopped all that probably at 14-15 ish? Probably 14 honestly. I just really wanna get myself healthier and more active instead of eating like shit everyday and doing nothing everyday. I wanna improve my life and i know i can but theres something holding me back and i know for sure its not depression because to be honest i really dont care about what happened in the past anymore the past is in the past and i need to focus on now, and really all i am now is bored and lonely. Honestly, im sure all it is that is making me unmotivated and not wanting to do anything is my unhealthy lifestyle but i dont know where to start on fixing that.\nIm sorry for the long read, ill fix it and add a TL;DR in the morning.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dac5ai/this_is_gonna_be_a_long_read_im_sorry_but_i_need/", "title": "This is gonna be a long read im sorry but I need help getting into a better routine but I dont know how/where to start.
