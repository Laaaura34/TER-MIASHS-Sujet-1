After all that, I still didn\u2019t feel complete and ok with my life. I realized I didn\u2019t feel like I had a purpose, other than keeping my kids alive and happy. I don\u2019t have a goal in life or something to look forward to, I\u2019m just trudging through the day to day. I don\u2019t know why, but I just got the urge to look up online schools. I found one that would work for me and decided to apply. I was accepted and qualified for a grant to fully pay for tuition, classes and books. I\u2019ve attempted to finish school twice before, but dropped out both times because I just didn\u2019t have the motivation to finish. This time I have a reason to finish and I just know I\u2019m going to do it. I\u2019m finally excited about something.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ih1ufb/im_35_and_finally_going_back_to_school_on_monday/", "title": "I\u2019m 35 and finally going back to school on Monday", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Mountainmama85", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2508, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1598458584, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ih1ufb/im_35_and_finally_going_back_to_school_on_monday/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436986.2397592, "replies_charged": false}
