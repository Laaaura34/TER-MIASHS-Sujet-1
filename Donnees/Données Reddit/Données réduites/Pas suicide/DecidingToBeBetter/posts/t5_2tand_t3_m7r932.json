Some stories on how people do these.\n\nLong story short, I had many friends who would disrespect me. I was a people-pleaser up until the start of the year when Ive realised I need to stop this. All of these socalled friends of mine were very keen on setting up a lot of boundaries, starting with 'dont talk about this topic', through 'this topic is boring, why do bring it up', up all the way to the 'Im uncomfortable when you ask questions, so dont, ever', all the while they would disrespect any I tried to set, by saying Im too sensitive and everything insults me. \n\nThe end result so far is that the word 'boundary' is highly triggering to me. I dont use it and I hate hearing it, because I automatically think back to the fear and restraints I was forced to respect, as well as the hurt I felt when I was being laughed at for the ones I tried to set. I dont know where the balance is anymore. \n\nSo, if anyone could tell me their story on how they learnt how these worked, I would be very glad and thankful. I cant even read self-help books (I do, I try!), because everytime this word appears, Im automatically angry and losing hours thinking about these past events. I just need some good examples or something... \n\nThank you. \n\nTl;dr - I have no idea how boundaries work due to unhealthy relationships, I would like some advice on the topic on where to find balance.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m7r932/how_to_set_boundaries/", "title": "How to set boundaries?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "not-a-deer-my-dear", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616075496, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m7r932/how_to_set_boundaries/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435156.6427822, "replies_charged": false}
