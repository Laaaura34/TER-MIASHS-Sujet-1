I was sure that my main task is to think strategically. My imagination drew a picture \u2013 I am a captain gazing at the night shadows. The 2008 crunch made me sober. It was painful but efficient. \n\nBlaise Pascal, a French mathematician and philosopher, said: \u201cToday you are where your yesterdays\u2019 thoughts have led you\u201d. Our \u201ctoday\u201d is a consequence of ours\u2019s yesterday. Our current life results from the decisions made some time ago, the choice we made in the past. \n\nBut it also means that our tomorrow will be the result of our today. Therefore, we have to know exactly who we are and where we are going. We need to know where our point A is to make a route to the point B.\n\nSome books and speakers try to persuade us that the goals and persistence in reaching them are the most important parts of success. But let\u2019s imaging an artist who watched motivation videos too much and decided (by mistake) to become a businessman. For instance, he wants to be rich, and business people are typically wealthier than artists. But the more persistent he is, the more unhappiness it brings in his life. Because deep inside he is still an artist, and pursuing a false dream drives him further from his real goal. \n\nA business entity can change its conception, strategy, and mission, but a human being can\u2019t. Every person is a unique combination of the neural links formed in her or his brain many years ago, in childhood. They determine his or her temper, talents, personality. It doesn\u2019t mean that a person can\u2019t evolve and develop within a lifetime. But people always do it in line with their nature. It is fine-tuning, not creating \u201cme 2.0\u201d. \n\nTheoretically, it is possible to change it slightly by trying to do something we don\u2019t have inclinations to. An artist can try to behave like a business person, but why? Happiness is not about money; it is about harmony between what one wants and what one does. It much better to develop one\u2019s strengths than to fight with one\u2019s weaknesses. \n\nStrategic thinking starts with embracing our original selves. We have to learn ourselves and accept that our life is a result of our past decisions. We need to find a point A. In the next posts I will suggest a couple of tools for how to do it.
