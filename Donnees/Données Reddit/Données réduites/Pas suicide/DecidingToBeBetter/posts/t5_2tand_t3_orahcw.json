Hopefully I can add 10 pounds of muscle. \n\nI'm super privileged and have a good life and I realize I was always guilt tripped for having a good life by my dad growing up, and it made me unconsciously despise having things good and its made me suicidal. I've been this way for years. \n\nI'm also deciding to realize I do deserve to be happy and free and I'm old enough to not be grounded or hovered over because of what I want to do. \n\nI'm starting school again soon and going to be apart of an internship program and I'm really looking forward to getting my shit together.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/orahcw/choosing_to_lose_the_weight_i_gained_during/", "title": "Choosing to lose the weight I gained during lockdown.
