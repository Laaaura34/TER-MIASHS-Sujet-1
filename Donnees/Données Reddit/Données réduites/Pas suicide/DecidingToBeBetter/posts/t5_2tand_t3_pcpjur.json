I used the money and bought a printer and paper that I've had my eye on for a year, plus postage stuff. No more self doubt. No more spending ridiculous money on things that will kill me. I'm done. I'm using the money for something good, that will make me happy and maybe make me money. Sometimes being impulsive is my downfall, but I've made up my mind. I'm so excited to start this journey and I wanted to share somewhere, don't want to tell my friends yet until I get up and running. So yeah, this is it, I'm doing this thing guys!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcpjur/used_my_cigarette_budget_to_buy_a_printer_and/", "title": "Used my cigarette budget to buy a printer and paper to start selling my art.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "kievinthechicken", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 161, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630078005, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcpjur/used_my_cigarette_budget_to_buy_a_printer_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436119.006528, "replies_charged": false}
