As of now I am the smallest and happiest I\u2019ve ever been. I\u2019m doing so many things I\u2019ve only dreamt of doing: Being consistent with the gym, my eating habits, and not having people who uplift me around me anymore. \nI\u2019m not at my goal as far as where I want to be, but for some reason, as I was at the gym today, I just had this flooding feeling of anxiety behind it all. \u201cWho will I turn into?\u201d \u201cWill people be genuine to me once I\u2019ve changed?\u201d \u201cWill interactions with new people need to be met with much more caution?\u201d \n\nI\u2019m happy I\u2019m bettering myself, but I guess I feel nervous about how the world will see me now. I\u2019m no longer the girl who needs to hide behind big, baggy clothes, and yet, what kind of people would I attract into my life like that? Would they have accepted me when I was bigger? Depressed? Im a pretty intelligent, open minded girl, i attract a lot of people and people feel the need to vent to me and feel i have good energy.\nBut i don\u2019t want that part of me to be taken advantage of, not anymore. And i won\u2019t let it be. Maybe these are the growing pains I\u2019m experiencing. But i don\u2019t want to also turn into a person that rejects interaction because I\u2019m so cautious and traumatized. \n\nAh, growing pains.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/omzllh/anxiety_because_im_turning_into_a_person_ive/", "title": "Anxiety because I\u2019m turning into a person I\u2019ve never been before", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Indigochairudo", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626643043, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/omzllh/anxiety_because_im_turning_into_a_person_ive/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435147.2204685, "replies_charged": false}
