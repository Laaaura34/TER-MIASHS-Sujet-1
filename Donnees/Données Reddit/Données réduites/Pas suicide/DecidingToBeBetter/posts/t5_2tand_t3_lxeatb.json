I\u2019m so sick and tired of drowning in endless misery and wanting to end everything, I just want to be happy. I\u2019ve tried being optimistic, I\u2019ve tried talking to people, I\u2019ve tried ignoring it, I\u2019ve tried faking happiness, I\u2019ve tried therapy, I\u2019ve tried confronting the problem, I\u2019ve tried giving myself goals, I\u2019ve tried motivating myself, I\u2019ve tried helping people, I\u2019ve tried being a better person. I\u2019m not even sure what to do at this point. I know that there\u2019s no guaranteed way to get rid of depression, I\u2019m just looking for suggestions I guess.
