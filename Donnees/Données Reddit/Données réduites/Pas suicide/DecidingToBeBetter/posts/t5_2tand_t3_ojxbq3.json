Based on context I can safely presume his goal was to gauge whether I was interested in getting back together. Our relationship was passionate but chaotic, and on too many different occasions I had found myself coming back to it only to remember why I had left before. Today I politely but firmly told him I wasn\u2019t the same person I was before, and that I think it\u2019s best that we don\u2019t rehash the past anymore. It was surprisingly hard to send that message, but I found solace in the fact that I\u2019ve finally grown enough to recognize what is and isn\u2019t good for me and to be strong enough to not fall back into what is a comfortable habit that no longer serves me. Here\u2019s to moving forward, not back.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ojxbq3/today_i_trusted_my_gut_and_chose_not_to_rekindle/", "title": "Today I trusted my gut and chose not to rekindle an old flame.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "vancouverveg", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2230, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626239027, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ojxbq3/today_i_trusted_my_gut_and_chose_not_to_rekindle/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435974.7476876, "replies_charged": false}
