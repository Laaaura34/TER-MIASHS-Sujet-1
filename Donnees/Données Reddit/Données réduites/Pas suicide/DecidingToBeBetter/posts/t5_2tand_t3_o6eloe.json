There is  a concept known as SMART goals. The acronym stands for Specific,  Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely. Make sure that your goals  follow this acronym. \n\nGoals like \u201cnot procrastinating\u201d and \u201cdelaying gratification\u201d are not as helpful because they are too vague and lack context.\n\n**2) \u201cBlack-and-white thinking\u201d is not helpful.**\n\nLet\u2019s imagine that you are trying to discipline yourself to go to the  gym. You create a goal to go 5 times per week. Unfortunately, you only  manage to go 3 times during the first week.\n\nFor someone who thinks in a \u201cblack-and-white\u201d or \u201call-or-nothing\u201d  way, the week is considered a failure. The effect of this negative  thinking might result in the person quitting the gym and later feeling  depressed. This is a scenario I used to often find myself in. I used to  think \u201ceither I do everything perfectly or I don\u2019t do anything at all\u201d.\n\nHowever, I have learned that ups and downs are a normal part of the  process. Perfectionism is dangerous because it can cause you to avoid  doing the work that is needed for you to improve. My thoughts would now  be, \u201cOh well \\*shrugs\\*. That\u2019s okay. This is a process. The week was  still a success. However, I can do better next week.\u201d\n\n**3) Progress should be enjoyable and come from a state of flow.**\n\nA lot of people think that, in order to be happy, healthy, and  successful, you need to constantly punish yourself and suffer. I have  found that I am most productive when I am enjoying myself and going with  the flow of things, kind of like when I was a little kid and I suddenly  got interested and passionate about something. \n\nSure, there will be some discomfort whenever you are trying to  achieve something great. Discipline is important. However, suffering  should never be at the foundation of your purpose.\n\n**4) Escapism should be paid attention to.** \n\nPay attention to how and why you are escaping \u201creality\u201d. For example,  let\u2019s imagine a guy is constantly watching romantic movies and porn.  The reason behind this is that he probably lacks that connection in real  life. He probably has little to no experience with girls. \n\nInstead of indulging in escapism, he should go out, make friends, and  go on dates. The reason he escapes is that he probably feels that this  reality is too far away from being possible.\n\nThis is when he should go back to\u00a0**1), 2),**\u00a0and\u00a0**3)**.  He should create small and measurable goals, understand that his  process might take time, and try to make these small goals as fun and  enjoyable as possible.\n\n**5) Schr\u00f6dinger**\u2018s **cat is all around us.**\n\nThe reason getting disciplined and improving ourselves is so  difficult is because there is so much contradicting information out  there. Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cat is a thought experiment that shows that two  contradictory things can be true at the same time. The same can be said  about a lot of information out there. For example, I believe that both  of the following statements are true:\n\n\u2013 In order to become truly \u201csuccessful\u201d, mere desire is not enough.  You need \u201ccompulsion\u201d. You need the drive and the will that are  necessary to become great. Felix Dennis talked about this in one of his  books.\n\n\u2013 \u201cCompulsion\u201d can be dangerous because if you fail, it can lead to  depression. It can also take away from the joy of the present moment and  create a condition of worth.\n\nThe reason both of these statements can be true while still seeming  contradictory is because everyone is at a different point in their  process and because both statements lack context. The advice that is  good for one person may not be good for another. Everyone is in their  own unique situation, and oftentimes simple and short sentences like the  ones above don\u2019t give the full story.  \n\nAnother example is of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat is the debate surrounding  patience versus speed. Is it better to take things slow and to make a  little bit of progress every day, or is it better to act quickly and  with as much speed as you can? Gary Vaynerchuk hits the nail on the head  with the following quote. He says, \u201cmacro patience, micro speed\u201d.  Meaning, have patience in your long-term vision but try to get a lot of  things done in the short term. \n\nTwo contradicting ways of thinking can both be correct. It all comes  down to perspective. You need to allow your mind to be flexible.  Everything is based on context, and only you have the full context of  yourself and your situation.\n\n**6) Balance is the greatest virtue.**\n\nThis is my most important rule of thumb, and is a continuation of\u00a0**5)**. When I\u2019m having trouble with a dilemma, I simply go back to this.\n\nFor example, the popular \u201cselfishness versus selflessness\u201d debate, or  even, politically, the \u201cright-wing versus left-wing\u201d debate. I find  that I\u2019m happiest and in agreement with myself most when I\u2019m somewhere  in the center of things, objectively balancing two contradicting ideas,  and understanding that the scale can tip in either direction depending  on the situation.\n\nAnother example is the \u201cfree will\u201d debate. I balance the  philosophical \u201ctruth\u201d that free will doesn\u2019t exist, with the  psychological \u201ctruth\u201d that a belief in free will is important in our  lives.\n\nHave balance with everything, including with balance itself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o6eloe/6_concepts_that_may_help_you/", "title": "6 Concepts That May Help You", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "RossWriter", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624460559, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o6eloe/6_concepts_that_may_help_you/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435286.4923909, "replies_charged": false}
