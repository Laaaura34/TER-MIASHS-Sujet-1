Still no video games.   \n\nI\u2019ve now learned all the hiragana characters in Japanese and now working on the katakana.  I also skipped ahead a little and learned how to say \u201cit is half past one o\u2019clock\u201d  \ud83d\ude0d\n\n\nI read some more.  I started a manga, katerou daze, and also read some more of a book all about mma fighter/ pro wrestler Ken shamrock.  It\u2019s a really interesting look into his life and his impact on the early days of mma. It\u2019s not Shakespeare but reading anything is a good start.   I also have Jordan Peterson\u2019s 12 lessons book that I need to finish.  \n\nI walked 5 miles on Friday!   Walked another 2 miles Saturday and decided to rest today.   I wanna walk 5 miles Monday to Friday and rest on the weekends from now on.  \n\nI also didn\u2019t order any fastfood!   I\u2019ve been cooking a lot more.   Staying under my calorie goals.    Having a few things that aren\u2019t the healthiest but keeping that to a minimum and staying under calories.   \n\nI cooked lamb chops marinated in soy sauce, salmon burgers, roasted asparagus, really simple homemade chips were literally just slice 1 potatoe into thin strips, drizzle with a tiny amount (like less than a teaspoon) of oil, salt, and bake for 45 mins.   Much better than eating an entire can of Pringle\u2019s or a handful of fries.  Coooked some delicious tuna as well.  \n\nNo alcohol soda or anything like that.    Already losing a few pounds!   I wanna go from 245 to 199 by January 1st, and then 165 by August 1st.  It\u2019s gonna be tough but I can do it.  \n\nI\u2019m also way happier.   I know I\u2019m still gonna have bad days, but I honestly feel that I\u2019m finally pulling myself out of a deep hole of depression and that I\u2019ll actually start feeeling good about myself", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pe8xf4/i_pledged_to_do_better_and_im_actually_doing_it/", "title": "I pledged to do better and I\u2019m actually doing it!!
