More specifically anything related to sales, or people, or phycology, or things of that nature. But really just any website with good learning tools.\n\nI know there are more than a few out there these days, like LinkedIn learning and stuff such as that, and I am not above paying a (hopefully) small fee for it, but, with some many out there, I figured I would see what works for people, and who knows, maybe people have some free recommendations.\n\nSo what have you guys found that works for you? Any help is appreciated. Thanks!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lx2jrf/wanting_to_be_better_in_my_career_looking_for/", "title": "Wanting to be better in my career.
