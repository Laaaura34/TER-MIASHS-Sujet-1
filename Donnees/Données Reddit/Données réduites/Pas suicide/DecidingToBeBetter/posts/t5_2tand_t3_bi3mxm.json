I always get out there but I generally no longer enjoy it. \n\n\nI think I\u2019m leaving because my well-being is suffering and I have to protect myself. However, I wonder if it isn\u2019t fear as well. \n\nWhat do you think are the hallmarks of making decisions because of fear or making decisions based on wellness and taking care of oneself?
