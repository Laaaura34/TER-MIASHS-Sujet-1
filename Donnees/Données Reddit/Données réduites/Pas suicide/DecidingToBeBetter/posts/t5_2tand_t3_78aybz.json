For example, I thought 110% for sure I'd wake up for my class this morning but I slept right through it. I'll call this \"optimism.\"\n\nWhile I have this unbridled optimism, at the same  time, I don't want to go full pessimism because I feel like that makes you miss opportunities by having a negative tint to your selective focus and if you believe in \"the law of attraction\" and such or just \"positive thinking\" in general, they teach to always find the positive in things because \"it's harmful/useless to focus on the negative.\"\n\nHow can I reform myself so that I go about in the world working hard enough to succeed while also seeing all the opportunities that come at me? Also, are there any books/resources on this topic that can help point me in the right direction?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/78aybz/is_optimism_causing_me_to_fail/", "title": "Is optimism causing me to fail?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MrNoPornAddiction", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1508793559, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/78aybz/is_optimism_causing_me_to_fail/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436075.6437938, "replies_charged": false}
