I have been wasting away the last 11 years of my life. I just do the absolute bare minimum in order to live life. I barely passed high school because I never wanted to do the homework or study. When I became responsible for my own education at college I just started skipping classes because I didn\u2019t want to deal with it. I have been working the same part time job for 6 years and only revived a promotion because I worked there far longer than any of the other canadites for the position. I relationship happened to fall into my lap because someone was trying to cut ties with their abusive  partner and when I was no longer needed that person tossed me aside. Now when I\u2019m not working I just lay in bed or play video games while feeling sorry for myself because I was used by someone and that I\u2019m still in a part time job when In reality I should\u2019ve been done with college and pursuing an actual career by now.\n\nI want to be happy, I want a good job, and I really want someone to love but I have no idea how to change my nature of just waiting around for good fortune.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kie5h4/i_need_to_change_my_life_but_i_have_no_idea_where/", "title": "I Need to change my life but I have no idea where to start.
