I\u2019ve been in toxic living situations my entire life and I finally decided I just needed to take the plunge and go to school. My father said i was going to end up a pregnant drug addicted teenage runaway, but uhhh I don\u2019t think so buddy! I\u2019m only 21 so I\u2019m young, but I dropped out of high school at 17 due to family issues and had to get my GED. I didn\u2019t think it was going to happen. Of course covid turned my on campus classes into online classes , which was easier in a way but also harder.... anyway even though I managed to get myself into ANOTHER dysfunctional living situation with a boyfriend, and being under an ENORMOUS amount of stress every day, I got a 4.0 for my first semester. I almost dropped out a couple times because I just could not do it anymore but I always managed to get my work done even if it was a week\u2019s worth of work in one day. And I was working full time for most of the semester! Now I\u2019m in a healthy environment and I\u2019m ready to continue the year and pursue my degree and I\u2019m just so happy. I also started my workout plan today and I\u2019m taking care of my health, I got back on antidepressants... let\u2019s go, 2021!\n\nMandatory edit: thank you everybody for your love and support, it means the world to me and thank you to the person who gave me awards:\u201d) I\u2019m filled with appreciation for you all.\n\n2 hugz too?
