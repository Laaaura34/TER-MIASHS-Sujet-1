I decided that I want to become a better person cause this pandemic has made me burnt out, depressed, lonely, and miserable. My senior year will be starting in a few days and I'm doing everything that I can be able to to become the person that I've always wanted to be. However, I don't know how to do all of this. I'm trying to hit my goal of studying about 45 hours per week and be able to socialize on top of that and I'm afraid the courses I'm taking (which includes 2 grad courses) will slow me down a lot. I've been so anxious about it that the moment my courses' Canvas sites opened up today, I started working on my assignments. I made a lot of progress, but I don't even know how I'm gonna keep this momentum for 4 months. Do you guys have any tips and tricks that can help me out?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5xeu3/a_college_schedule_so_that_i_can_socialize_more/", "title": "A college schedule so that I can socialize more and do well in class at the same time", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LordUrkelTheGreat", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629177489, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5xeu3/a_college_schedule_so_that_i_can_socialize_more/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438376.4556258, "replies_charged": false}
