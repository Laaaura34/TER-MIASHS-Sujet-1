I didn't exercise, but I walked around a lot and didn't need to eat much to feel full.\nThat all changed last year when I spent most of my time in a tiny apartment that needed some tetris action to exercise, and with my depression getting worse and worse I didn't want to get out of bed most of the time. I gained like 10 kilos and not fitting into my usual clothes was a sore spot for me.\nSo back home where I can get help from my parents I decided to do a workout plan and a diet. I was afraid it'll take ages for me to get results, but it turned out to be pretty fast. I'm only at the halfway point in the diet so I wonder how much more I'll lose.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/prr54k/down_3_kilos_after_just_one_week_of_diet_and/", "title": "Down 3 kilos after just one week of diet and exercise", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Loud_cotton_ball", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 35, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632129381, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/prr54k/down_3_kilos_after_just_one_week_of_diet_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437373.6572475, "replies_charged": false}
