Many of you guys decided to send me links to study guides and even offered tutoring, you guys rock! Well, I passed both with relative ease and I\u2019m on my way to college! :)\n\nAlso, I just bought a 2010 Toyota Corolla today with 140,000 miles on it for $3,500! This will be my first car, although I really was looking for a civic... but all of the ones in my area had problems and/or had 200,000+ miles on them. However, this Corolla will do just fine for now and hopefully for awhile.\n\nAlso-also, I just bought an $800 laptop (expensive, I know... but it\u2019s a gaming laptop) with the rest of the money I saved, so I can go ahead and get started with college!\n\nThis is the happiest I\u2019ve been in a VERY long time and I appreciate the support from everyone here. Seriously, thank you everyone for all the kind words. <3", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o6y968/update_i_passed_my_ged_tests_bought_a_car_and_a/", "title": "UPDATE: I passed my GED tests, bought a car and a laptop for college today!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Jasper_Foxx", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1788, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624530887, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o6y968/update_i_passed_my_ged_tests_bought_a_car_and_a/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436122.8437784, "replies_charged": false}
