I (25f) had a friend, we\u2019ll call her Janet. At first glance, she\u2019s great, thoughtful, always putting her hand up. Except none of it was genuine. \n\nOne favor and you don\u2019t hear the end of it. Someone buys their first home and she questions how it\u2019s possible when she\u2019s so much more ahead of them financially. She ReALly wants to help Ron get that job but it\u2019s too bad they nor their entire family for that matter, didn\u2019t want to finish school. Her jealousy/hate? was on fire and she was always talking like she was above it all and taking jabs at people. No one was safe from her judgment. \n\nI\u2019m good friends with her cousin and Janet was very possessive of her. Perhaps she saw this as a threat, because she would intentionally find ways to exclude me, then pretend it didn\u2019t happen. Her cousin was always trying to make up for Janet\u2019s actions. \n\nIt was all so petty and a lot psychologically. I slowly distanced myself and brought this up to her, but she didn\u2019t take it well. Completely flipped on me like I was crazy, left me hanging mid-convo, and blocked me from everything. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t regret having the courage to try to talk this through with her, I also feel defeated and shaken from a response I should\u2019ve expected. Ultimately it was a toxic space I needed to get away from. I just hope I\u2019m not the only one who sees it. \n\nAny advice on how to move forward from an experience like this?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nt7f21/ending_an_unhealthy_friendship/", "title": "Ending an unhealthy friendship", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "butnowhy", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622932997, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nt7f21/ending_an_unhealthy_friendship/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436507.3432925, "replies_charged": false}
