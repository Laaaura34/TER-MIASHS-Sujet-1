All the years behind you were spent dreaming of this achievement. Likely, you would be crossing vast bodies of water and weathering numerous storms. This journey is, expectedly, a metaphor for life.\n\nThe journey is obstacled by moody waters and ships carrying people that wish you harm. But, along the way, you will encounter a chain of tropical islands, \u2013 safe havens open to discovery and exploration, and a temporary reprieve from the harsh environment.\n\nHaving fun, or having an enjoyable time, is time spent on these small tropical islands, stepping stones that pave your way and lessen the suffering. Some people believe that spending time (even unlimited time) on these islands *is* life\u2019s purpose. This is wrong, and will ultimately lead to detriment and multiplied suffering. You have to keep moving. If you willingly remain stranded on a tiny island, as pleasant as the stay may seem, eventually you will run out of resources or time and die, not having reached your goal.\n\nMeasured indulgence is necessary for survival, so cruise beside the archipelago of rewards.
