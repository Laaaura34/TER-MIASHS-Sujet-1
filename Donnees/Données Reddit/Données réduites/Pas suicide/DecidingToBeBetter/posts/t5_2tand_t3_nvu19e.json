Should be getting my license in 4-6 weeks, but right now, I\u2019m stuck at home all day. My mom doesn\u2019t come home until 5pm every day. So all day, I sit in my thoughts. I try to distract myself with video games, phone or tv, music, but it\u2019s so hard to find motivation to do anything else and anything I try to do I realize that it\u2019s not beneficial in any way or contributing to my life. It\u2019s just a distraction. I have a good support system, thank god, and I have a good friend group that I hang with maybe 1-2 times a week. But other than that, I sit at home, waiting for my life to start. I\u2019m so scared of life. Scared that it\u2019s going to feel too long, that I\u2019ll never be happy, feel fulfilled. That I\u2019m always going to be in this perspective of \u201cthere\u2019s no point to anything. Life is scary and I\u2019m incapable of it all\u201d I\u2019m seeing a therapist and that seems to be going okay. I have no reason to be anxious and depressed to this extent, there\u2019s nothing bad going on on my life. I just feel completely stuck and in a standstill.
