Very negative, always have witty comebacks, getting more sensitive, the world is unfair, the world wants to do me harm, everyone is boring, dont really care about people, im not good enough, what's the point, everyone's better than me anyway, I have nothing to contribute so I'll leave the groupchat, acting like a know it all, being arrogant, nothing means anything to me anymore.  \n\n\nWhen I think about myself a few years ago I had this hunger to improve, eager to learn, humble & positive, ego was not in the way. Now it's like sometimes I go in an out of being very kind & funny to being cocky and depressing. What are some steps to improve? I'll take anything at this point, I really appreciate it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qctkw3/how_do_i_start_being_a_good_person_again/", "title": "How do I start being a good person again?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "scenesick2", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 181, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634827967, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qctkw3/how_do_i_start_being_a_good_person_again/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436916.1273868, "replies_charged": false}
