Pick up a million new habits when feeling \u201cmotivated\u201d, do them for a week, maybe two, maybe even a month aaaand then, I\u2019d get burnt out and quit. \n\nRepeat this x 28.5 years and you\u2019ll find where I was not too long ago. Feeling like I couldn\u2019t do anything consistently, and that maybe I\u2019d always just be a quitter. \n\nI\u2019ve quit a lot of things because I\u2019m a recovering perfectionist. If I wasn\u2019t the best at something, I didn\u2019t want to take part. It\u2019s an easy cop out, really, because of course- a beginner will never be the best at something and continuously make a lot of mistakes- that\u2019s how they eventually, over time with commitment, become a master. \n\nMy life is now very consistent, and it\u2019s been this way for a few months now. It\u2019s 7:15 and I\u2019m about to go for a run, I just finished my AM yoga & meditation practice, and I\u2019m currently reflecting on how grateful I am for the life I\u2019ve cultivated. It didn\u2019t come naturally- I built it day by day. \n\nI now realize that the reason I was a quitter was because I just gave up when I should\u2019ve rested and regrouped. I never went back into something just because I was tired. I\u2019d burn myself out so much and be heavily depleted, instead of resting when I anticipated I would get tired and then be excited to get back into my routine. \n\nThe past week and a half I\u2019ve felt very heavy energetically. I haven\u2019t wanted to move much. I did yoga most days but I took off two days last week which is rare for me now. I knew I needed it but I still felt a little fear- if I stop, will I ever start back up again? \n\nI now realize I\u2019ve just been telling myself I\u2019m a quitter- and self-fulfilling that prophecy over and over again. I\u2019m not a quitter, I\u2019ve just quit things because I didn\u2019t know better and how to maneuver myself in the world ... now I do. \n\nNow I know I need to rest, and if I want to do what\u2019s best for myself (and in turn, for everyone around me) then I need to look after & take care of me by continuing to participate in the healthy habits that have changed my life. I now know that the people who have the most purposeful & peaceful existence didn\u2019t stumble upon it- they created it day by day but practicing what serves them & letting of what doesn\u2019t. Sometimes, in life, those things change. Maybe running is best for me today- but tomorrow, rest will serve me higher. \n\nIt\u2019s important to check in ourselves and notice where we are holding onto past stories or becoming complacent. Are we resting or being lazy? That looks different for everyone. I had rested and rested, felt pretty good and on Saturday I decided I would go for a run. I found a lot of thoughts saying, \u201cmaaaaybe just take another day\u201d but I knew that I had the energy and rested - I just needed to re-establish myself and my habit. I went for a run and it was the BEST feeling. It\u2019s no coincidence two days later I am waking up earlier than i have in a week and about to put on some running shoes. \n\nOur lives, although many aspects are out of our control, depend on how we react or respond in any given moment.  We have a huge part in how our experience goes. There\u2019s no road map or instruction manual but we can go off of how we feel and intuitively, we know a lot more than we give ourselves credit for. \n\nI hope you all have a beautiful day!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hyqinp/rest_when_you_feeling_like_quitting_then_get/", "title": "Rest when you feeling like quitting & then get right back into that habit you want to build.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "erinpanzarella", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 122, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1595849180, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hyqinp/rest_when_you_feeling_like_quitting_then_get/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436040.6860507, "replies_charged": false}
