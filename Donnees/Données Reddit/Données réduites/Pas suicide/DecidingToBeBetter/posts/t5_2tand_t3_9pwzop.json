Merriam- Webster\u2019s dictionary defines pain in the following way: \u201cacute mental or emotional distress or suffering.\u201d Sounds fitting enough to me. It also describes the feeling of pain as \u201csensation induced by noxious stimulus\u201d. This definition is a bit more of a mouthful, to be sure. Let\u2019s chew it a couple of times. Noxious- \u201cconstituting a harmful influence on mind or behavior\u201d. That makes it a little easier to swallow. Together, we have our Frankensteined definition of pain: distress or suffering, drawn from things that hurt the brain and body.\n\nCool. Who cares? \n\nI certainly do. Perhaps you should, as well. Besides the air that we share, pain is the commonality that stretches to connect all humankind. It can come in the form of physical sensations. Cutting yourself while shaving. Tripping awkwardly down the stairs. If you\u2019re me, its up the stairs. Getting stung by a murderous bee. (They *are* murderous, don\u2019t get me started.) Stubbing your toe against that sneaky, moving piece of furniture in the dark. Let\u2019s also not forget the humiliating, mind-numbingly intense pain of biting your tongue. As an adult. *AGAIN.* Moving on.\n\nWe also have emotional pain. The pain of growing up in an emotionally deficient environment. The suffering of losing a loved one. The anguish of waking up everyday knowing you\u2019re headed to a job you dislike. The fearful pain of not knowing how you\u2019ll climb out of the hole of debt you\u2019re stuck in. The hurt of a painful breakup. Or two. Or three. The point is, we all experience these pains to less and greater degrees. Life happens, and we cannot choose the events the universe throws our way. The only thing have control over is our reactions to these events.\n\nWe have no choice but to use this inevitable pain we feel. Our options are twofold. We either use this unwanted pain constructively, or destructively. We have the choice to transform it into a ramp that propels us towards better...or shape it to become a rising, impenetrable wall that keeps us where we are, unable to climb out and away. Sometimes we don\u2019t know that we are building this wall. Example: when I was in high school, I suffered from dark thoughts. Anxiety, depression, and heaping amounts of disdain towards authority figures. I became an expert wall-builder, unwittingly. I refused to do my schoolwork. If you\u2019ve seen The Lion King, you might remember they young Simba saying \u201cI laugh in the face of danger.\u201d I laughed in the face of homework during my high school years.\n\nMy grades dipped below the danger point. I barely graduated. When I chose to be social, I would surround myself with other misfits, who\u2019s lives and stories matched my own. This double negative led to drug and alcohol abuse, crime, and arrests. The energy that I absorbed from my teenage angst was used to destructively imprison me further. My pain paved the way for more pain. I toyed with the idea of suicide. I acted on it, once. Got lucky. I got my girlfriend pregnant during my senior year. The list lengthens. I could have chosen to use the pain of the burdening schoolwork to excel academically. I should have. I could have chosen to surround myself with people who would bring me closer to the surface of my drowning atmosphere. I could have kept attending my music lessons, and learned to (adequately) play the trombone, which I had enjoyed. All of these things, I did not do. Why? \n\nThe answer is anticlimactic. I didn\u2019t *know* I was decelerating my future progress. I acted on the basis of my pain, and acted to avoid it. This sent me hurtling along the path of pain at a higher rate of speed. Sometimes we go through events that scar us, and we retract. We hunch down, lest we become more exposed to the universe and its offerings of pain. This excludes us from the same offerings of blessings, prosperity, and peace that we desperately search for.  \n\nIf this has ever happened to you, learning to take the alternate approach will enhance your life and point you in the proper direction. Hang on, Evil Kneivel. Let\u2019s use what you\u2019ve been through to build a ramp from your pain and allow you to center in on prosperity. But...in reverse order. Come along.\n\nWhat events have been the most \u201cnoxious stimuli\u201d to your life? I said it that way to sound smart, like a dictionary. Hope it worked. What have you gone through, that perhaps has made you want to stay in the warm bath of your comfort zone, afraid to step out onto the cold floor of reality and reach towards your dreams? \n\nMaybe you suffered through a bitter breakup or divorce. I can check that box. Perhaps you gathered the courage to face your fears, and got promptly knocked back down. I hope the box is large enough for me to fit a thousand check marks into. Sometimes we get burnt by caring too much for others and neglecting our own needs. Other times we are minding our own business, and get whacked over the head with ad hoc pain missiles, paying the price for being alive. A friend betrays us. The sudden death of a loved one shakes us to our core. CHECK. \n\nThe experience of standing next to my wife, looking down at my precious, stillborn daughter shook me beyond belief. My heart and soul dropped, scraping against the deepest pits of hell and brimstone, pummeled against those cruel, silent rocks of agony and torture.\n\nThe pain didn\u2019t go away at all. I ran, hid, and stuck my head in the sand. No matter. It didn\u2019t back off an inch. \n\nUntil I turned around. It took months. I gathered enough courage..and turned towards the monstrous anguish. As I faced and fought back against my mountain of misery and woe, I came to an understanding with myself. At the very basement of bleakness, I understood that it was my choice to let go, or forever place in my path the suffering of unresolved desolation. In doing this, the hill of despair started to shrink. The rocky dirt\u2026. had small sparkles in it. It spoke back to me, offering a choice. I could get caught in my haunted past, stuck recycling my suffering like an endless wash cycle of dirty clothes. Or I could move forward, and mine my wounds for gold. Perhaps I saw too much of Mr. T growing up, but I liked gold. That\u2019s what I chose. It changed my life. These days, I pity the fool.\n\nLooking inside my pain transformed me, and brought me rich perspective. I learned to cherish the healthy, beautiful daughter that I do have...who is alive and well. Now, every moment of time that I spend with her, I cherish to a greater degree. Every hug, kiss, and tick of the clock with her is that much more meaningful.\n\nI\u2019m more appreciative of my 10+ nieces and nephews, who I adore. I am more patient and understanding with them. The feeling of being with them commands a sum that could never be paid for. The universal flying experience of the perpetually crying kid on the airplane annoys me less. That is saying a lot! I am startled by the fact that I would not have discovered these insights had I not faced my pain. Now, I take all opportunities to inspect the bad, for the good hidden inside.\n\nI have learned that there is no escape from pain. What we sometimes fail to see, is that inside the hill of pain, gold mines await. We all have our own veritable gold mines inside of us. Some of us contain flecks of gold, others- Fort Knox equivalents. I have heard it said that the more pain we experience in life, the further we can experience it\u2019s opposite. Satisfaction. Love. Peace. Tranquility. Happiness, fulfillment, abundance, prosperity...to name a few. How rich are you? \n\nHere\u2019s the thing about gold. When you search for gold, you don\u2019t necessarily look for it. You must find the dirt first. You sift through the dirt, the mess, the anguish...until you find some gold flakes. You get excited. You begin to enjoy the mud, the dirty fingernails. It means you\u2019re working towards your end, whatever that may be. You pan more intensely. You find larger nuggets. Now you\u2019re in *flow.* You don\u2019t mind the dirt...your *fear*, because you know it contains the treasures you seek. The hill of sifted dirt shapes our ramped exit, and once the fortune is gathered, we can launch away, treasure in tow. \n\nUse your overflowing cup of pain to begin prospecting, today. Ask yourself- what is there that I could learn from this? If you\u2019re like most people, you have an almost unlimited list of gold-filled heaps to choose from. Walk around, get to know the different sites and locations. Create a list of potential positives that you could get from something bad that happened to you. Strut confidently, feeling the pickaxe on your shoulder begin to grow, ready to dig into the pain. And when you\u2019re ready- begin your gold rush. Claim what is yours. After all, life is golden. \n\n\u201cMore gold has been mined from the thoughts of men than has been taken from the earth.\u201d\n\n\\-Napoleon Hill", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/9pwzop/the_wealth_of_pain/", "title": "The Wealth of Pain", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "strwberyiscreem", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1540063645, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/9pwzop/the_wealth_of_pain/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437636.3175237, "replies_charged": false}
