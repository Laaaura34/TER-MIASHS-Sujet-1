I have social anxiety and entered the freshmen year 2 weeks after classes started, everyone already had their groups and I struggled very hard to make friends. The only person that talked to me was actually talking shit behind my back because I didn\u2019t talk to anyone and she thought it was because I felt superior to everyone... Luckily I was able to make an amazing friend, however I still feel so lonely. My classes feel like hell because I feel completely alienated from everyone and I think they hate me. I have no motivation for my projects, it feels like I\u2019m just trying to get through them. It makes me very confused because i know that this is what I want to do with my life but I hate the projects they give us. These were supposed to be the best years of my life yet it\u2019s hard for me to get through a day without having a meltdown. \n\nIdk if this is the right sub, but I really don\u2019t know what to do. Any advice or shared experiences would be gladly appreciated because I\u2019m desperate :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qetbar/college_is_killing_me_and_idk_what_to_do/", "title": "College is killing me and idk what to do", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "imnotarobot02", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 36, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635085907, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qetbar/college_is_killing_me_and_idk_what_to_do/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436244.9018724, "replies_charged": false}
