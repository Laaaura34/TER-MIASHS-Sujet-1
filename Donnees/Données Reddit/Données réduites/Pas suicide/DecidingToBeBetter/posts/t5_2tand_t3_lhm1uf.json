I have an anxiety disorder (general and social) but I've been doing very well until recently. I started the year being very optimistic, I got good grades, I was disciplined, I got a new and challenging writing contract. Last week, things started to go off. I can't say exactly but I felt like I was on the edge. One day when I was hiking, I almost fell from a hill and it was the exact same feeling. 10 days again I was super happy with tons of projects, and suddenly I've been spinning down.\n\nI got an appointment with my GP tomorrow, but I'm not sure what she can do. I feel like it's getting worse, I can't follow classes anymore, I forget to reply to people, to do homework, I'm struggling like hell with my last writing contract and I'm skipping courses to finish it (I never had to do it before, for any contract). I find myself procrastinating like never before, it's more like self-sabotage. I take hours to write an email, even to someone I know. I don't sleep well, I have headaches, I'm super sensitive and I cry easily. I don't even know where to start to go back on the hill.\n\nI don't know if it's a lack of discipline or something like that, but if anyone has bits of advice that would be very nice", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lhm1uf/how_do_i_stop_falling_and_start_getting_up/", "title": "How do I stop falling and start getting up?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "OldGrumpyHag", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613054521, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lhm1uf/how_do_i_stop_falling_and_start_getting_up/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437596.3167372, "replies_charged": false}
