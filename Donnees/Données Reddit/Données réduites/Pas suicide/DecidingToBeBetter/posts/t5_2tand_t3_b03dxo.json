Just finished the interview I am so proud of myself that I did not stutter or talked too fast when I had the interview. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI could think clearly and speak what's on my mind and for once I was not letting my nervousness and anxiety get to me. At times during the interview when I could not find the words to say out loud, I would go 'hmm' in a soft voice to myself so that I can find the words and continue with my sentences. May or may not be a good thing to do in a serious interview, but at least I did not stop talking entirely and made the interview awkward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTook me some time to get to this stage and I am so proud of myself! :D", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/b03dxo/i_had_a_great_interview_just_now/", "title": "I had a great interview just now!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "technoMRT", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1552364176, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/b03dxo/i_had_a_great_interview_just_now/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438288.3353949, "replies_charged": false}
