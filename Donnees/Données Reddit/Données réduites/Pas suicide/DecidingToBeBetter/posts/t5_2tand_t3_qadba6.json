In the past, routines, meditation, and cutting out weed have helped me so much in beating depression. But now, any routine I create feels too restrictive, but less strict routines don\u2019t give me the stable structure I need for my life to feel meaningful. It feels like I go in and out of every day like a zombie, purposeless, meaningless, just going through the motions of life. \n\nI also have HUGE problems with perfectionism, and I think that\u2019s why my routines have started feeling too restrictive. I place too much pressure on myself to accomplish things, and it ruins the beauty of routines for me. I need things to be done in a specific way, and that also feels too restrictive. But being looser with my expectations puts me in that depressed, meaningless spiral instead like I said above. Meditation has also lost all its power for me. Though that may be because I am not consistent enough with it - it\u2019s hard to be consistent when I don\u2019t have a meaningful routine to my day, and it\u2019s hard to have a flexible routine when you struggle with perfectionism. So the cycle of depression continues. \n\nWould it be helpful for me to write out the things that are important to me, that I really want to focus on in my life, and build a routine around that? And also work on my perfectionism issues in the meantime, so I don\u2019t end up being too strict with myself? It would be SO much easier for me to meditate too if I had a meaningful routine going for me. \n\nSorry for this ramble lol, this was more of a journal entry than a Reddit post.
