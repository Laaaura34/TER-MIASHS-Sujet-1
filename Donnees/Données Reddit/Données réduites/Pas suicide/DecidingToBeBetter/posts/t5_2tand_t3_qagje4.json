Bonded over shared life values, hard work ethics and travel. We traveled to so many cities together, and he didn\u2019t want to be a relationship with me saying he wanted to pursue his dream and will move away. A year later, he starts flirting with me again, and this started a rift between me and my boyfriend at the time. Flash forward, I wondered if things would work out between us, I\u2019m single again and while he initiated being intimate with me, he doesn\u2019t want anything long term with me. Once again, he has a dream and he thinks he will move again. This happening again doesn\u2019t make things any easier for me to mend my once again broken heart. I did get a chance to tell him about the things he did that frustrated me while I\u2019ve been recently spending time with him, and I felt lighter emotionally and I felt proud for standing up for my needs and feelings. It\u2019s been really hard. I am in a tough emotional state right now: struggling with low self esteem, trauma, memories of being emotionally abused, fear of being taken advantage of, feeling lost with what career decision to take next, my \u201cbiological clock\u201d ticking, fear that people don\u2019t really like me and will abandon me or give me the silent treatment. I started working out again and it\u2019s been a tremendous help! I feel stronger every time I work out! I was able to get through the day without feeling like I have to curl up in bed and it hurts to think about the man you want grow old but he doesn\u2019t share that vision, it hurts a lot. Ultimately, my goal is get physically stronger and figure out the rest of my life while doing volunteer work. If you have any experience or advice to share that will help me solve some of the challenges and move on to building a brighter life, I will appreciate it!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qagje4/heart_broken_and_moving_on_day_by_day/", "title": "Heart broken and moving on day by day", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "heyapc", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634536445, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qagje4/heart_broken_and_moving_on_day_by_day/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435126.4358654, "replies_charged": false}
