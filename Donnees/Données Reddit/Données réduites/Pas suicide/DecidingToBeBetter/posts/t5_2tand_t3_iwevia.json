Or Seneca: \u201c The greatest obstacle to living is expectancy which hangs upon tomorrow and loses today\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, without having a future that excites or inspires you, the present becomes meaningless and without purpose. According to Viktor Frankl in Man\u2019s Search for Meaning, it\u2019s actually impossible to be happy in the present without a future you\u2019re striving for. As he stated:\n\n\u201cWhat man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task.\u201d\n\nBoth of these make perfect sense to me and can see the benefit in each one in isolation.\n\nWhat usually happens in real life is that I go from one extreme to another meaning that for a while I go hard on myself, doing everything according to the plan for the future, not giving in any momentary pleasure for a better future. I get tired then start the next phase which I just relax and do whatever I find pleasant at the moment and not caring about the future. And this cycle goes on and on.\n\nI believe there is a balance point but for some reason can't connect the dots and see the full picture.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iwevia/live_in_the_moment_or_plan_for_the_future/", "title": "Live in the moment or plan for the future", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bysa64", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1600612329, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iwevia/live_in_the_moment_or_plan_for_the_future/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437678.5233335, "replies_charged": false}
