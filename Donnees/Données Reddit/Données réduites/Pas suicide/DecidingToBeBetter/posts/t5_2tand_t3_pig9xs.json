On the bright side I am pursuing genuine therapy to help combat this issue \n\nI\u2019m going to return to journaling to better restrain myself, the things I say, how I handle my issues, restoring dignity and self worth.\n\nI do genuinely enjoy Reddit but I\u2019ve been using it for all the wrong reasons. I am purging my feeds from any negative sources of energy, false hope, and overall shit that will just ruin me if I lurk in them. Control what you write or see. Do yourself a favor and leave bad subreddits while you can still salvage yourself, take breaks, go do something fun or productive. \n\nWhat would your spouse, relatives, friend or roommate think of you if they saw your account? Would they really want to be in the same room as you? Probably not is what some would say. \n\nBeing mindful of what to consume on the internet. Time after time I\u2019d follow the worse subreddits that only hurt myself in all ways mentally, emotionally and physically. \n\nIt\u2019s a harsh journey but it\u2019s very doable \u2014 Healthy mind, healthy body leads to great things. Save yourself while you still can.
