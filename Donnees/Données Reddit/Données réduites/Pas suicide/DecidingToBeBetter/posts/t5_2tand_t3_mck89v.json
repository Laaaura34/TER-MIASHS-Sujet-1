The past few years I've been dealing with OCD and social anxiety and I've been through therapy the past few years, focusing on myself and my well being. I'm doing much better, and now I'm thinking about what I want to do with my life.. I'm gonna look for a job, but since I have barely work experience, I had a job as a cashier at The Home Depot for a week, but I let social anxiety win the battle, and left the job.. So, for the past month, I started volunteer once a week doing packing and assembling stuff at a warehouse. It's going well, so maybe start doing an entry level job in packing and assembling, but I'm not sure what jobs to look for to gain experience. As in for careers, I thought about becoming a translator/interpreter since I speak English and Spanish, but I'm not really sure what I really want to do with my life. In school, I was good at history.. I have a good memory of dates and things but I've always have trouble about what to do with my life..
