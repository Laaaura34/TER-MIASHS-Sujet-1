My heart ached because I finally found someone who made me feel safe, respected, and loved. I felt worthy for once. I found myself yearning for all the nice things he used to do for me. \nSo after a week of nothing but tears and worrying about how I would never get that again... I decided I\u2019m going to do nice things for myself now\n\n-\tHe would bring me milk tea/flowers/snacks? I\u2019m going to get myself milk tea, flowers, and snacks\n-\tHe would take me hiking and on walks? I\u2019m going to take myself hiking and on walks\n-\tHe would make sure I\u2019ve eaten, slept, worked out well? I\u2019m going to make sure I\u2019ve eaten, slept, and worked out\n-\tHe would give me pep talks on days I was feeling especially depressed or anxious?
