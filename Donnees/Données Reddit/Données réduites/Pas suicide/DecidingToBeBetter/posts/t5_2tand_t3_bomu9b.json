It threw my whole day upside down and I held onto it for about 10 minutes staring my two paths head on. I threw it away because I know how much I have to lose and that everything going wrong in my life is thanks to my substance abuse problems. Before I would've been jumping for joy and euphoric, but I now realize how much I've really changed. \n\nNo matter what you're dealing with just know that if you need to change you can, no matter how hopeless things feel.
