After losing 52 lbs I realized I wasn't happy with my body. I talked about it in therapy for years. For the first time in a long time can proudly say I\u2019m happy with myself, and my life. I can finally love myself for the time of ever.\n\nI'm 22 and if it weren't for my trauma I think could have achieved this earlier in life. My nmom abused me mentally and physically everyday until she kicked me out. Some family members sexually abused me and forced me to do things to them. \n\nNaturally, after everything, I thought I didn't deserve to be loved. I used to self-harm but it has been 451 days since. It's also been 3 months since I left my toxic job for a much better job. \n\nI've been exercising 30 mins a day and practicing mindfulness. I feel alive and proud again. Things actually do get better. I graduate with my Bachelor's in 8 months and can't wait. In 3 months I start my internship with an Abuse Center helping kids like me. I want to become a Social Worker for them.\n\nAll of these things have made me happy and made me laugh want to live. As a person who has CPTSD, MDD, and Anxiety this is a huge accomplishment for me. I've been depressed every day for years.
