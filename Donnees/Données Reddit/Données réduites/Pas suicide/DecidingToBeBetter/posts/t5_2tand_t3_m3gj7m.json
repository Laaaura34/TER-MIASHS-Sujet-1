I'm genuinely happy, I love the job, & I don't think I've ever been this satisfied or comfortable with my life. \n\nI turn 40 today.\u00a0 In the last year, I've survived a comple life upheaval,\u00a0 I've paid off a $10,000 credit card, I've found a job I can not only handle but excel at, I've started living my life for me, I've improved my mental health, & I'm optimistic about my future \n\nI still have a long way to go.\u00a0 My ex & i bought a house in January 2020 & he's not planning on moving out until September, we avoid each other.\u00a0 I'm worried about not being able to handle things on my own, like all the bills, but as long as my job keeps up, I won't have any problems.\u00a0 I still get down occasionally,\u00a0 I'd like to have someone to share things with, but i don't feel like I need someone else to take care of me. \n\nI hate hearing \"things will get better\", because it always just feels like insincere bullshit. \n\nBut my life is proof that things CAN get better.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m3gj7m/i_told_myself_that_if_my_life_didnt_improve_by/", "title": "I told myself that if my life didn't improve by the time I hit 30, I'd kill myself.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ThePunkHippie", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2838, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615552056, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m3gj7m/i_told_myself_that_if_my_life_didnt_improve_by/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437493.7361002, "replies_charged": false}
