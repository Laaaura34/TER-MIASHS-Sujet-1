It feels like I\u2019ve been unmasked as an imposter and I\u2019m being judged even by strangers that don\u2019t know me. \n\nWhat inspired me to write this post, I gave a speech today in my business communications class. \nI fundamentally overestimated my target audiences understanding of the topic at hand because I rushed through the assignment last minuet and based it on what I\u2019ve been learning in my computer science degree path. \nI fumbled in front of everyone, actively realizing my miscalculation as I progressed through slides of the OSI/TCP model and pulling a complete blank I froze. I ended up apologizing and stating what I had realized. As agonizing as it was for me, I know it\u2019s just a small mistake.\n\nWhat bothers me is that this is my third time in college. I failed out of two other colleges.\nMy first attempt I was just young and didn\u2019t have good values.\nMy second attempt was when my son was born and I missed 12 required clinical hours that forced me to drop out.\n\nI\u2019m not stupid, but I have a set of challenges that makes me seem less than bright. They make it hard to stay committed when my interest sway so frequently.\nMy ADHD and Dyslexia work in tandem to make it really hard to focus on what I need to be doing. Instead of having strong executive functions and being able to prioritize, I lose my train of thought and I focus on what\u2019s interesting or stimulating to me. It isn\u2019t intentional and I\u2019m not even cognizant of it most times. \n\nI work 40+ hours a week, I have two beautiful kids but I constantly feel like I\u2019m not good enough because of how hard it is to find what they are doing interesting (from my ADHD as cold as it sounds. I love my kids, but I don\u2019t have control over that process in my brain.)\n\nNow, I\u2019m not going to go in depth about every bad thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.\nThat isn\u2019t the purpose of this post.\n\nIt\u2019s mostly to vent, and hopefully relate others who might be facing similar circumstances. \n\nIn truth I like failure, it makes me feel, even if it\u2019s embarrassment. It teaches me, I don\u2019t think there is a better teacher than failure.\n\nI\u2019m going to keep on trying, learning, pushing. That\u2019s the father that my kids need. That\u2019s who I want to be.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read all the way down here, thank you and I hope some of this post had a positive effect on you.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pyyzqt/im_going_to_keep_trying/", "title": "I\u2019m going to keep trying", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Csmith981", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633056683, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pyyzqt/im_going_to_keep_trying/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435345.7683926, "replies_charged": false}
