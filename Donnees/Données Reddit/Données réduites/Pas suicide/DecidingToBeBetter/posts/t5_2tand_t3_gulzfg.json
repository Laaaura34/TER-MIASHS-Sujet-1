Looking back at every situation that felt like the end of the world, I have a lot of compassion for what I\u2019ve gone through. I\u2019ve led both a hard and blessed life. I\u2019ve had it worse than some and better than others. I now know that life isn\u2019t an \u201ceither, or\u201d kind of thing, but an \u201cand\u201d. Life is beautiful and ugly. Life is amazing and tragic. \n\nI get lost when I think it\u2019s one thing. As humans we look for patterns and try to define things. At all of my rock bottoms, the time where I almost lost all hope, I couldn\u2019t see what was waiting on the other side. I couldn\u2019t understand that although everything was really hard in those moments, I would become a better person for them. I would learn, a lot. \n\nI\u2019m working on feeling my feelings as they come, not reacting when I\u2019m in an emotional state, but honoring whatever rises. Our emotions have purpose but they\u2019re also rooted in a lot of illusions. My fears teach me about myself and they show me where work is to be done. But i am allowed to feel afraid. I am allowed to feel anything. And I have to, in order to release. In order to let go. \n\nI wanted to share these words of hope that even when it feels like all is ending, and it might be, a new order is on its way. It might not be easy. It can be hard and transformative. It can be divine and horrific. Remember that there is something coming, even when all feels over. Each ending promises a new beginning. I\u2019m not sure of most things, but I am sure of that. And I\u2019m positive that you can get through whatever is thrown your way. No matter the situation, you are stronger than it. You\u2019re still here. You\u2019ve made it. And you will continue to do so, and learn so much along the way.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gulzfg/breathe_you_will_get_through_whatever_life_throws/", "title": "Breathe.
