In one of my channel videos I described how I failed the physical therapy boards so sat around for a year feeling sorry for myself. This accomplished . . . nothing. When I reorganized my priorities and finally got licensed suddenly everything changed. You may consider it a year wasted. I do not. I learned a huge lesson that has followed me in all my endeavors to writing, my advancement in PT (now 21 years) and everything I set out to do. Inaction pushes you forward not at all. Staring at a boulder doesn't make it move. Being angry at it because it is in your way doesn't make it move. Your path gets cleared when you put a lever underneath it and push down hard. Something that I now advise my subs.
