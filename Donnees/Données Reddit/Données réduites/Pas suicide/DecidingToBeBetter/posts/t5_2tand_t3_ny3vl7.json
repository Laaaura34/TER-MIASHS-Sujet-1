I happen to be in pretty bad shape despite the achievement. I tend not to think so much of the things I want to achieve after achieving them. I'm too hard on myself. Being too hard on myself probably takes away the joy and maybe even prevents me from being confident about myself.\n\nSo I want to tell myself that I did a great job graduating from university with a Latin Honor. It's a big achievement for me, I have never managed to be an honor student from my grade school to high school years. As much as everyone says that grades don't always matter. I want to tell myself that it's a symbol of how I worked hard to achieve something that I wasn't sure I'd ever even achieve.\n\nI also did a great job in losing almost 20 KG. It took me a long time probably but I got there. I've honestly been trying to lose weight since I was in high school but I always failed. It's okay that I was slow but at least this time I had the discipline and commitment to get to my goal.\n\nI'm still working on other things. I hope to have a good update about them soon.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ny3vl7/i_want_to_be_the_person_i_envisioned_that_i_could/", "title": "I want to be the person I envisioned that I could be.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "cheeselover15", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 25, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623494229, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ny3vl7/i_want_to_be_the_person_i_envisioned_that_i_could/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437306.0706177, "replies_charged": false}
