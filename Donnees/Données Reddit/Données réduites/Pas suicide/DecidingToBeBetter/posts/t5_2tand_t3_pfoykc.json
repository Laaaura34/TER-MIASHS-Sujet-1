I loved group fitness and dance classes and miss them terribly. \n\nToday, I took my cycle out for the first time in a long time and rode 8KMs. There were so many times in the middle when I felt like turning back and going home, but I finished the route that I had promised myself. I'm obese and prediabetic, and trying to lose weight. For me, this was very very hard. But I'm happy I completed it! As miserable as I felt whenever I stopped to catch my breath, my feelings when I got home after this route were the complete opposite. I felt so confident in my body! \n\n\nI read somewhere: exercise is a celebration of what your body can do, not a punishment for what you ate\n\nI'm so grateful my body has kept me alive and for all it can do. Hopefully I can take better care of it from now on.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfoykc/felt_good_about_exercise_after_a_long_time/", "title": "Felt good about exercise after a long time", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "me_and_otherthings", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 40, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630481625, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfoykc/felt_good_about_exercise_after_a_long_time/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436938.2680788, "replies_charged": false}
