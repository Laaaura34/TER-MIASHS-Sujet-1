I gained an astronomical amount of weight in a short period of time. I have so many symptoms and generally just felt so disgusting all the time I didn\u2019t see the point of even trying. So I didn\u2019t. For years. I got married and I was unhappy. I was working at a job I hated. I was living in a place that I couldn\u2019t stand. \n\nSo I decided to leave. I left my husband and moved back home to live with some friends. I slept on their couch for a year before we decided to move to Washington. I got my own room again, left my job at Starbucks for an opportunity that paid better, and started to repair the damage I\u2019d done to my life. Then I became complacent again. I was smoking more cigarettes than ever since my commute had gone from 10 minutes to an hour. I ate like garbage. I was at my heaviest and my anxiety and depression were at an all time high. I had so many health issues that I couldn\u2019t even name them all. Most of them stemmed from my PCOS but the others were my fault. \n\n\u2022I finally made a doctors appointment. I got on medication to help me quit smoking, since I\u2019m not a gum chewer and I move around so much at work that the patches don\u2019t stay on my body. As of right now, I haven\u2019t had a cigarette in two days. I would go through a pack in a day and a half before this medicine. \n\n\u2022I started going to the gym a few weeks ago and I\u2019ve stayed consistent with it every day. I began meal prepping. The scale only says I\u2019ve lost 2lbs, but I\u2019ve gone down two pants sizes and most of my shirts fit better than they ever have. \n\n\u2022I bought a Fitbit and I log every step and calorie and my sleep schedule to hold myself accountable. \n\n\u2022I\u2019ve started doing yoga and meditating. I talk to myself positively. I still slip up and say really mean things about myself and my body. It\u2019s a work in progress. \n\n\u2022I finally filed for divorce after leaving 2 years ago. \n\nChanging my mindset wasn\u2019t easy.  It\u2019s only been a few weeks and it\u2019s been mentally and emotionally challenging. I just keep reminding myself how much better I feel now than I did a month ago. If I feel this good now, imagine how I\u2019ll feel in another month. \n\nI decided I wanted to be better and I\u2019m committed to staying that way. I\u2019m grateful for this sub.\n\nEdit: you guys are so amazing and supportive. My heart is so full from your responses.
