A server has to be great, unless they just want shitty nights. The pay is good so you might have to match the demand for the labor. Once you show your managers that your the hot stuff, they'll easily give you good sections with out thinking much. Like the servers you financially envy. \n\nExample. \n \"Hey manager! Can you swing by my table and greet, and ask them how everything was? . . . . I just want to make sure there okay\" or, \"hey manager! I need you to swipe your managers card on the computer, this table tipped me over %50. This has been happening all week, oh heavens lord all my almighty\" good service can lead your tables to leaving wonderful notes on your receipts. you then can accidentally show them while chatting with them during work. Equally important, be funny to your tables, so oddly funny that you make your guests laugh out loud. HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA !!!!!! It'll catch the attention of your manager if they're near by ;]   If they're playing with you, you play them at there own game.
