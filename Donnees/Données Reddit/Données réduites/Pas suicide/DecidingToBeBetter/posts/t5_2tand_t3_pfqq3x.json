I don't know if I'm an asshole or an idiot. Or both) after about 6 months. Got rejected, which gave me the reality check/slap in the face I needed. Took me a while, but I finally moved on. Might be alone at big school functions but most of my friends are in the same boat, and misery loves company, right?\n\nToday, I finally moved forward. I came to an acceptance that some people are destined to go through life without a partner, but that I can still live my best life. There are so many other things in the world that are beautiful, and I don't have to be in a relationship to be able to appreciate them. Won't say it doesn't hurt still, but the sting has gone and the pain is way more bearable. Ultimately, I needed that rejection to see things clearly (for the first time in a while), and now I can finally move forward. I have so many great friends, a loving family and a good life in general. I'm not gonna throw that away just because I missed a shot.\n\nTo anybody going through a breakup/rejection phase, it hurts. Oh, it hurts. But it won't hurt forever. Please know that you have my deepest sympathy, and that you CAN move on and be your best self regardless.
