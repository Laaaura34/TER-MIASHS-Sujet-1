It sometimes seems to me that having this idea of a \u201cgoal physique\u201d means that I\u2019m not accepting of my current body even though it\u2019s healthy enough and this made me question whether I truly have love for who I am.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this and have any of you experienced something similar?
