Do you have any advice? \n\nPlease hear me out first: I have lovely friends and generally get on well with people - I find it relatively easy to connect with and be vulnerable with others. But, I am very quick to see the negatives in those around me, even (or especially) my best friends. I easily fixate on the negatives, too, sometimes finding it hard to then still like them. \n\nI find it very hard to find a romantic partner, even though I have dated a lot of people. I don\u2019t really understand why this is (I\u2019m a critical thinker in general, I suppose?) and would like to change. Any insights welcome, this really bothers me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfp6lm/how_to_be_less_negative_especially_about_other/", "title": "How to be less negative, especially about other people?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ms_calculated", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 67, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635192512, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfp6lm/how_to_be_less_negative_especially_about_other/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436249.884391, "replies_charged": false}
