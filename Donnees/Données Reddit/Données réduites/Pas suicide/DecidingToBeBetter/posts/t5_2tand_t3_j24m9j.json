I like being happy, I like seeing the brighter side of things. And hand in hand with that, I\u2019ve always felt that I\u2019m very honest and open with my emotions. I know what I\u2019m feeling and I don\u2019t have any fear to face it.\n\nAfter the service I went to go talk to my friend, and we chatted for a bit. It was very very sudden and out of nowhere, so he was rightfully emotional, but when he hugged me goodbye he told me he loved me and it hit me like a brick wall. Not necessarily with overwhelming emotion but by shock at the fact that it was so hard for me to say it back.\n\nI really do love this guy like a brother, and it was shocking to say the least that I couldn\u2019t just immediately let myself be open and vulnerable and say the words \u201cI love you too.\u201d Which, I did say, but the amount of effort it took was something that really scared me.\n\nI remember being able to tell people I loved them all the time a few years back. It wasn\u2019t hard, and I meant it. I suspect this to be remnant from a horrible break up that really rocked my world. I truly thought I had reached a point of being at peace with what had happened with that, but it seems there are a few more things to overcome and work through.\n\nI hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019d had this emotional stunt in my life, and I thought I was the same old me for so much of this time. But this experience has put a lot of things in perspective and I\u2019m excited to work back to being able to express myself again.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j24m9j/today_a_close_friend_told_me_he_loved_me_and_it/", "title": "Today a close friend told me he loved me and it was a shocking wake up call", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "StarfishWizard", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1601402552, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j24m9j/today_a_close_friend_told_me_he_loved_me_and_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437616.7384768, "replies_charged": false}
