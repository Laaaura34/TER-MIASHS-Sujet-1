I love to learn about all sorts of things, and I believe that knowing a lot is quite powerful. However, that counted with gossips as well, and due to the human nature, I tend to get curious about other's affairs as well. But sometimes, ignorance is bliss. \n\nI was caught in a drama from 2020, that the effects of it still lingered in my life. When I reflected back, I realised that all could've been avoided if only I stopped asking my friends about their own personal lives. It wasn't intentional, more like a follow-up, because they've let me in few times over the years. They told me don't be afraid to ask. And I listened, but never did I know that it accidentally affected the peace of everyone. Eventhough I've apologised for disrupting the peace they were having, they saw me in a different light, that I am nosy and loves gossip. But I was just instinctively curious, and that I made a misstep.\n\nSince this year is still fresh anew, I would like to work on my social skills, by avoiding what I did before. I still worship knowledge, still passionate about learning. Now I know better that, some things should be left unknown. And I hope that this can be insightful to all of you as well.
