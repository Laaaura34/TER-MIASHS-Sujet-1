And let's not forget my poor boundaries, daddy issues, and naivette. \n\nThough I'm aware of my problems, I don't realize when I'm having an SA episode until after the damage is done. I've learned to go back to the person involved and communicate correctly once I'm clear headed but many (all) don't care and just end up ghosting me. \n\nIt usually takes me 2 months to realize a friend or potential SO is not respecting my boundaries. And then at that point I usually cut them off or more rarely discuss the problem (they usually don't want to respect the boundaries after the 2 month free for all) \n\nI have unreasonably low or high expectations of men. Still haven't figured out how to help myself with this one. \n\nAnd I was super sheltered growing up and though I've grown since then I still am very naive.\n\nI'm tired of the same cycle of panic attacks and unreasonable self-induced stress fucking up my relationships. And I've stopped trying to make friends cuz that's 10x harder. \n\nAny tips on how to get ahead of my SA if not completely cure it? Just anything that can give me a long term benefit.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxhzeb/how_can_i_outgrow_my_social_anxiety/", "title": "How can I outgrow my social anxiety", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "cln16", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632869323, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxhzeb/how_can_i_outgrow_my_social_anxiety/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437983.474653, "replies_charged": false}
