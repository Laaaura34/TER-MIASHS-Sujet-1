Very few men have the guts for this practice. Your insecurity may cause you to doubt yourself, and so you take the easy way by not even approaching the edge.\"* - [David Deida](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Deida)\n\nWe have been conditioned for thousands of years to fight for our survival. Because of this, the majority choose experiences in life that require minimal risk. This helps maintain the false illusion of being safe and secure. You become comfortable with complacency.\n\nWhat exactly is holding you back? Fear.\n\nHaving new, more insightful experiences often means embracing uncertainty and forcing yourself to push the boundaries of your comfort zone. Success depends on the ability to lean just beyond your edge: in everything you do. With great risk comes great reward.\n\n**When is the last time you stepped outside of your comfort zone?**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1tkeub/what_is_holding_you_back/", "title": "What is holding you back?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MappingTheTerritory", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 60, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1387842058, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1tkeub/what_is_holding_you_back/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436096.4041398, "replies_charged": false}
