I also need straight As to continue within my intended major, and would like to try and follow the 1-3 hours of studying per credit per week which is recommended by colleges. I also want to be able to find time for myself, as well as find time for a social life and be able to work an on campus job. I know it is entirely possible and doable, but I'm just unsure what to do to make it happen. My idea was to wake up around 5 or 6am every day(2-3 hours before my first class), and study 2 or 3 subjects an hour each, then get breakfast before class, and lunch after, then study another subject at the library for about 1 hour, followed by the gym for an hour, then I would go to whatever job I would be working(probably school cafeteria), fir what would be a 3-5 hour shift, followed up by dinner, and another 2 hours of studying, but I fear this would cause a burn out. Should I just wait until the summer to get a job and focus on all other things above? Get in shape, get the grades, then worry about the rest when I have more time? How do I do all of this while also keeping my sanity, finding \"Me time\", and being social?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/emu33t/how_do_you_balance_school_gym_work_and_social_life/", "title": "How do you balance school, gym, work, and social life?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "randomusername02130", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1578676990, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/emu33t/how_do_you_balance_school_gym_work_and_social_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435257.4046488, "replies_charged": false}
