I tend to really clam up and get anxious around new people and I get this really agreeable persona to try to fit in. I find it really ends up having the opposite affect where I become boring and forgettable to the other person, and I\u2019m really unable to connect with others. Additionally I feel a lot of pressure constantly about where I am in life, what I should be doing, and what other people think of me, my actions and my life. \n\nI\u2019ve watched celebrity interviews with guys like Johnny Depp, Joaquin Phoenix, Tom Hardy, Jake Gyllenhaal, RDJ, etc and they all have this cool confidence about them where they\u2019re not scared of showing who they are and how they feel and it just looks so freeing. People actually respect them for acting that way instead of trying to fit in. \n\nI\u2019d love to get to that point but I don\u2019t know how. Any advice on reading I could do or any lifestyle changes that can help?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lknyar/im_struggling_with_being_comfortable_in_my_own/", "title": "I\u2019m struggling with being comfortable in my own skin and living life on my own terms", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "___needtoimprove___", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 18, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613425364, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lknyar/im_struggling_with_being_comfortable_in_my_own/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435946.7034457, "replies_charged": false}
