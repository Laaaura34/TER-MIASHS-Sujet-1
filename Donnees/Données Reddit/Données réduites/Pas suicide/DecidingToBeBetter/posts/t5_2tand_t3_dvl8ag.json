Just try your best and be yourself, and eventually things will just click. It doesn't make sense. I try my best. I be myself. It's still not enough. It's not enough to make me like the real people out there who can talk about social outings. It doesn't make me like the real writers who can talk about their friends and agents and things they're grateful for.\n\nIt's just..  what did they do to be good enough? I don't think there's some great injustice being done to me or anything. I just want to understand how to obtain what they have so I can start living a real life instead of this empty imitation of real life. This is no real life at all. And I don't really care about *feeling* better or becoming comfortable/complacent/accepting of who I am. I want to know how to become someone worth accepting, without trying to force myself into believing some nonsense about how my personality is already good enough. Sure, everyone is unique, but what do I need to do to become *the right kind of unique?*", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dvl8ag/when_does_being_yourself_and_doing_your_best/", "title": "When does being yourself and doing your best become good enough?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "NauticalFork", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1573613415, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dvl8ag/when_does_being_yourself_and_doing_your_best/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436063.619785, "replies_charged": false}
