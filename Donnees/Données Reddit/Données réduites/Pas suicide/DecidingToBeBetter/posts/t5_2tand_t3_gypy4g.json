Went to treatment then dove headfirst into 12 step groups and worked my ass off to improve my life and make a decent home for my family. \n\n20 years later I am desperate to stop a slide in my mental health and pot helps. I have been surviving mostly on therapy and weed for seven years. Then about two months ago I realize I am not getting the same relief smoking always gave me. So I just lose interest and stop. No treatment. No NA. No one begging me to quit. \n\nI\u2019m still hurting from chronic mental illness.  I\u2019m still embarrassingly fragile over life issues. But I don\u2019t see getting high helping me anymore. I would love to enjoy something as much as I enjoyed the euphoria of getting high. It\u2019s just not there anymore. My brain chemistry must have changed I guess. \n\nI am not proud of quitting or feel noble. I probably am posting in the wrong sub since there was no decision made. It\u2019s just a new stage in my life. It just makes me wonder what comes next. Life takes some weird turns. \n\nAnyone else have big changes happen without making a \u201cdecision?\u201d", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gypy4g/i_just_stopped_getting_high/", "title": "I just stopped getting high", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bill_bullock", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 28, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1591582471, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gypy4g/i_just_stopped_getting_high/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436380.9705997, "replies_charged": false}
