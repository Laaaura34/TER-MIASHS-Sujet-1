You also have the ability to change what you do not like. It\u2019s all up to you!\n\n2) Get rid of all negativity in your life - easier said than done. However, try your best to ask yourself if there are any people in your life that have a constant negative impact on you. How can you change this? \n\n3) Always make time for yourself - paint your nails, have a bath, do a face mask. You cannot help others if you do not help yourself first! \n\n4) Challenge your abilities - try something that you\u2019ve never done before. Do something out of your comfort zone. You must face your fears if you want to overcome them. \n\n5) Organize yourself - tidy your home, clean out your closet. Getting rid of things that you no longer use is the perfect fresh start. \n\n6) Strive to learn something new - nothing is better than picking up a pastime. Maybe try journaling for the first time. \n\n7) Positive self talk - a positive mindset is the key to achieving what you truly want in life. Negativity only brings hesitation and blocks you from achieving your goals!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fcjsem/how_to_sprinkle_some_happiness_into_your_life/", "title": "How to sprinkle some happiness into your life!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "babicherry", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 663, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1583186214, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fcjsem/how_to_sprinkle_some_happiness_into_your_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438003.7571282, "replies_charged": false}
