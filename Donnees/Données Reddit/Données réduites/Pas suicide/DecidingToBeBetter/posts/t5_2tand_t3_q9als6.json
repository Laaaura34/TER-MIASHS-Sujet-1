That bag would have disappointed someone who wanted Taco Bell, but his Uber Eats order had been for Jack in the Box. This wasn\u2019t just the wrong order, it was the wrong restaurant! I\u2019ve seen less sadness on a dog\u2019s face after getting neutered. \n\nAren\u2019t his words the perfect bumper sticker for life? Life doesn\u2019t care what we ordered. Doesn\u2019t care what we wanted, worked for, thought we needed, or put on our five year plan. How many of you had planned a bunch of travel for 2020? I did. I was going to take a different trip every month. I was going to finally visit Europe. And then COVID happened. That wasn\u2019t what I ordered. \n\nMy first reaction, as usual, was to complain and feel sorry for myself. For some strange reason this didn\u2019t help. It usually doesn\u2019t, but I wanted to try again just in case. Failing that, I found this advice from Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius: \u201cThe impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way\"\n\nLet me see if I can translate the latin: \u201cQuit your bitching, use this setback to your advantage.\u201d \n\nOuch. Point taken. In my case this meant \u201cOkay you can\u2019t fly to travel right now, but there\u2019s a lot of places in the US you can drive to that you haven\u2019t seen. Get on it.\u201d I could also apply the extra time to things I had been putting off, read more, you get the idea. The point is *it doesn\u2019t really matter what you ordered from life, what matters is how you use the cards you\u2019re dealt.*\n\nYou always have the choice to make the most of your situation or cling to the plans you made yesterday. And the former is always better than the latter.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s hard to find silver lining in the curveballs life throws us, I\u2019ll own that. Sometimes life absolutely sucks and things happen that are objectively bad. In those times I\u2019d encourage you to practice a virtue. What I mean is that losing someone you care about is awful, but it can be a reminder to cherish and be grateful for the ones you still have. Being stuck around unkind people is not fun at all, but it can be incredible practice for mindful observation of your emotions and ensuring you do not overly identify with the unhelpful ones. Not all hands you will be dealt are good hands. *But there is a constructive way you can play any cards you ever get, and it\u2019s your job to find it.*\n\nYou know what a curveball in life actually is? It isLearning something you didn\u2019t know before. Maybe Plan A was \u201cMarry Sally,\u201d but then Sally cheats on you. I would argue Plan A was actually a bad plan, but you didn\u2019t know Sally was a cheater before. Now you do. Your dream job wouldn't hire you for reasons you can\u2019t control? Business partner screwed you over when you thought they\u2019d always be there for you? All of these are Plan A\u2019s that had incomplete information. The curveball was just life giving you some facts you didn\u2019t have before, and now some other plan makes more sense. Don\u2019t feel like a failure because your first plan didn\u2019t workout. You know more now. It\u2019s okay to let go of yesterday\u2019s plans and make the most of what cards life gave you today.\n\nIt\u2019s good to have plans, but just know that life might have other plans. You might not get what you ordered, but you might also get something better. You can make the most of what you have or be the victim of your life story. What\u2019s it going to be?\n\n**Further Reading:** If this post resonated with you then I highly recommend Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. The Stoics are a charming bunch in that they give very practical advice and it\u2019s just as relevant now as it was 2,000 years ago. Life doesn\u2019t have to be complicated. This book taught me to make the most of the cards I was dealt, and it can do that for you too.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9als6/none_of_this_is_what_i_ordered_a_life_lesson_from/", "title": "None of this is what I ordered (A Life Lesson from Taco Bell)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MattTheMentor", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 20, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634385614, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9als6/none_of_this_is_what_i_ordered_a_life_lesson_from/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435073.475644, "replies_charged": false}
