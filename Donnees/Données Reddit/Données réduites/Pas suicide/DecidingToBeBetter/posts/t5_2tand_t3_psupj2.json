I am an alcoholic, averaging at least six beers a night. I am a gambling addict sometimes to the point of being broke the day after pay day. I stopped smoking but have replaced it with vaping even though my intention was to stop nicotine completely.\n\nI wanted to start exercising but have never gotten past more than a day of it. My mental and physical health is shot, I feel terrible all the time and have high blood pressure and anxiety with depression. I don't want to go to the doctor because I never have money and live in the US. (I am going later this week but have put it off for 3 years or more)\n\nI guess what I ultimately need help with is the fact that I have these moments in life where I know I want to be better, and care for myself. But days and sometimes hours later, my inner voice beats me down to the point that I give up, and go to find solace in the bad things. \n\nHow can I build myself up when I am constantly tearing myself down? \n\nI know a lot of you will tell me to see a psychiatrist, but i really dont want to, as i have no insurance and no money.
