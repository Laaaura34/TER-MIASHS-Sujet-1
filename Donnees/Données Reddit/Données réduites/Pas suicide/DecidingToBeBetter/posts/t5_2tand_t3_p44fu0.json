I\u2019m getting angry over nothing and I\u2019m doing everything to try and avoid it.\n\nI\u2019m doing Wim Hof, Transcendental Meditation, and it only works temporarily.\n\nI have an appointment for therapy but it\u2019s all the way in late September.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. I\u2019m really scared of what\u2019s going on in my mind and I want it to stop.\n\n**Edit (22:48 Monday 16/viii/2021)**: The comments have been so helpful. Thank you all. \n\nI got back into weight training and, let me tell you, once I do those reps, the pain in my chest goes away. Most importantly, all of those bad thoughts kinda just fade away as well.\n\nIt\u2019s insane. To think, all that I had to do was get off my lazy ass and just exercise\u2026\n\nI vow every day that I\u2019m going to do some form of exercise. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s just 10 mins or the full intended hour. I need this to keep me sane. This is no joke. I really need to make sure I exercise every day.\n\nMy experience with all those violent thoughts and fires in my chest was one of the most unpleasant experiences in my life. I don\u2019t want that ever again.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p44fu0/i_am_having_very_violent_angry_random_thoughts/", "title": "I am having very violent angry random thoughts.
