And another reason is that it's the Netherlands!!! People speak Dutch!!\nHowever Dutch teaching and learning materials are very rare. I have no idea where I could find thorough materials for my whole process of studying.\n\nIn terms of French, I learned some basic French for 3 months and just quitted to finish my highschool diploma. French materials in my language are easy to find; the learner's community is very popular and supportive, too. \nI know that learning any foreign language will be beneficial anyway but I'm a bit confused: why French when I will be living in the Netherlands for at least 3 years? And French seems to be a super challenging language. \n\nSo what should I go for? Please share your experience and some self-learning tips, I will be very appreciate! \n\nTLDR: I'm moving to the Netherlands for university. Should I learn Dutch (to communicate) or French (a seemingly easier path)?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ns27ft/im_gonna_learn_a_new_language_give_me_some_advice/", "title": "I'm gonna learn a new language: give me some advice!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "kkkaaatttyyy", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622803692, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ns27ft/im_gonna_learn_a_new_language_give_me_some_advice/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435441.3692815, "replies_charged": false}
