I'm not very social or very antisocial but I project a lot of confidence to cover up my insecurity. I'm scared to trust my gut and I don't know how to be spontaneous. Im overly afraid of consequences and I don't know how to let loose. Im uptight all the time and my whole life is becoming centered around self improvement. I want to stop overthinking everything I do and just be able to enjoy myself at a party or meet new people but all I do is just go to work and spend my time on my passions alone. I feel like I'm wasting this time of my life trying to do everything right  when I should just be enjoying myself but I can't even do that", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oohykc/i_dont_know_how_to_have_fun/", "title": "I don't know how to have fun...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Able_Remote_3616", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 37, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626838641, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oohykc/i_dont_know_how_to_have_fun/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436752.2663777, "replies_charged": false}
