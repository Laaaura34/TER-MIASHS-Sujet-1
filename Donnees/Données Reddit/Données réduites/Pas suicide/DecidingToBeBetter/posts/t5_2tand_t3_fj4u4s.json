I know that\u2019s the core reason as to why I feel jealousy over things others have and I believe acknowledging it\u2019s there is a first step. I\u2019m currently on the process of building up my own self confidence and embracing who I am and simply loving myself. What are some healthy ways to deal with jealousy? For example, I have tendency to compare myself with others but I tell myself that everyone is different and certain situations call for certain circumstances. And that everyone goes at their own pace. I try to remind myself of the good and fortunate things that are in my life and appreciate them. \n\nWhat are some other coping methods to deal with feeling bitterness and jealousy towards someone else or situations? I honestly hate feeling jealous, but like any other emotion, it\u2019s normal however, I\u2019d like to find better ways to deal with it and build my own self confidence to  have a better balance being happy with myself and happy for others instead of jealous. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of run on sentences I apologize. I\u2019m not the greatest at explaining myself but I hope my message comes across clearly.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fj4u4s/overcome_jealousy/", "title": "Overcome jealousy?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "jeswhale", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1584293024, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fj4u4s/overcome_jealousy/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436737.8676617, "replies_charged": false}
