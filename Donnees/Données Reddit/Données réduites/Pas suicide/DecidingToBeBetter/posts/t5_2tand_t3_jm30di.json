For example, if something is dirty and needs to be cleaned and there is someone else in the room, my brain goes \"If you clean up, and they see you do it, they will feel positive towards you. You know they will like you more for doing this, and if you do this right now, you're being manipulative. If you don't do it you're lazy.\" This applies to a bunch of other things including emotional expression and problem solving. \n\nI'm in therapy, but I would like some outside advice. \n\nThank you!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jm30di/how_to_stop_thinking_im_manipulative/", "title": "How to stop thinking I'm manipulative?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ExoplanetEspresso", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1604240559, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jm30di/how_to_stop_thinking_im_manipulative/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436521.283528, "replies_charged": false}
