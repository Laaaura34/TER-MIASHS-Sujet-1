I hope everyone is well. I\u2019ve struggled with some pretty rough depression over the years and it always reminds me of an ocean: it comes in waves, having high tides and low tides. On my low tide weeks, it\u2019s fine, nearly nonexistent even. It\u2019s fully manageable and I\u2019m able to do everything I want to do. On high tide days are when it tends to screw everything up. I\u2019ll get depressed and sleep all day, wake up and hate myself for doing it. I\u2019m lucky to have a support system, but they all day \u201cYou just have to get up and do it.\u201d And I genuinely can\u2019t figure out how to just get up and do it when everything seems so hopeless on my high tide days. I want to get better, I just don\u2019t know how. I\u2019m a college student so I shouldn\u2019t be sleeping through my classes or clubs or things, I should be enjoying this. Does anyone have tips to conquer my depressive episodes and be able to not let it control my life?\n\nedit: thank y\u2019all, seriously. and i\u2019m listening to everyone saying to talk to someone! it\u2019s just that sometimes these things happen when the therapist isn\u2019t around, haha. i felt really hopeless, like i was trying to solve a math problem that somehow everyone else knew, and you all really helped me work it out. i\u2019m super excited to try everything recommended.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1b5ek/i_want_to_stop_falling_into_depressive_slumps_and/", "title": "I want to stop falling into depressive slumps and learn how to manage them in a healthy way.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lawfullytired", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 895, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633370862, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1b5ek/i_want_to_stop_falling_into_depressive_slumps_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436946.0807114, "replies_charged": false}
