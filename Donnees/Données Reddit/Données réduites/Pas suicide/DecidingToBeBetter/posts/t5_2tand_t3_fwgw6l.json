I have worked most of my first  3 years out of college Holiday hires, part times even volunteer work. Something that my pervious  employers like about me was how willing  and ready I was to take up any challenge. \n\nAfter a few interviews I had finally managed to get a job at a TV station, it was the night shift. Most people  thought  it was the worst  shift cause I work all lone from 8 PM to 6 AM and had to work weekend and holidays. But I was doing what thought would  lead me to my career path. I would get called in to take oth shifts; my sleep was thrown  off but hey you start some where right. In just 6 months later I was fired. I asked my supervisor and coworkers what I may have done to have been fired but didn't get many answers. \n\nIt still crushes me today, ( suicide thoughts enter every now and then but I'm able to fight them off knowing their irrational thoughts.) I  lost what made me,  me and my opportunity to make a stable living for myself. I thought I was a hard worker and I though I  met the demands of my career. But what if I'm really  not good  at what I  enjoy. Did I  really  waste 4 year of college to be unable to meet the requirements of the industry?\n\n2 years now and I now have this crippling  fear and anxiety that I'm not and never will be a productive member of society. I'm a millennial who is a drain on their  family  a resource.And soon I'll  be competing with others who have more work experience and confidence in the work place. How can I get over this? What do I do? \n\nTLDR: How can I get over my fear of being a failure and just get a job to just be someone  normal again?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fwgw6l/i_was_fired_form_what_i_thought_would_be_my_life/", "title": "I was fired form what I thought would be my life long career.
