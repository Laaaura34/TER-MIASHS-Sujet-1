If I want to play a game instead of doing something worthwhile, I do it.  If I want to watch YouTube instead of preparing for work, I do it.  If I want to watch porn, I do it.  Even when I think to myself \"I shouldn't do this, I have other stuff that needs to be done\", it's usually not enough to dissuade me from indulging myself.\n\nAs a result, my dopamine system is out of wack.  I'm constantly \"rewarding\" myself despite rarely doing stuff I should be doing (exercise, housework, researching better work methods, preparing for work, etc.), so my brain just constantly procrastinates.\n\nI don't think quitting everything cold turkey is possible for me because I have no \"worthwhile\" hobbies at the moment.  So if I just stopped doing everything, I'd be sitting alone in my room.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mpxuog/how_do_you_teach_yourself_self_control/", "title": "How do you teach yourself self control?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Nowheretoturn48", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618301329, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mpxuog/how_do_you_teach_yourself_self_control/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437997.1056266, "replies_charged": false}
