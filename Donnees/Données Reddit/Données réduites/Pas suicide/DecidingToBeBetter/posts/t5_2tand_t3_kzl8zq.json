I (18F) have been dealing with personal issues, and i\u2019ve recently come to a realization that my \u201cfriends\u201d from high school aren\u2019t actually my friends, so this was the best decision to make, and is already such a huge progress for me as i\u2019ve had my twitter, snapchat, and instagram since 2014. I also haven\u2019t  left my house in 10 months, but today i finally did, and it felt amazing. \n\nI already feel much happier; it\u2019s like i have a huge weight off my shoulders. now i can focus on college, and have much more time I can put into my passions while simultaneously improving my mental and physical health.\n\nOriginally, i was going to leave and come back on instagram by my 19th birthday this summer, but i decided to do the full year as i truly want to get the full experience and benefits of quitting social media for a really long time. \n\nI will be starting a full time job next week, will continue to eat balanced and not relapse into my eating disorder, read+write more, run 6 days a week (unless my body needs a break), and buy my first car. \n\nIn a couple of days, i plan on maybe deleting reddit as well since i spend some time on here (i\u2019ll probably try to just manage the time i spend on here), the whole point of this journey is to use as much time as i can to try new things and be disconnected from the online world. \n\nHere\u2019s to a better year and me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kzl8zq/i_permanently_deleted_my_snapchat_twitter_account/", "title": "I permanently deleted my snapchat & twitter account, deactivated instagram as I don\u2019t plan to be back on that until the end of this year, and have started to run daily again.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "camr9435", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2351, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1610937634, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kzl8zq/i_permanently_deleted_my_snapchat_twitter_account/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435267.0286255, "replies_charged": false}
