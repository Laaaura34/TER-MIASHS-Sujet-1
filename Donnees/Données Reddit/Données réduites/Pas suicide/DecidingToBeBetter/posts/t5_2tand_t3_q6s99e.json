I never used it often but I couldn't bring myself to delete it, but I realised how the hell or why the hell would I want this especially as I get older.\n\nNow like I say, it is a bit of an impuse as I have tried to delete it a few years ago and ended up downloading stuff again but I don't want to do it anymore. How does one stop having a hoarding attitude? I just want to rid myself of this stuff from my hard drive, it serves me no purpose apart from feeding my addictions...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: thanks to everyone who commented, i'm a bit overwhelmed but please know that I appreciate every person who has replied to me since it gives me motivation that I've done the right thing!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q6s99e/i_deleted_my_500gb_porn_collection_one_step_to/", "title": "I deleted my 500gb porn collection, one step to being closer to the better person I want to be.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Icy-Marzipan-5522", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 576, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634062635, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q6s99e/i_deleted_my_500gb_porn_collection_one_step_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436749.3285327, "replies_charged": false}
