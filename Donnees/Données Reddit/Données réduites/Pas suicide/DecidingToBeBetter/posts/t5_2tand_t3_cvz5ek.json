As an example: After losing money in my investments, I know which investments to avoid. It is rightly said adversity and loss make a man wise. In adverse circumstances you can either flee or face up to the problems and deal with them. To take them on requires knowledge and understanding i.e. wisdom. This wisdom comes from experience, observation, trial and error and the counsel of others.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cvz5ek/adversity_and_loss_make_a_man_wise/", "title": "Adversity and loss make a man wise", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "world_citizen7", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1566878601, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cvz5ek/adversity_and_loss_make_a_man_wise/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437884.9539313, "replies_charged": false}
