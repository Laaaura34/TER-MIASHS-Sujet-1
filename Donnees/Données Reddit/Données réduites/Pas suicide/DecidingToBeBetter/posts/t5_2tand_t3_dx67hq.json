However they sent me the \u201cShow up for your annual or we drop you\u201d letter so I went.  I brought a list of topics and he was delighted I have agreed to start antidepressants.  (Family trauma, he treats most of my family\u2014mom, brother, Spouse).  Got a cortisone injection for my hip so I should be cleared to resume the elliptical in a week.  \nI had imagined an entirely different reaction from him.  All my own negative creation.  In reality he was BEAMING and kept saying \u201cthis is great\u201d.   \n\nSo weight is lowest in many many years, hip is getting treatment, and sertraline is the game  plan.  He even setting up a follow up phone call appointment, because he knows I won\u2019t show up at the office unless I\u2019m reasonably certain I am dying.  :). \n\nThis sub has helped me SO much I really wanted to thank you all.  Your stories and updates helped me advocate for what I needed\u2014and I learned that help was literally waiting for me to reach out for it. \n\nThanks guys \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c You are awesome in more ways than you could ever realize!!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dx67hq/went_to_the_dr_yesterday_made_a_solid_plan_to/", "title": "Went to the Dr yesterday, made a solid plan to move forward", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SlightlyCrazyCatMom", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1573906631, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dx67hq/went_to_the_dr_yesterday_made_a_solid_plan_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435312.3497155, "replies_charged": false}
