I\u2019m sort of feeling \u2018behind\u2019 in life, though I began surrounding myself with people that challenge me positively mentally, physically, and professionally. Instead of feeling jealous as to where they\u2019re at in life, I\u2019m finding ways to instead be inspired. I\u2019m finding that being challenged makes me uncomfortable, but I feel like I\u2019m growing in so many ways! It\u2019s AMAZING. It\u2019s also such a great practice to just genuinely be happy for people. I hope to inspire someone else one day, just like how all of the people around me right now inspire ME. \n\nCheers to getting out of our comfort zone + moving forward in becoming the person we envision ourselves as. :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n52aa8/choosing_to_feel_inspired/", "title": "Choosing to feel inspired", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LunaxMielx", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1620173229, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n52aa8/choosing_to_feel_inspired/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435873.260711, "replies_charged": false}
