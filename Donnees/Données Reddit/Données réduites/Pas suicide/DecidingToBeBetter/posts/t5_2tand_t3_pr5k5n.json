I am so glad I did it. I love that we live together now and I always wanted to move to another city even before I met him, because I was desperate for some distance from my toxic family dynamics because they were draining me. I know this was a huge step for my overall well-being. But it hasn't been easy. Yesterday I came to the realization with my psychologist that I'm struggling with adjusting. It was hard to admit that I'm feeling very lonely/empty and I missed the toxic household. I've been wanting to see my family, but more out of guilt of not being a good family member than for my own pleasure. I realize that's because it's the only thing I knew for a long time. I feel like I have a lot more space for myself now and I haven't really discovered what to do with it yet. It's overwhelming and it's a lonely place. I am trying not to get carried away by the guilt. I'm choosing for myself. I just don't know where to start.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pr5k5n/old_habits_are_tempting_but_im_not_going_back/", "title": "Old habits are tempting, but I'm not going back.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "vclae", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632047700, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pr5k5n/old_habits_are_tempting_but_im_not_going_back/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437735.2686372, "replies_charged": false}
