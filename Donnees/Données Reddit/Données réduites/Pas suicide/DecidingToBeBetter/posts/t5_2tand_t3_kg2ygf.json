The hospital discharged me after stitching up my wounds. They didn't offer me a room in the psych ward. One psychiatrist saw me for five minutes and just told me to break up with my partner. \n\nI don't know what to do with myself. I dont know where to begin to build again. \n\nI keep seeing people on social media being happy and healthy and I feel like such a loser.  \n\nI feel embarrassed for trying to kill myself and failing. But I also feel tempted to try again but do it properly. I haven't felt joy since before covid. \n\nHow did you pick yourself back up after a failed suicide attempt?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg2ygf/failed_suicide_attempt_dont_know_where_to_go_from/", "title": "Failed suicide attempt.
