As an adult, I find that the only joy I had is the process of getting what I always wanted (though I don't feel any joy from having or owning it).\n\nfor example, getting into a school or job that I wanted to. I was happy the moment I got in, but I put no effort in my time there. I got in, but I am not enjoying myself being there. As an aftermath, I don't set greater goals and stop working hard from there.\n\nThis beahavior also extends to my daily life. The moment I got a new laptop or anything I have wanted for a really long time (the time I spend justifying why I need it, and how much it will help with my learning, entertainment, etc). yeah, I was happy the moment I got it. But, I do not use it as often as I wish I did. It feels like I only bought it to give myself a peace of mind that I have it. Though, I don't use it.\n\nI want to learn how to treasure what I have and use it to set and achieve greater goals.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/paynyz/i_stop_working_hard_the_moment_i_got_what_i_want/", "title": "I stop working hard the moment I got what I want.
