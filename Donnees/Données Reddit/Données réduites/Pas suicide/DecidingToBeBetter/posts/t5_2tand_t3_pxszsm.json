It's helped inspire me to find out the center of my problems.\n\nMy problems started around when my father died I didn't feel a negative emotion about the whole thing for a long time. [Sadness and Grief] I wanted to be strong for my mom and brothers, I wanted it to be easy on them so I helped them be strong. I didn't open up because I was afraid I'd make my family feel sad that, was the last emotion I wanted them to feel. \n\nIt's been a bad few years lately ever since I'm actually dealing with it. I've only recently started talking with my family about these matters. I've been feeling better now that I'm doing the right thing. \n\nI look forward to keeping in touch I have a great feeling about my future.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxszsm/ive_figured_something_out/", "title": "I've figured something out.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "0LonesomeWanderer0", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632913264, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxszsm/ive_figured_something_out/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436276.31136, "replies_charged": false}
