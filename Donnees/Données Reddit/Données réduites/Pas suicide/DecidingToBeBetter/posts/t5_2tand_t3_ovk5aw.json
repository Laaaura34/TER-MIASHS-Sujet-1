I don't know how my life is going to change but at least I can say to myself in this life I worked hard towards a goal, and clawed myself out of a hole and got what I want. Yeah it was fucking tough, but finding your own direction and purpose in life is going to be one of the hardest things you have to do. For the people still on the race to the dream, I wish you all the determination within yourself!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ovk5aw/as_of_next_week_i_will_be_employed_full_time_in/", "title": "As of next week, I will be employed full time in my dream career!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tofudeliveryco", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 741, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627785491, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ovk5aw/as_of_next_week_i_will_be_employed_full_time_in/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436121.5222387, "replies_charged": false}
