Trying to weed out toxic behaviors and habits, trying to make myself into the person I need to be. Trying to forgive myself for past mistakes.\n\nAnd I feel like I've failed every step of the way.\n\nInstead of weeding out these behaviors, it feels like the fight against them grows all the harder. Instead of growing into the person I need to be, I feel 'stuck'; I know the things that are wrong with me, the things I need to change about myself, but it seems impossible. And there's just no way I feel like I can forgive myself for the things I've done.\n\nI've tried to amend all the mistakes I've made in my life, but it seems like I've just doubled them.\n\nI've been trying to read more, exercise more, drink more water and it all simply feels for naught. \n\nI just really, really hate myself, and I'm not sure what to do. It's like I've slid right back to where I was. I've been trying to be a good partner, a good child and grandchild, a good sibling...\n\nYet here I am, at 5pm, and I haven't gotten out of bed all day.\n\nI just wish I could start all over.\n\nI'm sorry for venting. I've decided to be better - but it's the getting there that's been so hard. I'm just so unsure as to what I can do.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/os931j/just_lost_19_years_old/", "title": "Just lost. 19 years old.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwawayimprove", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 36, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627336419, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/os931j/just_lost_19_years_old/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437391.8762822, "replies_charged": false}
