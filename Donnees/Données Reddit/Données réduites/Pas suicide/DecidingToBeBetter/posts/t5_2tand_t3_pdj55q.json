I\u2019ve been taking the day for myself which I never do and I\u2019ve been looking at classic cars/trucks online. Sometimes when I look at something like that I\u2019m really inspired by the style, it makes me feel creative and like maybe I could design something (tshirt, sticker, tattoo, etc) or even just do something like start a company or get a better job.   \n  \nBut I don\u2019t have money for a startup and I don\u2019t have much time for hobbies like that... it doesn\u2019t mean I can never do it but it makes it hard to start.   \n  \nThe thing is I\u2019ve almost started to avoid things like that that I like because I get too pumped and it goes nowhere. It gives me this ambitious inspirational feeling and then I sit there in it until I fall asleep or go to work or whatever.   \n  \nI hope I explained this passably well. I\u2019m just hoping to capitalize on this feeling instead of have it make me feel awkward", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdj55q/what_to_do_with_excited_ambition_and_no_moneytime/", "title": "What to do with excited ambition and no money/time?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Bushidough", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630189040, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdj55q/what_to_do_with_excited_ambition_and_no_moneytime/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438203.0356474, "replies_charged": false}
