You do so much for others, you are terrified of upsetting anyone, and none of them even know you are suffering. When was the last time you asked someone for anything?\n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a bad thing to help others. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s wrong to be selfless. But when will there be more in your life than saving other people? When will you decide that saying no to someone is easier than working yourself to death? \n\nDon\u2019t tell me that you know how to tell people \u201cno.\u201d  I think we both know you haven\u2019t done that in a long time. In fact, I bet you only do it when your plate is so overwhelmingly full that you have no choice. You only say no when you are stretched to your limits and it\u2019s not up to you. And what happened then? Did it shock you when the world didn\u2019t end? \n\nHonestly there aren\u2019t any \u201chave to\u2019s\u201d in life. There are choices and consequences. You don\u2019t have to wear clothes in public. You\u2019ll probably get arrested, but that\u2019s just a consequence of a choice. You also don\u2019t have to help everyone all the time. Maybe some people will get upset with you. That\u2019s a consequence. But do you want people in your life that hold you emotionally hostage? There are big consequences to never getting your own needs met too. Have you thought of that?\n\nIt\u2019s time to change. It\u2019s time to think about what you need and stop putting everyone else first. Lots of people are burning you out right now just because you don\u2019t know how to tell them no. You\u2019re hurting right now because you don\u2019t know how to tell them you\u2019re overwhelmed. And there\u2019s a lot of things you need to say that you hold back out of fear of rejection. You\u2019re suffering in silence and the only person who can help you is busy taking care of everyone else.\n\nIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve been there too. A lot of times I\u2019m still there. But we can take baby steps. We can tell people that we don\u2019t enjoy that thing they want us to do as much as they do. We can tell them how important this other thing is and we really want to do it. We can just say we need to recharge and we can\u2019t help them that day. You don\u2019t need to give a reason. But you do need to say no so that you can see what happens. You can see how the world doesn\u2019t end and practice standing up for yourself. This gets easier over time. You are not a bad person for having needs. You\u2019re not unkind for saying no. And you won\u2019t get better at this until you try it.\n\nThere\u2019s someone who needs you now more than anyone else. Someone in incredible pain and completely abandoned without anyone else who can help them. The most important favor you could ever do for anyone is taking care of yourself. If you burn yourself out then you can\u2019t help anyone. Now is the time to be there for yourself. The world can take care of itself while you\u2019re seeing to your needs. It will still be there when you come back. But if you don\u2019t take care of yourself then there\u2019s a lot of people who will miss you when you\u2019ve given away so much there\u2019s nothing left. \n\nLife is short. You can\u2019t get this time back. You\u2019re hurting a lot right now, and it\u2019s time to take care of you. Please take this chance, you have less left than you think.\n\n\\--------------------\n\nFurther Reading: If this post resonated with you then I highly recommend Self Compassion by Krstin Neff, PhD. Dr Neff\u2019s research teaches emotional literacy through mindfulness and compassion. When I better understood my own buried resentment and inner pain I could then offer myself compassion. And when you accurately see the pain you are in, you\u2019re in a much better place to stand up for yourself with others. If you can\u2019t see the fuel level in your car it\u2019s easy to offer people rides all day and get stranded together on the side of the road. If you really want to help others, helping yourself is a part of that.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mo3nlj/people_pleasers_saying_no_might_feel_rude_but/", "title": "People pleasers: Saying \u201cNo\u201d might feel rude, but never saying it feels worse", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MattTheMentor", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 166, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618057157, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mo3nlj/people_pleasers_saying_no_might_feel_rude_but/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436503.5398438, "replies_charged": false}
