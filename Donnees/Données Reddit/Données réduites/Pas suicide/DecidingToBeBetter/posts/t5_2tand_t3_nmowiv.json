More often than not they seem to come back.\n\nSocial media has a lot of uses. We can connect with people all around the world. Many communities (like this one) are great places to post in. We live in an unprecedented time where we can learn just about anything online.\n\nA lot of platforms are literally designed to be addictive though. Google \"social media\" and \"reward circuit\" (and/or \"dopamine\") if you're curious. Attention span can be affected in some people as well.\n\nEveryone is different, so do what's right for you.\n\nThere's a lot going on in the world right now. There has been a lot of misinformation online this year. The pandemic's effects on people's mental health probably hasn't helped matters. There seems to have been a rise in (excessive) negativity in a lot of subreddits I used to browse.\n\nI'm someone whose attention span is affected quite a bit by Reddit browsing, etc. It's just the straw that broke the camel's back. So I'm out. \n\nThere's a lot I want to do, and I probably won't get there if I keep spending my evenings searching for cat gifs.\n \nCheers.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nmowiv/social_media_and_its_effects_on_mental_health/", "title": "Social media and its effects on mental health.
