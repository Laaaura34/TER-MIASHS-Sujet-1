I engaged in very few social experiences, which is something I deeply regret. As an extension of this, my social circles stagnated while those of friends flourished as they entered relationships and joined student entities. Being an extrovert,all of this hasn't worked out terribly well since without social engagement, my mood tends to drop.\n\nThis last summer, I figured I would change that, this being my final year. I applied for on-campus volunteer positions to meet people, and I attended \"club days\" or whatever to see what was available. I even got to know some frat members, and joined a dating site because I figured fuck it, why not? But I never heard back from any of the jobs despite follow up attempts, none of the clubs or their social circles were of interest to me, 4th year is just too late to get a start on frat life, and online dating hasn't worked out.\n\nIn my head, I'm still sticking with my decision to do better, but in reality, I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I need some sort of outside stimulus to get me going, but I don't know where to find it. What else I can do to try and get out of this rut?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/2gfrdx/decided_to_be_more_social_but_my_opportunities/", "title": "Decided to be more social but my opportunities went away?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "FeelTheEffect", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1410762246, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/2gfrdx/decided_to_be_more_social_but_my_opportunities/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436557.8118188, "replies_charged": false}
