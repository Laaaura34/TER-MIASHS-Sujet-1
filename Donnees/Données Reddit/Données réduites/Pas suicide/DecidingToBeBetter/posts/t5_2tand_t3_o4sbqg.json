Basically I went through a breakup at the beginning of this year and to make it short and sweet I had every intention of settling down with this girl. Since the split we\u2019ve been very on and off and more recently decided to cut back most of our contact to 1. Decide if the breakup was the right decision 2. Help us move on (assuming that\u2019s what we decide is the right path forward).\n\nI thought that by now (5 months on) I\u2019d be ok, but I\u2019m definitely not, I\u2019m struggling a hell of a lot and I\u2019ve finally decided that even for a short period of time it would be sensible to look for a therapist who can allow me to just talk completely opening about how low I\u2019m feeling. It\u2019s new territory for me as I\u2019m very laid back and not much gets me down, but I can recognise that right now I need someone to talk to.\n\nSo yeah, I guess I just wanted to put it out there that I\u2019m trying to better myself by seeing someone I can speak openly with who isn\u2019t a friend or colleague.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o4sbqg/seeing_a_therapist/", "title": "Seeing a therapist", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "GBUK14", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624272276, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o4sbqg/seeing_a_therapist/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435283.5800264, "replies_charged": false}
