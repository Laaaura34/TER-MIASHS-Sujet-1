Outspoken and goofy, yet still sensitive and ready to listen. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m overthinking my identity and perpetuating existential crisis. \n\nThat\u2019s all, thanks.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qh1nyb/trying_to_forgive_my_past_self_and_reincorporate/", "title": "Trying to forgive my past self and reincorporate some of who I used to be into who I am.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "oddlylongnipplehair", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 31, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635355148, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qh1nyb/trying_to_forgive_my_past_self_and_reincorporate/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435216.2994566, "replies_charged": false}
