I am proud of myself as I am now, but the confidence I lack is tremendous. I hate being hairy and that made me depressed for so long and I barely accept it. I hate my genes, but there's literally nothing I can do about it.\nIt's time I accept my misfortune and work hard in order to get rid of the disturbances in my life. I will become a better version of myself, I will eat like a normal person does, cut out sugar 6 days a week, exercise, work on school and try my hardest to gain skills I can do on my own. No more excuses, no more 'maybe tomorrow'. The day is today, tomorrow is a different universe. I'm okay the way I am, but I have the potential to be better.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9u9wl/realization_the_start_of_a_journey/", "title": "Realization - the start of a journey", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "helenacchi", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634457067, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9u9wl/realization_the_start_of_a_journey/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436253.102497, "replies_charged": false}
