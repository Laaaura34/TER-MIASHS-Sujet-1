How do i even achieve it ? I am at a constant state of being stressed, i can never ever relax my shoulders, they are always stiff and heavy, i can never relax my jaw, i once needed to have my picture taken for my passport and it took me too much time to be able to kind of relax my jaw for the photograph as the photographer instructed. \nIm always at a state of being hyper and my mind is always in a scattered state, i get migraines from overthinking stuff at least 3-4 times per month and caffeine and other stimulants have no effect on me, it is as if im constantly in a highly caffeinated state. \nPlease everyone, help me understand how the hell am i supposed to get my life in order and my shit together, my constant tense state is interfering with basically every domain of my life, im currently 24 and i've been like this ever since i remember myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pce9m1/what_even_is_relaxing/", "title": "What even is \"relaxing\" ?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "simpoukogliftra", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630031470, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pce9m1/what_even_is_relaxing/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438033.8826847, "replies_charged": false}
