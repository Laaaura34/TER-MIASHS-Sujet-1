I often react to it trying to improve my posture, faking confidence, but in reality I really break down in moments like these.\n\nIt's accompanied by the feelings that I am maybe too skinny/thin, hence something is wrong with my body or that I cannot stand up properly and look really stupid while doing so. In fact, often at such moments if someone clicks my photos, I am often actually appearing stupid, making utterly stupid facial expressions. \n\nI am fed up. I wanna feel happy with myself. I wanna feel comfortable with myself and not look stupid, but I am totally clueless how to not look stupid, make stupid facial expressions, etc. How can I improve myself?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pi00cr/how_can_i_become_comfortable_with_myself/", "title": "How can I become comfortable with myself?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Able-Calligrapher-74", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630790695, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pi00cr/how_can_i_become_comfortable_with_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435933.779541, "replies_charged": false}
