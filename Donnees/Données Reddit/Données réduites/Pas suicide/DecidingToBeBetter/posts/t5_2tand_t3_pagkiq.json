Decluttering my feeds has been a process- but I know that media is food for our brain that we will internalize and take forward with us. Every choice we make lays down another brick in the path towards the future. Prequel memes, animals pages and advice subs (Looking at you AITA!) May have brought me joy, but mostly it was just a distraction. They stole my attention and time that I wish I could take back. Long term, they didn't bring me joy, they brought me disappointment in myself. They brought me further away from my goals and the person I want to be. \n\nAs of a few moments ago: I don't follow any subreddit unless it's actively associated with a hobby I practice, educational or centered around self improvement and bettering my life. I'm tired of all of my down time being spend melting my brain when it's capable of so much more.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pagkiq/its_not_enough_for_it_to_spark_joy_getting_rid_of/", "title": "It's Not Enough For It To Spark Joy: Getting Rid Of Time Wasters.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SickSwan", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 22, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629780694, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pagkiq/its_not_enough_for_it_to_spark_joy_getting_rid_of/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437290.9101648, "replies_charged": false}
