However even though I don\u2019t drink/do drugs or at least struggle with addiction in any way  , I still feel like I  have potential to be better . Currently I\u2019m a second year law student who is broke and doesn\u2019t know how to drive at the age of 22. \n\nI wake up feeling sorry and miserable for myself I\u2019m really tired of this toxic cycle I have with myself . I know I\u2019m better than this . However , I really struggle to make change and be truly disciplined . I have the concentration of a dying fish . I know nobody else can fix my issues except myself . But I feel lonely and don\u2019t really have many friends I can vent about my thoughts/feelings . Everybody that I have tried to be friends with wants me to change for them or let me just put the effort in the relationship, it sucks . I just want to vent like . I know the issue and how to fix it , but truly honest I\u2019m scared to actually do something good and win .  \n\nIt sounds weird I know .", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qarrho/22_bored_and_need_to_do_better_for_myself/", "title": "22, bored and need to do better for myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "smolmitsuki", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634578916, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qarrho/22_bored_and_need_to_do_better_for_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436441.4106631, "replies_charged": false}
