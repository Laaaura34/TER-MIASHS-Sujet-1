My lower back hurts..especially when I wake up.\nI cycle regularly and am active but have always had this underlying body pain that I cant simply decipher. \n\nAlso idk if anyone can relate but whenever I wake up, my face looks HORRIBLE. Not fresh but darker than my original skin tone, oily and like a zombie.\n\nWhat do I do with this? Should I start taking any supplements?
