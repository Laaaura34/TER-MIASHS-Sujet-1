In moderation this is fine of course, but it does mean that I buy more takeaways than i probably should and a lot of my income is on groceries. \n\nI  don't have any eating disorders or anything but I do comfort eat. This  has probably contributed to some weight gain over quarantine ( i was also unemployed, depressed & mostly sedentary until june, when i got a job which is a 15 minute cycle from my apartment) \n\nI'm 5'9 and last time i weighed myself (back in june) i was around 83kg (183lbs). I may have lost some of that through more excercise though. \n\nAnyone have any advice on non food based treats and dealing with my emotions in a more healthy way?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q41v09/how_to_find_non_food_based_treats/", "title": "How to find non food based treats?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Spoopyjello", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 20, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633712304, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q41v09/how_to_find_non_food_based_treats/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435963.7195885, "replies_charged": false}
