It really hit home recently when we got a new male co-worker who is extremely attractive and all the girls are over him. Yes, it's shallow, but fuck I wish I were attractive. Just having people interested in you based off of your looks is such a huge bonus. The new guy is also just a really cool person and while I'm not competing against him, it does make me jealous. \n\nI'm not ugly exactly, but no one would look at me twice or ever ask for my number out of the blue. I am skinny and I feel like if I were built better and weighed more I'd probably attract more women and have higher self esteem. I can get dates, I'm not a virgin and I've been called cute, fine, etc. Before but it's so rare that I just feel ugly most of the time. I don't stand out in anyway and it sucks. Especially at work because there's girls who I like who don't even give me the time of day, but as soon as Prince charming walked in the door they're all over him. I'm not mad because I get everyone has their preferences, but it's like no matter how good my personality is it doesn't matter because I'm not hot or sexy. \n\nAnyways how do I come to terms with being ugly or avarage? \n\nTL;DR: I'm ugly and want to know how to accept it and be happy while I'm ugly.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jgpk3a/how_do_you_get_over_being_ugly/", "title": "How do you get over being ugly?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Tricky_Movie5539", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1603467800, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jgpk3a/how_do_you_get_over_being_ugly/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435822.0581052, "replies_charged": false}
