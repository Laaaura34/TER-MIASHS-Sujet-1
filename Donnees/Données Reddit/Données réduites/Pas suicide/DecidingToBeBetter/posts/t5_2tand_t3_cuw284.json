Unfortunately, from learning their social patterns, I lost the ability to have negative interactions with people. It's always been a problem somewhat: as an empathetic person, I hate the feeling of knowing I've offended or hurt someone. \n\nBecause positive interactions aren't always best for obtaining goals: I may need to be able to be somewhat pushy to influence a deal in business, or even compromise on small things with a roommate on sleep schedule, or stand up to an obnoxious person, etc., I decided I wanted to learn how to be *okay* with offending people. Not that I'd go out of my way always offending them, but just be okay with it, so I'd have the option. The past two months have been that, and they've been just a tad rough: I left my internship over creative disputes with the boss, I'm in a group dispute with my group from marketing class, and I've been openly hostile with my roommate *only* when he refuses to compromise.\n\nNow, I feel I'm adequately comfortable with expressing and receiving negative feelings from people, and I want to balance that to still be helpful in the scenarios I mentioned, while still focusing primarily on positive and happy relationships. I'd like to hear feedback or related stories.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cuw284/learning_how_to_balance_negative_interactions/", "title": "Learning how to Balance Negative Interactions with People", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bdodo", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1566666574, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cuw284/learning_how_to_balance_negative_interactions/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435299.4899395, "replies_charged": false}
