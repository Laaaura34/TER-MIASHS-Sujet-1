But it's a fact of life that it's impossible to find this kind of eternal stability - we have to accept that life is actually pretty fluid. I don't think this is a bad thing, in fact I think it's a pretty beautiful thing. It's just sometimes we forget to treasure those moments of enjoyment when they are occurring.\n\nIn my opinion, in those moments when a person is really enjoying an activity, they are getting closer to what life is all about. It's in those moments of enjoyment that we're most *alive*.\n\nWhat things do you really enjoy to do? Don't underestimate the importance of those activities. I'm not saying not to be sensible and plan for the future, of course, do that as well. Just be aware that it can be quite easy to fall into the trap of missing the elegance of the present.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/56iexi/why_i_prefer_finding_enjoyment_to_seeking/", "title": "Why I prefer 'finding enjoyment' to 'seeking happiness'", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "brick_eater", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 49, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1475953115, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/56iexi/why_i_prefer_finding_enjoyment_to_seeking/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436337.8575, "replies_charged": false}
