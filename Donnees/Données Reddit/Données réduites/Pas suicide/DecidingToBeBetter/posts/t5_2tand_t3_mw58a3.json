I try to virtually meet at least 2-3 new people a week.\n\n90% of the conversations come off as business-purpose driven. It\u2019s either to learn about a subject matter area, brainstorm and discuss ideas, or provide insight on a topic.\u00a0\n\n**The remaining 10% are free-flow chats \u2014 these are the conversations I love most.**\n\nObviously, the lack of purpose can make it feel futile or awkward, but with the right steer, you can have great conversations too.\n\n\\---\n\n**Here are some case studies, principles, and anecdotes behind having a great conversation:**\n\nBe present, be curious\n\n>Brandon Stanton is the author, photographer, and content creator behind [**Humans of New York**](https://www.humansofnewyork.com/) **(HONY).**\u00a0He was named Time Magazine\u2019s \u201c30 Under 30 People Changing the World\u201d and has taken hundreds of portraits of people in more than 20 countries across the world.\n\nI recently listened to [Tim Ferriss\u2019s podcast, where he interviews Brandon Stanton and discusses his journey](https://tim.blog/2018/06/18/brandon-stanton-humans-of-new-york/) on the challenges and roadblocks he encountered.\n\nI\u2019d highly encourage you listen to it if you haven\u2019t already. It\u2019s a great anecdote on facing adversity, battling self-doubt, and following your passion.\n\nI\u2019ve listened to it four times. Start at **66:00** if you\u2019re short on time.\n\nBrandon started off with a goal: **to photograph 10,000 New Yorkers on the street and create a catalog of the city\u2019s inhabitants**. Along the way, he began to interview his subjects in addition to photographing them.\n\nIt took him 7 years to complete this project.\n\n**Today, HONY is a blog, Instagram page, published book, global brand, and much more.**\n\nWhat you\u2019ll immediately notice, is that the stories are real tear-jerkers. These are some of the most emotional and vulnerable stories \u2014 featuring people\u2019s deepest, darkest secrets.\n\nThe incredible thing is that Brandon typically learns these stories during his first interaction with them.\n\n**We\u2019re all familiar with the axiom:**\n\n>Empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight\n\nBrandon has exponentially increased our line of sight through HONY. He\u2019s managed to create empathy, humanize tens of thousands of people across the world, and paint a more accurate picture of humanity.\n\nIt takes an incredible amount of skill and dedication to do what Brandon has accomplished, and through thousands of conversations, Brandon has effectively mastered the art of connecting with strangers. He\u2019s developed the ability to empower people to be comfortable enough to deeply open up, in just 30 minutes.\n\nHow does he do it?\n\nIn Brandon\u2019s own words:\n\n>\u201cHow you get to that deep place with a person is\u2026 **Absolute presence**.  \nIt\u2019s being 100% there. You\u2019re not thinking in the framework of an interview. You\u2019re not looking at a list of questions. You\u2019re not thinking about your\u00a0next question. You\u2019re not thinking about how this person fits into your idea of them and what you know about them.  \n**You\u2019re 100%\u00a0there and you\u2019re 100% listening to them.** And your questions are based on the curiosity of what they\u2019re telling you, and nothing else.\u201d  \n\u2014 Brandon Stanton\n\nFor someone to deeply share with you, they have to be extremely comfortable in the presence of a stranger \u2014 somebody they\u2019ve just met. They have to feel you\u2019re truly interested, that you know them and care about them.\n\nHow can you apply this?\n\nNext time you\u2019re having a conversation with someone:\n\n* Ditch a comprehensive question list and framework; have initial questions or topics, then let it flow from there.\n* Let natural curiosity drive the conversation. \u201cHow\u201d and \u201cWhy\u201d questions are always great for digging deeper.\n* Practice empathy. Put yourself in their shoes and **truly** visualize what it\u2019d be like from their perspective.\n* Use [active listening techniques](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-active-listening-3024343) to encourage them to keep talking and sharing.\n* **Be fully present in the conversation. All that exists during the moment is: you and them.\u00a0Nothing else matters.**\n\nYour goal should be to create a safe space for conversation and sharing. Be fully present, and demonstrate genuine curiosity and interest.\n\n\\---\n\nAsk insightful questions\n\nI previously mentioned that it\u2019s **not** always about the questions and it may seem like I\u2019m contradicting myself. To clarify: questions are a tool to begin the conversation and explore deeper conversation topics.\n\nIt\u2019s about the quality of the questions you use to begin with. Ask **insightful questions.**\n\n**Insightful questions are questions that:**\n\n1. Prompt the person to think deeply about something\n2. Are relevant and reflective of the subject at hand\n3. Can ignite a conversation\n\nI consider Tim Ferriss the master of asking questions and I\u2019ve mentioned Tim a couple of times in my writing. I think he deserves a proper introduction:\n\n>Tim Ferris is an author, podcast host, and entrepreneur who focuses on performance, optimization, self-development, and business.  \nHe\u2019s the author of [4-Hour Workweek](https://fourhourworkweek.com/), [Tools of Titans](https://toolsoftitans.com/), and [Tribe of Mentors](https://tribeofmentors.com/) (all my favorite books!).\n\nThe idea behind his podcasts and books is that he interviews the world\u2019s top performers in various disciplines \u2014 athletics, business, science, mathematics, and so forth \u2014 and picks their brains on routines, habits, and behaviors\u00a0they use to optimize their life.\n\nHe\u2019s probably interviewed most celebrities and influencers that you\u2019ve heard of.\n\n>[Jamie Foxx talks about how Kanye blew up](https://tim.blog/2015/12/06/jamie-foxx/)  \n[Daniel Ek (Spotify CEO) discusses how to scale a company](https://tim.blog/2020/12/03/daniel-ek/)  \n[Naval Ravikant shares wisdom on general business, life, and happiness](https://tim.blog/2020/10/14/naval/)\n\n**Through hundreds of interviews, he\u2019s mastered the art of asking good, insightful questions. Often, this is the key to extracting wisdom from experts.**\n\n1. Here is the list of 10 insightful questions he asks in interviews:\n2. What is the book (or books) you\u2019ve given most as a gift, and why? Or what are one to three books that have greatly influenced your life?\n3. What purchase of $100 or less has most positively impacted your life in the last six months (or in recent memory)? My readers love specifics like brand and model, where you found it, etc.\n4. How has a failure, or apparent failure, set you up for later success? Do you have a \u201cfavorite failure\u201d of yours?\n5. If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it \u2014 metaphorically speaking, getting a message out to millions or billions \u2014 what would it say and why? It could be a few words or a paragraph. (If helpful, it can be someone else\u2019s quote: Are there any quotes you think of often or live your life by?)\n6. What is one of the best or most worthwhile investments you\u2019ve ever made? (Could be an investment of money, time, energy, etc.)\n7. What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love?  \nIn the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your life?\n8. What advice would you give to a smart, driven college student about to enter the \u201creal world\u201d? What advice should they ignore?\n9. What are bad recommendations you hear in your profession or area of expertise?\n10. In the last five years, what have you become better at saying no to (distractions, invitations, etc.)? What new realizations and/or approaches helped? Any other tips?\n11. When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, or have lost your focus temporarily,\u00a0what do you do? (If helpful: What questions do you ask yourself?)\n\n**What are the common threads between these questions?**\n\n1. They all require deeper thought to answer (can you answer any of these questions immediately?)\n2. They\u2019re all interesting questions that can spark off into a separate, deeper discussion.\n3. They all touch on the themes of growth, decision-making, and learning \u2014 which is Tim\u2019s domain.\n\n>**Jumping back to Brandon\u2019s technique, here are the 3 questions he uses to kick off the conversation:**  \nWhat\u2019s your biggest struggle?  \nHow has your life turned out differently than you expected it to?  \nWhat do you feel most guilty about?\n\nBrandon uses these questions as an entry point into the conversation. Often, he\u2019ll start with one of these questions and monitor interest signals from the person to decide which topics to dig deeper into.\n\nTim uses a similar technique. He kicks off with one of his questions, goes deeper into the idea, then brings the interviewee back out, and pivots into the next subject.\n\nHow can you apply this?\n\n1. **Create a \u2018question bank\u2019 of your favorite questions to use in different settings** (e.g. interviews, coffee chats, regular conversations) \u2014 continuously refine and vet this list.\n2. **Prioritize your questions** \u2014 if you could only ask 1 question, which would it be? Some conversations tunnel in one direction so I always ask my most important questions first.\n3. **Use \u2018How\u2019 and \u2018Why\u2019 questions to understand more deeply.** For any stories that involve change \u2014 whether it involves moving countries or changing jobs \u2014 I always try to understand the \u2018Why\u2019 \u2014 what sparked the change? And the \u2018How\u2019 \u2014 how did they do it?\n4. **Ask open-ended questions to keep it broad.** This allows the person to choose what they\u2019d like to talk about and signals what is most important to them.\n\nTie these principles together:\n\nDo your preparation ahead of time and understand what good, insightful questions are. During the conversation, be fully present and refer to these questions as needed. Remember that pre-meditated questions just serve as a tool to kick off the conversation into something deeper.\n\n\\---\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nI write about similar topics here [https://www.andrew.today/](https://www.andrew.today/)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mw58a3/how_to_connect_more_deeply_with_others/", "title": "How to connect more deeply with others", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mrjones51", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619099580, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mw58a3/how_to_connect_more_deeply_with_others/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436877.4176035, "replies_charged": false}
