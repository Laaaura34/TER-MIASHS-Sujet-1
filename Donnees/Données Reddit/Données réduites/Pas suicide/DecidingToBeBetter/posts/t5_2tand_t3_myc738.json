Idk why bout on a whim, I went to this store 5 below, it\u2019s like a dollar store but for slightly more expensive things.   Hence $5 or below.  I saw this journal that has prompts for everyday.   You\u2019re supposed to fill it out every morning waking up and every night before going to bed.   Has prompts like current mood, what I\u2019m looking forward to, what can I do to make the day enjoyable, etc. then the night prompts are like what did I do well, what did I accomplish, etc. \n\nSeems not my thing, I\u2019m not the target audience.  Really flowery cover and just seems marketed towards hippy peace flower girls.   I\u2019m a dude. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.  But I figured ditch the matcho BS and give this a shot.  \n\nAnyone have experience with one of these types of journals?  Hopefully another guy has but females more than welcome to share too.  Success stories? Tips? Etc?\n\nEdit:  small note, I bought it early enough in the day that I just filled out the morning part even though it\u2019s a few hours after I woke up.  Just putting down thoughts on paper does seem to put me in a better, more productive and positive mood \ud83d\ude07", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/myc738/anyone_have_success_with_journaling/", "title": "Anyone have success with journaling?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tyler_durden2021", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619369333, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/myc738/anyone_have_success_with_journaling/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438336.903524, "replies_charged": false}
