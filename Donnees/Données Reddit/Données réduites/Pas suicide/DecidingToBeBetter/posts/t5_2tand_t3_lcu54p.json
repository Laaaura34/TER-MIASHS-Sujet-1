Over the years, my anxiety got worse. I developed panic attacks. My anxiety is also affecting my relationship with my SO. I am seeing patterns in my thoughts, emotions and actions which I believe are formed by childhood trauma. \n\nI must admit: I am so terrified of going to therapy and showing my emotions. Terrified that therapy will not \u201cfix\u201d me. But I know that I can no longer let anxiety hold me back. I need to do this. For myself and also for my loved ons. \n\nNobody knows I\u2019m going tomorrow, except my SO. Now I wanted to share it with Reddit too. Hopefully this will make somebody go to therapy, someone who has been putting it off, just like I did. You deserve to get the help you need. \n\nThank you for reading.\n\nEdit: thank you all for the replies. It warms my heart to see people reaching out to someone they don\u2019t know. You all have given me strength in the moments I needed it most. My first appointment went well. I encourage everybody to make their first step to healing as well.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lcu54p/tomorrow_is_my_first_day_of_therapy_ever/", "title": "Tomorrow is my first day of therapy ever", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "oh-no-my-croissants", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 940, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612483295, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lcu54p/tomorrow_is_my_first_day_of_therapy_ever/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436464.3434043, "replies_charged": false}
