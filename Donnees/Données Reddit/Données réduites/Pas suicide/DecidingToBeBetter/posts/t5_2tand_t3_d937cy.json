Supposedly only anger and joy are our legit, accepted emotions.... what a fuckin' crock of short-changed shit!\n\nWhen was the last time you had an epic, messy, eyes-out bawling, raging, tear-flowing cry?\n\nWe are not machines. We don't do anyone any favors by \"staying strong\" in the face of everything we face in our world today. Holding in our tears is a short-term fix that serves very few in the short term. Long term, we cut off ourselves and our friends and family from our full human experience. \n\nNobody wants us to horde tears! Be tough, supportive, sure, but when life sucks, when we mourn for the state of the world and the challenges of our own lives, our familes' shit, and our own tragedies, we must emote or be doomed to festering pain indefinitely. \n\nI'm 43 and just bawled my eyes out throughout the whole movie of Deep Impact. It hurt, felt weird, and was kinda embarrassing. But wow - so cathartic and freeing.\n\nFind a way, even if alone like I just did, to FEEL your sadness. Only by feeling our strongest emotions can we process them and let them go to free ourselves for personal, emotional growth and freedom. \n\nCry on, my brothers.  \ud83d\ude0a\u270a\ud83d\ude2d", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/d937cy/gentlemen_i_speak_to_you_specifically_i_submit_to/", "title": "Gentlemen, I speak to you specifically.
