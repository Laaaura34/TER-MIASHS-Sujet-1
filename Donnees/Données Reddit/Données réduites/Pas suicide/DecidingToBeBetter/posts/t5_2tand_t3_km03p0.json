This in turn improves your overall mental well being. \n\nMaybe your goal isn\u2019t to lose weight. Maybe your goal is to get a better paying job. You spend every day learning about the job you want to transition into and study the habits of successful people at that job, study questions for the job interview, and if you consistently apply those principles, over time you may not only get the job you also would succeed at the job. \n\nMaybe your goal is to develop more meaningful friendships. Sure initially people don\u2019t open up to you but if you keep meeting those people and build rapport with them, over time your friendship deepens. Now sometimes it doesn\u2019t but that\u2019s ok as not everyone will like you. \n\nOver time, the self doubt and anxiety that has clouded your head disappears. You become so immersed in your new habits that you forget to think about what\u2019s wrong with you and you focus more on these habits.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/km03p0/when_you_consistently_focus_on_a_routine_to/", "title": "When you consistently focus on a routine to improve yourself, a lot of the anxiety, depression, and self doubt you may have had earlier subsides or disappears.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "nouseforaname888", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 27, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1609192890, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/km03p0/when_you_consistently_focus_on_a_routine_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438455.5444562, "replies_charged": false}
