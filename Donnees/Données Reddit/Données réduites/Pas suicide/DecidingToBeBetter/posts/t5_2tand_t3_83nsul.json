Because positivity is based on a productive outlook towards life, where as low self-esteem will cause you to constantly criticize yourself, which is totally the opposite of what we\u2019re trying to do here, that\u2019s why you have to build a strong sense of self-esteem first, so you can be happy and comfortable with yourself. This will help you a great deal in developing a positive perspective.\nAnother reason why you need to grow your self esteem is that you\u2019ll encounter a lot of challenges and difficulties on your way to building positivity. Having a fragile self-esteem will make it almost impossible for you to go on, because you\u2019ll be too eager to blame yourself instead of doing the opposite.\n\nTo Do : read the six pillars of self-esteem.\n\n**2. Stop being a victim**\n\nOne of the reasons people adopt a negative attitude is because they always see themselves as a victim of their circumstances. While some aspects of life are out of your control, a large portion can be changed by your actions and decisions, so stop blaming life, and start taking responsibility for your actions.\nLet\u2019s take a real life example : let\u2019s say you were a regular college student, then got a 9 to 5 job. But the thing is you\u2019re not quite happy with the outcome, so you start blaming the economy, your boss, maybe the college you were in\u2026etc. The list is endless, but the fact is that it was your decision that caused you to work on a that job. The whole scenario would have changed if you decided to do something different with your life, by taking a different decision, so how can you blame the situation that you\u2019re in, when you were the one who chose it in the first place?\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not saying that you\u2019re responsible for every single thing that\u2019s happening, but the fact is you\u2019re responsible for a large part of the situation that you\u2019re living right now.\nTo sum it up, you have to stop looking for someone to blame, instead take control of your life, and work to improve it.\u200b\n\nTo Do : stop complaining.\n\n**3. Find an objective that you want to achieve**\n\nThis is as true for positivity, as it is true for success in general. You need to have a goal, something to strive for, to fight for, something that you really want to achieve. This will help you because having some kind of target will generate willpower, which in it\u2019s turn, will help you to stay on track, because once you decide that you want to attain a certain objective, and you stick with it, it\u2019s really hard to give it up.\n\nTo Do : find a purpose.\n\n**4. Find some inspiration**\n\nIn order to gain long lasting positive outlook, you\u2019ll need more than willpower and conscious effort alone, that\u2019s where inspiration comes in. Inspiration means feeling something that your words can\u2019t really describe, but you feel like you can do absolutely anything you want, and no one can stop you.\nIf you want to gain inspiration, success stories are an excellent way to do so. There are so many examples of people who challenged the world around them, and eventually managed to succeed against all odds.\nRead as many success stories as you can, you\u2019ll start to notice something common between all of those achievers, it\u2019s that they weren\u2019t blaming anyone, they decided to take action instead, because constantly criticizing never solved anything, but also because they knew that the way they think can change the outcome that they get.\nEven fiction can work as a source of inspiration. Having someone that you can look up to will help you to be more positive, that\u2019s the idea\n\nTo Do : Read success stories\n\n**5. Stay away from negative influences**\n\nWhether it\u2019s some place where you feel uncomfortable, or people that are too depressed, make sure you stay away from these negative factors, because trying to become positive under these situations is an uphill battle really.\nThe next thing you should watch out for is surprisingly watching the news everyday, because news have been related with feeling negativity, because of the constant flow of negative information that\u2019s broadcasted.\nThe main idea is to distance yourself from anything that makes you feel depressed and helpless.\n\nTo Do : Eliminate any negative influences in your life\n\n**6. Recognize the difference between realistic and pessimistic**\n\nWhen first trying to become more positive, you\u2019ll encounter a lot of resistance from nearly everything and everyone, we warned you earlier. However, a lot of people will try to convince you to be more \u2018realistic\u2019, when in fact, it\u2019s just an excuse to justify their inaction.\nYou should avoid falling in this trap at all cost. Here\u2019s the difference between realistic and negative : realistic is based on what people think they can achieve, what seems reasonable. Negative means thinking that you can\u2019t do something that\u2019s realistic, in other words realistic, a realistic attitude offers more possibilities than a negative one, yet it shuts a lot of possibilities that are still attainable.\nThe problem is that a lot of people tell you to be realistic, when they really want you to be pessimistic, simply because they don\u2019t realize their true potential, and that\u2019s not wishful thinking, it\u2019s a proven fact from thousands of success stories around the world. What most people don\u2019t realize, is that this \u2018realistic\u2019 attitude isn\u2019t based on what we can do, it\u2019s based on what has been done before by others. So being realistic isn\u2019t much helpful. I mean, what\u2019s the point of doing what millions of people did before you? On the flip side, being positive is closer to reality, because it focuses on what you can do, instead of focusing on what seems \u2018reasonable\u2019 or \u2018easy\u2019. Bottom line, being positive allows you to reach your full potential, whereas being \u2018realistic\u2019 imposes self-limiting beliefs.\n\nTo Do : Don\u2019t confuse being \u2018realistic\u2019 with being \u2018pessimistic\u2019\n\n**7. Start focusing on why you can**\n\nWe all tend to see the dark side of life, and while there\u2019s one for sure, there\u2019s also a positive one. We all have this big mental barrier that always stops us from seeing the good side of the situation, but at the same time we\u2019re glad to complain about all the things that we don\u2019t like. The really common misconsception here is that when you try to think of some reason why you can do something, it seems so far out of reach, it feels like you\u2019re making stuff up, like all the \u2018positive\u2019 thinking is just an illusion, where in fact it isn\u2019t. People always percieve being positive with wishful thinking, the difference is that a positive person knows what\u2019s in his favor and what\u2019s not, where wishful thinking is just plain imagination, there\u2019s nor action involved.\nYou have to start thinking of all the reasons that make you capable of coping with life. Start saying I can do this because\u2026\u2026I\u2019m smart, I\u2019m resourceful, I\u2019m confident\u2026.etc. The thing is, you have a lot of qualities. Seriously, I\u2019m not saying that just to make you feel better. You may not see them because maybe you\u2019re always critizing yourself, maybe people always put you down or anything like that. The lesson to learn is this : you have to change the way you see the world, start evaluating what can help you, what are your strengths, what are your advantages, these are all reasons why you actually can achieve what you want in life, so go for it.\n\nTo do : look for the things in your favor\n\nThat\u2019s it for positivity, I hope this helps you to dramatically change the way you think and approach life.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/83nsul/7_ways_to_develop_a_positive_attitude/", "title": "7 Ways To Develop A Positive Attitude", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "rafikGk21", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 200, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1520786456, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/83nsul/7_ways_to_develop_a_positive_attitude/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436534.668162, "replies_charged": false}
