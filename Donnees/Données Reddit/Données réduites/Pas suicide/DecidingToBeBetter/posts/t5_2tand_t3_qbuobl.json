I picked on every part of me because they were flawed, or so I thought \n\nAbout 4 weeks ago I went to the dentist for a checkup. And it happened to be that I would be getting a root canal(still in the process). That was an awakening for me that I had to get up. \nThe reason being was because I had intentionally let my teeth root because I felt no worth. Absolute worthlessness, you wouldn\u2019t even know cause I would always cover it with the jubilated self that I was. \n\nRight now the process is BIG. \n\nI\u2019ve cut my everyone out of my life. And I just want to start over. I just want to see that person because all the hate. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to do it but I\u2019m going to do it. \n\nI also pray and read my Bible. God has become my best friend \ud83d\ude0c\u263a\ufe0f. \n\nToday while looking at myself in the mirror, I was about picking on myself, I immediately reprimanded myself not to.\n\nLike I deadass said \u201cdon\u2019t you dare\u201d \ud83d\ude02 \n\nFeeling whole is not the end result it\u2019s the journey that makes everything worth it. Knowing so well that the pain doesn\u2019t last forever gives me hope. \n\nWhat inspired me to write this was reading about everyone\u2019s journey, and the GROWTH. \nTHE GROWTH. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd yassssssss. \n\n\nI\u2019m so happy that I\u2019ve found a community where I feel safe. \ud83d\ude0c\u2764\ufe0f", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbuobl/its_a_wierd_transition_for_me/", "title": "It\u2019s a wierd transition for me", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Academic_Fishing", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634711872, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbuobl/its_a_wierd_transition_for_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437352.4558682, "replies_charged": false}
