He's just doing his job. He's a pretty great guy in general.\n\nI know all this. But I can't calm down. One WhatsApp message and my pulse spiked. I just saw his name, that my name was the first word of his message... And my heart rate jumped. It's like a fog settled in as I braced for the worst. I know I shouldn't but even his constructive comments are making me panic and defensive. \n\nToday the office is closed and still he's working on something I needed him to do. I'm miles away from him or the office. And yet, I'm hurting. I know this is irrational but I don't know how to accept this.\n\nPlease help. I need to move past this anxiety and defensiveness. It's been 2 years already and I'm still not comfortable with him.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/afw07s/need_advice_cant_calm_down_after_bosss_comment_on/", "title": "[Need Advice] Can't calm down after boss's comment on my work", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "asriva94", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1547473999, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/afw07s/need_advice_cant_calm_down_after_bosss_comment_on/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435796.5641747, "replies_charged": false}
