Normally I\u2019d fall into a slump and never bounce back. \n\nBut not today. I am guilty of letting it affect me for a while, but I got up and let myself gain back my confidence. \n\nI put on an upbeat playlist and started doing a mix of dancing and working out. Then, I fueled my body with protein. \n\nAnd now, I\u2019m finding pictures that I took and thought I looked cute in and adding some motivational quotes onto them so I can look back on these and remind myself to be confident. \n\nI\u2019m not the most attractive, but I\u2019m certainly not that ugly and I have to remember that.
