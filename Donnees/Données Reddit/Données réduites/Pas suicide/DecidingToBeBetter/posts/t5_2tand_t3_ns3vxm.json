I fucked up my final paper and didn\u2019t even leave the country (I\u2019m not in the US or UK). Yes, I retook the paper again, but got lower results without the help of teachers. \n\nI\u2019m envious of everybody that made it to a good university. I bet they feel really secure about they\u2019re future. Here I am worrying about my results and getting turned down by student clubs left and right. It\u2019s not fair. \n\nI want to feel happy about myself; like I\u2019m the main character of a story, but now, when everybody starts to overshadow me in achievements, it feels like I\u2019ll be relegated to the sidelines and won\u2019t enjoy life to the fullest. \n\nWhat do I do? I don\u2019t want to keep feeling like this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ns3vxm/i_want_to_feel_proud_of_myself/", "title": "I want to feel proud of myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwaway56475674", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622809527, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ns3vxm/i_want_to_feel_proud_of_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437303.1031141, "replies_charged": false}
