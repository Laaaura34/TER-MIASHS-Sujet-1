Like even if I was making six figures (I know), I'd still be frugal and worried about being poor and living pay check to pay check. I work hard at my current job and scoop up as much extra hours as I can without murdering my studies. I've made a couple thousand in four weeks but I still am terrified of being poor (now and in the future). \n\nMy fear of money is consuming me. I've even considered going into high paying jobs just for the money (bad, I know) bc I'm that afraid, even though I know it'll never be enough. \n\nHow can I change this mindset? \n\nThank you all,\n\nGhost", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ng7ve7/deciding_not_to_be_obsessed_about_money/", "title": "Deciding not to be obsessed about money", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "GhostKingThrowAway", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1621435786, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ng7ve7/deciding_not_to_be_obsessed_about_money/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436616.4293354, "replies_charged": false}
