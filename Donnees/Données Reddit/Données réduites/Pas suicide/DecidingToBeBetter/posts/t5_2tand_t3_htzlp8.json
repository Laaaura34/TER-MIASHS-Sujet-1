I believe that this has impacted me in many negative ways, one of them being that I don\u2019t know how to put actual hard work into things. I\u2019m used to the fact that my minimal effort is sufficient to go by.\n\nI just did significantly worse than I expected on my university entrance exams. This has been a wake-up call of sorts. I know what my potential is, I just never developed the skills to realize it. I want to learn how to:\n\n\u2022 \u201cforce\u201d myself to do things which are not immediately pleasurable.\n\n\u2022 actually stick to new habits.\n\n\u2022 effectively manage my time.\n\n\u2022 make better decisions in high stress situations.\n\n\u2022 become a fast thinker and a better problem solver.\n\nI would appreciate any form of pointers. Books, YouTube videos, personal experiences, activities I could take up. Thank you\n\n\nEDIT: The response has been overwhelming. Thank you all so much for taking the time to give me such intricate advice. I have started reading Atomic Habits, which a few of you mentioned. I had already identified the habits I wanted to implement, but I\u2019ve been trying to do them all at once, which I\u2019ve learned is a mistake. So I\u2019m currently trying to meditate daily, cut out white bread/pasta, fix my posture. I\u2019m also trying delayed gratification (thanks for mentioning) to decrease my daily screen time. I\u2019ll be sticking around in this wonderful community.
