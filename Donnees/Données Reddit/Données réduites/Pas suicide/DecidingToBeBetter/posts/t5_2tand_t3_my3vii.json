The problem is that everytime I try something new or when I try to be positive, it feels fake.  I feel like I'm only ''playing'' the girl who is positive. I don't know how to to explain it, I've never been good expressing my feelings. For example, when I try to do morning affirmations or journaling, even if I'm writing something good, I have a voice inside my head saying things like ''why you do this?'' ''you don't even believe what you're saying'' '' it means nothing'' etc. I end up disapointed with myself and giving up the self care thing. Does anyone feels kind of the same?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, I'm sorry for the bad English. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nReading all the post and comments here really made me feel welcomed and safe.
