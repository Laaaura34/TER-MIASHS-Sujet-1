I messed up school really bad when my dad passed and ended up failing two semesters. Straight F's for 8 classes. I wasn't sure I was going to be able to go back, but I switched majors and got academic forgiveness and now have a 3.8 overall GPA. On my way to my Masters of Counseling and finally feel like I'm on the right path in life. I just wanted to share my joy with the people of Reddit and let you know with hope and perseverance you can achieve anything you want.
