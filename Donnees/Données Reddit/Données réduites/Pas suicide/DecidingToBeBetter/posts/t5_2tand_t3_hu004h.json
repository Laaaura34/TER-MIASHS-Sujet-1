I feel like I am getting more calm and put together, and am learning to accept and get through some bad feelings instead of desperately (and unsuccessfully) trying to push them away.\n\nThanks to everyone on this subreddit for keeping me inspired, and I strongly recommend meditation to anyone and everyone! \n\nHopefully this post can inspire someone else to try to learn how to calm down, just like someone else's post did for me. I don't remember the username of the person posting it, but they really did do me a huge favor and I'm very grateful.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hu004h/just_finished_my_first_successful_weeklong/", "title": "Just finished my first successful week-long meditation streak after inspirationfrom this subreddit", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "kdjtufe", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1595163051, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hu004h/just_finished_my_first_successful_weeklong/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436527.7152026, "replies_charged": false}
