If I saw another kid hanging out with their friends or if another one were more talented than me in something, anger and sadness would bubble up and overtake me. Outside, I\u2019d appear . If I happen to be \u2018better\u2019 than someone for even just a little moment, my self esteem would rise up and I would feel like I\u2019m at the top of the world special, too good for anyone. If something contradicts that, I come crashing down, feeling undesired. I remember once snapping at my little cousin for hanging out with the other girls, I was spitting out \u201cI hate you\u201d\u2019s while he stared at me back with those naive eyes. I had to go home after that, and my parents comforted me by letting me buy Minecraft.\n\nI\u2019ve never really been close with anyone, because I\u2019m so caught up in my inner hatred and I\u2019m demotivated to even work on my social skills. Nobody really talked to me in school and I wasn\u2019t even the one to pursue the relationship with my best friend of 4 years. I think I\u2019m only further hurting her by letting her stay with me. \n\nI\u2019m dysphoric about my presence, and self conscious on how I appear. Recently I\u2019ve been spending more money on clothes so I can appear how I want to appear. But I look at the mirror and see a super skinny and short good-for-nothing impostor. I\u2019m very perfectionistic but I\u2019m never satisfied. I look at the world and see so many unforgivable flaws. That\u2019s why I\u2019d wallow in my inner world where I control every aspect and tinker it to \u2018perfection.\u2019\n\nMy real colors are so ugly. Under my humble exterior, I see a storm of swarming hatred, deep-rooted envy, selfishness, and self-loathing. Even in those moments of bliss where everything looks to be going right for me and I feel confident, it\u2019ll all just fade away eventually and I\u2019ll be back to square one. I\u2019m so deeply unhappy that thoughts about jumping off a building and hanging myself are beginning to plague me. I\u2019m drowning deeper in my bubble.\n\nI\u2019m so scared of my future, and I\u2019m scared if I\u2019ll let the hatred get to me and do impulsive bad things towards people. What steps should I take so I can ensure I don\u2019t fall deeper than I already am?
