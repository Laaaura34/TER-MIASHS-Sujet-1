I have a lot of motivation the day before but once the next day comes the excuses pile up and I don't do the thing I wanted to do. \nI want to get back into excercising because it helped my overall mental health. The thing is... I'm afraid to be seen alone. Especially while learning new things because I get embarrassed and don't want to be stared at as a clumsy woman. \nI bought new inline skates a week ago but I only got the courage to practice in my garage and with my boyfriend. I'm sick of waiting for people who will have the same motivation to spend time on getting better.\nI need to learn to be comfortable on my own so I decided today to go out 3 times a week. On my own or with a friend but I have to go at least 3 times. I needed to write this down to keep myself accountable.\n\nI'm gonna collect all my courage right now and find a spot with minimal people so that I can go out there and finally be outside on my skates for the first time on my own.\n\nAll encouragement is welcome because I'm scared...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nkpmwm/finally_decided_to_take_action_and_get_over_the/", "title": "Finally decided to take action and get over the anxiety of doing new things on my own!
