I've been journaling for more 2 years now, but this is the first time I'm actually recording my own anxiety in full detail, and I realized how toxic and negative my entries have been.\n\nSo, I decided to change the way I write my entries. First, I got into scrapbooking. I am starting slow at first, only pasting little colorful memo pads here and there plus stickers, and I am writing *all* of the good things that I've noticed or have happened to me every day in those memo pads. They don't have to be big deals; sometimes I write about how I loved ending my day with a cup of hot chocolate. But I believe it's important that I take note of those *and* highlight them for myself so I am always reminded that even in my worst day, there's still something to smile about, big or small.\n\nIt has been really wonderful for my mental health.\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for the silver! This is my first award ever. I hope you are all having a positive day. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you so much for all the awards. I hope everyone is having a great day!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mxcrnh/i_realized_im_only_journaling_about_the_bad_stuff/", "title": "I realized I'm only journaling about the bad stuff so I made the decision to highlight the good stuff, too.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "chrwiakgjw462q1", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 856, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619239202, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mxcrnh/i_realized_im_only_journaling_about_the_bad_stuff/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436964.582623, "replies_charged": false}
