This is quite sentimental for both of us but i\u2019m getting tired of just snapping our faces rather than having meaningful conversations online. Obviously we have some actual conversations on text and snapchat etc, but i just feel like i need to end our streak for us to be able to grow and mature. Can anyone help me with this because i\u2019m struggling to let go of the sentimentality. (i deleted snapchat last night and we will probably lose it by tomorrow but i keep getting an urge to just log back on and snap him!)
