I never knew that was a thing. If I did say no, it was backed up with a huge reasoning why, a justification so someone else would fully understand why I was saying no. And it always involved an \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d \n\nI realized my constant proclamations of \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d took me out of my power. I wasn\u2019t sorry for doing what was best for me but I was ashamed of admitting that. I had an overwhelming guilt associated with looking after myself due to a lot of reasons that were all based in old beliefs. I let everyone else think that they were the priority and that doing what worked for me even if it was inconvenient or not good for someone else needed justification or was something I should be sorry for. It\u2019s not. \n\nBoundaries seem complex but they\u2019re not. When I first learned about them, I decided to set them. And then i broke them, over and over and over again. I still do sometimes but now I\u2019m aware of it almost immediately.  It does take effort to undo years worth of toxic habits but ultimately, it is a choice if you are aware enough to set boundaries in the first place and are committed to them. \n\nI used to get frustrated because \u201cpeople were crossing my boundaries,\u201d but it\u2019s not their job to uphold or respect them, it\u2019s mine. I am the only one with power here. I can voice them to another person but they don\u2019t have to go along with them.\n\nRealizing this has kept me accountable for my own life and got me out of a victim mindset and into an empowered one. Keeping my boundaries has helped me in so many ways. Any uncomfortable feelings that arose from initially setting them has gone away and I am left with a peace I didn\u2019t know before. And once you set one, and uphold it, it gets easier to set more in a healthy way. \n\nIt\u2019s not about closing yourself down, but protecting your own energy and needs. It\u2019s about saying yes to what fuels you and no to what drains you. And it\u2019s super possible, as long as you hold yourself accountable for them.\n\n\n__ \n\nEdit: it has been helpfully pointed out there are times where this doesn\u2019t apply such as violations of physical boundaries. You are not to blame if this happens to you and this does not apply to those circumstances.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfea2i/setting_boundaries_and_keeping_them_is_your/", "title": "Setting boundaries and keeping them is your responsibility.
