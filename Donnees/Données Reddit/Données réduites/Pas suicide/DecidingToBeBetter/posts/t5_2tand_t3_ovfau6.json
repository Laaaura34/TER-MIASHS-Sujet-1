I feel like this is progress. I used to pay very little attention to the audio and now I feel a little more in control than usual. I am getting a little bit closer to make my concentration better.\n\nI guess this is very little progress but I'm proud of me. \n\nI am going to sleep now and I feel extremely relaxed. \nGod bless guys. Can't wait for day 5.\n\nPeace.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ovfau6/day_4_100daysofmeditation/", "title": "Day 4 - #100DaysofMeditation", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "InfernalEagle786", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627766431, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ovfau6/day_4_100daysofmeditation/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435552.1175199, "replies_charged": false}
