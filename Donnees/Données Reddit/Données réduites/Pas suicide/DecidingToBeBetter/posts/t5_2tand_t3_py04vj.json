Sometimes you just need to state things \"outloud\" in order to own your issues make yourself accountable to working on them, right? \n\nAnxiety has been a problem my whole life. I always thought I would grow out of it but the truth is I never have and it is probably something that I will always need to be on guard about because it causes overwhelm and complacency in me that gets in the way of every single life goal/dream I have for myself. I often feel defeated and mentally weak because of it. \n\nI am going to start looking for a way to get back into therapy. I am going to try to figure out a game plan to address the anxiety when it happens instead of just hoping it won't happen again, or that it won't get worse. \n\nThanks for reading.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/py04vj/stating_my_intentions/", "title": "Stating My Intentions", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "CallOfTheTriforce", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632936028, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/py04vj/stating_my_intentions/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436017.8052251, "replies_charged": false}
