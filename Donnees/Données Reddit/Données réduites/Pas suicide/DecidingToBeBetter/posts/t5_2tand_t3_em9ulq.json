It sounds kind of cynical, and I don\u2019t really like regret in general because I think it\u2019s a waste of valuable inner-peace and headspace, but I do think there is something to learn from it. \n\nI have never, not even once, regretted going to a yoga class. No matter how sore I am after, no matter how much it\u2019s a struggle to get through it, there\u2019s always an upside. I feel accomplished knowing I\u2019m doing something for myself that helps my physical body, quiets my mind, and is aligned with my spiritual practices. \n\nI\u2019ve never regretted taking the time to write - whether that be journaling, something to share, or parts of a book i am working on. Taking a look back at what I\u2019ve written always makes me smile. Seeing the words that were stuck in my head or in my heart on a page or on a screen helps me a lot. Knowing I\u2019m accomplishing something that I think is part of my greater purpose helps propel me forward. \n\nI\u2019ve never regretted getting up earlier to make celery juice because it helps me. I\u2019ve never regretted eating a healthy breakfast, meal prepping for the day, drinking enough water, etc. These things give me so much energy. I\u2019ve never been upset that I\u2019ve had \u201ctoo much energy\u201d. \n\nI think you get the point now. I\u2019ve spent so much of my time in regret because I haven\u2019t done these things. And I know i would be in a very different place if I\u2019ve consistently kept up with them from the time I started the rituals of doing them. I feel like I could be way more successful had I just done them when i didn\u2019t feel like it but knew it was best to follow through anyway. I\u2019m not mad at myself, and I do think theres divine timing, and I had to learn a lot of lessons, but I also know there\u2019s a lot more I could be doing that helps me feel good and a lot less i could be doing that\u2019s self-sabotaging or counterproductive. \n\nUsing the question: will I regret doing this or not doing this more? has been monumentally helpful recently. I\u2019ve followed this before and was moving along life very smoothly. And then I forgot and fell back into old habitual patterns of doing the bare minimum and wondering why I was so miserable. In life, we experience both ups and downs, ebbs and flows, and we don\u2019t have to beat ourselves up for it. Having compassion and love for who we are, who we were, and who we could be is of utmost important. But pushing ourselves to be better is also how we progress and grow. And I find asking this question and taking action based on the answer is pushing me into new levels and higher territories. \n\nSending you all love and hope you have a great day.
