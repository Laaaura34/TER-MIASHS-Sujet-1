The Juul was the most popular device at the time, and of course being young and dumb I hopped on the trend and got addicted. I tried quitting for the past 2 years, but always went back for that \u201cone last hit.\u201d Somehow I suddenly effortlessly just quit, without even trying. I feel much better now, I still have anxiety but not as intense as when I was hooked on Nicotine.\n\nNext up, I\u2019m looking to kick my Porn Addiction. I\u2019ve been addicted to Porn since I very first watched it. The addiction has made me develop some weird tastes. Not only has it made me develop weird tastes but I have also looked at Women as sex objects instead of human beings. My confidence is the lowest it\u2019s ever been, my eyebags are dark, I feel a bit miserable, self sabotage, etc. These are the result of porn usage, and it\u2019s the only explanation. \n\nI\u2019m looking to get clean, so I can enjoy life and so I can build relationships instead of staring at a screen and taking the easy way for self pleasure and dopamine rushes.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kvg4el/after_almost_4_years_of_being_addicted_to/", "title": "After almost 4 years of being addicted to Nicotine, I\u2019m officially clean.
