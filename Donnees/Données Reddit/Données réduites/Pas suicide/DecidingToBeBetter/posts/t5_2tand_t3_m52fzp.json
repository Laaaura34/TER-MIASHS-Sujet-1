Recently I've been stuck on Band of Brothers. I'll let it play while I'm on a long drive, to give me some white noise to fall asleep (I have tinitus so some kind of white noise is needed). Or if I'm just sitting around waiting to go into work. Lately I've been getting into the historical value as well (reading articles or stories relating to the 101st, 506th, etc.). I'm not sure I'd call it an addiction, but it's something nonetheless. Anyways, as far as I can tell it hasn't affected my well being. I still socialize as I normally do, still take care of myself, and so on. Just curious what everyone else on here thinks. Also, if this should go elsewhere, like r/psychology or something, let me know.
