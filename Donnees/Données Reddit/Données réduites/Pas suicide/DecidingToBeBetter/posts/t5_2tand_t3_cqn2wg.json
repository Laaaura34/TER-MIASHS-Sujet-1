Which worked for a while.   \n\n\nOver time; my tolerance built up.  \nNowadays I usually need to take in around 600mg, otherwise I will LITERALLY start falling asleep behind the wheel of my car.  \n\n\nHow do I cut this out of my life? I can't afford to take two weeks off of work to recover, and getting into an accident because of my dependency isn't favorable.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cqn2wg/how_to_go_about_quitting_caffeine/", "title": "How to go about quitting caffeine?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "xTrimmZ", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1565857637, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cqn2wg/how_to_go_about_quitting_caffeine/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436521.8683486, "replies_charged": false}
