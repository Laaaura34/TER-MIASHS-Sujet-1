Since a few years ago I went through puberty/started lifting and also got a few tattoos which made a lot of beautiful girls notice me. But for some reason the attention I get is never enough, I constantly want more and when I don\u2019t get the attention I want I start to become insecure.. yeah really weird I know. So now my question is how do I get my mind off women?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oav6ix/craving_female_attention/", "title": "Craving Female Attention", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "BretzFX", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 223, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625051864, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oav6ix/craving_female_attention/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435349.1844468, "replies_charged": false}
