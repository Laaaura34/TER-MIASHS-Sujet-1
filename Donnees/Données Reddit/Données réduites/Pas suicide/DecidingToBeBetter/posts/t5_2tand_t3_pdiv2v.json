Here is what I am hoping to achieve by October 1st \n\nForm habits of everything I want to improve on:\n\nGet better at staying on top of cleaning: \n\nBetter hygiene: ( don't judge it's been a rough several weeks)\n\nExpand my knowledge on things:\n\nSelf-teach myself more: ( I don't have an education and so I am academically dumb which is embarrassing) \n\nLose some weight:\n\nDrink more water: \n\nSkin care: \n\nRead more: \n\n\nNow I am aware that I probably won't achieve everything on the list, but that's ok as it'll only be my first month. I'll try not beat myself up too much lol \n\nI will spend the last few days of August prepping for September making lists, making daily schedules, making work out playlists.  etc", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdiv2v/starting_september_1st_i_will_be_challenging/", "title": "Starting September 1st I will be challenging myself to self improve", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "madman1255", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 43, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630188027, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdiv2v/starting_september_1st_i_will_be_challenging/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437441.6356676, "replies_charged": false}
