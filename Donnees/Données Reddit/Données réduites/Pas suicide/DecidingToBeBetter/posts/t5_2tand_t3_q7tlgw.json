Due to the nature of work I had to pass a police check before I could get an official offer. Lucky I don't have any skeletons in the closet. This job has so much potential, will develop my skills and knowledge, and I'll be working with so many specialists in their field. If it doesn't work out down the line, the contacts alone will be invaluable. \n\nBest bit is, its WFH 2 days a week and they are offering the max of my salary expectations. I've never gone into an interview before asking for a salary, and after reading this page I asked for more than I was comfortable asking. As a woman I've always been offered a number and that was it. I've been significantly paid less than less qualified/experienced male coutnerparts and always first on cutting block. So I'm beyond happy to break the ceiling for not only me, but future women that come after me. \n\nI start Nov 22 and taking a few days off before hand to relax and get some new work clothes! \n\nThank you random redditors for your support and encouragement!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q7tlgw/update_applied_for_my_dream_job_and_i_got_it/", "title": "Update: applied for my dream job... and I got it!!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MuchOutlandishness25", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 190, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634190974, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q7tlgw/update_applied_for_my_dream_job_and_i_got_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435954.580128, "replies_charged": false}
