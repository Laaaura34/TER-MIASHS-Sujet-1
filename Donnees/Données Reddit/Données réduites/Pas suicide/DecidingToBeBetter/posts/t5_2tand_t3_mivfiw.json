I'm a florida boy, I grew up going to the beach almost every weekend. I got wounded on that deployment, life has been extremely hard ever since.\n\nEven though I'm back in my hometown since '18, I haven't been to the beach once since 2016, one of the reasons is that walking on the sand with my screwed ankle seemed like a painful idea, and yeah it was painful but I still enjoying it.\n\nIt was a perfect day, I found a nice little spot, away from people and sat down and damn I felt good. The sound of the waves, the smell, everything felt like heaven.\n\nIt was first time in forever I felt relaxed, happy to be alive. It's a good reminder that life can be good or at least some times, little things can bring so much joy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mivfiw/today_i_went_to_the_beach_for_the_first_time_in_5/", "title": "Today I went to the beach for the first time in 5 years and it felt amazing!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "moonlight_wolf_", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 147, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617402871, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mivfiw/today_i_went_to_the_beach_for_the_first_time_in_5/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437159.857363, "replies_charged": false}
