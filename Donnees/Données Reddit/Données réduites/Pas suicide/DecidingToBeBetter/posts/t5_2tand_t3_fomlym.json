Thus preventing me from sleeping a lot of nights. \n\nI just want to tell you guys that you have to ALLOW yourself time to think! It\u2019s easy to say oh I\u2019ll think about that at lunch or I\u2019ll think about that while I\u2019m doing such and such. But more often than not, I get wrapped up in whatever I\u2019m doing and never truly think of the matters I want to tackle. Like for instance, I want to produce something of high quality and that other people will enjoy. But I don\u2019t know what that something is because I haven\u2019t given myself time to think about it. \n\nI\u2019m the type of person who just likes to do things and think later but, sometimes giving yourself the time and space to think about the things important to you is a important action as well. \n\nHope all that made sense and stay safe!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fomlym/ive_found_that_being_busy_hampers_the_thinking/", "title": "I\u2019ve found that being busy hampers the \u201cthinking\u201d you planned to do.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LogHorizon__", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1585123881, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fomlym/ive_found_that_being_busy_hampers_the_thinking/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436552.4939303, "replies_charged": false}
