It goes beyond imposter syndrome. I have always been an \"excellent\" student in English literature at an \"elite\" university. I know its all bullshit to begin with but I always impressed my professors and won awards for my writing, etc.. I don't have a lot of other skills and struggle in some areas and so academics and English especially were really important to me-- and I loved them. And I \"worked\" really really hard. I researched for hours and hours even when it wasn't required.\n\nBut I realized today that I have no ideas of my own. I basically just read the text, then research for hours and \"absorb\" other people's ideas, then think about them and \"marinate\" in them until I trick myself into believing they are my own, then reread the text with all the new ideas I've stolen from centuries of literary criticism and when I'm asked a question in class, act like I've spontaneously noticed things that I did not. I'm so insecure about my complete inability to think on my own I won't do any reading assignment or say anything or write anything without doing a bunch of outside research. I'm a complete fraud.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjv4la/i_have_no_ideas_of_my_own_ive_been_a_fraud/", "title": "I have no ideas of my own.
