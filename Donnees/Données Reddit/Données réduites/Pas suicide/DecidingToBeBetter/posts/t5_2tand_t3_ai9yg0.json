{"id": "t5_2tand_t3_ai9yg0", "request": ["d16532c7-3c5c-45c4-ab79-168cb2cfbb61"], "text": "So lately my emotional state has not been ideal. And I've mostly been vague about it to my friends. To more or less compound this situation for myself I'm writing down what is wrong, and maybe along the way figure out how to solve these matters, maybe by myself, maybe with help from others, I'm open to suggestions at this point since it's a pretty untenable situation.\nI generally don't share my negative emotions because I don't want to bother others with it. And I feel a lot of shame about them. They are there though, and there are a few. It's a bit of a deep dive but I'll try to be as objective about it as possible.\n\n**Depression** - is something I have been struggling with for a long time. This started at age 13 when the home situation wasn't very good. My parents weren't shitty people, but they had a lot of shitty things happen to them and they never resolved those problems for themselves. Instead, they just forwarded it to others. And who easier to do this than to a child who can't fight back, and if they do blame them for it. Instilling a feedback loop of futility in confrontational matters. As an example when I was 15 my mom got very drunk in the afternoon and started threatening me after I got home from a terrible day of school where I got bullied. She pushed me so far I was about to hit her to sort of emotionally defend myself, and just this sort of line of computer code flashed by me, as you see in movies with all the possible outcomes of this action, and none of them were good. I restrained myself even though I was emotionally devastated by all that transpired that day. I went to my dad's office in tears and told him about the situation he replied \"she's bothering you again? Good, then she'll leave me alone.\" That was the point I didn't love my parents anymore. I sat out my time at home till age 18 and moved out breaking all contact for almost a decade.\nMy school like for most people wasn't much help either. I was a completely out of place weirdo without any friends at all. Partly because I felt bad, I went to a completely shitty school. I am fortunate that even though at one point I literally had zero friends I bounced back pretty well on this front. I have a lot of friends now.\n\n**Aspergers** - is something you can only manage. Unlike depression which solvable. Aspergers is not going to go away and I am pretty good at hiding I even have it. It helps I have a fairly mild case of it and enough insight/intelligence to deal with the consequences. It does require a bit more downtime than for most other people. And it does lowkey have a lot of impact on my world though. While making friends nowadays through the magic of having a great hobby (music) it's still really hard to connect to people I have little common interests with. There is also a lot of social anxiety that this brings with it. Making things like dating a nearly insurmountable task. We humans all want to be loved, but finding love is already complicated enough if things are 100% great. But that mountain only gets steeper the further that number sinks.\n\n**PTSD** - is mostly solvable. But lately, a lot of things from my past have been catching me off-guard, now that I have been having a lot of nightmares. Sleep is a pretty essential part of life and while I am sleeping a lot due to depression I am not well-rested and the quality of my sleep at this point is not good. Sleeping is better than be awake until the nightmares show up.\n\n**Gender** - is a complicated one. And I don't really like to talk about it. Because of the following reason on the list.\n\n**Trust issues** - is probably something everyone deals with at this point. We've all lost a few people I considered friends in really shitty ways. I trusted some with things that I considered really private and they either took advantage of it or showed they didn't give a single shit. Maybe I'm too trusting because my theory of mind concerning others is the projection of my own feelings placed on them, and I like to think I am trustworthy even though that might be a somewhat controversial thing to disclose about oneself.\nNot too long ago while having an Asperger meltdown (it's a complete sensory overload, somewhat similar to a panic attack but still quite different) someone suggested that if I was feeling so badly about everything and so without any improvement for such a long time I maybe ought to consider a 'more permanent solution'. This hurt, this hurt even more because at that time I was at my absolute lowest moment I had been for the last few years.\n\n**Employment** - is something we all want. At first, I thought none of us wanted to work, but spend enough time on a couch doing nothing and realize how unfulfilling it really is. I spent 10 years working at one of the best places ever and now I'm sitting at home for the last year doing nothing and it's eating away at me. I try to fill this time by doing as much as I can working on myself trying to improve the situation I'm in. But it's reliant on others and therapy and there isn't enough time available. If anything I would want to take a whole workweek of therapy for a couple of weeks or months just to sort things out. But it's impossible. There are 45 minutes a week per issue and that's all the time that's available. Meanwhile, life is moving on and I'm stuck at a point that the only way forward for me is external input. As the past 20 years or so I've pretty much done all I can to resolve it by myself. Because I don't like to ask for help. I detest the fact I even need to get someone else involved in my matters. \n\n**Romance** - is difficult. The last couple of times I was going out with someone there was quite a bit of disparity between what I was looking for and what they wanted. \"I'm not looking for a relationship at this point, I want it to be casual\". Proceed getting dumped because they found someone else to start a relationship with. It hurts never being that actual special someone in somebody's life. Especially when you keep thinking they might be yours. Experience this situation a few too many times and your dating self-esteem just tanks. Doesn't help my first, and last actual \"relationship-relationship\" was when I was 17 years old. I'm twice as old now but a couple of times more disillusioned.\n\n**Helping others** - is something I really respect in others. And seeing people do this makes me aspire to be like them. I try to do as much as I can, but everything I do feels like it's never anywhere near enough.\n\n**Sharing feelings** - is difficult for people, doubly so for men. Growing up a man you are constantly berated for infractions that are deemed unmanly. I know this is becoming less of an issue nowadays but I had a father that was born before, and lived through the war (western-Europe) and still had many pre-WW2 notions of what was and was not manly. No room for emotions, you just do things, \"you are a man! act like one!\".\n\"Don't cry, it's nothing!\" while I was 4 years old and I slipped on ice and half my chin needed stitches. Also, society doesn't help much in this regard. Just stomp it down the overflowing rubbish bin instead of taking the trash out in an expedient manner as a more sensible person would.\n\n**Accomplishments** - I've organized dozens of music events, played at big festivals, and events across multiple countries and continents. I got a great house which is totally paid off. I recently got back from the vacation of a lifetime to the country that was #1 on my list of places I wanted to visit. It was truly amazing. I have enough capacity to analyze what's wrong. And I know rationally I am not a bad person. But knowing this rationally versus how I'm feeling isn't helping the situation much. I know I shouldn't be looking for some sort of external validation but I can't help the fact I feel like I have never been loved and I seem to be unable to find this in myself.\n\n**Professional help** - I am currently seeing a psychologist for 45 minutes about every 2 weeks (previously once a month) for a myriad of things. Another person (not a psychologist) is helping me for 2 hours a week with my Aspergers for more practical tasks that need to be done. I feel though that these things aren't enough. I am insured, but the mental health sector is severely overloaded at this point due to cutbacks. I am on the list for depression therapy, but it might take 20 weeks to get to an intake meeting.\n\n**Self-help** - I'm doing meditation, going to the gym and eating healthy. The problem lies that when I get hit with a streak of bad times these are the first things I stop doing because I feel bad, and subsequently feel worse because I stopped doing the things that make me feel less bad.\n\nI needed to vent. Sorry. =(\n\nEdit: today I spent some time with a close friend and had a good time, so I'm feeling less completely devastated at this point in time.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ai9yg0/problems_with_being_unloved_depression_asperger/", "title": "Problems with being Unloved, Depression, Asperger, Bad childhood/PTSD, Gender issues, Trust issues, Dating, Friendship.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ShadowFiendThrowaway", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1548076270, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ai9yg0/problems_with_being_unloved_depression_asperger/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437633.1464686, "replies_charged": false}
