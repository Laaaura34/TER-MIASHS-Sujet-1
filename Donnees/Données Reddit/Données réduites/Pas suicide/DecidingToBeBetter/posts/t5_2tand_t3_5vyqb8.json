When you've lived I life like I have, empty, lonely, and seemingly pointless, it's hard to see these things as anything but propaganda or mirages.\n\nI don't see how things (cars, mansions, etc.) are going to motivate me to change into a better person. There some ideas I have about the person I want to become but they are so far removed from my life experience and what I think I'm capable of, at least in the present moment, that they seem impossible.\n\nHow do separate pop culture's ideas of success and find the things in it that don't mean anything and those that do. Or maybe there are things outside of pop culture that may be more fulfilling and I'm just unaware of them.\n\nFeel like I'm rambling nonsense here but I just wanted to see if anyone else has these feelings or at least understands them.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/5vyqb8/when_youve_lived_a_pretty_lonely_and_empty/", "title": "When you've lived a pretty lonely and empty existence, how do you know what will make you happy, fulfilled, etc.?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bigfan81", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1487956790, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/5vyqb8/when_youve_lived_a_pretty_lonely_and_empty/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436722.1698236, "replies_charged": false}
