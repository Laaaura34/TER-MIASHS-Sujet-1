In school I always managed to get decent grades and overall seemed to stride to do the best that I can, with what I was given. Very charismatic, bright, happy, charming. I\u2019m not trying to be that guy that has his glory days in school and shit but I\u2019m using it for story telling. I never went to college, I thought that if I had to go to school for another four to six years I was gonna lose it. It just wasn\u2019t in me. So, for the past five years I\u2019ve been dicking around. First, I did Walmart for two years and that mainly consisted of part time hours with a never ending quest of getting stoned and laid. Then after never making any money, I went and worked at mobile home plant for three years. The pay was decent, but the job itself and the management and work life balance was god awful. I quit once and worked a different job for a while, and then came back for the money. I left yet again, and did something else another production plant but 3rd shift, and couldn\u2019t hang. I left there and I currently work at another production plant making some really decent money. I still live with my parents, but I pay my own way. My own car payment, phone bill for my personal phone, and various membership payments along with giving my parents money because ya know I live with them. They consider it the equivalency of it being utilities and rent. So all I would need is my own place. My point? I fucking hate my life. These jobs, they\u2019re meaningless and pointless. They serve no purpose. I\u2019m not trying to get deep, but they\u2019re just jobs where you slave yourself for 8 hours and they just use and overburden the shit out of you until you\u2019re mentally burnt out. And that\u2019s all I\u2019ve done for five years, these lame ass jobs. I\u2019ve always felt like I could do something MORE. I\u2019m very smart but very lazy. I\u2019m debating on getting tested for ADULT ADHD. Because too many different things are adding up. I don\u2019t really have an outside life. I just work and come home. I really don\u2019t have the me in myself anymore. I can\u2019t get into my hobbies, I don\u2019t enjoy anything. I feel very exhausted all the time. I\u2019m angry, I\u2019m tired, I have a lot of negative thoughts and feelings, and just overall have become a toxic person. I feel helpless. I just think I\u2019ve hit this point in my life where I realize I haven\u2019t done anything with my life and I feel extremely powerless because I have no idea what the hell I would want to do anyways. I\u2019ve just been drilled to think MAKE MONEY AND SURVIVE and it\u2019s just wearing on me. I don\u2019t know anymore.
