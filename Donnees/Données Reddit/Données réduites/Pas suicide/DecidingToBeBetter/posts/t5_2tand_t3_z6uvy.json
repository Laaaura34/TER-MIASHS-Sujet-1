I figure the best way to do that would be get out there and try new things and create challenges for myself to complete. My biggest focus has been social interactions, I have been described as awkwardly charming and have recently made an effort to loss the awkward portion of that description. Its been a fun process. To accomplish this I joined have a few sports teams and have tried to be more positive and a friendlier person with everyone I meet. It's been a slow process but a fun one. \n\n   I would like to know about things reddit users have done to create a more positive life. Why did you choose to do them? And did you get the results you expected? Were there any surprises that  positively affected your life? \nand also if you have and suggestions for me I would love to hear them.\n   ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/z6uvy/personal_improvement_project/", "title": "Personal improvement project.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Chekassa", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1346518920, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/z6uvy/personal_improvement_project/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435845.42148, "replies_charged": false}
