I need to become incredibly confident and self assured. \n\nI have so much anxiety over little things and no confidence. I am always putting myself down and I know that everyone around me pities me or is annoyed by me. Even when I'm feeling ok and relaxed everyone treats me like I\u2019m made of glass. I am scared to try anything because I do not believe that I am capable of doing it. Even when I do something it is after a ridiculous level of planning and asking questions.\n\nI need to spend hours/days just to send an email or phone call that isn't regular business. Routine is the only thing that gives me security anymore. Big decisions and changes terrify me, and I am going to graduate and face the \u201creal world\u201d soon. My parents have been joking about kicking me out too, and I\u2019m afraid that they aren\u2019t joking anymore.\n\nI know my pathetic self will ruin my life and my chance at a future. I cannot cure cancer or do hard labor so charisma is the only way I can survive in this world. Without charisma I will end up living in a cardboard box somewhere. \n\nIf there are some kind of exercises or things to do that will improve my confidence, please. I am desperate and tired of feeling so insecure all the time. Life seems so much easier for confident people and I need that right now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oeyi6g/i_need_to_get_confidence_and_charisma/", "title": "I need to get confidence and charisma", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "murderisSOMETIMESok", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625589038, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oeyi6g/i_need_to_get_confidence_and_charisma/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438048.9179456, "replies_charged": false}
