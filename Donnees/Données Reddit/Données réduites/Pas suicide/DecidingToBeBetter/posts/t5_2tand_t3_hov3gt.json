I've done nice things for people and have put thought into gift ideas and favors and other things like that. However, recent events in my life have made me realize that the way I think is what is self centered and I want to learn how to think my way out of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI realized recently that the way my mind thinks is in a way that is caring, unless my mind feels it is vulnerable, then it will try and find a way to not be or be the least bit vulnerable while still trying to do the caring thing. I've realized that my mind hates being vulnerable so much that it makes me feel depressed and regretful for making a decision where I feel like I didn't get at least something out of it, or gain some sense of emotional security or protection. I hate this realization and want to change it. How can I think in a way that stops me from imposing my feelings onto someone or them asking me, say, and emotional favor that leaves me completely vulnerable but would be beneficial to them and show them that I care and can be selfless? How to I change my thinking in order to not worry about myself so much?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hov3gt/i_want_to_be_less_self_centeredselfish/", "title": "I want to be less self centered/selfish", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Lt_Dangus", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1594408242, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hov3gt/i_want_to_be_less_self_centeredselfish/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435487.1011992, "replies_charged": false}
