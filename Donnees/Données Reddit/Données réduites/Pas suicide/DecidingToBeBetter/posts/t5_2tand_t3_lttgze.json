I always knew I \u2018felt more\u2019 than other people but I didn\u2019t know how to express my emotions as talking about feelings was seen as weak in my family and I was constantly told to \u2018just be strong\u2019.\n\nI began to repress my anxiety and made a serious of horrible decisions concerning my career and relationships because instead of dealing with problems, I just wanted to run away from them. Now I\u2019m 28 with no job, multiple failed relationships (including a recent breakup) due to my paranoia, emotional outbursts and inability to communicate, and 2 friends who are slowly distancing themselves because I reply to their messages a day late, sometimes two. I have told them that my depression can get debilitating but even though they seem to understand, I feel like they\u2019d rather be with someone who\u2019s more joyful to be around. \n\nI want to live but my constant fear that I\u2019m just meant for despair and happiness is a luxury I don\u2019t deserve, is crippling me.
