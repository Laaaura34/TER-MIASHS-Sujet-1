In the process I've received weekly therapy sessions, gone to a psychiatrist and put on medications for my bipolar. Six months ago now I quit drinking and I'm in such a better place because of it. Originally I stopped because of my medications but now I'm doing it for me. Every time I crave alcohol I remember how depressed I would get drinking. I already have enough issues with rapid cycling (I go manic more than four times a year) and depression that I don't need to add another factor. I'm not really sure on the reason for me posting but I'm proud of myself. I wanted to be better and I actually took the steps.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0n6gr/a_year_ago_i_was_an_awful_person/", "title": "A year ago I was an awful person.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MentallyFucked127", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 81, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623787203, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0n6gr/a_year_ago_i_was_an_awful_person/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436302.6698775, "replies_charged": false}
