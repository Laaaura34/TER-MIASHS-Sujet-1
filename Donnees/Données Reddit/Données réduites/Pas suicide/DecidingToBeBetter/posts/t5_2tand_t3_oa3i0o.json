I can no longer do the things I could do without even thinking about it 2 years ago and I feel as though I'm starting to spiral and I have no Idea what to do. I don't know if I want to get out of this line of work or not but I have no idea how to transfer the skills I've been honing for years to another line of work without taking a large pay cut and starting from scratch. I'm not getting any younger and I don't want to regret this potential turning point in my life. For backstory, I've been a chef for the last 10 years and I feel that I'm passionate and great at my work but lately I've been getting burnt out at an increasing frequency and I have no idea why. Today I completely dropped the ball on myself and my staff and I'm at a loss as to why and what happened, I take these kinds of mistakes entirely on myself and  the incident today has made me question the last 9+ years I've poured my entire life and soul into. I don't know exactly what I'm asking you guys but I would appreciate any input this community would provide me.
