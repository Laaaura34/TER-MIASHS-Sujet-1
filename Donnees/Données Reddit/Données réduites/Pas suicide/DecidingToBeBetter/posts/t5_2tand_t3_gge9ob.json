I'm going to attempt to break it down Atomic Habit style: \n\n(Cue) --> my body smells bad/feels icky.\n(Craving) --> I don't want to smell this body odor/ feel these icky substances.\n(Response) --> showers are a waste of time and resources. If I angle myself this way, I won't smell it. If I distract myself with better activities, I won't feel it.\n(Reward) --> video games/ Netflix/ chores/ social media\n\nI don't know how I break that cycle, but eventually I do and this happens: \n\n(Cue)--> my body still smells bad/ feels icky\n(Craving)--> I want to smell good/ feel good\n(Response) --> Shower \n(Reward)--> Good smells, pleasant skin sensations, good mood\n\nI prefer the latter cycle.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gge9ob/i_took_a_shower/", "title": "I took a shower", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DottedDee", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1589025659, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gge9ob/i_took_a_shower/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437682.1976461, "replies_charged": false}
