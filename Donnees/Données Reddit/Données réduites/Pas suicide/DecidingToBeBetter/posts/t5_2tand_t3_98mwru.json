I'd spend a lot of time on the app, just scrolling through my timeline, miserable because everyone was having fun and I was alone.\n\nSo I did it. \n\nAfter the initial rush of adrenaline, the loneliness hit me like a wave.\n\nI felt like I didn't have any friends.\n\n*I felt alone.*\n\nAnd most of all, and for the first time ever, I felt compelled to change that.\n\nSo I texted some old friends to see if they were in town so we could meet up, and I was shocked when they agreed.\n\nI always considered myself disliked by the group of people I grew up with. But now I understand how wrong I was. We picked up where we left off, the conversation had a pleasant flow, and for the first time with these friends, it didn't feel forced.\n\nIt may be small, but it's progress.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/98mwru/progress_deleted_my_social_media_and_finally_was/", "title": "Progress: Deleted my social media, and finally was free to meet some old friends after three years", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Curryandcaramel", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1534707493, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/98mwru/progress_deleted_my_social_media_and_finally_was/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437722.4644272, "replies_charged": false}
