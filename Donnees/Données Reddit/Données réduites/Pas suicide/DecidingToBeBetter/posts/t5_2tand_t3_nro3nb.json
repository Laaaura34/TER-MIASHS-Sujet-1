My original question was \"How do I find a passion?\" but not only it is meaningless, because you have to do it yourself, I have also come to a realisation that I don't think I will find a passion/hobby that I like out of the box, I will need to learn to enjoy it.\n\nI already play guitar, but that doesn't really bring fullfillment to me anymore and I just keep it as a habit. I have fun most of the times I do it, but it isn't the experience I got in the first 2 or 3 years of learning, which was really fun. \n\nI tried drawing, programming, 3d modeling, writing, singing, making mods for skyrim and in all of those before I start I have this wonderful image in my head of doing one of those and having fun yet when I start doing them I recieve a lot less fun than I originally imagined.\n\nWhat is a better way to stop imagining myself doing certain things and because of that setting unrealistic standards of how it should be? How do I learn to enjoy things while I actually do them?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nro3nb/how_do_i_learn_to_enjoy_a_hobbypassion/", "title": "How do I learn to enjoy a hobby/passion?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Older_1", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622754616, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nro3nb/how_do_i_learn_to_enjoy_a_hobbypassion/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437515.0857852, "replies_charged": false}
