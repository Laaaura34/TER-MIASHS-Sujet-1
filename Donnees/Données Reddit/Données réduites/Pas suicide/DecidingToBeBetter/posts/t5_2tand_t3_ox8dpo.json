Every time I tried to get into the routine of taking a stimulant to help my ADHD symptoms, I\u2019ve had to inevitably give it up because I would lose too much weight. My depression would take over and, with the appetite suppressant effect of the stimulant, I would simply forget to eat for hours and hours at a time. \n\nI\u2019ve gotten to a point where my doctor was so concerned about my safety, that she refused to continue prescribing me the stimulant. I am now on attempt number 4 of trying medication for my ADHD symptoms. \n\nThree days ago, albeit not for the first time, I committed myself to proper nutrition and giving my body and brain what it needs. \n\nIn the last three days, I have kept up with the goals I have set for myself:\n1) I will eat breakfast every day before taking my medication. \n2) I will have a protein smoothie mid morning to supplement, even though I am not hungry. \n3) I will eat lunch every day. \n\nI\u2019ve started small, and plan to build myself up slowly, but I am so proud of the steps I have taken towards better self care. It has been such a relentless struggle with too many failed attempts at fixing it. \n\nAnd yet,I bought myself easy-to-make and nutrient dense foods, so I can work around my depressive symptoms. \n\nI have never been able to stick to these goals more than a day before. I\u2019m celebrating the win that is continuing this routine another day. I\u2019m finally making my health a priority and I feel so good!\n\nSuccess only means standing up one time more than you are knocked down.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ox8dpo/finally_feeding_myself_well_one_step_at_a_time_tw/", "title": "Finally feeding myself well, one step at a time.
