I love his stories and failures and successes. He's authentic. Because life is authentic. Life is not sweet all the time. He has this saying. (Paraphrased) \n\n\"If life knocks you down. Make sure you land on your back. Because if you can look up you can get up!\" \n\nI encourage you today if you're at rock bottom. To push yourself up. If you're hurting today. You remember that you are still breathing. Nothing is over until you decide it is. Either positive or negative. So DECIDE TO BE BETTER. I am. Get excited about life today. Be passionate about living. We are blessed to be here no matter what!!! God blessed us today with life. Stresses come and go. But you're a beast!! So LET'S GO!!!
