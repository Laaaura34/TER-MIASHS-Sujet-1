Even as a child or teen I was never completely sure what I wanted to go to college for. My mind always changed. I've been working on getting my ASSOCIATES on and off for like 10 years now. Changing my major at least 6 times. School has NEVER been my thing but my parents want me to get a degree so I've been fucking around in college not doing shit. Wasting my time and my father's GI Bill money. This has literally been my story since elementary school. I liked being creative as a teen. I loved writing. I swore up and down for years that I wanted to become a screenwriter and make horror films. That was my thing. But I can't even bring myself to write or watch horror anymore and I don't know why. I can't bring myself to do anything without it completely exhausting me. I don't know what to do. I also still live with my parents because adulting I have no idea how to adult. I feel like I'm just a giant waste of space tbh", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/", "title": "Nearly 30 years old and I still have no idea what I want to do with my life.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lochnessence", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1009, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628683951, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p2btw4/nearly_30_years_old_and_i_still_have_no_idea_what/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436256.966615, "replies_charged": false}
