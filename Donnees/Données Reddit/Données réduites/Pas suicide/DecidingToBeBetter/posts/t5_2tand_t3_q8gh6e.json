I\u2019m working on that. \nBut that means that I take the times I\u2019m in military duty super serious. Even though everyone is miserable, because that\u2019s just the nature of the military, It\u2019s the only time I get excitement in my life. So I actually look forward to it. \n\nI recently got a small promotion to team leader. So now I\u2019m in charge of the well-being/performance of 4 guys. But I\u2019m literally the youngest guy in my platoon. I\u2019m 20, in charge of 24-25 year olds. I can\u2019t even go out drinking with them. \n\nI\u2019m usually very confident (on the outside). But I can\u2019t help but think they see me as an illegitimate leader, and think I don\u2019t deserve to be in charge of them. So ever since this promotion I\u2019ve had self esteem issues.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated, I\u2019m trying to better myself so I can be mentally there to take care of my boys.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8gh6e/is_this_imposter_syndrome/", "title": "Is this imposter syndrome?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Solid-Source-8610", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634271454, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8gh6e/is_this_imposter_syndrome/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438427.1924858, "replies_charged": false}
