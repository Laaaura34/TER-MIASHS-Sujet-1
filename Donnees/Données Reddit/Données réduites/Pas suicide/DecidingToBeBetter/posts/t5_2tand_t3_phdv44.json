Being immature when I started drinking probably explains why I never learned to drink responsibly. \n\nIf I drink, I get drunk. I have one drink with the best intentions but it\u2019s like a switch is flicked and my brain no longer remembers that I was only having one, I just want to drink more.\n\nI drink till I black out, I act poorly, I\u2019m very self destructive and try to sabotage myself. \n\nWhen I sober up, I\u2019m depressed for days. Not sad, depressed. I can barely get out of bed, I cry all day, I wish I was dead. I have some mental health problems.\n\nI\u2019m not an alcoholic, I don\u2019t have a need to drink. I\u2019ve actually given up on the past, I\u2019ve been sober for over 12 months twice. For whatever reason I have a drink again, a work event, pressure from friends and I think I can handle it, I cannot. \n\nI\u2019m a week sober and I\u2019ve decided to stay sober, however, there\u2019s already pressure to go for a drink with my boss and friends have asked me to go to the pub.\n\nThe people in my life are not supportive, they tell me if I\u2019m not an alcoholic then I can drink. I just don\u2019t want to drink again.\n\nI have a good job, a family and home. If I can stay sober I\u2019ll have a good life.
