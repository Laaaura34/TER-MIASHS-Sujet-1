I enlisted for training in my countries disaster relief and part of that training is crawling through really small concrete tunnels to rescue people. I'm not gonna lie, I'm really scarred and anxious about it, especially cause I'm afraid to get stuck and we'll have to carry a lot of equipment down there, including oxygen bottles.
