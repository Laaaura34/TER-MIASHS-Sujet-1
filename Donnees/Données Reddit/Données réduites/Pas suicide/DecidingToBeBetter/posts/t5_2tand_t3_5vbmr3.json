The sun sets and the sun rises. We inhale and we exhale. We create and we rest. Don't expect happiness to last, but don't expect depression to either. The only thing you should expect is balance. Enjoy the balance because it is only natural.\n\nWhen I finally realized this, it was one of the most profound experiences of my life.\n\nFor a while, I used to hate how my life used to come in go in waves. I would have six months of extreme confidence\u2014then, six months of insecurity. A couple months of productivity\u2014then, a couple months of laziness. Every time I thought I turned the corner and was going to stay happy or productive forever, those undesirable states would reemerge.\n\n**And I would beat myself up for it.**\n\nEventually, I learned to stop identifying those low points as \u201cbad,\u201d and began to embrace the duality. By identifying one side of the duality as bad, I was at odds with **[a law of the universe.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihs3Zis70ik)** I was at odds with the everlasting presence of Yin and Yang. That caused so much pain.\n\nBeating yourself for not feeling confident all the time will destroy you. Worrying that your feeling of laziness it will last forever\u2014 is like watching the sun go down and fearing it will never rise again.\n\nSo when you are suffering, feeling lazy, or lacking confidence\u2014 recognize that you will always rebound. It is the law of the universe. Duality is ever present and will always have sway over your life.\nBecome aware of the duality and embrace both sides.\n\nIn doing so, **productivity** and **laziness** will turn into **creation** and **rest**. Confidence and insecurity will turn into self esteem and self growth.\nWhen you are aware and appreciative of both sides of the duality, you will exist in harmony with a universal law\u2014one that will carry-on throughout the rest of your life.\n\nTo expand on this topic, **[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihs3Zis70ik)** will illustrate how duality operates in your life. When you watch, you will learn how you can truly embrace it to make a miraculous transformation.\n\nIf you enjoyed this post, I invite you to subscribe to my YouTube channel--where I first shared this story.
