Maybe they all seem like autopilot right now, but they are more rare than you think and I\u2019m proud as hell of all the things you do well.\n\n**1. You don\u2019t give up**\n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s easy. I\u2019m not saying you enjoy every item on your to-do list. But you\u2019re doing it. You\u2019ve been doing it. So many people gave up before they got as far as you have. You really want things to get better, and I\u2019m proud that after everything you\u2019ve been through you\u2019re still in this. You work so hard and you never give up, and if you look back you\u2019ll see how far that has taken you. That\u2019s a lot to be proud of.\n\n**2. You genuinely care about people**\n\nYou probably don\u2019t even give yourself credit for this. \u201cIf you can help someone then you do it, that\u2019s just what you do\u201d you might say. But a lot of people don\u2019t. How many problems have you helped people solve? How many people have felt lost and you talked them through it? I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re perfect, but I\u2019m so proud of the impact you have on others. You care about them, and it doesn\u2019t even matter how many you\u2019ve helped. If you\u2019ve helped one person then the world is better because you were here. Everyone you\u2019ve helped is lucky you\u2019re here.\n\n**3. You\u2019re not afraid to try things**\n\nOkay, maybe you\u2019re kind of afraid. But you still do it. Most are too scared of failure to try new things. You might feel fear, but you know moving forward is more important. I love that about you. You try things and learn from mistakes and keep trying. You\u2019re like a relentless archer that kept shooting and shooting and got closer with every arrow. Very soon you\u2019ll have so much practice you hit the bullseye every single time. You are creating the life you want for yourself, and it\u2019s closer than you think.\n\n**4. You take care of yourself (kind of)**\n\nBecause I care about you, I want you to take care of yourself. And you\u2019re decent at it. I think you still work too hard sometimes, and you give away a ton of time to other people. But I\u2019ve seen you set boundaries, I\u2019ve seen you cut out toxic people that were holding you back, I\u2019ve seen you take time for yourself when you really needed it. I don\u2019t think either of us are perfect at this. But you\u2019re important to me and I\u2019m glad you take care of yourself the best you can.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI know it feels like there\u2019s a long way to go, maybe you\u2019re not where you want to be. But please give yourself credit for everything you\u2019re doing right. More people look up to you than you realize, you\u2019ve made a difference in more people\u2019s lives than you realize, and you\u2019re doing more things right than you realize. These were just a few. Thank you for being you. None of us are perfect, but there\u2019s a lot of people who are really glad you\u2019re here.\n\n**Further Reading:** This letter is to my friend Charles, but if you do those 4 things then I\u2019m proud of you too. I found Charles after I read The Book of Joy by the Dalai Lama and Desmond Tutu. That book taught me how important meaningful relationships are and taught me the tools to go out and create some (compassion, empathy, gratitude). Because that book helped me create great relationships (and therefore joy) I think you should read it too. \n\nWishing you all the best - MattTheMentor", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nstsl5/im_proud_of_you/", "title": "I'm proud of you", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MattTheMentor", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 33, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622892864, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nstsl5/im_proud_of_you/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437323.4772267, "replies_charged": false}
