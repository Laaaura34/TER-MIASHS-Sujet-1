I think today was better than yesterday. Slightly better but I will still count this as progress so yay. \n\nAlthough today my head was filled with negative thoughts while meditating. I tried to resist it but as far as I know meditation helps control the flow of thoughts and hence I should stop resisting the negative thoughts and simply let it flow and not act upon it.  It is very difficult for me to inculcate this but I am positive that I will achieve it someday. I mean that's what I am here for, to make peace with myself. \n\nCan't wait for day 3!\n\nPeace.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/omz0hd/day_2_100daysofmeditation/", "title": "Day 2 - #100DaysofMeditation", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "InfernalEagle786", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626641218, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/omz0hd/day_2_100daysofmeditation/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437463.358323, "replies_charged": false}
