I'm so lucky to be where I am to have opportunities appear. I can't waste away anymore. I am going to walk my dog every day. I'm committed to making my wellness a priority, and that mean sacrificing some things. If it means I have to stop drinking and even stop smoking weed, I can do it. I know I can. I don't want to stop but at the same time, I've used those things as a crutch to get by emotionally in life. Its affecting my physical health. This is the largest my body has ever been! I have never been this out of shape. I don't have any ambition but I want to change that. I want to want things. I want to have goals that I want? Goals that I like? I have been taking the easy route I think for too long. I want to be better. Writing out what I want to achieve I think will help:\n\n* Walk my dog everyday\n* Gotta start walking to Run\n* Drink & Smoke Less OR Eliminate Drinking & Smoking\n* Be Brave and take risks. Confidence.\n* Learn More, Get more certifications/Formal educations\n* Clean more, Redecorate.\n* Be more personable.
