BUT a lot of people have decided to leave their prejudice in the past and i\u2019d like to share our experiences being \u201coutsiders\u201d\nI\u2019ll give you a story of my first time \nI was in the first grade, and it was 9-11. I grew up in a mostly white town and the ignorance of their parents surely reflected on most of them, although now most of them have gained new perspective. Anyways, I was the only student who had brown skin, as i am Iranian, and on 9-11 i felt very isolated and alone. Everyone looked and me and made judgmental comments about how I was \u201cjust like the people on tv\u201d This hurt my self esteem and I didn\u2019t know what to do, they could not see past color and even though we were just in first grade it hurt me a lot. I have felt similarly when I would go to the airport and get checked again for having my last name, mind you I am a F(17). I recognize my privilege as a beautiful thing bc I know SO many people have it worse. I am a firm believer in the fact that every experience you have shapes who you are today. But the whole point of this post is to pose the question of when was the first time you felt isolated by something you couldn\u2019t control? How did you overcome it?\nThanks for reading, have a great day!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jidk3l/when_was_the_first_time_you_experienced_racism/", "title": "When was the first time you experienced racism and how did u feel", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "puzzlehead-fish444", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1603715041, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jidk3l/when_was_the_first_time_you_experienced_racism/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437855.1605248, "replies_charged": false}
