Just to give a little context I\u2019m a virgin and when you\u2019re a dude at this age you have to sometimes try weird things to get laid. \n\nI post a lot on these virginity exchange subs or r4r subs and one user made a post about virgins trying to lose it who don\u2019t have their lives together. They said if you don\u2019t make or have enough to have a car, a mattress, or enough money to buy a hotel room that sex should\nbe the least of your problems. \n\nI read that and it kind of made a wave of depression hit me. I\u2019m one of these pathetic people she\u2019s talking about. I\u2019m basically a man child trying to have sex and thinking of myself as that brings so much self hatred. I don\u2019t have an income. My parents support me and won\u2019t kick me out. The only thing giving me a will to live is what keeps me busy. Those things are basically housekeeping, like hard housekeeping work for my family and my own physical work outs. I keep myself in great physical shape. Maybe my only real accomplishment on this stupid piece of dust. I feel like I do the housework and workouts to make up for what I haven\u2019t done in life. \n\nFor a lot of reasons, anxiety, OCD, depression, severe social anxiety, RSD,low self image, I\u2019ve avoided work, applying, interviews all that stuff for *years*. Now I\u2019m an almost 30 year old man. 27 to be exact. I\u2019m not having sex, I have no social life, my best friend is about to die, all of those issues I mentioned are still there and I think another one is about to be added. I\u2019m worried about how often I\u2019m thinking about suicide. It\u2019s not that often but it\u2019s more often than before, definitely more as time has trudged on. Idk if i intentionally think of it but I\u2019ll just be sad about sex, my self, my life or whatever and I\u2019ll think about setting myself on fire like a monk. That was the most recent one. I\u2019ve always been *mortified* by suicide because of ocd. It took years for me to even learn how to talk about it. But i worry if this is the beginning of me considering it idk. I do think about it a lot in a philosophical way more than I do actually think about doing it. Still scary. \n\nSo yeah I have all this going on meanwhile I\u2019m just like most other 27 year olds, dying for sex and companionship especially with all that\u2019s happened this past year. But I guess some\nPeople are just fucked. Or maybe I\u2019m just pathetic and even this very post is me looking for excuses. Idk. That\u2019s the cliff notes version of me. Please be honest even if it\u2019s bad.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve realized something over the years and it\u2019s that I just want \u201cit\u201d to be easy. \u201cIt\u201d can be any obstacle in my life but the main ones are independence and lack of sexual experience. \n\nI honestly admit. I want it to be easy. I want to have sex and be independent without it being hard. I do!!! Cuz you know what, I\u2019ve struggled a lot in my life and a lot of normal things for me are HARD. Am I that terrible for wanting *one* fucking thing in my life to not have to be so exhausting? Just to be normal!! I spend so much time literal time in my day on the clock of existence thinking about what it must be like to grow up a neurotypical. I\u2019m tired of saying I haven\u2019t suffered cuz my parents have money. Look up what OCD is like, *real* OCD not the bullshit you see on social media. It\u2019s torture.
