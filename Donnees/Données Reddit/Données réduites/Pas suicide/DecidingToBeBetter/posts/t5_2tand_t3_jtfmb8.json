I'm very good at organising tasks, scheduling activities and planning ahead of time, but then I end up doing everything last minute anyway. Anxiety haunts me every day.\n\nI really can't afford a therapist right now, so what I'm doing is trying to tackle one problem at a time. Yoga and meditation are helping me with physical anxiety - I used to catch myself holding my breath or tensing my muscles at random times, it happens less now. \n\nThe biggest thing now is doomscrolling. I deleted Facebook years ago, never had an Instagram account. I only use Reddit, Tumblr and YouTube. The hit of dopamine I get helps me quickly getting rid of sudden bursts of anxiety, but then I get trapped and when I manage to get out I feel absolutely miserable and even more anxious because I've thrown away a lot of useful time. It's not even a conscious action sometimes.\n\nHow can I stop that? I'm looking for healthier and actually helpful alternatives. I read a lot of books but that isn't the same.
