This limited time is filled with visual delights, food of the utmost deliciousness, amazing people with incredible talents, and love.\n\nThe first person is a great man, and while he\u2019s grateful for the gift, he has lots to do and so regrettably has to spend a lot of it replying to emails and texts, and checking for updates in social media. He does take some pictures of the delicious food and shares it on social media, though he doesn\u2019t pay attention to the taste.\n\nThe second person is a bit of procrastinator (OK, let\u2019s be honest: a big procrastinator), and while she really wants to use this gift wisely, she keeps putting it off. She spends much of the hour watching videos the first guy posts online of the magical world, but she doesn\u2019t go out and experience it herself.\n\nThe third person is blown away by this gift. What an incredible opportunity! She realizes she needs to make the most of it, but isn\u2019t sure how.\n\nSo she starts by paying attention. She notices every little detail. She listens to the amazing people she meets, and tries to really see them for who they are. She tastes the food and pays close attention to every sensation as she eats, savoring the food slowly.\n\nShe then practices gratitude for every moment, every person, everything she\u2019s given. She\u2019s filled with happiness by every little thing in this hour.\n\nFinally, she changes people\u2019s lives. She uses what\u2019s left of this dwindling hour to learn magic skills, to heal people who are struggling (including the first guy), to make things to delight the other amazing people in this magical world.\n\nShe becomes the gift for others.\n\nThe hour is over, and the first two people realize they\u2019ve wasted the gift, and will never get it again. They\u2019re filled with regret. The third person has no regrets, because she paid attention, was grateful, and used the magic to change lives. She used the gift to its fullest potential.\n\nWhich of those three people are you?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/25q9yq/the_gift/", "title": "The Gift", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dwilliamjones", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1400263486, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/25q9yq/the_gift/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436221.318487, "replies_charged": false}
