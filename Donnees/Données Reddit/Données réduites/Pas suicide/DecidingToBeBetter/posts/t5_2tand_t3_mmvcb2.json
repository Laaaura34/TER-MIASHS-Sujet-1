But I know that most \u2018normal\u2019 people would perceive me as bad and not want to associate with me if they knew I was the way I am. I worry that I might even have a personality disorder such as NPD, and in that case I can\u2019t help but think what\u2019s the point in anything. Though I don\u2019t know if i do have it everyone sees people with NPD as incurable, and if I had this disorder it would mean I can never be normal and have the normal life i want so much with attachments, love, even children one day and a happy family. I really want to fall in love, and I really want to be a mother one day. I want to have positive emotions, or have emotions with at least some intensity rather than feeling numb or anxious all day. I really hope i DONT have a personality disorder but I know this isn\u2019t just a part of growing up. \n\nToday I\u2019m 17, and around a year ago I became aware of how selfish, envious, entitled and subtly attention seeking I was. I made a change because I didn\u2019t want to hurt the people around me, I noticed that sometimes I could even be subtly manipulative. I didn\u2019t want to hurt my mother who I love so much. I remembered every time i\u2019d made her life harder and felt so much guilt. I even recall a few instances of intentionally guilt tripping her as a child, or complaining excessively. \n\nBut even when I work to be a good person externally, internally I am not. I have both an extremely deep inferiority complex and sometimes even feelings of superiority over certain things (such as academics). I care way too much about how others perceive me, I\u2019m very self aware at least, so I always call myself out. I spend all of my time inside my head, calling myself out on every single thing I do. 70% of my waking time is spent in complete anxiety, dissecting every single thing I think and the motivations behind it. I can\u2019t stop analysing each thought and using it as evidence of me having a Cluster B PD, and if i do what\u2019s the point in living? I\u2019ll never love and get close to people like I want to so badly If i have something like that. What\u2019s the point in living without human attachment. Even before this stage I was so unhappy, I spent all of\nmy time daydreaming about an ideal life where I had some worth and happiness. \n\nI want to die so much. I know i would never do anything to myself because imagining my parents reactions breaks my heart, I love them so much. But I can\u2019t help but wish a car would hit me, or i\u2019d have a sudden heart attack or something because I don\u2019t want to do this anymore. \nI just want to be a normal teenager. Everyone thinks I\u2019m weird and ugly too so i don\u2019t have physical appearance going for me either, and even this post is filled with endless amounts of self pity which is inherently self centred. I don\u2019t know if this post is just looking for sympathy too, or reassurance that I\u2019m a good person but talking about this on here in private gives me some relief. \n\nEven though Im pleasant to everyone around me now, I\u2019m still me. I feel like my default state is just someone bitter who\u2019ll never be normal, I just work to direct my negative feelings inwards and protect those around me. The people around me are happy but I\u2019m so so sad. I think i\u2019ll always be sad and one day i\u2019ll die alone, til then I\u2019ll pretend to be happy or respond with what people want from me even if I can\u2019t feel it. i don\u2019t know if I inherited this but I can\u2019t help but hate whoever passed this down to me and wish i\u2019d never been born.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mmvcb2/im_kind_of_a_bad_person_and_im_really_not_sure/", "title": "I\u2019m kind of a bad person, and I\u2019m really not sure what to do.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ocdsuffering", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617898773, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mmvcb2/im_kind_of_a_bad_person_and_im_really_not_sure/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437246.166926, "replies_charged": false}
