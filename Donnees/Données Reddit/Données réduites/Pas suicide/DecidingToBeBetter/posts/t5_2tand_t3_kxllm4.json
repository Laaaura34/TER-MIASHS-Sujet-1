I fail at my daily habits multiple times a week. I cheat on my diet. I skip going to the gym (for months at a time). I give in to my addictions all the time.\n\nI\u2019m anything but disciplined and strong-willed. I spend hours a day lazing around on the couch, mindlessly watching stupid shit on Youtube. Give me a choice between doing what I should do, and doing what I want to do, and I\u2019ll almost always go with the thing I want to do.\n\nI\u2019ve always been poorly-disciplined. And you know what? It doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ve learned to be kind to myself, to not beat myself up for it, to just accept my laziness and make the most of my life anyway.\n\nSo how have I achieved any of my goals? How have I gotten myself a great dating life, [lost a tonne of weight](https://kyil-extra.com/how-i-lost-weight/), done a photo-a-day challenge without missing a day, started two websites, become a life coach, rack-pulled 200kg, blah blah blah?\n\nBecause even though I\u2019m a lazy piece of shit sometimes (often), even though I lack willpower and discipline sometimes (often), I still take tiny little baby steps forward each day.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason I never shut up about the book, The Slight Edge. It is THE reason I\u2019ve been able to achieve 95% of my goals, without any willpower, and certainly without any discipline. The idea in the book is that: as long as you\u2019re working on your goals a tiny bit each week, as long as you\u2019re taking more steps forward than backwards (even if those steps forward are pathetically small), you\u2019ll eventually hit your goals. Progress is measured over the long-term; it doesn\u2019t matter how many lazy days you have, as long as you also have some good ones thrown in there too.\n\nThe bad days don\u2019t matter.\n\nIt really doesn\u2019t matter how many fuckups you have, or how many times you cheat on your diet or get lazy with your goals. It doesn\u2019t matter how many times you fail, or embarass yourself, or pussy out on a challenge. All that matters is you just never quit.\n\nMaybe one day I\u2019ll set up my camera and do a time-lapse of my day so I could see how much of it is spent lazing around on the couch, self-medicating, avoiding the things I know I \u201cshould\u201d be doing. I know it\u2019s easy to look at peoples accomplishments and say, \u201cI bet he\u2019s a badass\u201d \u2013 I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times people tell me they can\u2019t do what I\u2019ve done because \u201cI\u2019m not a badass like all of those successful people out there\u201d\n\nAs a 'successful' guy that people have put in that group, that's bullshit.\n\nI\u2019m the last person on Earth you\u2019d ever call a badass (if you really knew me) and I do not want you to use your \u201clack of discipline\u201d or \u201clack of willpower\u201d as an excuse not to achieve your own goals. You can find your own success, if you\u2019re willing to put aside the notions of willpower and discipline, and instead focus on just taking baby steps each day and never ever quitting.\n\nThere\u2019s other things you can do too \u2013 I\u2019ve spent years figuring out how to get myself \u2013 a very lazy bastard \u2013 to actually work on his goals. I call these things my \u201ccheats\u201d. One cheat that\u2019s helped is bribing myself \u2013 and boy do I use this one all the damn time.\n\nI bribe myself to go to the gym. \u201cIf I go to the gym today, I\u2019m allowed to buy an expensive steak and enjoy it.. but only if I actually go to the gym.\u201d\n\nI bribe myself to write articles like this one. \u201cIf I write an article, I\u2019m allowed to then spend the rest of the night watching mindless Youtube videos until I fall asleep.\u201d\n\nI bribe myself to do even basic tasks like doing the dishes or cleaning my house \u2013 I have to bribe myself every single time I need to do chores. \u201cIf I start cleaning the house, I\u2019m allowed to listen to my favourite music or a podcast I\u2019m really into.\u201d\n\nSteal this cheat from me \u2013 use it yourself. Bribing has been my go-to method for dealing with my lack of willpower and my total unhinged laziness. Bribing yourself with nice rewards really does make it a lot easier to do the things you don\u2019t really want to do. It really is really damn effective \u2013 you\u2019re giving yourself a planned reward for completing tasks you don\u2019t really want to do. Just make sure you pick bribes that are healthy \u2013 don\u2019t tell yourself, \u201cIf I go to the gym today, I get to inject heroin into my arm!\u201d\n\nAnd on the flipside \u2013 be careful with berating yourself and yelling at yourself to work on your goals. It definitely works for some people (if it does \u2013 great). But I\u2019d caution against doing it too often; it can very quickly develop into a pathology or devolve into self-hatred. Most guys who are into self-improvement are already cunts to themselves sometimes; you might find a bit of love and kindness works better at actually getting yourself to work on your goals.\n\nYou can also \u201ccheat\u201d by only working on one or two big goals at a time (it\u2019s fine to also work on a couple of small goals at the same time \u2013 as long as they\u2019re very small goals). Prioritising just one or two big goals makes it a hell of a lot easier to put in the consistent daily work \u2013 because you\u2019ll simply have more free time, more mental energy and more emotional energy to focus on those one or two big tasks, rather than being stretched thin across a bunch of big goals.\n\nLast year, I was prioritising writing for my site and working out at home. I was completely neglecting my dating life. Because I was going hardcore with writing and the gym and nothing else, I don\u2019t have to rely on willpower or discipline or forcing myself to tackle multiple giant goals at once.\n\nAt other points in my journey, I\u2019ve focused solely on my dating life + going to the gym \u2013 and neglected just about everything else. I put aside my career, my finances, my social life and a bunch of other things, just so I could go hard with feeling like I could be good with women and improve my body. And again, that didn\u2019t require much willpower or discipline \u2013 because I only had to tackle a couple of things at a time. Slow and steady won the race for me.\n\nYou can do the same \u2013 just pick one or two big goals you want to achieve, and make those your main priority. If you have extra smaller goals to add on, just make sure they\u2019re very easy to do and take almost no effort \u2013 the idea is they shouldn\u2019t be draining your willpower or discipline. Focus on the one or two big goals, and you\u2019ll find you don\u2019t really need much willpower at all.\n\nYou can also \u201ccheat\u201d by making your habits so pathetically easy you can\u2019t help but do them. If you want to go to the gym, instead of saying, \u201cI have to go to the gym and do my full workout\u201d, you make it so easy you can\u2019t help but do it. \u201cI only have to walk to the gym. As long as I step foot in the gym, I\u2019m successful. I\u2019m literally allowed to walk into the gym and then immediately walk out \u2013 as long as I go to the fucking gym.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll find by lowering your goal to \u201cI\u2019ll literally just step 1 foot into the gym\u201d, you will always go to the gym. That\u2019s so pathetically small you will never skip it. On your absolute worst days \u2013 eg a day where you have a really bad flu or something \u2013 you\u2019ll drag your sorry ass to the gym, put one foot inside, and then turn around and go home. Congrats! You were still successful \u2013 you stuck to your goal.\n\nI know that seems very weak \u2013 after all, how the hell does stepping 1 foot into the gym actually help you get a killer body? Because it\u2019s building a habit. If your absolute worst day is \u201cI still went to the gym\u201d \u2013 isn\u2019t that better than \u201cI sat at home being lazy\u201d? It means the millisecond you feel better, you\u2019ll go to the gym and crush your workout \u2013 because you\u2019ve already built a habit of going to the gym.\n\nAnd you\u2019ll find on many \u201cbad\u201d days, if you can just drag your butt to the gym, often you\u2019ll get there and think, \u201cOk, I didn\u2019t want to come to this stupid gym but I\u2019m here now. Maybe I\u2019ll just do some lazy bicep curls or something then go home.\u201d You\u2019ll start doing your curls and you\u2019ll realise, \u201cThis feels ok, actually. Maybe I\u2019ll do a bit of bench pressing too.\u201d You\u2019ll do that, and before you know it, you\u2019ll end up \u201caccidentally\u201d doing most of your workout. You\u2019ll go home, feeling like a fucking boss \u2013 it started out as a shitty day, and you turned it into a pretty damn successful day \u2013 just because you stepped foot in the gym.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t have that pathetically-small goal of \u201cI will just step 1 foot into the gym\u201d, there\u2019s no way you would have gone to the gym. It would have taken too much willpower \u2013 willpower you didn\u2019t have, because you were having a shit day. Having a super easy, pathetically-small goal ensures you will always be successful \u2013 even on your bad days.\n\nThis is the concept behind the book Mini Habits \u2013 you set such a tiny task that your success is basically guaranteed each day. Over time you\u2019ll build up a habit of always actually working on your goals (even just a tiny bit \u2013 baby steps).\n\nFocusing on the end goal is another good \u201ccheat\u201d \u2013 let yourself fantasise about your end destination, what your life will look like when you get to your goal. If you\u2019re trying to lose fat, and you\u2019re finding it hard to go to the gym, let yourself really obsess about what it\u2019s going to be like when you have the body you\u2019ve always dreamt of.\n\nGet a big piece of paper out (or use your laptop) and write down exactly what your life will look like when you hit your goal. In the case of going to the gym, let your mind go wild:\n\n\\------\n\n\u201cWhen I get down to 10% bodyfat, I\u2019ll finally have abs, which is something I\u2019ve always wanted but never thought was possible. I\u2019ll feel so fucking proud of myself for finally looking elite; I\u2019ll be able to look at myself in the mirror and smile. I probably won\u2019t even believe that\u2019s me staring back; what a feeling that\u2019ll be.\n\n When I\u2019m lean, I\u2019ll have an amazing jawline, so I\u2019ll literally just have to stand there and I\u2019ll naturally look good in every photo I take of myself. Girls will tell me how good my body looks, which will be incredibly validating \u2013 I never ever dreamt I could have a girl tell me I have a good body. That\u2019ll seem so surreal and I\u2019ll probably even cry with joy as soon as she leaves. \\[Andy\u2019s note: Yes, I have done this\\].\n\nPeople will be nicer to me in general (the halo effect), and I\u2019ll get more looks on the street \u2013 I\u2019ll feel noticed. It\u2019ll be easier for me to get promotions at work, because people will respect me more \u2013 they\u2019ll assume if I look this good, I must be worth something. I\u2019ll find people wanting to be my friend more. It\u2019ll seem like the whole world is nicer to me now that I\u2019m lean.\n\nBest of all, I\u2019ll have proof that I\u2019m capable of doing something that\u2019s pretty hard \u2013 I\u2019ll have proof I\u2019ve achieved a big goal. And not just any goal \u2013 this will be a big goal that requires discipline, and patience, and many months to achieve. I\u2019ll know that if I\u2019m able to achieve something big like this, I can go on and achieve the next big goal, and the next, and the next. I\u2019ll be showing myself proof I can literally do anything. The sky\u2019s the limit.\n\n\\------\n\nPretty god damn motivating, right? Focus on that every day, read it out loud to yourself in the moments where you\u2019re lacking motivation and lacking willpower. It might seem like I have a lot of discipline and willpower, but really I\u2019m just \u201ccheating\u201d a lot by focusing on my goals and fantasising about how amazing it\u2019ll be when I achieve them \u2013 especially in the moments where I struggle to do the things I \u201cshould\u201d be doing.\n\nMy friends who\u2019ve achieved great things do the same \u2013 they obsess about the goals they want to achieve, and how their life will look when they get there. Then they take tiny little baby steps each day towards their goals; no willpower required.\n\nWhen it comes to discipline with vices and addictions, I have no willpower there either. Put a bottle of whiskey in my house and it\u2019ll be gone 2 days later. Leave me at home alone and chances are I\u2019ll waste half the day jerking off to porn. Tempt me with junk food and I\u2019ll likely eat all of it, until I\u2019m 6000 calories deep and bloated and gross and feeling utterly disgusted with myself.\n\nSo, cheat like I do \u2013 remove those vices so you\u2019re not tempted. I never ever ever have alcohol in my apartment; otherwise I\u2019ll just drink it. If I\u2019m going to a bar, I leave my wallet at home and just drink water. I use a browser extension to block porn websites so I can\u2019t visit them. I make sure there\u2019s never any junk food of any kind in my apartment \u2013 I haven\u2019t had junk food in my cupboard for the last 5 years.\n\nIt goes deeper \u2013 I know there\u2019s certain things I couldn\u2019t stop myself from doing (I have a very addictive and obsessive personality, as two of my coaching clients have even pointed out). I\u2019ll never try any drugs that have even a hint of addictiveness to them. Alcohol was enough of a learning experience for me (I held off having my first drink until I was 22, and when I started drinking, I quickly became a drunk-every-day alcoholic).\n\nI\u2019m bad with eating too, especially when I\u2019m on a diet. I have such little willpower I\u2019ve literally thrown food out so I won\u2019t be tempted to eat it\u2026 Then gone through the bin and dug it out and eaten it anyway. The way I stop this is by \u201cruining\u201d the food \u2013 eg running it under the tap so it\u2019s soaked and wet, or breaking it into little bits and pouring salt all over it before I put it in the bin. That\u2019s not glamorous, but I\u2019m human.\n\nI\u2019m really not kidding when I say I have zero discipline when it comes to my addictions, so I just never put myself in a situation where I\u2019d have to use willpower to control myself. You can steal my \u201ccheat\u201d here too \u2013 get rid of all temptation. Maybe you struggle with food; get rid of it. Maybe you play too many video games; uninstall them all. Maybe you watch too much Netflix \u2013 cancel your account. Out of sight, out of mind.\n\nYou can have those vices back once you\u2019ve achieved a few of your goals \u2013 after all, rewards are nice. But if they\u2019re hindering your progress right now and getting in the way of your success, remove them.\n\nI\u2019ve discovered other \u201ccheats\u201d that help me \u2013 I struggle with writing for this site sometimes \u2013 and my lack of willpower and discipline hasn\u2019t helped. The way I\u2019ve made it work is to not have a structured or planned time in which I write. I just laze about on the couch (usually watching YouTube), and when I feel like writing, I write. Yeah, that\u2019s lazy \u2013 but it requires zero willpower and zero discipline. And given I\u2019ve written over 278,000 words for this site so far, I think it\u2019s working for me.\n\nThe final \u201ccheat\u201d I\u2019ve discovered is to outsource your motivation. I don\u2019t have any discipline with the gym \u2013 I\u2019m a lazy bitch. So I pay an expensive powerlifting coach to keep me accountable and force me to keep making progress. I\u2019m not motivated so I literally hand him money to be motivated for me. I get to be a lazy bastard, knowing that as long as I\u2019m paying him, he will motivate me and push me and force me to reach my goals.\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling with your diet, pay someone to keep you accountable. If you\u2019re struggling to keep up a habit of hitting on girls, pay someone to keep you accountable. Stop relying on your own fleeting/non-existent discipline, and just pay someone else to be your external-discipline.\n\nMost of my coaching clients aren\u2019t super disciplined, but it doesn\u2019t matter. They\u2019re doing what I do with my strength coach; outsourcing their motivation to me. They pay me for weekly check-ins so I can keep them accountable and push them if they\u2019ve been lazy, and help them get back on track if they\u2019re in a rut. They know they sometimes struggle with discipline, so they pay me to be disciplined for them.\n\nAnd finally, I\u2019ve said this a million times \u2013 you can\u2019t assume I have my shit together all the time, just because I\u2019ve achieved a few goals. I\u2019m full of doubt, full of insecurities \u2013 that\u2019s just part of being a human. The only reason I appear to have my shit together is because my successes cover up my failures; my highs distract from my lows. I\u2019m also a very optimistic person who prefers to focus on the good, rather than get bogged down in the bad; so most of what I show you is my successes.\n\nThe only way I\u2019ve been able to achieve anything is by implementing all these little cheats, and figuring out ways to bypass discipline and willpower. Yes, I\u2019ve actively avoid discipline and willpower \u2013 I run from them. I\u2019m a lazy bastard, but I\u2019m also a cunning one \ud83d\ude09\n\nYou can do the same. Steal all of my cheats, and trick yourself into looking like a disciplined person. You can be a complete fucking trainwreck and still achieve great things. Being a bit of a loser doesn\u2019t exclude you from being a winner.\n\nGo out there and fucking win.\n\n\\-Andy", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kxllm4/discipline_willpower_dont_fucking_matter/", "title": "Discipline & Willpower Don\u2019t Fucking Matter", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "handyandypandy", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1610680061, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kxllm4/discipline_willpower_dont_fucking_matter/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437602.4229283, "replies_charged": false}
