We were close before dating, noticed that we just aren't in the right place to be together right now, and I made the leap to call it quits on the romantic relationship. I just realized after my last relationship, I was just hooking up with people to make myself feel better. I did it to forget that I was hurting and it helped in the moment, but it never fixed anything and changed my relationship with sex. Since dating my friend, my relationship with sex has gotten healthy again, but I kinda fucked up. I was just feeling sad and I hadn't had sex in a few months, so I hooked up with a friend and I'm sure that relationship is over now. It didn't even do anything for me, hooking up never really does. I just feel so empty. \n\nI want to do better for myself. I don't want to just need someone to \"fuck me better\" all the time. I honestly hate this about myself. I think it's important to also mention that I am bipolar and this need for sexual intimacy gets more intense depending on my mood. I don't want to be like this anymore. I honestly hate it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbif4m/how_do_i_stop_using_sex_as_a_coping_mechanism/", "title": "How do I stop using sex as a coping mechanism?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "-helpwanted", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 72, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634670352, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbif4m/how_do_i_stop_using_sex_as_a_coping_mechanism/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635436964.1298583, "replies_charged": false}
