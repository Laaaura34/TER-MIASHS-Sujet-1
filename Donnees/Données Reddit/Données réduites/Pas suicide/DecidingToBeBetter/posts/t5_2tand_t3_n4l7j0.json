Eating better, exercising, being nice to myself, all that jazz. And although I can see real results, I often get discouraged by all the work that is left. I suddently lack energy and have to pick myself up again. It feels like part of me is still resisting.\n\nDo you guys experience that too ? If yes, what do you do during those times ? What do you say to yourself ? Do you ask for help ? Do you have a special plan ? I found it hard to find a balance between resting and letting myself go !", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n4l7j0/what_do_you_do_when_its_starting_to_feel_like_too/", "title": "What do you do when it's starting to feel like too much ?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "cahdmus", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1620124823, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n4l7j0/what_do_you_do_when_its_starting_to_feel_like_too/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435292.1326091, "replies_charged": false}
