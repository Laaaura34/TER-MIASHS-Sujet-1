For the next year-year and a half, I helped my mom take care of my grandma, volunteered, and took lots of portraits and decided to pursue a photography career. From 23-26 I earned a second AA Degree in Business Management and worked a lot of student jobs. In 2016, I started working at  fast food restaurant with the idea that it would be for six month or so. Six months passed and I decided it would be responsible to stick it out for a year. Now it's been two years.\n\nI don't want to move up and become manager. I would say I'm officially bordering on complacent. I feel as if I've learned as much as I can there and want to find something new. It was good to know the service industry and I feel like I found a lot of personal growth. I've always been a late bloomer. I just don't know what to do though, I don't feel qualified to do anything else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow can I move forward? I think discovering that it is finally time to move on is \"Deciding To Be Better\" because I don't want to to keep on this way.
