Sometimes it is hard for me to remember or recollect the information within these books; underlining and/or highlighting helps, but sometimes I'm prone to get too crazy with it, haha.\n\nThis may sound silly or pathetic, I know. I love to read, and I didn't have this problem at one point; I don't know if it stems from depression or anxiety or what, but I miss truly enjoying reading. I feel like I still do enjoy it, but there's always this gnawing feeling, albeit small, inside me telling me that it's imperative I remember I've read everything.\n\nThis last Thursday, I had a breakthrough - I didn't experience this. I started two books (one I had read previously, and one I hadn't), and I found myself truly enjoying reading again, and I've retained what was said and what it meant to me. But I feel like I can improve, too, you know?\n\nThis may sound crazy, I don't know. I just want to improve in this regard right now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pmfa82/struggling_with_reading_and_retaining_information/", "title": "Struggling with reading and retaining information.
