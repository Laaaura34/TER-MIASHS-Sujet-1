Always failed people when they depended on me. It became a sort of complex that I lived with, constantly expecting and experiencing failure when other people felt sure I could handle things.\n\nIt was just recently I realized something. I have been willingly holding myself back, to prevent people from expecting things from me. I cultivated a persona of unreliability to avoid being pressured into doing more, into being more. \n\nIt's time I finally accept that I actually am more than what I've defined myself to be.
