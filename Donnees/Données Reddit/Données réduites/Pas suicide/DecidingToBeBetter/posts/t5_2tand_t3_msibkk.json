In putting on socks and getting back into an even semi normal routine. In walking down a driveway with no intentions, but to walk down the driveway.\n\nWalking. Walking alone has a freedom to it that I hadn't realised until now. Not much walking when you don't leave your cramped room but to get smokes and another bag. Walking is an act of freedom from addiction. Smoking. Talking. Socializing. Living, not just surviving. Even the mundane is a blessing when you haven't allowed yourself to experience it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/msibkk/decide_to_be_free/", "title": "Decide to be free", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "snootsame", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 18, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618626969, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/msibkk/decide_to_be_free/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435564.9172616, "replies_charged": false}
