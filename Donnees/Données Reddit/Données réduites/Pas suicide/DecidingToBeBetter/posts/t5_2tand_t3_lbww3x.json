I feel happy for her now, not like before when I felt sad and angry at myself.I feel peace, I feel love but not the dangerous one, I'm happy for her because she is my friend, and even though we are not meant to be together I will always be there for her, not taking any advantage. I found someone now, who makes me smile daily over face time and can't wait to meet her. If I never let go I would never had this chance. There is new sun shining on me now and I'm happy. Find your light, let go of the hurt laugh and smile \u2764\ufe0f", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lbww3x/let_go_of_my_old_love/", "title": "Let go of my old love", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "BlackRavenling", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612382954, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lbww3x/let_go_of_my_old_love/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435196.278639, "replies_charged": false}
