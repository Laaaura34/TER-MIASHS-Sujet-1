I feel unappreciated by my friends and bf. I realized I\u2019m definitely a giver. I do so much for all of the people in my life, and I speak through my love languages of giving gifts and quality time. \n\nMy bf and friends have seems to have been taking those aspects of me for granted. I was trying to plan a birthday gathering of around 7 people last month. It went through three phases of planning and replanning. I was going to give all my friends and bf\u2019s thank you letters for coming. I had ordered a whole wax stamp set and envelops just for the occasion. I had also planned return gifts to give them that individually matched their personality. But looking back my friends and bf didn\u2019t put it any or much effort to make the plan work. That felt disappointing. \n\nMy bf (M19) and I seem to be having communication issues. Lately it feels like he just avoids talking to me because he finds me to be the indirect source of his anxiety. I recently went through a traumatic event (my first post explains in detail) that many people blame part of him for. And ever since rather than feeling like a survivor of the situation, I just have been feeling like I\u2019ve caused more trouble and insecurity in him. It\u2019s a lonely feeling to be avoided by your own bf for several days to find out he\u2019s mad at you for something you read in your journal. \n\nHe apologized and admitted he was wrong. He said to judge him by his actions moving forward and it looks like he hasn\u2019t done anything to violate my privacy again. But I really have to say I\u2019m hurt deeply like that.\n\nMy parents have recently been blackmailing me on keeping me home. I recently found out that their blackmail is baseless. And I feel so hurt that they\u2019re willing to threaten to report a story that isn\u2019t theirs to the cops to keep me home. \n\nAfter saying all of that and talking through it I was finally able to see that I feel lonely. I just felt mad and sad before but now I can actually name it. \n\nSo I\u2019m taking time to myself and starting to journal again and spend more time alone. I\u2019m tired of just filling my time with noise and people who don\u2019t actually prioritize me like I prioritize them. And hopefully after some time I\u2019ll know how to address properly each aspect of my life. \n\nIt\u2019s a step to where I need to go and I\u2019m glad I found it because it felt lonely and lost these past few months.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k4e9vc/finally_admitting_i_feel_lonely_and_unappreciated/", "title": "Finally admitting I feel lonely and unappreciated in my relationships and deciding to do something about it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "watertaco47", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 27, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1606799344, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k4e9vc/finally_admitting_i_feel_lonely_and_unappreciated/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436886.4223328, "replies_charged": false}
