Recently I haven\u2019t been feeling good about myself and decided to better myself and become a person that I\u2019m proud of.\n\nI\u2019m on my third day of quitting all substances cold turkey, and I know that it\u2019s hard at first and it will get easier with time, but I just feel so bored. I\u2019ve quit everything  before for over 6 months but I started again when summer started. I\u2019m in my 20s and in college so I feel like this is the time where I want to do crazy things, go on adventures, and do fun stuff with my friends. The thing is that it almost always involves some kind of substance whether it\u2019s smoking or drinking. It\u2019s pretty hard to avoid those things especially when you\u2019re already having a good time. \n\nI do have goals that I want to work towards. I\u2019m studying environmental science and I hope to do something after college that will positively affect the environment. I started going to the gym again since I quit and want to build my physique. While going through a rough depression a few years ago I spent a lot of time studying philosophies/religions and looking for the answers to life. Along with my experiences with psychedelics I feel like I\u2019m at a good spot where I\u2019m just in constant amazement at the universe and our existence. I\u2019m fully comfortable with death and I know that my purpose in life is what I make out of it, and that my only true responsibility is to just be one with nature. I\u2019ve dabbled in things like Buddhism and stoicism which I want to implement into my daily life. Id also like to travel and explore the world and it\u2019s cultures before I\u2019m gone, as well as participate in volunteering and service to others. Ultimately I know that I want to spend my life pursuing self mastery, although you can never really get there and it\u2019s all about the journey.\n\nI guess I just have FOMO, I feel like by avoiding the things that are bad for me I\u2019ll have less fun with people. Or that people will stop reaching out to me because I\u2019m no longer into any of those things. It all just feels boring. Self mastery is supposed to be a fulfilling thing, and I know that everything I will ever experience is all a product of what goes on in my brain, and that I\u2019m in full control of that. But I can\u2019t help but feel that it\u2019s boring and I\u2019d rather be doing something else. Maybe I\u2019m just too accustomed to instant gratification and need to get used to self discipline. I\u2019m just so used to doing those things that I can\u2019t imagine something that is more fun to do. I can\u2019t think of things to replace my bad habits with that will make me feel excited. It\u2019s kinda like \u201cok I can pass that class, and get that six pack, and conquer these fears, but then what?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also kind of a validation thing, the feeling that my goals aren\u2019t really meaningful unless people see that I achieved them. I won\u2019t get as much satisfaction out of it if I keep it to myself, which I know is wrong and I really want to change. It\u2019s a big part of stoicism to not what others think. That includes their harsh opinions but it also includes their validation. This is kinda hard to explain but I hope I got my point across.
