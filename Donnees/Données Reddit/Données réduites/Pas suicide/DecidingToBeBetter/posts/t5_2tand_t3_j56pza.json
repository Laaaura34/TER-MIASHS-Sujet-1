I always need to see some success for it to make sense to pursue.\n\nWell, the case in hand that I've come with today, is that I'm trying to get my dating life together. While other people are totally fine to go on a date and they enjoy the whole thing, I am scared to even get a like on tinder, because I don't know what comes next. So since I have never tried it, I will \"not be good at it\". I'm afraid to make a fool of myself. Even on reddit with a totally anonymous throwaway account, I am afraid to start chats with strangers, because I am not doing \"well enough\".\n\nAny tips how to get rid of these feelings? How can I allow myself to fail and be fine with it?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j56pza/how_to_stop_trying_to_be_perfect_and_be/", "title": "How to stop trying to be perfect and be comfortable with making mistakes?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "srkdpu", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1601846020, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j56pza/how_to_stop_trying_to_be_perfect_and_be/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435995.6275182, "replies_charged": false}
