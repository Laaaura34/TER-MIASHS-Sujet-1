I ended up deleting the posts since at that point i had already relapsed and the posts weren\u2019t genuine since i was no longer clean. Throughout these weeks ive realized that I genuinely don\u2019t want to self harm anymore and I\u2019ve realized i have a problem that has honestly throughout the years turned into a slight addiction if anything and has massively took a toll on my mental health and who i am as a person. \n\nI will continue to try and keep this post up. And if i end up deleting it, I\u2019ll try again.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ld3bc0/6_weeks_clean_for_self_harm/", "title": "6 weeks clean for self harm.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Moneyopoly", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 79, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612515776, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ld3bc0/6_weeks_clean_for_self_harm/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437527.4683769, "replies_charged": false}
