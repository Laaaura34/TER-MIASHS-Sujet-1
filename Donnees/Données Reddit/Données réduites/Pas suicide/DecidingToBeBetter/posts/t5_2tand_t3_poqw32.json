My main goal was to get the citizenship and make life easier for myself and my siblings. I do not have any ambition in medicine and it was never what I wanted to do.\n\nThe issue with medicine is, on top of the long working hours, there is this constant need to keep up with the many requirements in order to progress to the next step. I feel extremely burnt out and I do not have any energy in me to put any more effort and compete with everyone else for residency spots.\n\nI have done some career coaching and talked to my supervisors and decided to start studying computer science as I continue to work. I have been looking for undergrad programmes for the past 3 years and I finally found one that has a flexible schedule. Even so, balancing both has been a real challenge and I have not been able to dedicate the time that computer science deserves.\n\nI have reached a point of genuine fatigue. I am in need of some serious advice. At this point, I am thinking of going back home (where I would definitely be unemployed). It is not easy for me to see the full picture at the moment \\^\\_\\^\n\nAny input would be much appreciated.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/poqw32/28_years_old_and_in_need_of_life_advice/", "title": "28 years old and in need of life advice.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Stuckinbluenight", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631715087, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/poqw32/28_years_old_and_in_need_of_life_advice/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435235.788846, "replies_charged": false}
