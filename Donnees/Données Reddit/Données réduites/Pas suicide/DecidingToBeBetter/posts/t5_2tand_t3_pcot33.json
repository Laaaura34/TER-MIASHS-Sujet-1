I was overweight, lazy, unfocused and not a productive member of society. \n\nWell 5 years ago I made a choice to stop playing the victim and to take action. I dusted off my high school qualifications - clawed my way into university. I hit the gym, got a half decent job, got my own home, car and dog. And I worked my ass off!!! \n\nToday after 4 years of university, many sacrifices and lots of hard work to position myself into the direction I needed to be\u2026 I was accepted onto a very competitive masters degree program that will open the door to my dream career. \n\nIn two years I hope to be a trainee Forensic Psychologist. \n\nAnd in five years I hope to add PhD to my title. \n\nIt feels so incredibly rewarding to sit and look back at where I was compared to where I am now. \n\nIt\u2019s a long road ahead but, I\u2019m more than ready, If you decide you want something badly enough - you\u2019ll get it! \n\nTo all of you out there sat wishing you could do or be more - I\u2019m living proof that it can be done! \n\nYou can do it - just decided right now that you can, make a plan and push forward. \n\nThank you all for the daily motivation!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcot33/5_years_ago_i_regretted_not_following_my_dream/", "title": "5 years ago I regretted not following my dream career path..", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "jayray2612", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 145, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630075647, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pcot33/5_years_ago_i_regretted_not_following_my_dream/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437439.7231805, "replies_charged": false}
