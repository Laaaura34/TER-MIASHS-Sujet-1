From my experience of getting ahead it\u2019s truly bliss because I don\u2019t have the pressure of rushing. I can work on an assignment for an hour having 2 days before it being due with more clarity and relaxation vs. having 6hrs doing an assignment feeling rushed, disconjointed  and stressed. I know it\u2019s old news but experiencing that is nice. Doing an hour of work with many breaks makes me want to do work, if that makes any sense. As I\u2019m writing I am procrastinating and have an assignment due in a few hours lol but now I\u2019m going to try and be more aware with my time.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jbab51/procrastination_reflection/", "title": "Procrastination reflection", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lanigir0", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1602711844, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jbab51/procrastination_reflection/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435631.684347, "replies_charged": false}
