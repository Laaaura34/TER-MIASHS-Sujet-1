And yet it just seems impossible some days.  It seems like every other day or every few days I shirk every responsibility (of the very few I have) in favor of gaming, social media, or any other type of media poison that isn\u2019t worth my time.  I know tricks i should do to get out of the funk when I realize it\u2019s happening and yet I make conscious decisions to keep wasting the day away.  Why can I not make the right decisions when they are right in front of me.  I now have to wake up early tomorrow and finish 5 chapters of work in order to have a chance at passing a class I need to graduate, FML.  Why do I do this to myself.  I\u2019m going to find a way to push through it tomorrow, but it\u2019d be a hell of a lot easier if I did some of it today.  If anyone\u2019s read through this and have any tips it\u2019d be greatly appreciated.
