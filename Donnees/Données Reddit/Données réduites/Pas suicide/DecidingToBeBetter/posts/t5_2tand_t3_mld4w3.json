I\u2019ve been a sugar addict with a huge craving for anything sweet and sugary nearly my entire life. At age 14 I was borderline obese and had deep self esteem problems. I\u2019m now nearly 18 and while I\u2019ve lost some weight since then and am now living a more healthy lifestyle, I want to be better and FINALLY quit dragging this dead weight of a habit with me. I\u2019m making this post in hopes it will keep my motivation up and make me hold myself accountable so I don\u2019t give up in hard times. \nI have no doubt this is going to be a hard journey, and I\u2019ve just come out of Easter break where I\u2019ve been very lax on the restraint and control when it comes to the sweets. BUT I\u2019ll keep trying even if I stumble. \nCheers to better habits and a better life. <3", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mld4w3/today_is_the_day_i_take_the_first_step_to/", "title": "Today is the day I take the first step to quitting my lifetime candy addiction", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "crowbar543", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617719910, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mld4w3/today_is_the_day_i_take_the_first_step_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435882.8811717, "replies_charged": false}
