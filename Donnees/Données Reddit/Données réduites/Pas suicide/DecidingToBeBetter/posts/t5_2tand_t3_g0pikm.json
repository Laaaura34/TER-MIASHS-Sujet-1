I keep thinking this will pass, good times will come. But looking back at journals from when I was 12-13, I was stuck in the same negative thought patterns then that govern my life now. Maybe I think I invite sadness and don't allow myself to grow. I don't know any other way of being. My life has been pretty normal - a little uncertainity with studies/career here and a little heartache from failed relationships there - but nothing that should result in the complete and debilitating sadness that has enveloped me. \n\nI simply refuse to be sad anymore. I deserve joy. I deserve to be happy, to smile, and to enjoy what life brings my way. At this point nobody can help me but me. I need to choose joy over melancholy everyday until this is my new way of life. I want to get my life together and make my family proud. I want to be proud of myself. Every single day for the next 365 days I am going to choose to be joyful and make the best of every situation. No matter how hard it may be, I will not allow myself to wallow in self-pity. When life drags you down, there is simply nothing to do but to shake it off and get back on your feet again. \n\nAsking the universe for strength, \nS\n\n14th April 2020", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g0pikm/i_21f_have_been_depressed_for_most_of_my/", "title": "I (21F) have been depressed for most of my adult/teen life.
