Since my usual commute hours (which is 2 hours) to work is removed from my daily morning set-up, I now tend to wake up maybe 30 mins before work. I tried waking up like the usual time, pre-covid days, but I always sleep over my alarm. I tried also putting my alarm away from me where I have to stand up to dismiss it, I still went back to sleep without me noticing it, like I turn it off half asleep. I also notice that I am less productive now, I always cram before deadlines, have no motivation to do work, and more exhausted than ever. Most of the time I just procastinate but I still feel so exhausted, more exhausted in fact even before covid happened.\n\nMy work-life balance is so messed up. I used to be a homebody but now I hate being home because I feel like it means work. I don't even enjoy the things/hobbies I used to enjoy. I feel like I should be working instead of doing other things.\n\nI am a workaholic even pre-covid, but it's taken a toll on my since I constantly worry about it now since I do it at home. I used to see home as somewhere to relax, but now my home is where I get stressed a lot.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/opuyr3/my_morning_routine_is_ruined_since_the_pandemic/", "title": "My morning routine is ruined since the pandemic, and it's affecting a lot of my daily life.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "aprrsr", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627014927, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/opuyr3/my_morning_routine_is_ruined_since_the_pandemic/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435266.5220337, "replies_charged": false}
