Lately I\u2019ve asked people this, and the only answer they have to support their answer is \u201cbecause it just doesn\u2019t work that way/sometimes, you just CAN\u2019T be happy\u201d\n\n\u2026but why?\n\nso I challenged myself. If I want to feel good, I\u2019m going to do just that - I\u2019m going to feel good. I\u2019m not going to let anyone tell me that \u201cbecause it\u2019s the way it is\u201d is an appropriate or scientific answer to why I can\u2019t.\n\nThis might seem very ignorant and simple, but it\u2019s something I\u2019m trying and really want to succeed with. I just really want to feel good, and I think it\u2019s totally possible. This is me deciding to be better because I want to. This is me actually choosing to feel mentally well.\n\nI guess I\u2019m looking for an actual answer to the question \u201cwhy can\u2019t you just be happy?\u201d, so if you\u2019ve got one, I\u2019d love to hear it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pmvqr1/choosing_happiness/", "title": "Choosing happiness", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "cordharmonie", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631463622, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pmvqr1/choosing_happiness/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437053.2634518, "replies_charged": false}
