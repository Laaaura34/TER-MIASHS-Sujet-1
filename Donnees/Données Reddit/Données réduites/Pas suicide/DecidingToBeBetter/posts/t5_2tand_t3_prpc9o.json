Thank you for choosing to do the things that are best for me even though all those corrosive old habits seem so tempting and easy. Thank you for supporting me on this journey as I learn to better appreciate and understand myself. \n\nI truly love you, me.\n\nAnd thank you, stranger, for taking the time to read my little tale! \n\nWhat are some nice words that you would like to share with yourself in this moment?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/prpc9o/thank_you_me/", "title": "Thank you, me..", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "pennykie", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 686, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632120342, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/prpc9o/thank_you_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436255.0446072, "replies_charged": false}
