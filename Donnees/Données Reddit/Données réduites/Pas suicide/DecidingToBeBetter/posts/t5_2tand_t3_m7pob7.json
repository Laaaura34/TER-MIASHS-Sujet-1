I have been in multiple emotional abusive relationships where it has left me feeling inadequate and unlovable. I\u2019m going to skip the details of that but after my last relationship which ended very badly on March 13, I finally realized that I could not heal on my own and did not want to revert back to destructive and reckless behavior. I genuinely wanted to get better and love myself, also I wanted to fix my strained relationship with my mom. I sought out professional help and had my first therapy session today. I feel fantastic but I know there is still a long way to go. Baby steps I guess. I didn\u2019t know where else to share this but I thought this community would be a great place to share. I am proud of myself and for the first time I feel genuinely happy without having to depend on anyone else. To those struggling out there, you can do it!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m7pob7/after_years_of_being_depressed_and_suffering_from/", "title": "After years of being depressed and suffering from anxiety, after multiple failed romances due to emotional abuse, and after having a strained relationship with my mom I finally sought help", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "rivalslink", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1199, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616070328, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m7pob7/after_years_of_being_depressed_and_suffering_from/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437460.0101204, "replies_charged": false}
