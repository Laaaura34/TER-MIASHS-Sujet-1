Having gotten out of a LTR of 6 years followed by 2 more of back and forth confusion, I've finally started to break away from my toxic 'situationship' and focus on me. I even road tripped solo last November and found that I didn't feel alone at all on the trip but instead was actually having a lot of fun jamming to music while driving, site seeing, listening to audiobooks for entertainment and personal growth (I highly recommend Jay Shetty's Think Like a Monk) and overall just enjoying being with my own company. It's something that I still work on even today. \n\nI will admit that I do miss having someone to talk to in a somewhat daily basis and to just talk about the day to. I deleted dating apps a few weeks ago after some personal family issues came into my life but also I feel that I'm not really ready to be dating or jumping into a relationship yet. \n\nSo I'm curious, how have other people worked on their feeling of loneliness that doesn't resort to trying to meet/hook up with people? I want to keep growing internally and I would prefer not to go into (my opinion at least) unhealthy habits that will give me temporary satisfaction. \n\nThanks a bunch.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lap494/how_to_deal_with_loneliness/", "title": "How to deal with loneliness?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "anguy044", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612246269, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lap494/how_to_deal_with_loneliness/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438115.1586747, "replies_charged": false}
