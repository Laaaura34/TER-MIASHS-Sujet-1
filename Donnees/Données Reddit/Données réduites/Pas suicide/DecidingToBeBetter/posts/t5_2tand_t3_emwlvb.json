I joined a sport, started learning guitar, and go to the gym but none of this really makes me feel whole. Every time i try to be productive, its something seemingly insignificant and only leaves me temporarily feeling better about myself. Eventually, i always end up playing video games and feeling shitty. Maybe i havent stuck with anything long enough to truly appreciate it, but I\u2019m not passionate about anything really. I think i want to start a business. I am still thinking about different ideas and what I would want to do and if that idea could be done from a dorm room. I hope is a more successful approach to the lack of purpose ive dealt with for years.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/emwlvb/i_want_something_fulfilling/", "title": "I want something fulfilling", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tordilla", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1578687839, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/emwlvb/i_want_something_fulfilling/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436723.8065357, "replies_charged": false}
