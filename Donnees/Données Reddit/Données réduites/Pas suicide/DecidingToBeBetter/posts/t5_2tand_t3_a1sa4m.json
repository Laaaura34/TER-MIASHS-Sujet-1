You don\u2019t really know what self-improvement is**\n\nA lot of people in the self-help community seem to think that self-improvement means reading books and sharing quotes on social media.\nJust to be really clear, here\u2019s what self-improvement means :\nthe improvement of one\u2019s knowledge, status, or character by one\u2019s own efforts.\nSelf-improvement doesn\u2019t just mean knowing a lot of stuff to feel like you\u2019re smart. It means learning to develop your character and your mindset to get better results in life.\nThe ultimate goal is to get results, not just theoretical knowledge that you never use.\n\n**2. You don\u2019t really know what you want**\n\nI see a lot of questions on Quora asking something like \u201cHow can I be a better person ?\u201d \u201cHow can I improve myself ?\u201d or \u201cHow to improve my life ?\u201d\nDo you really think there\u2019s a right answer to such questions ? The questions are too broad and not specific enough.\nWanting to improve is a good thing, but being too broad about it won\u2019t get you anywhere. You have to know exactly what you want in order to get it.\n\n**3. You want to improve everything at once**\n\nSimilar to #2, some people just want to do everything at the same time. They ask questions like \u201cHow do I become more confident, build my self-esteem and find my purpose in life ?\u201d\nDo you see how rich the question is ? It\u2019s too cluttered.\nYou can\u2019t improve everything at the same time. You have to improve on aspect of yourself at a time so you don\u2019t get overwhelmed.\n\n**4. You\u2019re all about the theory**\n\nYou like consuming as much content as possible. You like reading books, watching youtube videos and all that because it gives you a false sense of satisfaction.\nBasically you learn a lot, research a lot, but you don\u2019t apply anything.\n\n**5. You\u2019re too impatient**\n\nYou want to become a better person and you want it now. Instead of going through the process of change, you want to improve yourself overnight which is nearly impossible.\nThe truth is that changing yourself takes time and effort. You can\u2019t become a whole different person overnight.\n\n**6. You don\u2019t commit to one specific outcome**\n\nThis usually happens like this : Let\u2019s say you want to become more confident. You read a book or watch a video to learn how you can do it, you remember one or two things from that, you try one or two things for a few days, you totally forget about it afterwards and then you say that it doesn\u2019t work.\nWell, it doesn\u2019t work like that. To get a result, you have to be consistent. You can\u2019t expect anything if you try something for a few days then you forget about it.\nI see a lot of people saying that \u201cself-help doesn\u2019t work\u201d when all they do is read a book without even trying what it says and then you find them saying \u201cthe book sucks\u201d.\nIf you want to get fit, you don\u2019t go to the gym for a few days then you say that gym doesn\u2019t work. That would be crazy !\nSame thing here. Self-improvement requires constant effort. That\u2019s the only way of making a positive change within yourself.\n\n**7. You always look for shortcuts**\n\nYou\u2019re constantly looking for the next \u201ctip\u201d or \u201chack\u201d to success, confidence or happiness. That\u2019s one of the biggest mistakes you could make. If you\u2019re always looking for the \u201ceasy way\u201d to improve, you never will.\nThere\u2019s an old saying that goes like this : \u201cNot everything that shines is gold\u201d. That\u2019s exactly the case with these \u201ctips\u201d you often get. They might be shiny, but they\u2019re not gold.\nThose \u201chacks\u201d are just shallow pieces of advice, they won\u2019t get you anywhere. The reason why they\u2019re so attractive by the way is because they seem so easy, and we often like to avoid putting the effort, so it seems like the perfect solution while in fact, it couldn\u2019t be further away from it.\nThe bottom line is : stop looking for shortcuts.\n\n**8. You\u2019re not following a specific plan**\n\nThis means that you know what you want but you don\u2019t know how to get there. If you want a certain outcome, it\u2019s not enough to know what you want to improve, it\u2019s also very important to know how you\u2019re going to get there.\nFor example transitioning from someone who\u2019s insecure to a person who\u2019s super confident without having a clear-cut set of steps is extremely hard.\nWhat I\u2019m saying is you must have a plan to be effective.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a1sa4m/here_are_the_worst_mistakes_that_are_stopping_you/", "title": "Here Are The Worst Mistakes That Are Stopping You From Improving Yourself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "rafikGk21", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 571, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1543583346, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a1sa4m/here_are_the_worst_mistakes_that_are_stopping_you/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438149.169105, "replies_charged": false}
