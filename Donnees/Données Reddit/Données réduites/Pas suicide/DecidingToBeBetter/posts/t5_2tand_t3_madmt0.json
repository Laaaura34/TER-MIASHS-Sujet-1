Whether it's creative work like writing stories or attracting the interest of people, the thing that defines what I am as a person always ends up being \"not the right fit,\" \"i don't feel any chemistry,\" or something similar.\n\nIt's like I can't develop any better habits in exercise or submissions or the like because it feels like it won't matter without subjectivity. And subjective appeal is what I am missing the most. \n\nWhat do I have to do to gain the *potential* to be someone's \"right fit\" in something? Often, people act like saying \"it's not personal; it's subjective\" is supposed to be comforting, but it just makes me feel gross and hateful of myself knowing that, like always, I failed at subjectivity or being \"the right fit.\"", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/madmt0/my_entire_life_ive_hated_that_so_much_is/", "title": "My entire life, I've hated that so much is controlled by subjectivity.
