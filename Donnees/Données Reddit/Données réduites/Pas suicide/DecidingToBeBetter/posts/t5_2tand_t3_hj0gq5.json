Due to CPTSD, I have a lot of painful memories, trauma and fractured pieces of self that carry emotions which can arise in me. I\u2019ve recently begun to practice Jodo Shinshu Buddhism, this has helped me a lot. \n\nI am constantly harassed in my mind by fears and pain, but ever since I begun my chanting practice, I find that I can stop more often and say \u201cI am okay, I don\u2019t have to worry so much\u201d even now as I type I am fearfully worrying but at least I am aware of it and try not to let it beat me down. It all passes and arises and passes again. Some days I realize this better than others!\n\nBut today I was proud of myself, I was trying to calculate something, and I am poorly educated so it was hard to focus on the numbers. I said out loud to my mom \u201cI am getting frustrated, hold on.\u201d instead of breaking down over something small like I usually do I was able to calmly step back and then keep going!\n\nJodo Shinshu helped me find a calm and meaning in my life. Something that says \u201chey it\u2019s alright, just as you are.\u201d", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hj0gq5/noticed_when_i_was_getting_frustratedsad_and/", "title": "Noticed when I was getting frustrated/sad and calmly addressed instead of getting out of hand also finding meaning in life.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "WalkWhereFlowersGrow", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1593565818, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hj0gq5/noticed_when_i_was_getting_frustratedsad_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435788.5707257, "replies_charged": false}
