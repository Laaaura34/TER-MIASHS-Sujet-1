It makes me feel good about everything in my life. Like my life is exactly as it should be.\n\nBecause of my practice, I am able to utilize my resources more effectively. I make purchase decisions more based on what's truly valuable to my family and me and have a much deeper sense of the value of things, which wasn't something I was taught growing up. \n\nI feel healthier and that my mood is better. \n\nAll these things have a positive ripple effect on every other area of my life. \n\nOnce you make a conscious effort to have a gratitude practice, even for 5 or 10 minutes a day (make sure you're doing it properly; like anything, there are healthy and unhealthy ways to practice it), it will naturally become a part of your thinking and who you are, which is a beautiful thing.\n\nNow, I notice myself just naturally having thoughts that spark gratitude and appreciation throughout my days.\n\nIf you value health, wellbeing, good relationships, fulfillment, and success, then a gratitude practice is definitely for you.\n\nIf enough interest is shown I will write a separate post on how to have a healthy gratitude practice, and the pitfalls to avoid. :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o1byk7/how_to_have_a_better_life/", "title": "How to Have a Better Life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TheKuzzinator", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 15, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623868597, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o1byk7/how_to_have_a_better_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435400.2107313, "replies_charged": false}
