I always feel like men are horrible and most of them have porn addictions and do nothing but play video games all day. Everytime I feel like I want to try dating, I end up getting disappointed because most men end up wanting to use me. I am at a point where I don't want to date anymore and feel like I can't form healthy relationships with any of them. How do I stop being this way?\n\nEdit: Just to clarify my problem isn't with dating, I couldn't care less about what single men think about this because I am not trying to impress them. My problem is that I am starting to hate every single male in existence and I often have violent thoughts. This became more clear to me when I started realizing I often let out my frustrations and scream at my younger brother when he has nothing to do with what I went through. I feel like I have become the abuser. \nI'll be disabling comment reply notifications now because many of them are just attacking me, but if you actually have something nice and helpful to say then you can message me I guess. Funnily enough the comments are not helping and are making me hate men even more", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/", "title": "How do I stop hating men?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "neonbuttrfly", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 467, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635291244, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436917.965912, "replies_charged": false}
