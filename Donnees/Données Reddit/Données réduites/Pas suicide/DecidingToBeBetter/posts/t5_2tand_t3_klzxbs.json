After being addicted to cutting, a suicide attempt, being hospitalized, I thought it would be all over. But no. I've now become severely depressed, and I began cutting again after stopping for almost three months. I feel like a lifeless zombie, and I am slowly feeling suicidal again. The worst thing is, I have nobody in my family to talk to. I don't trust any of them, so I am basically trapped with these burdens. \n\nBut guess what? I am going to get better. After all I've been through I want to get better. I have a routine that I do everyday. I read, write, meditate, yoga and train. My routine is one of the reasons I am this optimistic still, even though I barely can get myself to lift the glass of water to drink sometimes. I've called my doctor, so hopefully I will be get some antidepressants. \n\nI wanted to tell you this, since I rarely talk to anyone at home, and expressing my feelings feels great. I just want to say there is light at the end of the tunnel. But sometimes it can be hard to see in the distance when depression darkens your surroundings.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/klzxbs/deciding_to_get_better_despite_wanting_to_give_up/", "title": "Deciding to get better, despite wanting to give up.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "uvuvwevwevweugwembe", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1609192345, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/klzxbs/deciding_to_get_better_despite_wanting_to_give_up/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437602.7596812, "replies_charged": false}
