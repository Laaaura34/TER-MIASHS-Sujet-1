I assume lots of people deal with this, so hopefully there's lots of advice to go around.\n\nI don't enjoy working. I don't hate my job and by a lot of standards, I'm quite spoiled. It's a great environment.\n\nI just... don't care. There are a thousand other things I would rather be doing that don't pay the bills: eating, sleeping, friends, books, games, movies, exercise, etc. I live a very full life outside of work and if I ever won the lotto, I'd just quit and do more of that. \n\nI also likely have some mild/moderate ADHD. I'm forgetful, get distracted very easy, fixate on the wrong things, etc.\n\nI don't want to be a workaholic. I'm never going to want some high-stress job. But I DO actually want to be seen as a reliable and capable person. I'd like to not be a burden on my coworkers. I would also like to make a little more money.\n\nSo... tips on doing better?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qc1t2h/working_when_i_dont_care/", "title": "Working when I don't care?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "graciepaper", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634739190, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qc1t2h/working_when_i_dont_care/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436275.4937963, "replies_charged": false}
