Academics was what I was really good at although Ive always wanted to play guitar. (Parents didnt let me bc of school and it's the same reason I held myself back with art as well)\nI've been down bad to the point where I can barely focus.\n I'm 21 y/o first year engineering student , behind in all my classes and top of the line procrastinator (who has an exam next next week lmao) who wants to change their life around. I'm getting my guitar:) I want to continue sketching and I want to pass everything this semester.  I'm in no position to get A's but passing is enough until I get a hold of myself. \n\nWhere do I start? How do I do it? I want to be better for my future.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n0v1pj/how_do_i_pick_myself_up_as_a_former_gifted_kid/", "title": "How do I pick myself up as a former gifted kid?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Proper_Actuator_2415", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619664020, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n0v1pj/how_do_i_pick_myself_up_as_a_former_gifted_kid/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436821.31392, "replies_charged": false}
