Taking care of my joints and ligaments, something I never even considered previously, has suddenly become a critical component of my exercise routine.\n\nSo I\u2019ve been thinking: what other aspects of my health have I either overlooked or taken for granted, and are there preventative/behavioral things I can do now to \u201cage gracefully?\u201d\n\nA few that came to mind:\n- Dental care\n- Lower back care\n- Limiting sugar intake\n- Meditating and disconnecting\n- Sleep hygiene\n\nI don\u2019t plan on tackling everything at once, but I wanted to be aware of what I might be missing. Any thoughts?
