Sometimes even when I\u2019m not trying to be, I\u2019ve been told I sound aggressive. I\u2019ve had issues with my anger and emotions in the past but I have always been aware of that worked on it as best as I can. I\u2019ve gotten better, but I can still get better.\n\nThere are things I\u2019ve done in my past that I\u2019m not really proud of. Not like hurting anyone physically or something illegal, but I feel like I\u2019ve been an asshole a lot to ppl for no reason. Just for getting under my skin. Stupid shit.\n\nSometimes bad shit happens to me in life and always think about how I treated certain ppl in my life. Like thats why this shit is happening to you. I\u2019ve always shown love to those I care about, but when sometimes I\u2019ve been a dick.\n\nI always think about it like damn I\u2019m a bad person. Then I try to think positively like no I\u2019m not, I\u2019ve done x,y, and z but the negative thoughts always creep in.\n\nFeelings of regret, disappointment, ashamed, angry. Ppl even tell me \u201cyou look and sound like a mean dude\u201d\n\nI just don\u2019t wanna be known like that. I wanna be able to forgive myself and be normal. How can I be better? I know its unpopular on Reddit, but I believe in God and I know shit is more complex than heaven and hell, I always get shook because I\u2019m afraid God won\u2019t forgive me. \n\nI feel like this is my biggest downfall and failure. I need to get better at handling conflict. I need to be more loving and accepting and open minded. I need to be better at not losing my cool quickly.\n\nMy problem is idk how to even start doing that. I know It probably sounds dumb, but I just don\u2019t understand how I can do this and do it CONSISTENTLY. \n\nI was just hoping maybe some ppl on here could help.
