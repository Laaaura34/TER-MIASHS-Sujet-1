It was only early this year I decided to seeing a psychologist.\n\nWhile at times this has helped me understand a lot about how we think and process things and steps to take to improve my mood, I still feel as though my baseline is about a 3/10 most days.\n\nThe next step I feel is logical to take is to see how I go on antidepressants,\n\nMy question is, what has your experience been with them? Do they work? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o3d3lh/23yo_male_with_depression_and_anxiety_have/", "title": "23yo male with depression and anxiety.
