For the past few years I\u2019ve struggled with depression/anxiety/OCD. I\u2019ve used all sorts of drugs to drown out those feelings and this past year began drinking very heavily. After many blackouts, failed attempts to quit, close calls with the law, embarrassing those around me as well as myself, and some outpatient treatment that has been mostly ineffective, I am headed to a rehab center in Florida for 6 weeks that treats for dual diagnosis, both mental illness as well as substance abuse. \n\nMy family and friends have done what they can to help me but it\u2019s ultimately up to me to change. I\u2019m not sure what to think of the situation now. I really don\u2019t want to go but am attempting to keep an open mind and positive outlook. I\u2019m a bit nervous as well. I\u2019ll be quitting alcohol, nicotine, and xanax, as those are the main things I use. It certainly gives me hope to read other stories and tips in this subreddit, because I do want to improve my life and be the best person I can be. I guess I just wanted to ask you guys for any advice you have\u2026 feel free to ask questions about anything.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nzbwut/headed_to_rehab_saturday_morning_not_sure_what_to/", "title": "Headed to rehab Saturday morning.
