I think it's because I feel ashamed of it and try to forget the embarrassing things I did to get through. This year, I found myself being borderline narcissistic. I always wanted to see people's reactions and that can only happen when I grab their attention by showing off or by making challenging and, sometimes, problematic opinions. It didn't help that I hated searching the web about self-improvement because all I see are people teaching other people to avoid narcissists. \n\nDrinking 3 times a week. \n\nSurfing social media for the whole day.\n\nI just can't try smoking because of health reasons.\n\nBut now that I'm back with my calm thinking, I think I acted like that because I know I need something but can't figure out what is it specifically\u2014just like how parents spoil their children when all they need is to help them regulate their emotions and accept them as they surge. I often remind myself that, it helps me realize what I really need in different situations.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt2nhw/now_i_know_my_narcissistic_tendencies/", "title": "Now I know My Narcissistic Tendencies", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "kalagmitan", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632297108, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt2nhw/now_i_know_my_narcissistic_tendencies/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435783.144648, "replies_charged": false}
