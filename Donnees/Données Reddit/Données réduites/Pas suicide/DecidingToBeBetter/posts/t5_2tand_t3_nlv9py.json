I fought some demons, new and old and came out on top. I have a good work ethic now, I have a good paying job, I'm going onto my final year of university, my confidence is back, I have a work out routine, I'm eating again, I'm surrounded by people I actually want to have around - that are supportive and good people, I'm becoming the sort of person I would want around, I've started dating a girl who is an absolute angel, I've actually got plans for the future where a few months ago I honestly couldn't see a future at all, I understand life and the ups and downs so much more now, I understand people a lot more and at the end of it all I am just thankful, and blessed. I'm excited to see where this road leads :) \n\nIt's really something when you start to see the beauty in life\n\nStay blessed all of youuuuu", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nlv9py/finally_getting_there/", "title": "Finally getting there...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ProperGloom", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622074415, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nlv9py/finally_getting_there/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435564.002568, "replies_charged": false}
