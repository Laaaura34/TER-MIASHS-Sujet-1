I thought my happiness, my worthiness and security would come from someone other than myself. I often wondered why I was feeling unhappy, worthless and insecure. I am finally learning that I'm the writer of my own story and I am the only one that can give myself what I need. I need to love myself first, which isn't an easy thing to do, but I'm making major steps in the right direction. I feel more confident and complete than I ever have in my life. I'm excited about continuing the journey of finding myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iu9vw6/finally_learning_that_im_responsible_for_my_own/", "title": "Finally learning that I'm responsible for my own happiness.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MrsKHall", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 35, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1600307557, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iu9vw6/finally_learning_that_im_responsible_for_my_own/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437089.3541806, "replies_charged": false}
