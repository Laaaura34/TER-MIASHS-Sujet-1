I've had a couple of med and dosage changes, and I am now in the process of slowly tapering myself off the meds\n\nI now know for a fact that these meds work. While there have been ups and downs, I've managed to actually enjoy things such as TV shows for the first in who knows how long. I've also found incredible consistency with self care and exercise. For example, my colleagues and I had a challenge to run or walk a total of 110km during the month of July. I ended up doing 183km in total, ranking just below an ultra marathoner and a triathlete. The longest I'd ever ran before that was 5km and it damn near killed me. \n\nI now want to find out if I can keep this up without the meds, since some of the side effects have been troublesome. If I can't, I think I'd still be okay getting back on the meds and having them be a constant part of my life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p95sd1/6_month_update_i_went_to_a_psychiatrist_today/", "title": "6 month update: I went to a psychiatrist today.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Julmannen", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629605440, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p95sd1/6_month_update_i_went_to_a_psychiatrist_today/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437502.9111683, "replies_charged": false}
