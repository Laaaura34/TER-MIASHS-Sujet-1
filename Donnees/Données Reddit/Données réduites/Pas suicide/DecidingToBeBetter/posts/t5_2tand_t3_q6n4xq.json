I can quickly identify red flags and abusers, and I say no to them and walk away without guilt.  I\u2019ve started on Wellbutrin to get out of my depression, and I\u2019m managing my anxiety better.  \n\nThe challenge I\u2019m having now is that I\u2019ve found a good group of people but I never learned how to emotionally connect and be vulnerable.  They\u2019re patient with me, and they somewhat know my history.  But I can tell that sometimes they expect me to open up in return, share my insecurities as a way to connect, and I either completely miss it in the moment or I overshare and push them away.  \n\nHas anyone had any luck navigating this?  A childhood of emotional neglect has left me without the tools to inherently understand it so I\u2019m learning the hard way.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q6n4xq/being_more_open_and_vulnerable/", "title": "Being more open and vulnerable?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Stroopwafellitis", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634048097, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q6n4xq/being_more_open_and_vulnerable/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437445.1589031, "replies_charged": false}
