My girlfriend broke up with me. I failed college. I failed the businesses I pursued. I got addicted to porn. I watched everybody around me prosper while I just continue to get stuck and fail. I did not feel good about myself at all.\n\nBut I decided to heal. During these tough times, I decided to focus on myself and be better. I now understand that I am accountable for my actions and reactions; that I deserve all the L I took, that it was necessary for me to fail for me to grow. Despite it being the worst year ever for me, it somehow opened my eyes and now, I understand myself better. I know I still have a long way to go, and I am hoping everything will fall into place eventually but right now, I am just trying to be the best version of myself and continue to work on that.\n\nThere are 4 months left of 2021, for better or for worse, I want to make them count.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/plfgej/the_best_worst_year/", "title": "The Best Worst Year", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Joskupo", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 30, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631254775, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/plfgej/the_best_worst_year/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437877.9359488, "replies_charged": false}
