Due to quarantaine I'm gaining weight. I sleep late, I wake up late. I don't have any routine, even on days I have to work until 2pm or 4pm sometimes. I was moody, low on energy and I've been drinken so much, it kinda gets absurd. So that was my situation.\n\nI was in a mood to watch the Red Hot Chili Peppers live at Slane Castle, which was my favourite dvd when I was a kid. I hadn't watched it in ages and I suddenly felt like a kid again. I was bouncing around the room and was full of life. I remember Flea walking on stage in a handstand (can't remember what concert that was) and I thought to myself \"that's the coolest shit ever I should learn that\". So for the following days I just tried doing handstands all day. That turned into little workouts and walks during the day. I started keeping my room clean again. I'm not negative anymore and I just wanna keep going and keep improving things in my room and of myself. Next step is cleaning up my diet. I feel great, life is great.
