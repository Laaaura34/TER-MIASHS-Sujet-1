They\u2019re sad. If they didn\u2019t like sadness, they would pop-right out of it saying \u201cOh shit. I was sad. I want to be happy now.\u201d But they continue to go deeper into their sadness. Deeper and deeper.\n\nImagine a world where you could solve someone\u2019s problem (mental or otherwise). Now imagine the long-line outside of your home of people waiting for you to solve their problems. Now imagine that you couldn\u2019t ever solve anyone\u2019s problems. Imagine the weight lifted off your shoulders. You can\u2019t make everyone happy, and you can\u2019t make anyone happy. You can make someone smile while they\u2019re in your presence, but happiness fades away if the container is broken. So is it your job to mend it? How much will you continue to mend? What exactly is your methodology of creating no-sadness. Or no stickiness to sadness. No blues. No rhythm. No art. No music. Sadness is a creative force, even though you don\u2019t want to do anything when you\u2019re sad. Sadness can be everlasting, and some people can die living their whole lives in sadness, or even kill themselves.\n\nWhat if no-one could make you smile, but your own self. What if the answer is hidden in the self. What if everything so far has been a hoax, and now needs you to master your own, in order to just be happy and in bliss. You don\u2019t need to tell anyone to be happy, they just are. And when they\u2019re sad, you can\u2019t help them. Let go of wanting to make someone happy all the time, and you\u2019ll realize that you\u2019re now just happier.
