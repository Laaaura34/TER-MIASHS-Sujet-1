The thing you reach for to fill the moments when it\u2019s uncomfortable to be with your thoughts. Is it social media? TV? Weed? Booze? Alcohol? Which distraction feels better than those thoughts you're hiding from?\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. Your mind is your home. It\u2019s the home only you can clean, the only demon you can\u2019t escape, the voice track you can never turn off.\n\nThich Nhat Hanh says when we neglect our mind for too long it becomes messy. When we move from one distraction to the next, there\u2019s no time to mow your mental lawn. You can\u2019t do the mental dishes, vaccuum your mental carpet. Life\u2019s pains make us track in all kinds of muck from day to day. It doesn\u2019t stay clean just because you\u2019re not looking at it.\n\nIt\u2019s not fun to clean though. You have to be present with your thoughts and emotions. You have to listen closely to the pain and fear, understand what relationships are worrying or stressing you. It is very hard to resolve these things without feeling, processing, understanding. It\u2019s the right path forward, but it is uncomfortable. \n\nWhen you have free time and you feel almost panicky without something to do? When you\u2019re feeling anxious about something and you scroll through apps or lose yourself in video games? When the pain is too much and that bottle of wine blesses you with numbness and apathy?\n\nThese are your crutches. These are the tools you use to cover up the thoughts and feelings you can\u2019t deal with. These are you deciding that you\u2019ll put off cleaning your mental home for one more day.\n\nI have my own crutches too. I\u2019m so tired of wanting to be numb. I\u2019m tired of reaching for crutches that keep me from feeling. It\u2019s true that life hurts. Life never stops hurting. There\u2019s never a point that you figure it out and things get easy. But how much pain have I already blotted over with White Out? If I keep covering things up I don\u2019t know how much will actually be left. If you censor every uncomfortable feeling in your life then you\u2019ll never figure out where they\u2019re coming from. If you refuse to look at blood then you can\u2019t find the wound and heal it.\n\nWe\u2019re not bad people. We\u2019re not weak. We haven\u2019t wasted our lives. It just takes time to realize these kinds of crutches are holding us back, not holding us up. You are allowed to sit with the pain. You can put it into words in a journal too, if you want to understand them a little better. What I\u2019ve found is asking/searching for help is much easier after you can articulate the pain a bit. You\u2019re not the first one who has felt these things. Other people put down their crutches and healed, we can too.\n\nSo take a good look at your crutches. Things that steal you away from the present moment and things you run to when the present doesn\u2019t feel good. I think it\u2019s time to put those down. Life is happening now. The ups are intertwined with the downs. Let\u2019s stop hiding from the downs, because you\u2019re missing a lot more than you realize.\n\n**Further Reading**: If this post resonated with you then I\u2019d recommend the book Radical Acceptance by Tara Brach. She taught me how to accept the painful feelings I was trying to escape. You don\u2019t have to numb and distract yourself. You can face those feelings. And once you accept that they\u2019re there you can sort out your baggage. You\u2019re not broken, you just have some healing to do.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o89cmk/can_we_talk_about_your_crutches/", "title": "Can we talk about your crutches?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MattTheMentor", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624708370, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o89cmk/can_we_talk_about_your_crutches/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435559.0051603, "replies_charged": false}
