To be honest, I don\u2019t feel extremely anxious about this because somehow, there is this part of me wanting to test my dignity and the feel of helping the student body prosper doesn\u2019t overwhelm me and I can somehow picture myself as the senator of my college. The thing is, I have no connections and I\u2019m not that popular. I am silent most of the time and people haven\u2019t noticed me potentially as someone who can lead them. I don\u2019t know how to win their minds and their hearts and I\u2019m scared about that. I guess I am just swooned by the council\u2019s words. Not sure if this is me deciding to be better by running or Maybe I shouldn\u2019t run after all lol", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ekt94v/so_a_well_respected_party_deliberated_among/", "title": "So a well respected party deliberated among themselves and finally decided to choose me to run for senator in the student body and I\u2019m scared.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "leviackerman09", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1578312202, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ekt94v/so_a_well_respected_party_deliberated_among/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437884.551686, "replies_charged": false}
