This will give me the opportunity to interact with new people, something I get awkward and anxious with. I did bring my daughter as my buffer (baby steps), she is 7 and wayyy more outgoing than me. I have a thing or two to learn from her. \n\nThis, will help get me out of my bubble of work/home and connecting with the real world more. I'm optimistic of how this will help improve me overall as a person.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/njhztu/breaking_out_from_my_comfort_zone/", "title": "Breaking out from my comfort zone", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Wondertwin235", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 22, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1621805934, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/njhztu/breaking_out_from_my_comfort_zone/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435938.625534, "replies_charged": false}
