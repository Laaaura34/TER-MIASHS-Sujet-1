I've started to slowly realize that you aren't you're own thoughts and that brains are weird and fricked up and like to play tricks on you. My actions define me, not my thoughts. What I do is more telling of me as a person than what I think. Sorry I just felt I had to share it. I'm trying to learn how to not hate myself because if I dont try now then I truly believe I never will. I cant find love if I dont like myself and this is my first step towards that goal. Thanks for listening\n\nEdit: thank you all so much for your kind words. I would have never guessed that this would blow up as much as it did. Originally this was just for me to share my feelings but I'm so glad its able to help you guys too. We're all on different steps but ultimately I believe our goals are the same. Happiness and love. I hope we can all make it to where we want to go. I believe that anyone can do it. You just have to put in the effort. You wont get better if you dont try to make yourself feel better.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h7bpqh/learning_how_to_not_hate_myself_and_forgiving/", "title": "Learning how to not hate myself and forgiving myself for my thoughts and only judging myself based on my actions", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "awesomebossbruh", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 818, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1591926921, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h7bpqh/learning_how_to_not_hate_myself_and_forgiving/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437542.7202847, "replies_charged": false}
