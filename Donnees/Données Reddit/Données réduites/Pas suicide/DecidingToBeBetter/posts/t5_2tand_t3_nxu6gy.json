A lot of people offered me free tutoring and great sources to study up on, so thank you everyone for the support!!!\n\nNext up, a license and a car! Then I will feel like I\u2019m caught up with every other 19 year old, lol. Thanks again, everyone!\n\n\nEdit: I meant I passed the math and science portion, so I\u2019m COMPLETELY finished.
