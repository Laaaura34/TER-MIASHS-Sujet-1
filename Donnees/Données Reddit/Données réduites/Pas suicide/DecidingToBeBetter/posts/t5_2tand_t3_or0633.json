I've gotten a few promotions at work but can't seem to progress anymore as management doesn't seem to think I'm mature enough and I think they're right.\n\nDespite my adhd, I have a tendency to goof-off and keep a joke going rather than do work because I believe life is short and I don't want to put my all into something just for a company that could easily replace if I left/passed away. \n\nLoved writing before but now I only write fanfict and lose myself for hours in video games. I try to keep up with current events but there's so much going on and it's as though every thing requires a history lesson to keep up. \n\nI look around me and everyone seems to be a lot more disciplined or living and learning.  \n\nLife seems to have so many different paths and I don't have the knowledge on where to place my next step.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/or0633/i_dont_know_how_to_mature/", "title": "I don't know how to mature", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Jammiepretz", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 58, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627167826, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/or0633/i_dont_know_how_to_mature/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436782.0799227, "replies_charged": false}
