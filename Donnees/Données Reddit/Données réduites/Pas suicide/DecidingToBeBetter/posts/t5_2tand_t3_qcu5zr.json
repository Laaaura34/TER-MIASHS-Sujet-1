I'm also more inclined to negative emotions  , I really fear the positive ones . \n\nTwo nights ago,  I became blinded by anger , and jealousy when talking to my partner,  I really love them but anger blinded me and I temporarily ended our relationship. Before the anger cooled off and I tried to repair things with them the next day. \n\nThis outburst really ruined my relationship,  does anyone have any advice on controlling anger,  or intense emotions .\n\nTherapy isn't an option due to financial reasons", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qcu5zr/anger_fear_jealousy_too_much_emotions/", "title": "Anger , fear , jealousy , too much emotions.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Insecure_Teenn", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634829577, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qcu5zr/anger_fear_jealousy_too_much_emotions/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438178.5490115, "replies_charged": false}
