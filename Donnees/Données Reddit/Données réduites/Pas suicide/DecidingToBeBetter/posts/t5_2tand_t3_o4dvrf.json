After seeing some similar posts and looking myself in the mirror; I relised how far i gone. Discord groups, subreddits, facebook, instagram, NSFW gaming; it was everywhere  and constantly on my mind. My porn habits where getting more and more picky and I would waste hours trying to find the right content.  I purged everything I could; no half measure like last time.   Am I going no-fap? Prob not but I'm try to take a huge step back and certainly distance myself.\n\nMake sure your looking after yourself guys, I got much worse in the last couple of months and I felt like I was at a bit of a cross roads. Thanks to the previous users who posted their storys. You inspired me.  \n\n\nEdit: Thanks for all your kind messages  and sharing your own stories, I cant believe how amazing and postive the responses have been. I'm sure in my times of weakness, I can come back and look at these posts to help me stay on track.  I'll post a update in 90 days on how I'm getting on.
