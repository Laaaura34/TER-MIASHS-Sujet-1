Trying to find out who that person is, and I feel lost. I am aware that I\u2019m emotionally dependent on others and reactive. I\u2019m trying to learn to be more loving to myself, to learn to be happy single so that one day I can find myself in a healthy relationship. I just feel so alone (always rejected by guys for another girl) and have some serious abandonment issues & traumatic experiences.  I want to become a more confident person who is truly happy with herself and doesn\u2019t need some guy to define her. It\u2019s been a lifelong struggle!\n\nI\u2019ve read books, but am looking to find stuff to listen to so I can do activities at the same time. \n\nThank you!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i4e3tp/what_are_some_self_help_podcasts_yall_recommend/", "title": "What are some self help podcasts y\u2019all recommend?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwawayjuly220", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1596662351, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i4e3tp/what_are_some_self_help_podcasts_yall_recommend/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437673.1864727, "replies_charged": false}
