One thing I really had to do was deconstruct ideals that I\u2019ve been taught or are implied by my roles/upbringing. I grew up with white, Christian, military parents. I\u2019ve decided that my parents morals, although not all bad, are not my exact morals and values. I\u2019m trying to separate myself from my whiteness, being female/expectations behind being female, Christianity. For example, why do I put makeup on? Is it to empower myself or to appease the male gaze? Am I working so hard because I relate wealth to worth like my father? Just trying to remove myself from these roles that have been assigned: wife, daughter, student. I believe in individualism as well as a strong family unit but more so on my own terms with emphasis on things like emotion rather than economics (although economics is still important). \n\nAnywayyyyy. Does anyone have any book recommendations or resources that shine on this? Joan Didion has seemed to hit a bit of a spot, but is a bit too narrative for me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p9d1mu/deconstructing_taught_ideals/", "title": "Deconstructing taught ideals", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tvbuzzinginthehouse", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629641154, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p9d1mu/deconstructing_taught_ideals/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437203.4319599, "replies_charged": false}
