I want to learn pole dancing because it looks so much fun but I\u2019m obese. I feel the same about ice skating and boxing. First there is nowhere around here that I can do these things. Second, im really fat so im worried about people laughing at me behind my back. I know they will because who wants to see a fat girl do any of these things? It\u2019s gross. These aren\u2019t things I can really do in my home either. I live with my parents so I can\u2019t buy a punching bag or anything. Besides, I want to do these things outside of home. I don\u2019t know.
