And I must say after all I have been through this year (workwise) I am over the moon with the job I have,\n\nThere is only one issue, there it not a whole lot for me to do here! I work 9 hour day shifts and I only properly do about 2 - 4 hours of actual work!\n\nBecause of the type of work I do am I required to be there in case any issues arise but most of the time I'm on socal media and youtube etc. to pass the time,\n\nI'm struggling with feeling redundant in this job when other colleagues are working around me and i dont want to tell my boss this in case the deicide they don't need me here,\n\nDo I just accept this and be happy? Do I start reading or doing a hobby to pass the time? \n\nTrying to waste time is not doing my mental health any good\n\nAny advice? Anyone been in a similar situation before?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbd73m/trouble_with_new_dream_job/", "title": "Trouble with new dream job.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "robpreme", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634655331, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbd73m/trouble_with_new_dream_job/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437208.1724758, "replies_charged": false}
