It has been a tough year for me but thanks be to God I came out on top of all of it a better and changed man. \n\n To those that shared their experiences with addiction here I thank you from the bottom of my heart for sharing your milestones and really just sharing in general. Its comforting to know we're in it together in spirit. You guys have motivated me even more to keep pushing on! I hope that those of you who decided to get and stay clean continue to do so for the rest of your days and to those that are thinking about or have just started, know you're not alone in your journey and struggle. Id be lying to you if I said it was easy or that I didn't still have cravings, but looking back at who I was and who I am now I can tell you the struggle is worth it!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gdx1np/officially_a_year_sober_today_from_alcohol_this/", "title": "Officially a year sober today from alcohol!
