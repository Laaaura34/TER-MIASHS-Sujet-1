We (me and my therapists) didn\u2019t always know I was avoidant because I mask a lot and have a whole bunch of half-baked coping mechanisms. That means I have whole narratives\u2014people are untrustworthy, will use me if I\u2019m not careful, want to get close to me for ulterior motives, and generally don\u2019t like me\u2014that I actually *believe* and that hold strong after nearly three decades of life despite my hard work. It took me a while to realize I had this fundamental lack of trust in others and lack self worth, because I\u2019ve been \u201cdoing the work\u201d for so long and meeting people and making friends. \n\nBut lately I realize I am only connecting with people who don\u2019t scare tf out of me, which is 0.01% of people, and that\u2019s not cool because 99.9% of human beings are not untrustworthy and do not hate me. I\u2019m doing all the things to make friends, and even have friends who I trust and am loyal too, but am lacking SECURITY in who I am. I blame myself for every single thing that happens in social settings that\u2019s even the least bit awkward or unpleasant. If I have conflict with someone I don\u2019t already trust\u2014and trust takes SO LONG for me to build in the first place\u2014then it\u2019s almost guaranteed that won\u2019t blossom into a friendship. I don\u2019t even know how to have a conflict with a loved one if it isn\u2019t calm. I feel like a monster just for BEING angry at someone, even if my anger is understandable, and I don\u2019t have enough trust or confidence in myself to hear someone\u2019s criticism of me and be able to say \u201cyes that\u2019s true\u201d or \u201cno that\u2019s not true.\u201d If someone is mean to me or criticizes me my intuition is to believe they\u2019re right and I deserve to be punished. \n\nI had a lot of rough experiences that led me to this point. I was sexually and physically abused by my sister\u2019s dad until I was 9 and I know one result of that can be an incredible amount of self shaming and blaming in adulthood. I was raised by a single mother of three who was discriminated against, broke, busy, young, a lot of stress factors that she of course took out on her kids. I grew up really fast and just didn\u2019t connect with my peers at school, and eventually was socially ostracized. My childhood was quite isolated and I didn\u2019t start actually connecting with folks until adulthood. \n\nI\u2019m gonna be honest, I\u2019m exhausted. I\u2019m annoyed I have these avoidant habits after so much work trying to figure out what\u2019s wrong with me and fix it. But I have made so much progress and I am staying optimistic. I was just having a fantasy about yelling at someone who ridiculed me over the course of six weeks. I was their supervisor for a training and they were outright disrespectful to me and went out of their way to get other people to be mean to me too. I asked myself, why am I still thinking about this after three years, why am I still so angry at this person and how they treated me? If I don\u2019t think I deserve to be disrespected, and I can identify moments where that person was full of shit, then why can\u2019t I say to myself, \u201cWhat they did hurt my feelings but I don\u2019t deserve to be treated that way\u201d and move on? When someone is wrong and everyone thinks they\u2019re right, why am I not satisfied by knowing myself they are wrong? \n\nI am so so so so so so tired of feeling inadequate and being so concerned with what other people think of me. I want people to feel how they feel about me and I don\u2019t want to care. I want to be mistreated by someone and not let that lead to withdrawing, or self blame, or lashing out. I want to think \u201cthey mistreated me because of them, not because I deserve it.\u201d\n\nDoes anyone have any advice?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k1yfa5/i_want_to_hear_a_criticism_that_doesnt_apply_to/", "title": "I want to hear a criticism that doesn\u2019t apply to me and remain unhurt", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "voteYESonpropxw2", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1606471065, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k1yfa5/i_want_to_hear_a_criticism_that_doesnt_apply_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437603.9662073, "replies_charged": false}
