I have really bad anxiety (mostly social anxiety) and strong emotional reactions to things. People's negative judgements (even people's I don't like) affect me a lot. Pretty much to the point I try not to meet people. I've definitely been a people-pleaser. I also get depressed and often want to kill myself, I struggle to find a reason to bother doing anything sometimes. I had to get an extension for about 4 Months to complete my dissertation because I didn't have the determination to put the hard work in and get it done sooner. Even in excising my muscles give way quickly.  \n\nI need to make serious changes. How can I toughen myself up and get some grit to get through this? I'm tired of having such low self-esteem and being seen as lazy by a lot of my family and others.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cvw2t2/im_soft/", "title": "I'm soft", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "doug_on_a_rug", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1566862602, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cvw2t2/im_soft/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438246.142025, "replies_charged": false}
