Honestly, I have my whole life together now.\n\nI definitely have my regrets about not \"sowing my wild oats\" more. But I also have the most amazing girlfriend ever, and I don't want to jeopardize that.\n\nI find it difficult to escape objectifying other women, having a \"grass is greener\" mentality about other girls, and having an overinflated sense of how hot I am.\n\nI'll see random pretty women on the street, and fantasize about them. I know some of that is normal, but I think I get a bit too into it.\n\nI'll meet some random girl at a work event or something, and have temptations of cheating. I would honestly never act on it, but it feels bad for it to even cross my radar at all.\n\nSometimes I think \"oh wow, if I was single, I'd bring home a different girl every night of the week.\" Besides that probably not being that fulfilling, it's also just totally unrealistic about how hot I am.\n\nOf course...I keep all of these thoughts to myself. I think it's just a grass is greener mentality.\n\nDoes anyone have advice on how to be more grateful for my amazing partner? I legitimately think porn is part of the culprit - leading me to have perverse sexual fantasies - maybe I should cut it out.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/npxsfs/how_do_i_become_a_more_faithful_partner_and/", "title": "How do I become a more faithful partner, and stopped being tempted by other women?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Right-Comment-5650", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622564338, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/npxsfs/how_do_i_become_a_more_faithful_partner_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436720.1312985, "replies_charged": false}
