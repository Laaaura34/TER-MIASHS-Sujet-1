I always felt tired and weak, was extremely depressed, rarely ever left the house apart from for work and uni. It\u2019s been a whole year of poor lifestyle decisions so I decided that it\u2019s time for a much needed change, starting off with my health.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve realised is that the hardest part of it all was just getting started. Being at the gym felt so refreshing and so amazing I regret not going sooner. I remember reading a quote online along the lines of - ***\"After going to the gym, working out at the gym, finishing up and heading home from the gym, no one ever regrets going to the gym\"*** \\- and that could not be more true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cFirst time back to the gym in more than a whole year. The pump feels great. I miss this feeling so much and I will come back everyday for this. I definitely feel really weak compared to what I was able to lift back then but will slowly work my way back up. \u201d  \n>  \n>*- quoted from the notes in my gym logbook* \n\nEven that one session at the gym made me feel so much better about myself and made my whole day much better.\n\n**The easiest way to get started is to shut the fuck up, stop making excuses, and just do it.**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o5pw0c/just_do_it_and_keep_pushing_on/", "title": "Just Do It and Keep Pushing On", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "EmptyApe", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624376025, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o5pw0c/just_do_it_and_keep_pushing_on/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437994.4132624, "replies_charged": false}
