It\u2019s like if you\u2019re not working, or helping others, or engaged in some other distraction that you really fall apart. Why is that? \n\nMaybe it\u2019s a coping mechanism. I do it too sometimes, because it\u2019s hard for me to be by myself. If I\u2019m always helping others or working then I don\u2019t have to be with my thoughts. Maybe we would rather give all of ourselves away just so we don\u2019t need to be alone with ourselves. Maybe right now that is easier. But it shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t sacrifice our health and happiness because we\u2019re running from parts of ourselves we haven\u2019t healed. We shouldn\u2019t use the world\u2019s to-do list as our distraction. We are only succeeding at hiding from our problems. We\u2019re not living a life. We\u2019re not creating memories or growing. Just hiding from the pain for one more day.\n\nYou are never going to escape yourself. Your thoughts and pain and trauma will always be there when this distraction ends. All your hobbies and past times now are just sticking your head in one hole-in-the-ground at a time. Can you see that this is sand through the hourglass you won\u2019t get back? \n\nYou\u2019ve only got 85 years on this planet, give or take. How much will you spend running from thoughts and pain that are too hard to deal with?\n\nI wish I had an easy fix for you. I wish I had found one for myself. And yet the only one I have is \u201cwhenever facing this pain is easier than running away, you\u2019ll do it.\u201d It\u2019s like we use training wheels until someone takes them off of our bike and we get tired of falling constantly. Does running from your pain hurt bad enough right now? How long have you been running now? Have you made the same mistakes time after time after time like I have? Are you tired of hating yourself? How much do you hate where all this running has taken you?\n\nBecause I\u2019m pretty sick of it. I\u2019m tired of watching the same movie and knowing how it ends. I\u2019m tired of burning my hand on the stove and knowing I\u2019ll touch it again tomorrow. I\u2019m tired of knowing I\u2019m making the wrong decision as I make it. I\u2019m tired of taking on one more distraction or doing one more favor or doing whatever I can to stop facing this pain I\u2019m hiding from. \n\nMaybe we never grow until we have to. Maybe the wrong answer has to hurt incredibly bad to make us choose the right one. Maybe we\u2019re all stubborn and stupid. Maybe wisdom is a lie and the \u201cwise ones\u201d just got tired of the pain sooner than I did. \n\nBut I\u2019m so tired. I just want to see a fork in the road and walk forward knowing I didn\u2019t self sabotage this time. I want to sit alone with myself without pain or hatred. I want to give that self critical voice in my head less ammo to use against me. I want to be proud of who I am. I want to feel like I\u2019m not the biggest failure of everyone I know. I want to think that all the hard work I\u2019ve done was more than just defeat with extra steps. \n\nWe don\u2019t have to feel strong or courageous or brave. We just have to decide we\u2019re done repeating the same mistakes. I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m done. Have you?\n\n\\---------\n\n**Further Reading**: If this post resonated with you then I think you\u2019d really benefit from the Waking Up app by Sam Harris. It\u2019s the best tool for developing mindfulness I\u2019ve ever found, and for me that\u2019s the key to learning to stop repeating the same mistakes. The more thoughts and feelings you notice, the more chances you have to fix things before they get bad. You\u2019ll feel the ambient heat of the stove as you reach for it and not just when you get burnt. Then we can start making choices that hurt less.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n2gx8c/you_cant_escape_your_problems_by_solving_someone/", "title": "You can\u2019t escape your problems by solving someone else\u2019s", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MattTheMentor", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619870235, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n2gx8c/you_cant_escape_your_problems_by_solving_someone/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436505.1821194, "replies_charged": false}
