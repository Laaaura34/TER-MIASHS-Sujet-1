I find it hard to trust what others say whether it\u2019s about self improvement or a thought they have that sounds nice. I tell myself that this person doesn\u2019t actually believe what they\u2019re saying and they are just trying to convince themselves. I realize that this is a thought process i\u2019ve developed as a result of my own shortcomings and it is wrong and simply not fair to judge others based off my inability or failure to make a change I felt would better me as a person.\n\nI don\u2019t want to change this mindset simply because I don\u2019t want to doubt others, but it has become such a toxic roadblock that I am cynical towards my own desire to change as well. Even if I do make a change, I find it difficult to appreciate myself or feel proud that I was able to change something hard for me. For example, I quit nicotine and porn almost 6 months ago and even though it was a nice boost to my confidence, it\u2019s not enough for me to believe that people can actually change. So this causes strings of doubt within my own journey of self betterment. \n\nOverall, I am really fucking over this shitty way of thinking. It\u2019s not fair to others and more importantly it is not fair to me. I deserve to be happy and I know that change is possible. \n\nP.S. if anyone knows of any self improvement books to alleviate a cynical mindset, I would appreciate hearing about them.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mnnyjk/im_done_being_a_cynical_person/", "title": "I\u2019m done being a cynical person", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TheRussianCosmonaut", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 132, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617994257, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mnnyjk/im_done_being_a_cynical_person/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435254.2352593, "replies_charged": false}
