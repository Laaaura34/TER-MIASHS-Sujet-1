Basically, I can do incredible things with the right initiative, but i tend to be incredibly stubborn, lazy, apathetic, irresponsible and unambitious, and i don't know how to get out of this rut, because I always end up picking the \"ah, fuck it.\" option. \n\nI have worked hard before. I got waaaaaaaaay out of my comfort zone. I've read books. Meditated. Tried to be different, think different, talk to inspirational people. None of it helps permanently. I always end up sitting back in front of the bloody screen and wasting my time. I sure COULD be in a hundred times better place in my life, if only i had the initiative to do so and stopped making excuses. I'm wasting some great potential here.
