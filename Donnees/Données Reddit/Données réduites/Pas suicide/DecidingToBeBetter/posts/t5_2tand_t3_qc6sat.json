I\u2019m an adult in my late 20s, I make more money than the average working person, and i have my own business (Backstory of why things are as easy as they are to smoke.) When i say I smoke weed every day MULTIPLE times a day I mean Sometimes I smoke 2 eighths a day. But if it\u2019s available and i purchased a high enough quantity (a half oz) i can smoke all of that (half oz) in a day.\n\nI want to stop because I feel like at this point i\u2019m smoking to cover an underlying issue and I also feel like if i wasn\u2019t smoking as much I could put my time and money into much better things to expand my life and business even further.\n\nThe reason I can\u2019t stop is because i have the money to buy it, i own my own business which allows me to have time to work when i want to and still meet my quota, and it\u2019s also a bit of muscle memory.\n\nWhat are some things that you did to stop smoking or what was the realization you had that made you stop.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qc6sat/how_can_i_finally_put_an_end_to_smoking_weed/", "title": "How can I finally put an end to smoking weed?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "daysaredismal", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 51, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634752632, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qc6sat/how_can_i_finally_put_an_end_to_smoking_weed/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436250.7091029, "replies_charged": false}
