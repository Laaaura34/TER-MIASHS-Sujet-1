I had a LOT of time to think about myself and I realised that I am an absolute cunt once you get to know me. I am a two-faced person. Like when you first start to talk to me, i will be completely nice and act charming to keep you near me. Bit when you get to meet me better, I'll constantly lower your self worth, I'll be careless as fuck, emotionless and manipulative (I'm still working on that with psychiatrist, childhod shit and all).\nSo by that estimate, how can I become better person? Or better question, am I redeemable as a human being?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/krd7zk/how_do_i_become_a_better_person/", "title": "How do I become a better person?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "OneTimeAccount22345", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1609897016, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/krd7zk/how_do_i_become_a_better_person/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435821.086931, "replies_charged": false}
