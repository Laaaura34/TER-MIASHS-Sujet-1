The idea that my account is now deleted not disabled anymore and that makes me uncomfortable. I never posted and never really commented on posts yet still suffered from the negative effects of social media so I really didn\u2019t see any reason to keep it. The only reason I kept my Instagram around was because I felt like I still needed to connect with people (even with those who I don\u2019t talk to anymore) and for the day I would finally be confident and happy enough to post, all for the sake of validation and for the \u201chey peeps, my life is just as fun and amazing\u201d moment. I\u2019ve come to realise I\u2019ll never be truly happy with myself and find time to invest in my hobbies if I spend hours on this app comparing myself, creating senseless scenarios and feeling the FOMO. I created a list of pros and cons to further explain my leave. I bet no one will realise I left too which makes it easier but sadder.  \n\nPros: talking to good friends and keep up with their lives (we have other platforms), get informed on college events, memes and inspiration. \n\nCons: extreme comparison, endless scrolling, depression and anxiety intensified, feeling lost and behind and fomo. \n\nSo, I\u2019ve just added 5hrs back into my life but now comes to the hardest bit. What do I do? \n\n\nSorry for any typos.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pnko5g/deleted_instagram_now_what/", "title": "Deleted Instagram, now what?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "WideLengthiness4202", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 165, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631555743, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pnko5g/deleted_instagram_now_what/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436765.2876258, "replies_charged": false}
