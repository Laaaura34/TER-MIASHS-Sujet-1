As well, I used them as almost a digital scrapbook, to keep memories to look back on, but instead of just being about keeping memories, I ended up spending too much time looking backwards, and not enough looking forwards. So I saved and ordered physical prints of the most important pictures and memories, and permanently deleted everything else. No deactivating, just deleting.  Cold turkey.\n\nThe above combined with my compulsion to check on my ex-boyfriend's social media (and hurt my own feelings by doing so), pushed me to finally delete them all for my own mental health. It doesn't matter what he's doing. It doesn't matter what anyone else is doing. And it certainly doesn't matter what they think about what I'm doing. I need to learn to worry about and work on my relationship with myself before anyone else.\n\nAs a 22 year old female, I have a feeling this is going to get some funny reactions from my peers, especially new people I meet, but I think it's the best choice for me. It did nothing but make me feel inferior and insecure.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h9t3fl/deleted_all_social_media_except_for_reddit/", "title": "Deleted all social media except for Reddit", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "asinglepeanut", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1592269087, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h9t3fl/deleted_all_social_media_except_for_reddit/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436449.2678895, "replies_charged": false}
