I was already depressed but I almost broke down in front of grandma (she doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m depressed). \n\nNormally she\u2019s happy for how her health is. Or so I thought. She drinks vodka for her pain, smokes so she can feel her nerves. She can\u2019t feel her feet, or her left pinky. She doesn\u2019t eat hardly, she\u2019s dehydrated. She has ankylosing spondylitis, congestive heart failure, chronic back pain, arthritis, and more(to much for me to remember). Her spine is a backwards s, her bones in her spine are rubbing on each other she doesn\u2019t have the sponges in between that stops it. Her bones are literally disintegrating and there is nothing I can do for her except help her with simple things.\n\nSo for her sake, I\u2019m going to be better, live the life she couldn\u2019t. I\u2019m going to work out even more than I do now. Be more productive with what I want to do. Be the kid she could only dream of, I\u2019m not a bad kid now, but I could exercise more and help out more.\n\nWhy do I care so much? She is my savior, she raised me since I was two, after my father died, and my mom was arrested. My mom was arrested from what I know five times after the fact. Father died from a car crash, he was a great man. My grandparents are amazing people, young to be considered grandparents though. But that\u2019s in short why I care so much.\n\nPlease help encourage me, I really want this and I think my grandma needs it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o75k9s/i_want_to_be_better/", "title": "I want to be better.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "sadSmiIe", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624555412, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o75k9s/i_want_to_be_better/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436463.5244985, "replies_charged": false}
