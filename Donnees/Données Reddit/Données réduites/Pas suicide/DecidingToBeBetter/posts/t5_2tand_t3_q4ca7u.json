For the past year and a half my anxiety has been terrible after some unexpected deaths in my family. Usually when I get really overwhelmed and anxious I reach out for my security blanket. Well today I couldn\u2019t find it. Normally in this case I would try to find it and eventually break down and ask my partner to help me look. We broke up about three weeks ago due to my mental health getting worse. It was amicable we didn\u2019t want to break up later when we started to hate each other, but it\u2019s been really hard. I didn\u2019t think I could do it, but today I found my security blanket by myself. I cried and panicked but I was able to calm myself down enough to look efficiently and find it. I was scared but I\u2019m proud of the progress I\u2019ve made. Even if it was something very silly.\n\nI\u2019m going to try to keep being strong while going through this breakup and remind myself I can be whole on my own again. I\u2019m also excited to see how my mental health improves in the next coming months. I look forward to making myself more proud.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4ca7u/today_i_did_something_by_myself_i_wasnt_sure_i/", "title": "Today I did something by myself I wasn\u2019t sure I could do", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "capnbinni", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633746037, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4ca7u/today_i_did_something_by_myself_i_wasnt_sure_i/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435778.4502537, "replies_charged": false}
