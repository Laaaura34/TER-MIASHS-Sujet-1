Because just because they are your parents doesn't mean they are good. Many bad people happen to be parents. But a paste of my comment on how to make sure your upbringing doesn't become a lifestyle:\n\n *Ah. First you have to put to rest that the world is made of people and many are toxic. And many of those toxic people are parents. And you have to let them go. It will always bother you (experience here) like many tragedies in life always bother you. But you have to let that past die. You can forgive them---but you can't really forget it. Second--recovery is by surrounding yourself by positive, advancing, awesome people. Many will gravitate to what they know in relationships. They know toxicity so they run toward it. You have to retrain your brain to find the opposite. If you do that you will fill yourself with a well of good relationships and it will greatly help that old scar of bad family. Hope that helps---Charles*", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oodufk/how_to_bury_the_emotionally_bad_parents/", "title": "How to bury the emotionally bad parents", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "CharlesHurstCanHelp", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626823817, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oodufk/how_to_bury_the_emotionally_bad_parents/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435096.7315295, "replies_charged": false}
