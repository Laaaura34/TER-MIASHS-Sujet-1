I realized that not everyone is into personality typing and I think it gets wrapped up with astrology and it it nothing like that. It's a soft science. But it is science. \n\nBut it helped me a lot. It might help you.\n\nIt's not about being happy all the time. It's about learning to be content. Happiness is fleeting. Contentness is life changing. \n\n16personalities is a good start.
