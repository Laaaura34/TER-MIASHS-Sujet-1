But it seems like all I want to do is lie in my bed and watch Netflix or drink a lot of beer at the weekend. How the hell do I get myself out of this situation I've clearly got myself in? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\nUpdat: Damn went to bed and and woke up to all these lovely peoples helpfulness and just being down right bros, thanks so much for everyone that gave me suggestions on moving forward I've read everyone comments and definitely will be implementing some as soon as humanly possible. I've always been shite talking to people face to face with this sort of thing am not a shy person just something stops me from doing it, so all this is helping in ways you might not know. Thanks again for all your kind words of encouragement, I know I'll get through it with people like you in the world helping.
