Up until now, nothing has inspired me to stop smoking weed. I smoked weed daily for 6+ years. Before work, on my way home from work, when I happened to wake up at 3 AM, etc. But I\u2019m so happy to share with you all, and I\u2019m so happy for myself, that after a mere two days of being \u201csober\u201d I\u2019m not stressing like I thought I would. Instead, I see I have more time to do awesome stuff I like \u2014 yoga, meditation, reading books, and watching anime \u2014 all of which I enjoyed as a teen, right before I started smoking.\n\nI don\u2019t understand/never understood my urge to constantly be high or what I was running from? Maybe the death of my brother? :/ It just made me feel better. But now I can feel great all on my sober own! I\u2019m excited to be working towards a bright future with new life and new habits.\n\nYou can most definitely do anything you want.
