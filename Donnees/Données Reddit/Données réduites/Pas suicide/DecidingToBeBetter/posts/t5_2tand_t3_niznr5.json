I'm pregnant, so we can't do an MRI to see exactly how bad it is, but pretty certain I tore at least my ACL. I peeked at my chart on the computer and my BMI was written in red with an exclamation point next to it. Obviously starting a heart healthy diet is a place to start, but I'm limited on excercises.
