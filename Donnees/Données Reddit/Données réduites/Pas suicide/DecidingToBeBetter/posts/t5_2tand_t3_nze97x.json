I want to work in wildlife conservation or help the environment in some way, I\u2019m currently a biology major. I\u2019m not really sure how to get into that field. I\u2019ve basically been raising myself since both of my parents weren\u2019t around much, and now that I\u2019m finally an adult I feel disconnected from my peers but I still want to have a good time and set myself up for success and happiness later on. I read a lot of self help type books, I think I\u2019m pushing myself a little too hard at times. I\u2019m paying for college myself, but haven\u2019t had any loans yet since I have 3 jobs. I\u2019ve been dating the same guys for 3.5 years and we plan to get married at some point (a couple years after we graduate). I have depression and ADHD but it\u2019s getting better now that I\u2019m away from my family and have freedom to choose how I do things. I just got my first car and paid it in full, and I started investing on robinhood March 2020. I don\u2019t want to be rich, I just want to support my family in the future with my boyfriend and help the earth and travel. I\u2019m not sure how to balance working and having friends though, and I don\u2019t deal with stress well. I have body dysmorphia which is a constant struggle and I\u2019m not sure what my path will be after graduation. I\u2019m writing all this in case you\u2019d like to give more specific advice.
