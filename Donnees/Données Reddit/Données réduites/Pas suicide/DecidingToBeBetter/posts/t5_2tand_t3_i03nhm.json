In a new state with no friends or family , and I met him 10 days after I arrived. Everything was great in the beginning but got worse over time , even when it was bad I \u201cforgave\u201d him. As long as he was nice sometimes I was okay. I\u2019ve broken up with him 2 times before and 3rd time is really a charm . Every time we broke up I always initiated the \u201cgetting back together\u201d. I felt like I was going through some type of withdrawal without him. He has mental issues and I alway used them as an excuse. I too have issues with my mental and felt like I had to depend on him. Now I finally left him alone and am focusing on myself as well as trying to grow into a better person. It\u2019s been 3 weeks since I\u2019ve been in contact with him and I hope to never talk to or see him again. \n\nThis might not seem like a big deal , but I\u2019m proud of myself for deciding to do better.\n\n\nEDIT: I just want to thank everyone for their encouraging words, it made me tear up. I can\u2019t tell you how much this means to me , this just gives me more fuel to keep going forward and being my best self.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i03nhm/i_left_my_emotionally_abusive_boyfriend/", "title": "I left my emotionally abusive boyfriend", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Erahna", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1394, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1596040198, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i03nhm/i_left_my_emotionally_abusive_boyfriend/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435818.779523, "replies_charged": false}
