I\u2019d rather not go into the details but I\u2019ll just say that the week ahead is going to be really tough and full of hurdles. \n\nI\u2019m struggling. Like I said, I\u2019d rather not go into the details but I woke up today and I just felt crushed by it all. I cried a bit over how stressed I am, because I just can\u2019t think of anything else to do, and then I just... sat around in my pjs all morning. It\u2019s 1pm now and I\u2019ve done nothing with the day. I\u2019m so stressed out and anxious and I just don\u2019t know what I can do to calm myself down. \n\nI\u2019ve always had a habit of self medicating with alcohol and weed. I have a bit of weed left from months ago and I\u2019m really tempted to use it to take the edge off but if I do that I won\u2019t get anything done for the rest of the day. I\u2019m just freaking out and I need some kind of healthy way to temporarily chill the fuck out. Any advice is appreciated at this stage.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mbeded/i_need_ways_to_calm_myself_down_that_dont_revolve/", "title": "I need ways to calm myself down that don\u2019t revolve around drinking and smoking weed", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "travellingcats", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616505003, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mbeded/i_need_ways_to_calm_myself_down_that_dont_revolve/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435765.194369, "replies_charged": false}
