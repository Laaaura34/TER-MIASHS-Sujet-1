Everything bad happened to me. My dad died right before my 5th birthday. My mom was full of unresolved things and super angry for most of my childhood. People left me always, by death and by choice since I was young. Being adopted has its own abandonment issues even though I was very fortunate and had a blessed upbringing that i never would\u2019ve had. My second dad died 6 days before my 29th birthday last year. I can go on and on. \n\nAfter living in a victim mindset and being miserable for most of my life through constant self-sabotaging, cheating, and lying, I finally understood that I had to change what I did and how I did it. I could no longer hold onto old stories. I could choose to grow from my experiences and choose another way to live. And it was all up to me. \n\nAlthough digging deep into my past experiences, healing old hurts, fixing old belief patterns, and changing habitual behaviors that were toxic hasn\u2019t always been easy- it\u2019s always been worth it. I finally can have compassion for my past even though I did some things I know were terrible. Hurt people hurt people. Unaware people cause a lot of damage. \n\nI am now aware and I can forgive myself for not knowing better in the past but striving to learn each day and move forward. I can take steps each day that fill me up instead of tearing me (and others) down. \n\nI know I can\u2019t control everything but I can control what I do and how I do it as long as I am aware of my intentions and take action that serves my highest good. \n\nMy life is entirely different than it once was. I\u2019m no longer depressed or so anxious I can\u2019t leave the house. I\u2019m no longer paralyzed by fear. I\u2019m not in toxic relationships because I no longer invite those experiences. My life is mine. \n\nI wanted to share this with anyone who might feel lost or that life hasn\u2019t gone your way. You have so much power over your experience. We can\u2019t control what happens but we can control how we respond, and through that we truly can transform what we encounter. I am manifesting really beautiful things and it\u2019s not because I\u2019m \u201clucky\u201d but because I\u2019m putting in the work and learning each day. \n\nI heard this quote from a class I\u2019m taking \u201cI use my memories but I don\u2019t let them use me.\u201d I resonated so much with it because it put into words how I\u2019ve been living recently. I\u2019m not attaching to the things that have happened or the things I\u2019ve done, but bringing them forward to change how I respond in the present moment. It\u2019s a beautiful thing and I know everyone is capable of doing it. \n\nSending you all love.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hoh0nw/i_finally_feel_like_i_am_the_creator_of_my/", "title": "I finally feel like I am the creator of my experience.
