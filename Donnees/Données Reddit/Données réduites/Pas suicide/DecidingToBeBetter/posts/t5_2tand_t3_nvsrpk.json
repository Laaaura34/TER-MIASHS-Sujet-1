I\u2019m always ashamed of who I am and where I am standing. People my age, people I\u2019ve known before are going out and living their life. They have their own chapter and they have their own pace. \nFrankly, they won\u2019t give a fuck. Maybe they will for a little bit but they got their own stuff to deal with.\nThey\u2019re independent. That\u2019s what I want to be. To stand on my own and not have others worry and walk on eggshells around me. \nI always look away and see their backs to me. They\u2019re so far away. I want to go there. I keep wanting and wanting and I keep losing my footing and I stray and I get lost. The more I try to rush there, the more I lose sight of where I\u2019m going. \n\nNow I am aware. Now I won\u2019t look at them. A peek is good but I\u2019ll stop looking.\n\nNow I look at where I am and I realize I\u2019m not really far. And I\u2019m not near them either. \nThe truth is I\u2019m not really meant to be where they are. Because that\u2019s their path, it\u2019s their own chapter that they wrote, a road only familiar to them but not to me, because that is where I am not meant to be. \n\nI have my own. It\u2019s incomplete. It\u2019s full of tears and bumps and holes and it\u2019s not finished. I have to take things at my own pace. It doesn\u2019t have to be quick, doesn\u2019t have to be slow either. It can be however I want it to be.
