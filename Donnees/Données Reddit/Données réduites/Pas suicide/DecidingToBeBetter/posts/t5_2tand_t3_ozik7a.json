Overhead squats were my kryptonite it was hard to keep balance going down and I felt awkward. I didn\u2019t even attempt a snatch just tried to work on my balance and depth on my squat. So I moved onto doing front squats which felt good. I did lighter weight to focus on form and breathing. Moved on to kettle bell swings and lunges. KB shoulder press and pull ups then called it a day after the sauna. Tomorrow I\u2019m looking to recover with light cardio and body weight stuff.
