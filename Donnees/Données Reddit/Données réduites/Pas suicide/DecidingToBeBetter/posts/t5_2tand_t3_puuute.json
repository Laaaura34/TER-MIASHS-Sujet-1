But it is really hard to do the work to be. I am afraid I will be boring without my toxicity. I am afraid I won\u2019t attract anyone interesting into my life if I become the boring, sober optimist society wants me to be.\n\nI\u2019m afraid nobody will want to sleep with me. I\u2019m afraid I will lose my edge if I sober up and become a well adjusted adult at 21. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll mature too quickly and become a boring old lady, that I will lose my confidence and still hate myself and it will have been for nothing. That I will attract someone safe but boring. That I will never fully be able to be myself if I get better.\n\nI\u2019m afraid if I move out and take ownership of my life, that I\u2019ll remember trauma I don\u2019t want to remember. Im afraid that I won\u2019t recognize myself if I get better. I am so afraid to change.\n\nI want to stay in the cocoon of pain but it\u2019s time to come out and I don\u2019t know who I will transform into. I am scared getting better means I will grow up and give up on my dreams in order to be more responsible even though I know deep down nothing is certain in life; even the most responsible plans go wrong.\n\nI don\u2019t want to lose myself even though it\u2019s what I need. I don\u2019t wanna say goodbye to the me who got through the worst years of my life. And I don\u2019t wanna say hello to the newb who has so much to learn about being a \u201cgood person\u201d whatever that means.\n\nI want to do drugs and cut people off.\n\nI am in therapy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/puuute/it_is_hard_to_admit_this/", "title": "It is hard to admit this", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "z00w33mamma", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632525536, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/puuute/it_is_hard_to_admit_this/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437491.61919, "replies_charged": false}
