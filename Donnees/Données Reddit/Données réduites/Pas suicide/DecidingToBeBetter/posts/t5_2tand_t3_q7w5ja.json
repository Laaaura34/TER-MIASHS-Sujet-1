I have a friend who has been hit pretty hard with depression and anxiety ever since covid started. He's got a lot of stress in his life at the moment. I can't do much of any significance to improve his situation, but I am thinking I'd like to find little ways each day that I can bring some novelty and joy into his life. Unexpected things, fun, light, cheery. But I'm needing help rounding up ideas. My first thing I might do is to go and try out some e-scooters together, which we've often talked about doing but not done yet.\n\nIf anyone has ideas for little but joyful ways to bring some novelty and fun to my friend's life, I'd appreciate it so much.
