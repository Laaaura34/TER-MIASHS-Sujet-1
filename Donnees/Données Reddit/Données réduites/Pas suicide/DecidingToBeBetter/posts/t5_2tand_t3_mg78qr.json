I thought that if I rested for a week I could recover  but that didn't happen. It's been 3 weeks since I've stop going to  school and I can't take my parent's disappointment for I am the eldest  son. Sometimes I would feel like puking bc of sadness I think.\n\nThere's  3 ways to progress my story. 1 is to just kms and find out if there is  afterlife/heaven/hell, or it'll just be the end (I'm really curious what  the end would feel like). 2 is to leave my house, go somewhere, work at  a minimum wage job and live until my parents are dead, if I didn't find  anything to live for at that time I will just kms. 3 is my least  favorite, pass all my works by the weekend for it is my last chance and  live for my mom's dream.\n\nI probably won't go to option 1 but I find myself often wanting to end this too much Overthinking, Pretending to be so mentally strong in  front of all people but when I'm alone I cry, I scream, and hit myself to sleep.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mg78qr/is_there_a_way_to_keep_goin_from_this_situation/", "title": "Is there a way to keep goin from this situation?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ifuckinghatemyself88", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617076266, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mg78qr/is_there_a_way_to_keep_goin_from_this_situation/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437160.2498975, "replies_charged": false}
