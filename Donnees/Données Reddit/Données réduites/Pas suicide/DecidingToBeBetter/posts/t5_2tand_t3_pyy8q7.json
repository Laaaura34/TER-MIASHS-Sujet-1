I have ADHD, i\u2019m depressed, my parents, school, money, stress, etc. I let these excuses hold me back and keep me in a depressive spiral. But lately, i\u2019ve started to become the person I used to dream of being. I kicked my marijuana dependency, i\u2019m on antidepressants and actually taking them, and I\u2019ve started to take an active role in my happiness. When I look in the mirror, I see someone who\u2019s TRYING and being proactive. It\u2019s nice to look at my reflection and not hate the person I\u2019m staring at. Now, I see someone who has been through rough patches and came out stronger and happier. I\u2019m getting healthy, being more confident, dressing for myself and not others. This is the happiest I\u2019ve been in my life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pyy8q7/im_becoming_the_person_i_wanted_to_be/", "title": "I\u2019m becoming the person I wanted to be", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "wintergrl1308", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 94, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633053938, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pyy8q7/im_becoming_the_person_i_wanted_to_be/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437075.7962382, "replies_charged": false}
