It could be as extreme as getting in trouble with the law or something so minuscule like not being able to get a decent picture. I get so over heated and my skin starts to burn and I get an uncontrollable rage fit that normally leads to me putting holes in my wall or smashing my head against something until it dents. \n\nI desperately want to fix this but I\u2019ve Tried nearly everything people have told me. Stopping and breathing? Doesn\u2019t help, counting to 10? Nope. Going for walks or exercising. Not a chance. The only thing that helps me relax is giving it time but there are times where it goes on for weeks at a time. I\u2019ve tried therapy and anger management but it doesn\u2019t help, most doctors I talk to think they understand me but they don\u2019t and when they try giving me advice that I said \u201cDOES NOT WORK\u201d they still ignore what I\u2019m saying and repeat the same bullshit. I\u2019m at an absolute and have no idea what to do. I don\u2019t want to be an immature person my whole life but I am so fucking sick and tired of nothing going my way and then feeling like the bad guy for getting upset over it.
