Meaning that I can be bullied easily or that someone can tease me without me doing anything. I always say to my mind that I should avoid engaging into something that will cause trouble. So I just tend to smile and ignore them but inside I want to do something to defend myself. \n\nTimes pass and as I grow up I still carry those type of attitude that I have. Furthermore as I progress to my college life I find that my \u201ckind\u201d gesture invites people to abuse my personality. Showing my lack of courage, whenever they ask me something or they would ask a favor that I don\u2019t really like I just say yes and do as they say. \n\nI\u2019m stuck with this thought that I should really do something for myself to prevent people from taking advantage of my kindness to them. I always overthink every scenario and every time they take advantage of me. It sucks that I don\u2019t have the courage to defend myself. \n\nCan you guys send me some advice on how do you build up that courage to speak or do something to defend yourself. I\u2019m really concern about my future as I don\u2019t know what to say or what to do whenever such problems arise. \n\nAny advice is well appreciated.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jqhqzo/advice_to_have_courage/", "title": "Advice to have courage", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "JupiterZeus00", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 0, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1604863619, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jqhqzo/advice_to_have_courage/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436520.8539615, "replies_charged": false}
