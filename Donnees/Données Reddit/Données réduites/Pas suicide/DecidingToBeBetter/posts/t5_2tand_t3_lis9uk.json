I\u2019ve gone through two diets in the past three years and both crashed. I pushed myself yet again for the third time last August and have since lost 33kgs/ 73lbs and I\u2019m now at my target weight and today I ran 10km for the first time in my life, averaging 07:04min/km. I couldn\u2019t run a minute in august without losing breath. \n\nWhen I completed my run just now, no mere words can express the emotions that overcame me. Don\u2019t stop trying. Don\u2019t give up on yourself. You can do it. I can do it. We can do it. Let\u2019s go!\n\nEDIT: a few of you guys messaged me asking what was different this time round with my diet/exercising routine that made it consistent. I broke up with my boyfriend in August 2020 (today I look back and cringe at that relationship lmao) And as cliche as it\u2019s gonna sound, I had to channel the heartache somewhere. I have bipolar II but I was given the green light to stop medication in February 2020 after five years of taking all sorts of pills every single day. So I knew if I didn\u2019t do anything about the pain, I knew I would\u2019ve spiral and I didn\u2019t want to go back to that dark place again. So that\u2019s the reason. I do not ever want to go back do that hole. I was in the dark for the longest time, in and out of the clinic, hospitalised once, trying out all sorts of different pills until I found a good combo. I just didn\u2019t want to go through all that again. So I picked up exercising and dieting once more and channeled all the damned heartaches, pains and anger into it and converted them all to something positive  :)\n\nEDIT #2: Thank you all for your kind words and replies. I appreciate it so very much. My Saturday is indeed very blessed! And thank you to those who\u2019s given me all these awards! I hope everyone\u2019s well and keeping safe!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lis9uk/i_ran_10km_this_morning_for_the_first_time_in_my/", "title": "I ran 10KM this morning for the first time in my life.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mozakiiii", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1568, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613187332, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lis9uk/i_ran_10km_this_morning_for_the_first_time_in_my/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435550.0701194, "replies_charged": false}
