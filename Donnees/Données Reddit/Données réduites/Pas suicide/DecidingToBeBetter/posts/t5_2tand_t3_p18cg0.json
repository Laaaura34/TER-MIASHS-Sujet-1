I had a great time with her with the exception of one small argument. I am still hypersensitive to certain things. I am starting to become more aware and acknowledging these triggers and letting them go. Often times in our relationship I noticed that if I ask to do certain events or go out or something, the answer is often that she's not in the mood to or doesn't want to. But often times I see that if her friends ask her to do similar things, she is more than willing to go out of her way to do them. Its not something that's within my control. I cannot control how others feel about me or behave in situations like these. With that said, I managed to avoid a fight and keep my emotions in check.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the agenda for today:\n\nGoing to blast legs and shoulders in the gym. Tonight I plan to unwind a bit and get back into my reading. I have not had a chance to meditate much and I think I need to again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p18cg0/day_67_deciding_to_be_better/", "title": "Day 6/7: Deciding to be better", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Ohboyburgers", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 20, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628536652, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p18cg0/day_67_deciding_to_be_better/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436458.2211387, "replies_charged": false}
