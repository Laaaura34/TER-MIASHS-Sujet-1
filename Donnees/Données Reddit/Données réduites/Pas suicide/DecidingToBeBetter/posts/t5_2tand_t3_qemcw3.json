I should not have created this post. \n\nbut I wanted to share my experience with you guys. \n\nI have been struggling with living an emotionally and mentally unhealthy life. I was unable to express myself in personal conversations as well as in virtual conversations.\n\nI mean I used to say nothing if one of my friends faces a loss in her or his life. I would stay mum. \n\nBut today I saw a grieving father's post and I decided to speak and share what I felt in my heart. I know I can't understand or imagine his pain, and can't reduce his agony no matter what I say. I used to think if it is for nothing then why say anything.\n\nbut today I realised that as a human being I am supposed to stand together with people in whatever capacity I can.\n\nand this change is because of this community.\n\nthank you so much...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qemcw3/felt_better_today_took_my_first_step_on_my/", "title": "Felt better today, took my first step on my journey to become a better person", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Fried_Mangos", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 26, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635056078, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qemcw3/felt_better_today_took_my_first_step_on_my/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438396.7794378, "replies_charged": false}
