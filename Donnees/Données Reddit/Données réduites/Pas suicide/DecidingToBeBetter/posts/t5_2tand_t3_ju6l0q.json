I try to wake up everyday work out, eat healthy, work hard at my job, study hard at school, but last month I\u2019ve been drinking a lot, I don\u2019t seem to have any control and I\u2019ve been ignoring responsibilities and it sucks because I\u2019m really trying with all my heart to be better, but I still feel like shit. Yesterday, instead of being a responsible adult, me and one of my best friends went on a bender, I\u2019ve even let my friend to drink and drive we arrived at his home and wake his parents up, I\u2019m still in my friends house and I\u2019m so ashamed of myself, I don\u2019t know if I should just leave but I wanted to talk to my friend heart to heart that we didn\u2019t think right yesterday and we should really improve ourselves, once we are on vacations we could go out and have some fun, but we still have responsibilities we need to oblige for I will not let my addictive personality take control of me.\nI know I can be so much better than this, but the shit I\u2019ve been trough keeps me wanting to be numbed and never deal with it. It\u2019s just that it hurts so much that whenever I feel those feelings I don\u2019t have to courage to deal with them and I numb myself with alcohol, sex, porn, whatever I feel in the moment and it hurts my soul because I know that I need to be better, I will never let myself and the people I care about make stupid fucking decisions. I will be better! \n\nAnyhow sorry for the long post, but I\u2019m just hoping If someone has been trough a lot of trauma and stress know how to deal with those awful feelings and knows how to help ourselves and your friends from this shit!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ju6l0q/i_fucked_up/", "title": "I fucked up", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Elegant_warrior", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1605378355, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ju6l0q/i_fucked_up/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436546.2434573, "replies_charged": false}
