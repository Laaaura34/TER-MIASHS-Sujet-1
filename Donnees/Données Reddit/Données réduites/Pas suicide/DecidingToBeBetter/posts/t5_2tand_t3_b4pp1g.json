Today, I almost melted down because Walmart wouldn't take my paper ID, and Dunkin wouldn't take a $50 dollar bill.  I want to be better but it's so easy to be complacent when you're stuck in self-pity. Its everyone's fault but mine. Does anyone have pointers of how I can snap myself out of this thinking? \n\nEdit: In the moment I have a hard time adopting \"people have it much worse\". I usually say to myself \"I know I don't have it the worst but I'm allowed to feel what I'm feeling \".
