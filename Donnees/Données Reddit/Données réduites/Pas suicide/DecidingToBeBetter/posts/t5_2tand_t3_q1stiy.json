Just pointlessly scrolling through dumb shit to cure my anxiety temporarily or hold off getting any work done / addressing issues that need my attention. But somehow I still didn\u2019t stop, I tried to limit myself but just kept going back. \n\nUntil today, when the outage occurred and I didnt have access to Insta and FB, I actually got shit done and spent way less time on my phone. When the apps were back up obviously I continued binging and then it hit me. That I need to stop this now, I already experienced how better off I was this morning. So I instantly deleted all three apps 30 mins ago and I already feel at peace ready to start fresh. \n\nSorry just wanted to rant somewhere", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1stiy/deleted_instagram_facebook_and_tiktok/", "title": "Deleted Instagram, Facebook and TikTok", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dasing123", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 667, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633426031, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1stiy/deleted_instagram_facebook_and_tiktok/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436947.8457642, "replies_charged": false}
