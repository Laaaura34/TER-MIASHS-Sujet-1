I have a 9-5 job, i have been working out often, reading books, getting a little more serious with photography by doing projects of mine and recently i started learning to draw.\n\nThe problem is that i still feel i should be doing something more that would help me find a job more easily if something happens. In my current job there is nothing to be promoted by learning a new program or something. While doing all these for my i also meet with friends so there is little time left in my day but i still get the feeling that i am somehow wasting time doing all these things as they would not provide me something to get financially better in the next years.\n\nIs there anything that would suggest me to look up to? (maybe coding or new language or anything) that i could start learning so that i become better and also don't get the feeling of wasting my time and getting anxious about it.\n\nIs there something wrong while doing a lot of stuff to continue feel like i am wasting my time on these?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ppcf8t/how_to_stop_feeling_like_i_am_wasting_my_time_and/", "title": "How to stop feeling like i am wasting my time and learn a new useful skill.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "sotirisdimi", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631795606, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ppcf8t/how_to_stop_feeling_like_i_am_wasting_my_time_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438168.930102, "replies_charged": false}
