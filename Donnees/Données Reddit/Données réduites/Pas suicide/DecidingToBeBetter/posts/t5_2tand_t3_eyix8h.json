But every time I start I kinda end up giving in to staying up just a LITTLE later to play video games with my friend I never see anymore, or social life comes up and I end up going out all night and sleeping in all day and routine gets destroyed. How do you balance that? Do I just need more discipline? Am I trying to change too much at once? I'm so upset with myself when I go to bed. Like I haven't done what I planned, or what I actually WANTED to do, just what I felt like doing.
