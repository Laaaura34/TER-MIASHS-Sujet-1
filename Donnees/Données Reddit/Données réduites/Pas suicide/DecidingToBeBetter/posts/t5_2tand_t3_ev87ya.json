I\u2019m recovering after a period of stress and depression where pretty much all I felt for a few years was that I wanted to get hit by a truck as I finished my degree. So much of the past few years was terror about the future...like way off years ahead.\n\nNow things have moved forward and I\u2019m far less depressed, have some income, finished my degree, but I feel like I\u2019m coming back after an injury...I\u2019m just super emotionally wobbly and awkward.  \n\nI\u2019ll either be insanely positive, feeling like total shit, furious, or completely miserable. In all cases, it feels very difficult to pull back from.  I don\u2019t want to be closed off anymore like I was; it was incredibly lonely. But all this careening back and forth is fucking exhausting.\n\nAnyone have any tips?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ev87ya/i_want_to_be_more_emotionally_balanced/", "title": "I want to be more emotionally balanced", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "KrocusJok", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 43, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1580231309, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ev87ya/i_want_to_be_more_emotionally_balanced/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435252.2861304, "replies_charged": false}
