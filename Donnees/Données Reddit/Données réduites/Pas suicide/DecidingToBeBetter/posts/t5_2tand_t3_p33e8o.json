The way I acted differently towards my girlfriends than I did to my actual friends.\n\nTurns out, it\u2019s all my fault.\n\nI took after my dad. My dad was really emotionally and physically abusive to my mom when I was really little.\n\nI think I might have seen all of that and processed it as what people who love each other do.\n\nI never physically abused any of my gf\u2019s, in fact I was the one often being pushed, slapped, spat in the face\u2026\n\nBut the emotional manipulation I can honestly say I had a hand in that sort of behavior.\n\nI aim to do better. I scheduled a therapy session to discuss how to remedy these types of habits. Unfortunately due to covid, it\u2019s all the way in September. So, I\u2019ll do my best to hang on until then.\n\nI feel as though I won\u2019t find much help on this thread, but I do want to let others know who\u2019ve gone through something similar that you\u2019re not alone.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to realize that you were the \u201cbad guy\u201d all along. It reminds me of the character \u201cLoki\u201d in the Marvel movies. It was in his nature to lie, deceive, and manipulate all his life, but once he realized that he could actually do good in the world, he decided to go against his nature and devoted himself to being the best most positive version of himself he could be.\n\nWe all have that decision inside of us. Whether to use our gifts for good or evil. It\u2019s up to us to become the best versions of ourselves.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be the bad version of myself anymore. I want to spend the rest of my life being generous with my time, love, and happiness. It may be a long road out of this mess, but I\u2019ll do my best to make it out.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p33e8o/just_realized_im_toxic_looking_to_improve/", "title": "Just realized I\u2019m toxic.
