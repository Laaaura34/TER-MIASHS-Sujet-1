Fortunately, I was able to receive offers to do some micro jobs and now I have enough money to be relaxed with food for some time, but I wanna start saving money to leave the country. I presented an interview for a job that can pay me 200 dollars per month for 8 hours of daily work from Monday to Saturday -enough money to buy a lot of food in Venezuela-, but that it is not enough to think about living in other country and I am not gonna know if I passed the test until next week. I posted on freelance pages like Upwork and Workana, but I haven\u00b4t received anything.\n\nI can do all kinds of things related to Spanish (transcription, narration, teaching...), I can express myself in English and I also can understand and speak some Portuguese; those are my skills.
