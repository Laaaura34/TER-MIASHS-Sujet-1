Also, I'm pretty scared of being ridiculed for things I like or coming off as stupid and weird. Because of this things I come off as extremely reserved and quite person and people don't know what I even like and think that I don't want to be friends with them... However I can be funny and enthusiastic around people I know very well, but they also can still stress me lol. Things I already try to incorporate into my life is being more optimistic, journaling and mindfulness.\n ANY ADVICE WELCOMED :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kiwywa/im_trying_to_be_less_quiet_and_talk_more_any/", "title": "I'm trying to be less quiet and talk more, any advice?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SmilingNihilst33", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1608743608, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kiwywa/im_trying_to_be_less_quiet_and_talk_more_any/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437600.5774646, "replies_charged": false}
