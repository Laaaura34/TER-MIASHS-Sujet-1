The way I eat has had a huge impact on my life and I genuinely believe that the weight loss (while utterly wonderful) is one of the many side effects. My mental health has benefitted more than I would ever have imagined and has definitely made a difference to my life (and those around me). I don't think I would have been able to have come off my anti-depressants without reducing my carb and sugar intake.\n\nOnly 10lbs to go until I'm at my goal weight which I will hopefully reach in September. My plan will then be to go low carb, rather than keto and maintain my weight while relaxing a little on the weighing and measuring. That'll be a big change! \ud83e\udd23\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\n\n**START**\n\nWeight - 15st 8lbs/218lbs/98.8kg\n\nBMI - 42.8\n\nUK Dress Size - 20/22\n\n**CURRENT**\n\nWeight - 9st 8lbs/134lbs/60.8kg\n\nBMI - 26.3\n\nUK Dress Size - 8/10\n\n**STATS**\n\nWeight Loss - 6st/84lbs/38.1kg\n\nInches Lost - 59.8 inches/152cm\n\nBMI Dropped - 16.5\n\nDress Sizes Dropped - 6\n\n**MY LIFESTYLE**\n\nDaily tracking, weighing and measuring of all foods\n\nVery low carb (up to 20g daily)\n\nNo sugar\n\nHigh healthy fats\n\nHigh protein\n\nLow alcohol (gin and vodka)\n\nModerate exercise by walking and living a busy life - no classes, gym, sports or set workouts\n\nIntermittent Fasting (IF) between 18-22 hours a day.
