Graduating college with a respectable science degree. High performing my whole life. Shitty childhood. Lifelong mental health issues. No ambitions or goals really, my only desire is to be comfortable and left alone. \n\nI\u2019ve been \u201cself medicating\u201d with weed daily for two years now. Every now and again from age 15-19. I only smoke when I plan on being home for the remainder of the day so mostly days off and at night after work. It\u2019s become a habit as well as \u201cmedication.\u201d How do I know if it\u2019s helping or hurting me? My energy has been much lower since I\u2019ve started daily consumption, but I\u2019m riddled with anxiety and depression anytime I have to go without. People on antidepressants need their medication. Do I just need mine or am I addicted?
