But since my first depressive episode five years ago, plus the following for episodes and intermittent low mood, I haven\u2019t been able to pick up a book. Trying to pay attention was genuinely painful. But I started antidepressants in December, and I\u2019ve been seeing my therapist since October. Now I\u2019ve been returning to my original self! \n\nI talk more. I exercise more. I\u2019m kinder to myself. I\u2019m having ideas on how to get my grad job. Most importantly, I finished a book!
