A friend of mine asked me the other day how I was doing and normally he\u2019ll hear about how overwhelmed or depressed I feel and rather than offering my usual response, I told him that \u201cthings were going well and that I couldn\u2019t complain.\u201d His response was: \u201cokay but seriously, how are you actually doing?\u201d\n\nI thought that spoke volumes of my overall attitude and disposition in life. Yes, it\u2019s important to address my mental health and take steps to find healing but I think part of that process is learning how to be thankful for the big and small things. I have a wonderful family, I have great friends, I\u2019m in good health, I\u2019m working towards my goals, I have a job that\u2019s providing me a bit of financial freedom. Covid-19 has destroyed many families (whether it be mental, physical, or financially) and my issues do not even come close to the immense suffering that people are currently enduring. Life is what you make of it, folks. There will always be something to be miserable about, and I think it takes great courage and resiliency to say: \u201chey my life may not be where I want it to be, but I am pretty darn blessed.\u201d", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jvuv8u/doing_well_and_my_friends_are_in_disbelief/", "title": "Doing well and my friends are in disbelief", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "2020ismyyear", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 52, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1605626714, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jvuv8u/doing_well_and_my_friends_are_in_disbelief/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435586.5631888, "replies_charged": false}
