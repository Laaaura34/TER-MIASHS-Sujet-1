I need your help.\n\nOver the years I've noticed that I'm an incredibly nervous person. I get jumpy way too easily. I don't know why this is, but I hate it. It's such a big problem for me that I make myself physically ill just because I'm so nervous, usually resulting in severe stomach aches and even vomiting from time to time. It's stopping me from experiencing new things, going out meeting people, even something as simple as signing up for driving lessons. Hell, it's even keeping me from improving at video games like PUBG and Escape From Tarkov just because I get so nervous and jumpy that I throw out all common sense and start running around like a headless chicken the second I hear any gunshots or footsteps.\n\nSo... Does anybody here know how I could slowly but surely teach myself how to calm the f*ck down? Any input is appreciated.
