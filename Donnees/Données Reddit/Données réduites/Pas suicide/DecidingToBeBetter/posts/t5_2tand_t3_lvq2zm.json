I was verbally and emotionally tortured and abused constantly by my ex boyfriend throughout the entirety of my teen years. He is a pedophile who projected his fantasies onto me and expected me to play the role of the child. He has threatened multiple times that he will hurt a real child because of my breaking up with him. He is insane, and I truthfully just don't know what to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat is a very shortened versioned of what I went through, and I ask that if you do comment to read a bit of the original post that I can't crosspost here. I am utterly lost in what to do and I feel extremely guilty. Is there a way I can anonymously help this situation? I want him to never have access to children and I want to be completely separated from that part of my life as soon as possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for reading, any advice or comments at all would be extremely appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks so much,\n\n\\-zizithrowaway", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lvq2zm/my_insane_ex_is_a_pedophile_i_feel_extremely/", "title": "My insane ex is a pedophile, I feel extremely guilty- Please help!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "zizithrowaway", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614647109, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lvq2zm/my_insane_ex_is_a_pedophile_i_feel_extremely/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437544.6688082, "replies_charged": false}
