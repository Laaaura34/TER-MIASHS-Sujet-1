On october 1st started my 5th month of trying to get better.\n\n\nI started my journey on 27th of May 2021,\u00a0I've\u00a0been struggling with severe mental illnesses, body weight, cigarette consumption and relationship problems.\n\n\nI started going on therapy and started my nutrition plan and\u00a0gym..\u00a0I've been doing\u00a0great for 2 months but then it kinda all went down hill, so I pushed myself up, and im not letting anything stop me anymore. Currently\u00a0i\u00a0have lost 20 kg. And im not planning to stop until\u00a0i\u00a0get to my desired weight, and that would be at least 20 more kilograms.\n\n\nToday I deleted all of my social media apps, since I think it will help me focus on myself more than just spend time watching other people lives and liking posts that will not get me anywhere except consume my time.\n\n\nI started going to library and reading psychology and been trying to quit cigarette\u00a0addiction (I was smoking 1 pack per day and now im down to 15 cigarettes per day), I just started reading Alan\u00a0Kaar's\u00a0book, and hoping it will help me overcome this nasty habit.\n\n\nI also started working 2 jobs and I'm trying to keep myself busy over the winter since that's the most depressed time of the year.\n\n\nAll in all - it is hard but I try to stay motivated and active.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q13hyi/been_trying_to_get_better_for_5_months_now/", "title": "Been trying to get better for 5 months now", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "taxyzz", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 22, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633346716, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q13hyi/been_trying_to_get_better_for_5_months_now/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436437.3870618, "replies_charged": false}
