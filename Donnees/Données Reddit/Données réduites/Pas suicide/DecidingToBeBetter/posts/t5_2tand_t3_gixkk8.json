She broke up with me and proceeded to get with him after only a month. This has made me realize I shouldn't do what she's done by jumping into dating and have set out four goals to better myself, which I'll work on over the next 2.5 years. These goals are \"Physical appearance and health/wellbeing\", \"Social skills and charisma\", \"Be less materialistic and be better with money\" and \"Put more effort into my degree, career, hobbies and friendships\".\n\n# Full Version\n\n**Background**\n\nThe title of this post isn't totally accurate but is ultimately the truth. I don't believe she made the conscious decision to leave me for him, but I do believe she lined him up ready for after ending our relationship.\n\nWe broke up a month ago and she told me \"It will be **hard** for \\[her\\] to recover and move on\". Yesterday she messaged me to say that her and this guy \"are looking at being a couple soon\" - which I can see straight through, they're clearly already a couple and I know are frequently violating lockdown law to see each other. This guy's name? The name that was popping up on her phone and in conversations more and more towards the last few months of our relationship. She also used to tell me about several 'funny' things that happened in her day involving him, that I would categorize as flirting. Yesterday, she admitted she had feelings for him before she broke up with me. So **she emotionally cheated on me**. Researching this online reveals that people do this when they are immature, very insecure, have low self-esteem and are reliant on validation from others. Which knowing her, makes total sense.\n\nI'm not at all upset that she's with someone new, as everyone gets with someone new eventually. I'm upset that she was disloyal and that I meant less than I thought I did to her which she proved by moving on so quickly. But I've realized, this is purely on her. I was loving, caring and **loyal** to her so **she's lost someone who loved her, I've not**. I'm glad someone capable of doing what she did is no longer in my life and hope I find someone who doesn't take me for granted.\n\n**My Realization**\n\nI was thinking to myself before \"if she's found someone new, maybe I should too\". But fuck that! I love myself enough to be happy single so I'm going to do what she didn't, which is to work on myself emotionally, physically, mentally and socially. This will mean when I eventually find someone new, I'll be going into a **healthy** relationship, not going into a relationship having not recovered from and grown since the last one. So I'm not going to look for someone new for at least 6 months. If someone comes to me (like she did), I will see where that goes but I'm not going to look for someone before that time.\n\nI'm setting myself four goals that I will **try not to evaluate success/failure** until October 2022. Which is when I finish my degree, so it'll be a good time to look back at how far I've progressed.\n\n**My Goals**\n\n**1 - Physical appearance and health/wellbeing**\n\n* Exercise more \u2605\n* Have a better diet \u2605\n* Focus on skin care - beat the acne I've been struggling with \u2605\n* Once the gyms open, have and stick to a routine\n* Once the hairdressers open, get a new haircut and if I'm unhappy with that continue to experiment with that\n* Start wearing the contact lenses that I have FINALLY found that have the required properties to properly correct my fucked up eyes\n\n**2 - Social skills and charisma**\n\n* Watch social intelligence and charisma development videos on YouTube and try to practice the skills I learn to everyday situations \u2605\n* Travel more to meet new people, once that's possible\n* Generally get closer to my friends and try to use the skills I learn with them too\n\n**3 - Be less materialistic and be better with money**\n\n* Stop buying stuff that even though it's better than what I have currently, I don't necessarily need\n* Remove my external dependencies on happiness - I shouldn't need stuff to be happy\n* Try and budget better, save more money and spend money on memorable experiences such as travel, rather than physical stuff \u2605\n\n**4 -  Put more effort into my degree, career, hobbies and friendships**\n\n* Stop 'coasting' my degree as it's something I'm naturally good at. I want to get my current average of 73% as close to 100% as possible\n* Put more time in at home to learn new skills that apply to my job to hopefully stand out from my colleagues and enable more exciting opportunities in the future\n* Pick up the Piano and Guitar again, learn new songs and improve my skill \u2605\n* Find new hobbies to keep me engaged and improving as a person\n* Become closer to my friends, value them more\n\n\u2605 = already started doing this\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI'm not angry at my ex-gf, I'm grateful. I am no longer with someone who didn't appreciate me enough to want to be with me and wasn't loyal. I have learned a lot about relationships from her, both what can go right and what can go wrong. While I was with her she was a lovely person so I can't hate her for what she's done. I'm upset/disappointed about the disloyalty but what's done is done. I want to stay in contact with her, as long as she does too. I hope I'll be successful in my goals and that I'm thankful to her for giving them a jump-start.\n\nHere's a quote I found that I feel is topical:\n\n>Don't get mad. Don't get even. Do better. Much better. Rise above. Become so engulfed in your own success that you forget it ever happened.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nMost people aren't even questioning that she emotionally cheated, but a small few don't seem to see it. I must remind everyone, what people classify as 'cheating' depends on the boundaries within the relationship. I am the type of person to be willing to try a more open relationship, but she definitely was not. I remember her once lecturing me about how cheating in any form is the worst thing you can do to your partner. Ironic. She always got very jealous and suspicious of any involvement I had with other girls, which I can assure you I had no feelings for, they were just friends and I very rarely communicated alone with them - almost always as a group with other guys. So what she did was definitely beyond the boundaries of our relationship.\n\nThanks to everyone for the support and advice! I was not expecting any attention to this post - I was posting it so I could look back on it as I progress as a person. It's helpful to see people who were in a similar situation some time ago and how far they've come since. It's amazing to see people who have gone through similar recently taking inspiration from the post and a few people even reaching out to me via DMs for advice on how to take such a positive outlook on it! I never thought I'd become a pseudo-life-coach!\n\nThanks to u/Exile451 for including this story on [his YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCanZJNtSizOO8_KC6wmldeQ)!
