It\u2019s lead me to create bad habits which would ultimately place me in a worse state of mind. Ended up arguing with a close friend of mine on multiple occasions, traumatizing him in the process, and now we don\u2019t talk anymore unfortunately. Had another friend who has had a handful of mental disorders, let\u2019s just say she\u2019s hurt me because of it, and I still have urges to go back to her even if I know it\u2019ll just harm me. \nHow do I stop all this? I depend on others for happiness, being lonely sucks yes but I\u2019m kinda bad at socializing with people due to lack of experience. \nAt the same time, I wanna find inner happiness and not think about my failures via compare my own worth to others, just because they have skills that I wish to have. \nI\u2019m trying to push my limits & come out of my comfort zone by getting into many interests that I see fit. (Especially since these topics, Blazblue for ex, are ones the group of people I wanna talk to enjoy.) \nYet it\u2019s all so tiring. Hopefully it\u2019s just the process of doing things you aren\u2019t used to. \nTL;DR: I want to move on from my past self and mistakes. I wanna make new friends and be more of an interesting person to approach, while having inner peace.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ows61b/has_dealt_with_depression_loss_of_friends_finding/", "title": "Has dealt with depression & loss of friends.
