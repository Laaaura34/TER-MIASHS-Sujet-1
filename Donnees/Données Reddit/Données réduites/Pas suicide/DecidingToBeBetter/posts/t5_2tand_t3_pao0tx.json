These come and go. My girlfriend expressed to me how I've been putting all this stress on her too and being really negative/pessimistic. Just spreading bad vibes all around me. She doesn't feel comfortable with me and couldn't express any of her own stresses, worrying it'd stress me out even more\n\nOn top of this, it brings back a lot of childhood traumas she had with her dad because he'd just randomly get into a bad mood and all focus has to be put on him...but when all focus is put on him he'd be dismissive, saying \"no nothing's wrong\" in a passive-aggressive way. This is how I've been.\n\nWhen my GF and I talk, hang out, I bring these negative emotions with work and life with me. I make everything about me, put a barrier up and become stubborn, not listening to advice. She's extremely supportive and our communication is great, I really appreciate her bringing this up because I didn't even notice how much it affected her. \n\nI know this is not good. It affects me, and more importantly, the people I love. I need to change this.\n\nAnyone experience the same in the past? What are actionable steps and ways to improve? Thanks so much, any advice is greatly appreciated.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pao0tx/how_can_i_handle_my_stress_better_so_that_i_dont/", "title": "How can I handle my stress better so that I don't spread negativity/toxicity to loved ones around me?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TakExplores", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 372, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629813947, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pao0tx/how_can_i_handle_my_stress_better_so_that_i_dont/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435764.5377607, "replies_charged": false}
