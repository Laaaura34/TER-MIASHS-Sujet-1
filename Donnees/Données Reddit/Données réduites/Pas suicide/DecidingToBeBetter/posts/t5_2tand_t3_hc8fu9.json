But I'm lost. \n\nI'm a 36-year old father of 6, who has suffered from severe depression and anxiety since adolescence. I coasted through school then used my charm and what not to coast through early adulthood. I had no clue what I was doing. I started drinking. Heavily. I lost jobs, relationships, family, and time.\n\nI've been on a medication for anxiety and depression that works well, cut out drinking, and focusing on family. I have a \"job\". Not great, nowhere near what I can or should be doing.\n\nI'm not sure where to go from here. I want to fulfill my potential! I would love more than anything to go back to school. My old school is impossible to get back into due to money owed and dropping out. I would even love to learn a trade and be bad ass with my hands as well as my brain. But, as sad as it sounds. I... Don't know how.\n\nTL;DL - After cleaning their life up, how does an adult go back to college, or find something they enjoy for work?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hc8fu9/ive_decided_now_what/", "title": "I've decided.
