My dad is an alcoholic and nearly ruined his life on multiple occasions, and I fear I'll turn into him. So, after a night of heavy drinking and bad decisions, I've finally decided to take matters into my own hands and change. Tonight was the first night in probably two years that I didn't drink, and tomorrow I'm going to an AA meeting. I'm extremely nervous because I have social anxiety and being surrounded by strangers makes me uneasy. I was wondering if anyone who has gone to AA meetings before can just give me some advice on how to get the guts to talk and tell me what should I expect?\n\n\nUPDATE: Damn. I was not expecting to get this amount of love and support. Thank you all so much. My first meeting went great. There were a lot of laughs and tears and I decided to speak a little. I received my 24 Hour Beginner chip and I cant stop looking at it. This is night #2 with no alcohol. I feel very optimistic and hopeful besides feeling weak and shaky. I'm going to my next meeting tomorrow and hitting the gym afterwords. I can not explain how it my makes my heart swell to read the comments of people in my same situation saying my post pushed them to go to a meeting. We're all in this fucked up world together.
