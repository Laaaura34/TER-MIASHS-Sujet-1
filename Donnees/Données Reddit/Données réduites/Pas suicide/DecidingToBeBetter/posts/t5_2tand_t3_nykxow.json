My mom keeps motivating us that things will be better, and everything will be okay, while my dad searches for another job. We've been struggling due to the pandemic, yet we are stronger because of it\n\nToday, I turned 20, and because my parents cant afford to buy me a cake, they made me toasted buttered bread (which is one of my favorite food) and a candle on top. My mom teared up as she said \"We're sorry we cant get you a cake\", and I said \"thats okay, toasted bread is better anyway\" as I teared up too. \n\nThis birthday is my most special birthday out of all my previous birthdays, because it shows that even though we got hit hard, we are still here, going strong. Out of all our struggles for the past couple of months I can still celebrate my birthday with food, and my family. \n\nI'm so grateful for everything that I have, the little things to the big things.
