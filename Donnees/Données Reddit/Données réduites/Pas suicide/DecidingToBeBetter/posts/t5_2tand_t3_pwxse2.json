It's been months now and I'm struggling to even find something like a regular office position that doesn't require many qualifications. Well, I had a super surprise interview come up in conversation today and accepted a job working at a restaurant. I know I'll be great at it, I've worked in restaurants since 16, I was just really hoping to get into my field. \n\nOther than that, I've been practically begging my boyfriend to treat me better for ages now. He started \"demanding\" respect from me recently after I was mentioning how disrespected I've felt, how taken advantage of, etc. Tonight the conversation came up and he said \"I'm a male, I come first.\" I said I thought relationships were supposed to be mutual; and still, I gave him respect and allowed him to take my self worth over the last year... so really, even if that were true, it's still my turn! \n\nI'm HOPING that I'm done crying over it and I'm hoping I don't fall back into this again tomorrow. I've done it so many times before. I know I deserve to be treated better and I'm hanging onto what \"could\" be - things he promised but never gave... \n\nThanks for reading and if you have advice I would really appreciate it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwxse2/finally_accepted_a_job_and_am_getting_ready_to/", "title": "Finally accepted a job and am getting ready to move out and on from my relationship", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Fapertures", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 32, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632800360, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwxse2/finally_accepted_a_job_and_am_getting_ready_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435124.608545, "replies_charged": false}
