It wasn't my first choice but I got no other offer.  I was very scared whether I will succeed cause theory is one thing application the other. Long story short: It was a disaster - my superior would always ask questions (aggressively) I couldn't know and ask why I didn't ask before. Answer: Simply because there was no real training - if I had questions everyone was busy. During uni I always felt that others were smarter than me and I somehow cheated my way through my degree. This feeling was just cemented after taking on my first job and especially after being fired from it.\n\nFast forward to my second job. Everything is much better, there is even a training program with a guy who is only responsible for teaching the new staff. Yet, self doubt is still a part for me everytime when there is a question I can't answer. Even though I know that not knowing something doesn't mean knowing nothing - it still hurts. Now, I am hired still making mistakes and feeling bad comparing myself to others, who began training with me but went for higher jobs. I am scared of making steps forward after uni and especially after that first job.\n\nWhat can I do to change myself ?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m8t19u/feeling_no_happiness/", "title": "Feeling no happiness", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Marthin1234", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616193259, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m8t19u/feeling_no_happiness/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437078.0142899, "replies_charged": false}
