I'm not smart, but everyone around me tells me I am. I feel like an imposter. I'm not good enough for my degree or a relationship. I've never been in a relationship or had sex and im 22. I dont have many friends even though I get along fine with people, it just never goes anywhere. \n\nI'm a bit triggered right now. I did an assessment thinking I nailed it, and was so confident thinking I got a good mark. I got a 57 percent. I passed it, but for me, anything under 70 percent is a fail. I passed by 7 percent. This is a fail to me. It completely crushed my confidence and everything that I worked towards in this class. I enrolled in biology, and I can already smell the failure from here. I find bio really hard and dropped out of it twice because I failed one practical which didn't really matter if I pass the rest. \n\nI'm not good enough.
