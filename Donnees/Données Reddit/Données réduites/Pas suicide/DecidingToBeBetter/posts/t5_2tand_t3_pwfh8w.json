My body and mind are slowly deteriorating because of bad life changes. I hit rock bottom it seemed to me. Somehow I found strength in that and finally I did something about my diet, I'm actually sugar and carb free for over a month now, never thought I could do this. \n\nStill, I sit in front the PC all day, just doing nothing, I don't even like watching some boring ass YT videos. In fact, I weirdly hate it. But I just can't stop. Problem is that I don't have much to do. My Master's is beginning in a few days, then there is something. But still, after studying I am just in front of my laptop. Nothing else. Its just a rush everyday, I stress myself out to study as fast as possible, so that I can have as much \"free time\" as I can. \n\nIs there somebody in a similar situation? I think I am on the edge of ditching this habit, but somehow I can't. It is a weird feeling. \n\nI feel like I need a discrete plan. I have thought about just taking my laptop to my parents house (it's far away) so that I can't be online. But then there is the problem with my mobile phone. Of course I just could buy a very cheap one with no internet access, but then I can't really study for my exams. I mean I could, technically just study at the computer rooms at the university..... So many words, but no real action.\n\nVent ended.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwfh8w/i_want_to_ditch_my_youtube_addiction_but_i_dont/", "title": "I want to ditch my YouTube addiction but I don't know how", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "briansteel420", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 22, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632743796, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwfh8w/i_want_to_ditch_my_youtube_addiction_but_i_dont/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435947.5015583, "replies_charged": false}
