I was with this guy for almost seven years and well I have been on this journey of self discovery. I\u2019ve met and spoken to many cool people on here. Thank you for being kind! \n\nWe all look for genuine people who share a little piece. It has helped a lot for me. I\u2019m working on bettering myself and trying to push myself to be where I need to be. Doing this alone is the most difficult thing to do but understanding one self is crucial for this part of life. No matter what happens just keep pushing to be better and I hope this helps someone some way. We all have our differences but we all go through the same factor of being better. Life is difficult to understand at times but just breath in & out and just keep moving. \n\nBe safe!
