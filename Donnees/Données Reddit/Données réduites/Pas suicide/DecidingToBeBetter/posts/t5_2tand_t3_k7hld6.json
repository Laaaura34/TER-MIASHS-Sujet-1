I got sick of jail cells, court appearances, lost relationships, hangovers,  disappointing my Mumma, losing jobs, failing grades, that pit of depression or as some call it rock bottom, hurting people i love.\n\nAlcohol is my drug of choice and it nearly destroyed me. This is the longest I've been sober for 16 years. I still feel like shit and experience a lot of depression but it is somehow a bit more manageable now than it was. But I am managing to reach goals that I wasn't before like holding down jobs and passing uni. I guess i kind of expected it to be this miraculous thing, but it isn't. Once the alcohol is gone im left  with the raw inner feelings that caused me to drink and in all honesty i haven't made much of an effort to deal with those yet. But ill go to counselling next year and could possibly get into some kind of 12 step program cause right now i am 'white knuckling' it as they say in the rooms.\n\nIf you are reading this struggling with addiction. If there is one thing i can almost guarantee you. Is that living sober does have benefits over using. I believe in you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k7hld6/one_year_sober_today/", "title": "One year sober today", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "therewillbeniccage", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1520, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1607208681, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k7hld6/one_year_sober_today/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436164.6174934, "replies_charged": false}
