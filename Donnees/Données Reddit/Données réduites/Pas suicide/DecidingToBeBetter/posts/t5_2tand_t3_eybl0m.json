I had a bad high school experience and a toxic home life so college was a beacon of hope. But I didn\u2019t get the typical, cliche college experience when I got here. Or anything close to it. It\u2019s very disheartening, especially when I have to see everyone around with friends and doing \u201ccollege\u201d things.\n\nI know I won\u2019t die when I\u2019m done with college, but I currently view life after college as boring, depressing, mundane, and other similar words. I never really felt like a \u201cteenager\u201d and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m going to enter \u201cadulthood\u201d without ever experiencing being \u201cyoung and free\u201d (I don\u2019t know how else to say it). \n\nI think I\u2019m asking for help on how to stop thinking like that, because there is something within me that\u2019s telling me I\u2019m wrong. Seeing people around my age, with active friends and SOs, can really ruin my day because I keep thinking that this is my only chance to live that kind of life, and I\u2019m fucking wasting it. My post history has more \u201cinfo\u201d if anyone cares.\n\nPls anything :/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eybl0m/i_want_to_be_more_optimistic_about_the_future_so/", "title": "I want to be more optimistic about the future, so that I can stop sulking and hurting over what\u2019s happening right now.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwawayyhide", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1580755192, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eybl0m/i_want_to_be_more_optimistic_about_the_future_so/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437495.24597, "replies_charged": false}
