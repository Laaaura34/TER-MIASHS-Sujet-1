I seem to have had no problem making individual friends; however I\u2019ve never really had a group of friends that know each other. Mostly I\u2019ve just had a few close individual friends. I understand that to an extent this is out of my control; but are there any tips or places I could put myself in that would be the best chance of it happening?\n\nI would mostly like a group of friends since some activities are better in groups, like quizzes, going to gigs or sports and it\u2019s nice to sort of have multiple people to chat to rather than always 1:1. And often if there is a group; there\u2019s more chance someone in it; will be free to do something. I\u2019ve signed up to a few hobbies groups and met a few people from there; but again it\u2019s just individual friends, and whilst that would be great if they turned into closer friends, it would also be nice to find/ make a group of friends. I have also tried inviting unrelated people to gigs together, but it didn\u2019t really spark into a \u201cgroup\u201d per se, so any tips would be appreciated!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8i4gf/anyone_else_not_have_a_group_of_friends_but_just/", "title": "Anyone else not have a group of friends but just individual ones?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "philomenaofthefuture", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634278024, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8i4gf/anyone_else_not_have_a_group_of_friends_but_just/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437373.9836097, "replies_charged": false}
