I am inexperienced with using such drugs. My friend\u2019s text to me while I was in the ER, who was there at the scene, was awful to read. If he didn\u2019t have Narcan on him, I wouldn\u2019t be able to communicate to this to y\u2019all now. The paramedics arrived 8-10 minutes after I went cold. 16MG altogether was needed before I got to the hospital.\n\nI have struggled with addiction since my biological mother passed when I turned 15. I have no relationship with anyone I am related to for various reasons, but it all boils down to my safety. My best friend\u2019s family took me in, but LGBT community is not accepted for them. Grateful nonetheless. We are close in our own ways, but it is hard. After a tempestuous 3 years, the love of my life kicked me out of our home and she is moving across the country to get a doctorate. I\u2019ll never see her again. \n\nI think deep down I knew why I started experimenting with these drugs. I told myself I wasn\u2019t capable of love or being loved. I was no one. Despite the brutality of these things and others \u2014 enough was enough.\n\nI have a 3rd poetry book coming out in fall. I will begin graduate school for library science then, too. However, and read this closely: you don\u2019t need these seemingly \u201coutstanding\u201d goals to know you are worth fighting for, for yourself. What interests you? What excites? Who could you use a hug from? Which sights calm?  What things could use improvement? As for me, I can learn how to live for myself and those who care for me.\n\nI beg you \u2014 please use great caution when using these drugs, or just seek help. \u201cTerrified\u201d is truly minimizing to describe waking out from being a corpse.\n\nDecide to be better.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8dxds/yesterday_morning_my_body_turned_cold_from_a/", "title": "Yesterday morning, my body turned cold from a heroine overdose.
