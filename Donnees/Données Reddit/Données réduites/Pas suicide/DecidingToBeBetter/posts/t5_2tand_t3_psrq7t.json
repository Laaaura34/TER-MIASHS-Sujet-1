I am superrr codependent. I hate being alone/single because I associate it with rejection amd abandonment.\n\nThose are the main areas I've mapped out and it's been great to see that most of my issues are solvable. The only issue is that these self-help resources aren't working as well as I thought they would. (I'm also in therapy)\n\nSomething that works almost every time is hearing spiritual stuff like: \"you were meant to show people who they are. Only special people are born with this gift. Your analytical mind made peers and adults uncomfortable because they didn't like themselves.\" (I'm paraphrasing a podcast episode I just listened to)Basically explaining that the bullying and general rejection from adults was about their own issues and not about something being wrong with me. \n\nIt just clicked in a way that these self help books don't. The only issue is I don't believe in tarot cards or astrology or being born with a \"gift of sight\". Should I just keep using the spirituality resources anyway? Will this turn me into a hippie? Lol just kidding, but I don't know if it's okay to give into delusions to make myself heal.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/psrq7t/should_i_drink_the_spiritual_koolaid/", "title": "Should I drink the Spiritual Kool-Aid?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "itwaslitt", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632257407, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/psrq7t/should_i_drink_the_spiritual_koolaid/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436827.5551653, "replies_charged": false}
