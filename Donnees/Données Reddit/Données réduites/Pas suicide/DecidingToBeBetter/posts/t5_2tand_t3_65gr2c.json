In fact, when you\u2019re not daydreaming about having an affair with a celebrity or reaching max-level in your favorite pay-to-win smartphone game; you\u2019re probably thinking about your day-to-day real life problems. \n\nWhy?\n\nTo solve them, of course.\n\nYou might think about how you would feel better if you got in shape. Or you might think, \u201cIf I quit my job and stop working for that asshat, things will get better.\u201d Your brain has a fantastic ability to imagine future scenarios and to think up schemes intended to improve your life.\n\nBut there\u2019s a small problem\u2026\n\nWe think we know what makes us feel good, both short-term and long term (i.e. sex/a good job). Surprisingly, though, psychologists have found that we are essentially clueless about what makes us happy. We are more or less emotionally blind to ourselves. Not only that, we\u2019re blind to our emotional blindness. \n\nWe feel like we know what will make us happy and what will stress us out, but have you ever questioned this assumption? \nHave you considered that the problems we spend hours thinking about each day might lead us on fruitless Don Quixote-esque pursuits? Maybe we\u2019re chasing ghosts. \n\nAll of your mind\u2019s self-improvement schemes might be helpful, but what if the thing that\u2019s really damaging your well-being is something you\u2019re not even aware of? \n\nWe all have blindspots, no one is perfectly self-aware, but what if you\u2019re blind to the thing in your life that is having the largest negative impact on your well-being?\n\nTake me, for example\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve always devalued money, I\u2019ve thought of it as a nasty thing and I wanted nothing to do with it. I spent my money carelessly and put little thought into improving my financial situation. I didn\u2019t think about money, I didn\u2019t worry about money. I told myself I had other more important and \u2018elevated concerns\u2019, yet despite my blindness to its importance, money still mattered. Despite my blindness to money, my lack of an income was still causing me stress. Despite my blindness to it, money was still a 1000-pound gorilla on my back. \n\nMy relationship with money was causing me constant stress, but I wasn\u2019t consciously aware my relationship with money was problematic- I was blind to my blindness. Unfortunately, it\u2019s easy to be unaware of the real causes of your stress and to spend energy on smaller problems. There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re doing this as well, but of course, you don\u2019t know this.\n\nIs there a solution? \n\nYes, you must take a step back from the voice in your head and look at more objective measures for your happiness. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The Three Pillars**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere are three pillars of life satisfaction. If you aren\u2019t satisfying one of these needs adequately, it can cause suffocating levels of psychological stress. \n\nTake a moment to evaluate yourself on these three pillars, because no matter how much you improve the other areas of your life, if one of these pillars isn\u2019t up to par with the others, you must focus on improving that area to significantly improve your well-being. \n\nLook at it this way, imagine you want to compete in a triathlon, your running ability is amazing, you\u2019d rate yourself a 9/10. Your cycling is also very good, you\u2019d rate yourself an 8/10. \n\nBut\u2026\n\nYour swimming is terrible, you barely ever swim, and have never developed the skill, you\u2019d rate yourself a 2/10. \n\nHow would you train for the triathlon? Spending time on running or cycling wouldn\u2019t be of much value to you until you got your swimming up to par. You could train to be the best runner in the world, but you still wouldn\u2019t win if you didn\u2019t improve your swimming ability.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to fall into this same situation in real life, and not even be aware of it. \n\nTake a moment to measure your performance in the three pillars of life-satisfaction and you may find that you\u2019ve had a huge blindspot that\u2019s been limiting your well-being.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Monetary Wealth**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nResearch has found that money does correlate with happiness, up to about the 75,000 dollar a year mark (which so happens to be the amount of money necessary to take care of your basic needs), past that, money has almost no effect on your emotional well-being. \n\nMoney is always going to be a source of stress, but if you make less than the amount necessary to take care of your basic needs, it can be debilitating.  \n\nBut just making $75,000/year isn\u2019t enough, if you make your money from a career that feels meaningless, you\u2019ve got a better problem, but still a substantial one. Working a corporate job for a company you\u2019re ambivalent towards and for a boss you hate is a steady drain on your psyche. It\u2019s not so immediately painful as making too little money, but if you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re accomplishing something meaningful with your time, your life won\u2019t feel very satisfying. \n\nFortunately, if you need to change your career, time you spend towards finding something better will be enjoyable, you will be focused and determined. Once you accept that this area of your life isn\u2019t being properly managed, and you hone in on the value you want to strive for, your efforts towards solving the problem will be stress-relieving; because that stress you felt existed because your previous career didn\u2019t satisfy your most important psychological needs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Relationships**\n\n&nbsp;\n \nRelationships are, of course, the most important area of most people\u2019s lives, they\u2019re also one of the biggest sources of stress and frustration. Human relationships always have and always will involve a certain level of compromise, your values will never perfectly align with someone else\u2019s. \n\nWhen a relationship is toxic and destructive, it can poison the rest of your life, whether it be a close friendship, a family member, or a lover, if your thoughts often turn to how someone is frustrating you, you must address this. \n\nIn some cases, the only solution is to extricate yourself from the toxic relationship, if your girlfriend cheated on you, and you resent them for it, staying in that relationship might be easier than being alone and having to find someone else. But it also might be the only option that can lead to your long-term well-being. \n\nI\u2019ve literally \u2018broken up\u2019 with friends before, this might seem extreme, but if you and someone you know are having a consistently negative impact on each other, it\u2019s worth ending that relationship for both of your sakes. Remember, you are the average of the 5 people you\u2019re around the most. \n\nIn other cases, your relationships are not so toxic that they are dragging your life down, but you may have trouble expressing yourself and asserting yourself in a healthy way. We live in a generation where we are trained to be people-pleasers, unfortunately, people pleasers sacrifice their own well-being for the sake of \u2018niceness\u2019, if this is you, you must learn to disagree with other people, and to be okay with being vulnerable by being genuine. \n\nIf you\u2019re having trouble relating with people in a healthy (and mostly positive), way, it doesn\u2019t matter how much money you have, you can\u2019t expect to feel truly content and fulfilled. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Physical Health**\n\n&nbsp;\n \nWe take our health for granted until we lose it. If your physical health is not up to par with the other areas of your life, prioritize it. Of course, the most common health problem in America is weight control. \n\nFor most people, being overweight is a huge blow to their self-esteem. When you\u2019re overweight you may not feel like you\u2019re in control of yourself, and you can easily feel inferior and judged. You could tell yourself that you shouldn\u2019t feel this way, but this is more likely to bring attention to the issue than fix it (I am happy with my body, I am happy with my body, I am happy with my body\u2026 fuck) \n\nBeing fat sucks, and it\u2019s frustrating, and you\u2019re probably not okay with it. The only way to properly address it is to get in shape, we all have a million excuses, but this can be a constant source of stress until you die, or it can be transformed into a source of pride because you overcame it. \n\nIf you prefer to be fat, or it doesn\u2019t bother you at all, it\u2019s still a health issue, and the major health issues being overweight can cause are also huge sources of distress. \n\nIf you\u2019re overweight and you\u2019re not happy, don\u2019t expect a trip to the Bahamas or a promotion to make you feel better, body image is such an integral part of our self-esteem that it can\u2019t be ignored (by the way I\u2019m not saying that it should be this way, just that it is).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Find Your Blindspots**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThose are the three most important areas of your life that can suck. If any of them do suck, you can\u2019t expect to feel good about yourself until you make them better. The human brain doesn\u2019t do a good job at sorting out issues and stressors by their importance, whatever issue you focus on will feel like the most important thing you can do, whether it be getting to a higher rank in league of legends or getting a raise (even if you already make 6 figures). \n\nMake sure you don\u2019t have a blindspot that\u2019s getting in the way of your well-being. Measure where you\u2019re at in each of the three pillars areas, and find the weakest link. That\u2019s your main source of stress. That\u2019s what\u2019s getting in the way of your well-being, more than anything else. \n\nPsychologists have found that the best route to improving your well-being isn\u2019t to improve your life by adding more good things, but to take away things that are negatively impacting us. This is because we have an inherent negativity bias, and this bias makes it so that negative emotions are weighed about 3 times as heavily as positive emotions by your brain. \n\nGetting more money when you already have enough won\u2019t make you much happier, trying to gain 20 pounds of muscle when you\u2019re already in above-average shape won\u2019t make you much happier. But if you\u2019re in poverty, money is a source of stress, so getting out of poverty will have a big impact on your well-being. If you\u2019re obese, that obesity causes a lot of stress, so losing weight until you\u2019re in the healthy range, will improve your well-being. \n\nRate yourself on the three pillars write down what goal you would need to meet to reach a point where that area of your life isn\u2019t holding you back from well-being. Focus on that, and as you make progress notice how your life satisfaction improves, notice how your stress levels decrease. \n\nThe first step to high life-satisfaction is to be aware of the problem, and it\u2019s shocking how easy it is for us to be blind to what\u2019s really holding us back. When we can take a step back, and humbly evaluate ourselves, we can get a more objective, third-person view of what\u2019s affecting us, and then the path towards an even better life becomes clear. \n\nThis was taken from the blog at:\nhttps://tpsychnation.com/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/65gr2c/the_three_pillars_of_life_satisfaction/", "title": "The Three Pillars of Life Satisfaction", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Aghayden", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1492222276, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/65gr2c/the_three_pillars_of_life_satisfaction/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438113.8341022, "replies_charged": false}
