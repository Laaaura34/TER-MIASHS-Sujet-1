For example, I used to spend hours on Sundays to do different self care tasks, like exfoliating and moisturizing my whole body, cutting and painting my nails, doing a face mask, deep cleaning my room...you get the idea. By the end of the day, I wouldn't feel relaxed, I was more stressed! My days are just as busy as they were before, but with a little scheduling, I'm able to do at least one of these tasks by the end of each day, and it's a much more balanced way of caring for myself. So even if you want to improve yourself fast or work as hard as you can before doing all your self care tasks, one of the best things to do is a small act of kindness to yourself every day!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l4u0b0/when_practicing_self_care_doing_a_little_every/", "title": "When practicing self care, doing a little every day is a lot easier than trying to do it all at once.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "goatsnsheeps", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 653, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1611599264, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l4u0b0/when_practicing_self_care_doing_a_little_every/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435297.3427453, "replies_charged": false}
