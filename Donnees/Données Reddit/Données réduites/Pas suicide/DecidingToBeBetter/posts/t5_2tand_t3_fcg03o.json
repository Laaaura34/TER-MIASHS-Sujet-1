I'm not that out of shape but I feel and WANT to be better. I just am lazy and lack motivation. I really just want to lose fat and tone up and i enjoy lifting weights. I just struggle with dealing with anxiety and finding the motivation to get in the gym. I will appreciate any advice and tips. BTW, I said firefighter because I'm in college studying FPT and will soon be taking the civil service for a career firefighter position so it will be beneficial for me to get in shape.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fcg03o/how_do_i_find_the_motivation_to_workout/", "title": "How do I find the motivation to workout?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bridgeseric225", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1583171927, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fcg03o/how_do_i_find_the_motivation_to_workout/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435508.5982687, "replies_charged": false}
