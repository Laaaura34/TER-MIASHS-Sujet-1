I didn\u2019t recognize it back then, I had just thought that it just wasn\u2019t in the cards for me to have friends, relationships, or interests of any kind. I felt like I just wasn\u2019t meant to be happy. \n\nStarting in college, I realized I might have depression but still thought it was just how I was, and there was no point in changing it. I accepted my fate as it was. My family accepted it too. They were surprised one day when I said I was going on a date. I got the \u201cyou??\u201d Feel from them. I didn\u2019t go on the date. \n\nFast forward through early adulthood, nothing changed until a couple years ago when I started trying to date. I had my first actual date when I was 32. Never even kissed a guy before that. We broke up about a year later and he said \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with you but\u2026\u201d and even though I didn\u2019t love him and I don\u2019t miss him, those words still sting. Because I started to think there was actually something wrong with me. \n\nI am 35 now and still have no friends. I work enough to pay bills and spend the rest of my time waiting for bed. I don\u2019t have happiness or any positive emotions. I either feel sad, angry, or absolutely nothing. I don\u2019t want this for myself anymore. I want to be able to spend time with people and actually enjoy myself. I want friends to do things with, and I want to go on dates and maybe even get married someday. \n\nI hate that I spent so much of my life thinking I didn\u2019t deserve that for myself. \n\nSo I have finally made an appointment with a psychologist. I honestly have no idea what to expect. But I am hopeful for the first time.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3yo6y/after_15_years_of_serious_depression_and_thinking/", "title": "After 15+ years of serious depression and thinking I don\u2019t deserve happiness, I have made an appointment with a psychologist.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TooEmbarrassed7", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633702673, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3yo6y/after_15_years_of_serious_depression_and_thinking/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437052.4580674, "replies_charged": false}
