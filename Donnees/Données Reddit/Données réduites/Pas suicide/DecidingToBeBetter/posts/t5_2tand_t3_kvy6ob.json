When I get angry or frustrated I can sometimes bang my fist on something like a wall or a table, I need to stop doing that. \n\n2. When I argue a point even if its an opinion or a defense of myself I come across as always being right or in the right. This is leading to some resentment. I need to learn how to argue in a way that validates the other person's concerns or recognize when I am wrong earlier. \n\nHas anyone dealt with this before? Can anyone help point me in the right direction?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kvy6ob/looking_to_improve_my_temper_and_debating_skills/", "title": "Looking to improve my temper and debating skills", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dschild22", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1610478223, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kvy6ob/looking_to_improve_my_temper_and_debating_skills/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438216.4530873, "replies_charged": false}
