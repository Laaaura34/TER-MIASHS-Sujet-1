It always feels like it is not going to work out, or i am grasping for air, or like no one believes in me, or i just dont know my way around, or i am not smart enough or talented enough..\n\nSometimes i feel like the only time i feel not anxious is when i\u2019m with a partner who reinforces me, and that is the only time i feel strong enough to pursue anything, which seems fragile. I feel overly dependent - i cant do much when i am alone or with friends. I am not close with family. I think i have all these dreams but the easiest path to happiness or at least complacency/satisfaction seems to be just being a wife and mother.\n\nHow do you find a way forward? It feels like holding my breath and it hurts, like i dont have the endurance or courage enough to make it\u2026 but i want to, i think i need to.
