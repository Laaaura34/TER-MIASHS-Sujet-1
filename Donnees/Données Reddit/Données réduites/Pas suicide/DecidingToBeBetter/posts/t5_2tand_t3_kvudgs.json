Off and on I\u2019ve tried to wean off and stop this compulsive world to escape to but I realise I fall back into the habit the hardest when Im having the worst possible times of greatest challenge, stress and discomfort and after the short easing and pleasure from engaging with the games, there would be guilt, hatred, shame and all the mix. I\u2019ve tried deleting accounts and even using hacks to get myself banned. After unlinking and deleting my linked social media and emails to these games I find myself using them over and over still because they are still bound to my Game Center account. \n\nFinally after these years, I\u2019ve had enough and I plucked the determination to burn those bridges and ask for help. It was so wholesome when I got the email replies that my account has been unbound and blocked from those games and it feels honestly freeing that no more will I so easily slip back since I would have to start afresh and seeing the fresh profile would be a deterrent to falling back into the habit.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kvudgs/today_i_emailed_all_the_support_of_the_mobile/", "title": "Today I emailed all the support of the mobile games I\u2019ve been addicted to to unbind my accounts and block them", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "OutheMatrix", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1610467261, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kvudgs/today_i_emailed_all_the_support_of_the_mobile/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437771.5519865, "replies_charged": false}
