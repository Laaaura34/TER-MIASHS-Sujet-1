Not to toot my own horn, but I\u2019ve put my foot in a lot of things and I don\u2019t feel my \u201ccalling\u201d or a sense of satisfaction doing them. \n\nI\u2019m spending 4 years studying an engineering degree but I look at other degrees and careers and wonder if I\u2019ll be happy being in them. \n\nI feel like I can\u2019t take people\u2019s word for how good or how bad a career is, and I\u2019m better off trying it out myself and making a decision on my own. But I know that I don\u2019t have all the time in the world and came to the conclusion that it is impossible to find a job/hobby/calling that you like unless you\u2019re very, very lucky. In a sense, it\u2019s almost impossible to be satisfied and happy at life. \n\nWhat do you think?
