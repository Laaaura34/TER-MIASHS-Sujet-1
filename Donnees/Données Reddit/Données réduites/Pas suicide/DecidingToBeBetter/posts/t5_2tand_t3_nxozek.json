I went from being erratic and projecting my emotions, to being understanding of those around me and trying to understand where my negative emotions came from. I\u2019d now consider myself a pleasant and kind person, however, I feel contempt for people. Whenever I feel wronged, misjudged, or mistreated I immediately begin to feel contempt and deep frustration. This occurs even if the person did not intend anything or if the person didn\u2019t cause any actual damage. Unfortunately, this deep seeded emotion lasts for years. I remember this negative perception of said people, and it festers (even if they\u2019re still in my life). I\u2019m trying to grow and let go of those emotions/prevent myself from feeling that way about others, but I don\u2019t know where to start. I was wondering if anyone could recommend good books about inner peace and letting go of grudges? \n\nHonestly, I just don\u2019t know where to start. I\u2019ve talked to some friends about it, but many tell me I need to stop thinking of and stop caring about people who ignite those frustrations within me. I would really appreciate is some people wrote about their own experiences/ growth and what helped them or any recommendations for where to start!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nxozek/i_have_trouble_letting_go_of_grudges_and_i_want/", "title": "I have trouble letting go of grudges and I want to get better!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "iksita007", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623442128, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nxozek/i_have_trouble_letting_go_of_grudges_and_i_want/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437668.4165018, "replies_charged": false}
