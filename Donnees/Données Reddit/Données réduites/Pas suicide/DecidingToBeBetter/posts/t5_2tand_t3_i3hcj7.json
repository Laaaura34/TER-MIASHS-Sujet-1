You\u2019re saying there\u2019s a certain point you can get to where you\u2019ll be happy and satisfied and won\u2019t need to keep busting your ass with self-improvement.\n\nThe truth is **you should never want to relax and stop improving.** If you\u2019re not improving, you\u2019re atrophying.\n\nIn life, you\u2019re either on an upwards trajectory (towards your goals), or a downwards trajectory (away from your goals). There is no in-between. If you think you\u2019re \u201ctreading water\u201d and staying still, you\u2019re really moving away from your goals. Success doesn\u2019t come from staying still.\n\nA concept you\u2019ll often hear from many people is, \u201cI want a partner who loves me for me\u201d, or \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to keep pushing myself, always putting up a front and trying to be strong.\u201d They\u2019re complaining about having to improve themselves and actually make an effort to achieve the things they want to achieve. *\u201c**It seems like a lot of work**\u2026\u201d*\n\nSo what, you want to give up completely, not strive for anything, sit around playing video games, being complacent, just \u201cexisting\u201d?\n\n**Existing = sitting around just waiting to die.**\n\nTruth is you should be working on bettering yourself every day anyway; *it should be a core part of who you are.* It\u2019s a core part of being human, and a key piece of the *happiness puzzle*.\n\nThe day you feel like a completed product in one area of your life is the day you move on to the next area that needs handling. If you\u2019re finally able to date people you're into or find a partner, then it\u2019s time to move on and start killing it with money/career. If you finally hit that gym goal you\u2019ve been working on for 5 years, then it\u2019s time to set the next goal. If your business finally makes 100k, then it\u2019s time to work towards 200k.\n\nYou\u2019ll never ever be satisfied with who you are as a person or where you are in life. *You\u2019re not supposed to be.* You should definitely **be happy and proud of your achievements;** but that\u2019s not the same thing as *satisfied.* Satisfied implies there\u2019s no more work to be done, no more improvements to be made, nothing else to get better at. There will *always* be more to improve. You will never be perfect or complete - and that's a GOOD thing.\n\n**Self-improvement is an in-tray that never gets emptied.**\n\nOnce you get a taste for working on goals, pushing yourself, working on your mission, *achieving big things* \u2013 you\u2019ll never want to stop. You\u2019ll always want *more*.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a really beautiful thing. You\u2019ll never, ever, ever, ever be bored. You\u2019ll never, ever, ever be directionless. You\u2019ll always know what it is you need to do, and where it is you want to go. You\u2019ll have a sense of confidence & self-knowledge most people could never even dream of. You\u2019ll know who you are, and who you\u2019re going to be in 1 year\u2019s time.\n\n**Eventually you\u2019ll be satisfied with always being a little dissatisfied.**\n\n\\-Andy", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i3hcj7/selfimprovement_is_a_lifelong_endeavour/", "title": "Self-Improvement is a Lifelong Endeavour", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "KillYourInnerLoser", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1596539173, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i3hcj7/selfimprovement_is_a_lifelong_endeavour/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436057.618697, "replies_charged": false}
