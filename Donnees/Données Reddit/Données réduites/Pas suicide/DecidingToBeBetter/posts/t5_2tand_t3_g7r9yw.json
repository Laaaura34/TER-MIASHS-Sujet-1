I\u2019m ok. Haven\u2019t slept since yesterday. I\u2019m thinking of the act of breaking our limits. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve done that. Last time was definitely 4 years ago. It ended in major heartbreak. I feel as if that heartbreak is the reason why I haven\u2019t pushed myself since. It wasn\u2019t like it was the end. I could\u2019ve salvaged the situation; came back stronger. That\u2019s the functionality of breaking your limits. You discover the error in how you handled the fall; with that knowledge my limits have expanded, as well as my grace.\n\n  I\u2019m very far removed from my limits as of this moment. That is the discomfort of my comfort. Knowing that I\u2019m not drawing nearer to my limits, It hurts. To know that I\u2019ve removed myself from life; from the challenge of it. I am an escapist; I run. I cannot face. I fear that conflict will bring me pain, although I\u2019m aware that I can manage pain. I\u2019ve experienced pain, all too much for my short lifespan, maybe the last blow broke my internal barrier. Maybe my internal barrier had been broken all along, and my heart had been taking the damage. Maybe I\u2019ve been lying to myself. A heavy heart bears heavy armour, and maybe my armour was lighter than I thought it was. \n\n  Maybe this is the process of rebuilding. Maybe writing will help it along. Nothing else has worked. Maybe it\u2019s a misguided attempt at regaining what was lost; my ambition, my drive, my passion, and my Determination. I can\u2019t seem to find it anymore. It\u2019s not where I once left it. My phone, my laptop, my inability to focus; they have taken over my life. When did I lose so much ground? \n\n  Maybe I can\u2019t find passion, it has to find me. Maybe I have to be reflective and appreciative of my previous Determination in order to win it back. Maybe you don\u2019t pick your own Determination, It picks you.\n\n\n  Determination is a treasure; It\u2019s a conscious spirit, If you are not appreciative of It then It leaves you. If you don\u2019t push, you aren\u2019t pushed back. If you don\u2019t give, you aren\u2019t given back. If you don\u2019t appreciate determination, It doesn\u2019t appreciate you. When once It was your friend, It is now your bane. It doesn\u2019t want you, no amount of excuses will bring It back. Remember what It did for you, and forget what you gave up in return. Remember not your sacrifice, but your willingness and its abundance instead. You\u2019ve focused on your loss, rather than your willingness in incurring those losses. It wasn\u2019t that you worked hard, it wasn\u2019t that you sacrificed so much, it was that you willingly gave it all away. It was easy to give up in order to transcend, but now you\u2019ve forgotten the key to sacrifice; willingness.\n\n  Determination, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. Waiting for You is the reason that I live. You are unlike anything else in this world: The flow You bring and the peace that accompanies it, not the pleasure but the fulfilment of having You, and the animalistic passion You inspire. You are what it means to be human. With You, justification of life is unnecessary, and the sting of death is forgotten. The aroma that You give off is intoxicating; it mystifies those that smell it, they cannot help but to fall for Your alluring presence, and who can blame them. Everyone wants a taste of greatness, and with You, I could taste it in my dreams. You charmed me, You enticed me, You gave me hope. You have left me, and without You I am incomplete. \n\n  I miss You.\n\n  - Lazy Man", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g7r9yw/the_journaling_of_a_lazy_man_wanting_more/", "title": "The Journaling of a Lazy Man Wanting More", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LazyManChronicles", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1587809851, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g7r9yw/the_journaling_of_a_lazy_man_wanting_more/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435827.9774494, "replies_charged": false}
