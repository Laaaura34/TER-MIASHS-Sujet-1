We parted ways on bad terms. Shortly thereafter all my money in it has become inaccessible to me and all my distributions stopped. No access or insight into the company. Etc. \n\nI have had a crippling fear of dealing with this. I\u2019ve gone a few years now ignoring it and rebuilding myself telling myself it was so I could deal with it once I was in a position of strength. Though, likely, it continues to be in my pattern of escapism and avoidance behavior. I went to a good business school and got a good job and have been working to build that strength. I feel good about where I\u2019m at but I still can\u2019t afford a $500K lawsuit against him so I\u2019m still in the rebuilding phase. \n\nA couple months ago I was filing my taxes late and my accountant mentioned my years numbers were different than I expected and it was because I apparently made a profit from selling one of the building I own. I had no idea about this and it turns out my business partner sold a building we owned together, reported my share of the profit via a K1 but naturally never told me about it (we haven\u2019t spoken in about 3 years except for two instances our lawyers talked) and I haven\u2019t seen a penny of the profit or my principal investment. I don\u2019t even know which building of mine was sold or for how much. \n\nI\u2019ve been swinging from depressed to anxious to angry to upset to sad again during the times I can\u2019t push it out of my brain and pretend it doesn\u2019t exist since learning about this. Bad dreams frequently, etc. However, guys, I just emailed my attorney on reengaging his services told him what\u2019s going on and took the first step towards getting my ****ing money. \n\nIt\u2019s not a demand letter, it\u2019s not an actual legal action, but it\u2019s the first step towards moving past this massive emotional blockade and I\u2019m very very very happy about it!! I hope I can continue to keep up the strength and take the next steps and not feel beaten down, ashamed, embarrassed, and powerless in the face of this loss like I normally do. \n\nAnyway, thank you for your time in reading and the unconditional support you all offer one and other.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qhhxgl/small_step_to_overcoming_a_crippling_fear/", "title": "Small step to overcoming a crippling fear", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SirMonkey687", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635407866, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qhhxgl/small_step_to_overcoming_a_crippling_fear/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436444.262154, "replies_charged": false}
