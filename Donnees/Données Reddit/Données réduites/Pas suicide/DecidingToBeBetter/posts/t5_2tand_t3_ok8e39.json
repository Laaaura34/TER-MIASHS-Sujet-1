My mind is full of fear and \"what if's\".\n\nPast relationships have been traumatic for me, and the good ones I've managed to push away. \n\n**But this time I'm deciding to be better.**\n\nNot just for her or our relationship. I want to go to therapy and be better for me, because I'm so exhausted from the constant worrying and obsessing. I want to be able to be fully present and enjoy what's in front of me. And bettering me means bettering us.
