I spend way more than I make because I was never taught financial discipline.I have recently taken to looking into all my assets, income, spending and retirement goals. For the first time, I set a spending budget that will keep my spending under what I make. \n\nI also tend to buy things to support my life goals rather than do things. If there is a book or equipment to buy, I'll do that first with the BS idea that it will help/motivate me to take action toward my goal. However, I usually end up with stuff I never use, so I've spent money I didn't need to and I avoid actually working.\n\nThis happened this morning. I loaded up the cart with a couple books on calisthenics thinking I would \"really\" learn about them and then have this awesome exercise program. Instead of pressing purchase though, I went and looked at my budget for \"other\" purchases. There wasn't enough to buy the book. I went back to my computer and emptied the cart, closed the computer, and went to exercise with what I already know how to do. Pretty happy about that. (I also know about all the free resources already available for this, which makes my thinking that I must buy the books more ludicrous.)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jvvvsc/i_emptied_my_damn_amazon_cart/", "title": "I emptied my damn Amazon cart!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dog_fart_tacos", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1329, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1605630073, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jvvvsc/i_emptied_my_damn_amazon_cart/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436833.7803156, "replies_charged": false}
