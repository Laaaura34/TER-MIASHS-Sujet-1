For as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve had social anxiety and also have cared way too much of what others thought of me. Sometimes to the point where I put myself down and judged myself based on how *others* perceived me. It wasn\u2019t even reality. It was purely based on the negative voice in my head. Thanks anxiety.\n\nThis year, I have definitely become more of a cheerleader for myself. I\u2019ve celebrated and been vocal about my wins, both professionally and personally. I\u2019ve also gotten back into hobbies and interests that I used to love (i.e. Star Wars, Writing poems), which for whatever reason I was always so scared of others (friends, coworkers) judging me for liking certain things or having particular hobbies. Now, I don\u2019t care. I post about what I watch, read, and enjoy. I want to *be* myself around others, and try my hardest to not let my anxiety control me anymore. I deserve to be happy and *me*.\n\nI\u2019m excited for 2021 for me. I wrote down professional, financial, and personal goals for myself today. It\u2019s been a slow and long path self-acceptance and growth, but I know I\u2019m on the way.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg105q/im_starting_to_become_more_of_my_authentic_self/", "title": "I\u2019m starting to become more of my \u201cauthentic\u201d self and I\u2019m really proud of my progress.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tatertot94", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1343, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1608351358, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kg105q/im_starting_to_become_more_of_my_authentic_self/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437927.802315, "replies_charged": false}
