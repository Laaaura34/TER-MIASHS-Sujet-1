Long time lurker :)\n\nI'm almost at the end of 365 days with no McDonald's :)   \nIn Australia, McDonald's is the best/most convenient fast food and I would often get it just for the sake of being lazy driving home from work. On New Year's Eve 2018, I decided to give it up for a full 365 days to prove I could do it. First few months were really hard because not being able to just go to a drive-thru is so hard (Now I think about it I haven't been to a drive-thru this entire year because I don't eat any other fast food that Australia has to offer). But I got over it and I feel so proud of myself for having done it!!  \n\n\nInitially, I did it because my ex-boyfriend (we broke up end of January 2019) said that I never stuck with anything I said and had little motivation to keep my word. Jokes on him because I'm about to do it and I feel healthier than ever!!  \n\n\n2020 is going to be the year of no soft drink(soda)! I find that I drink soft drink fairly regularly (not as much as I thought but enough that doing 365 days will still be tough). Again, want to do it to prove to myself I can and just be healthier :)  \n\n\nI hope everyone else has awesome New Years resolutions!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eaiui5/almost_completed_365_no_mcdonalds_onto_the_next/", "title": "Almost completed 365 no McDonald's.
