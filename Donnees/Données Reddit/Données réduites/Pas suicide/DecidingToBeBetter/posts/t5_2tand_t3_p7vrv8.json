I don't have much and the issue is always \"work or naked\" so I decide that I should work. \n\nRecently, however, I've been overthinking too much. Im just anxious that I'm not doing enough. I always feel like it's not enough. Because I tend to overanalyze, in terms to wear myself out by thinking too much and I end up overcomplicating. \n\nIt gets to the point where I have no time to relax and recharge because I'm always worrying about the next step. What if I don't make the right decision? What if I don't make the best decision?\n\nI hate that I obsess so much over possibilities. So I'm making it public that I'm just gonna stop thinking and just do it. \n\nI need to accept that it may not be the most efficient way to do something, but it's progress. I need to convince myself that I need to stop being afraid of failure and just move forward even if It's not the biggest step. I gotta drill it that something is better than nothing. \n\nOver the last week I've tried to stop planning and start actioning. It's not the best use of time and yet I've accomplished more than before.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p7vrv8/sometimes_its_about_not_thinking_and_just_diving/", "title": "Sometimes it's about not thinking and just diving headfirst or adjusting on the fly.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "shnyaw", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629436921, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p7vrv8/sometimes_its_about_not_thinking_and_just_diving/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438044.9157581, "replies_charged": false}
