For me that's a big deal, I've been ballooning, the stress between my disabilities and my food struggles was making me crazy.\n\nSo it began. I talked to my doctors, they got me on an appetite suppressant and I've been diligently tracking my exercise and calories.\n\nI've already lost 5lbs. I've been active but also forgiving to my body and mind. I even bought walking shoes so I can take long walks listening to books and deal with my illness.\n\nI don't want to be obease. I don't want diabetes. I don't want to be a prisoner to my body and mind.\n\nI will not and I have the support to keep it up. I decided to be better and it feels so good so far.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ia1kqi/i_turned_25_and_i_felt_things_needed_a_change/", "title": "I turned 25 and I felt things needed a change.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DeadPuppyClowns", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1597467735, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ia1kqi/i_turned_25_and_i_felt_things_needed_a_change/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437022.3159416, "replies_charged": false}
