We all have the same exact 24 hours in a day. \n\nI used to think time would just open up and I would suddenly have the energy to do what I always wanted to do. I learned very quickly that if I kept waiting for that point, I\u2019d be waiting forever. \n\nI\u2019m currently working a 9-5 job, have a part-time job, run a small business, host a podcast, have a beautiful fulfilling relationship with my boyfriend that I live in a one bedroom apartment in, and focus on self-care every single day (which includes daily meditation & frequent physical exercise). \n\nI remember feeling drained just from my job. \nI remember envying people who seemed to have all the time in the world to accomplish their goals. \nI know that I do not have children, and of course that is a HUGE factor, but I also used to think I had no time at all. \n\nI finally understood that I need to create time in my day devoted to the places I want to be going. I am happy where I am and so proud of my journey but I didn\u2019t get here by accident. I made this for myself. \n\nI just wanted to send this gentle push to you that you are the one who gets to create your life & decide how you spend your time, and its a huge disservice to yourself to not take advantage of that power we have. \n\nDon\u2019t beat yourself up either. That only creates more self-sabotage & procrastination. It\u2019s ok if you haven\u2019t used your time in a way that you would like. It\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019ve gotten to where you want to be. But just know, every single step gets you somewhere & starting today is a beautiful thing. \n\nSending you all love. \nGo do something good for you & create the time \ud83e\udd0d\n\n\n\nTLDR; the title lol \ud83d\udc95", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m4ezh1/you_dont_find_time_you_make_it/", "title": "You don\u2019t find time, you make it.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "erinpanzarella", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615668289, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m4ezh1/you_dont_find_time_you_make_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435181.5329287, "replies_charged": false}
