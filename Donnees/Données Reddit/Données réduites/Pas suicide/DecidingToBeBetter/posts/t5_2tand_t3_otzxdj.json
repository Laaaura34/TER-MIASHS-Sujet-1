I am an on again/off again smoker and sitting a lot heavier than I\u2019ve ever been. I just got married in March for the first time and have put in some weight. The thing is, it\u2019s mentally taxing me and I can\u2019t find the motivation to work out. I set up a whole gym in my garage but can\u2019t find the mindset to get in there and actually workout. I feel the weight of potentially being a dad someday and being an attractive husband for my wife. I\u2019m typically the well dressed fashionable one in the group but my closet full of clothes no longer fits well. I\u2019m a 5\u201910\u201d 215 lb wear Indian man. I really want to change my life around.
