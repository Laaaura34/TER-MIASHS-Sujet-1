Even when I'm having a great time I'm always thinking \"wouldn't it be great if x happened or wouldn't this be better if we had x\" this can manifest itself as materialism, wishing I was elsewhere, endless dreaming about the future, etc.\n\nI used to believe this was an advantage to my life as sort of a driving force but recently wife and  I moved into the nicest apartment we've ever been in, our patio looks directly out onto a beautiful river, we've come into a small amount of money and aren't financially stressed for the first time in our lives, etc. and I STILL find myself constantly obsessed with the future, buying a home, etc. I feel like I'm so obsessed with how things could be better that I can't just stop and enjoy what I have. I feel like my friends and loved ones have put up with this extremely well, only showing mild frustration or exasperation at times, but I'd really like to work on this before it becomes more of a burden to them. \n\nAny good book recommendations or other techniques etc? Preferably texts that are not religious of any sort, though I have a feeling a lot of Buddhist texts probably address this somewhat. \n\nThank you so much in advance!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lj11nj/bookmisc_recommendations_on_enjoying_the_moment/", "title": "Book/Misc Recommendations on Enjoying the Moment", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SnackGobblin", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613224844, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lj11nj/bookmisc_recommendations_on_enjoying_the_moment/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435192.2809448, "replies_charged": false}
