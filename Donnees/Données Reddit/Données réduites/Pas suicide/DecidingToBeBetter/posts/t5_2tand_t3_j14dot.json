I'm a very cynical person, who's rather lowkey and nonchalant about things, a product of my own dealings with anxiety and depression leading me to put other things down in order to build myself up, in a twisted view of my own self esteem. I've been trying to break myself out of that mindset and just be genuinely happy for other people, even if I cant relate to what is making them happy, but I'm struggling. I feel like every moment I have to fight myself or bite my tongue in order to not say something somewhat snide or downright rude and I hate it. I hate that I think like this, that my automatic response is to poke fun at other people's enjoyment or go \"well, *I* dont think it's very good but.....\"\n\nI want nothing more than to break this habit, and i dont knowing this is the right sub for this kind of post, but i was hoping i could get advice here of some sort. Anything would be extremely helpful and appreciated :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j14dot/how_to_be_more_energetic_and_optimistic/", "title": "How to be more energetic and optimistic", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Osark2850", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1601262215, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j14dot/how_to_be_more_energetic_and_optimistic/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437490.642759, "replies_charged": false}
