What are some strong techniques you use to preventing it and/or getting out of it.  Thanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: I wanna thank everybody for taking the time to respond to my post! Some of your ideas and perspectives have honestly moved me. The one thing I can return in favor to you upon reading all of your responses is that the kindness of strangers is also a great tool. Being able to relate to all of you has already helped me tremendously. Thank you again for all of your inspiring techniques and generous words.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7xlv1s/does_anybody_have_a_depression_playbook_they/", "title": "Does anybody have a depression playbook they utilize when they feel depression is coming on or when you're already in it?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "BeejieT", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 99, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1518646896, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7xlv1s/does_anybody_have_a_depression_playbook_they/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436532.62861, "replies_charged": false}
