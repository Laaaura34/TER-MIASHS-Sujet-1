I was always overly handsy, but she never really said anything until about halfway through the relationship, at which point I did lay off of it for the most part. What I didn\u2019t realize at the time was that what I was doing was objectifying her, using her body to satisfy myself. When our sex life started to dwindle, deep down inside me I knew it was because she was becoming more successful in her college path and future career path, but I tried to blame her/shame her into putting more effort back into our sexual relationship. That had the opposite of my desired effect, so I fell back into my decade-old porn addiction and that escalated to talking to strangers online and saying not-great things about her to these strangers. But it got my rocks off for some reason.\n\nShe found out about it all back in April, and we split in June after living separately for a couple months.\n\nSince May, I\u2019ve been talking with a therapist and have been on a recovery path. I\u2019ve realized that I was highly objective and manipulative, and that a successful relationship relies on communication and vulnerability, neither of which I demonstrated really at all. I know now that she had every reason to leave and I don\u2019t blame her one bit for her decision, but I do also realize now just how much a truly do love her; you know the saying, \u201cyou never know what you\u2019ve got until it\u2019s gone.\u201d \n\nI had a gem of a person - kind and sweet, passionate about the things she loves, and she put up with my bullshit for a long time. I miss her every moment I\u2019m awake and I dream about her sometimes too. But I know that she\u2019s done with me and the only thing I can do is focus on becoming a better person.\n\nI repeat to myself almost daily: \u201cyou\u2019re not a bad person. You\u2019ve just done bad things.\u201d I can change my behavior and my life will be better for it.\n\nHere\u2019s to the long road ahead of me. *cheers*", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/khvnto/i_was_an_objectifying_manipulative_person_i/", "title": "I was an objectifying, manipulative person.
