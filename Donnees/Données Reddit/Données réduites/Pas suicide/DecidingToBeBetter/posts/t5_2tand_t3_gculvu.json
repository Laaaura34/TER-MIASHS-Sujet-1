Have you ever felt that someone is better than you, because it learns without effort, or because it does not need to put extenuous effort to achieve great outcomes?\nWell, I was feeling just that way some couple of days ago. I have been suffering from a very severe lack of self esteem, because I always felt that others do not need to put in a lot of work to get results. And I always felt that I had to work more to get the same results than everyone else.\nIf you feel like this, I want to ensure that you are not alone in this world.\nBut, I was thinking about this problem. And I have reached a conclusion: if you can't be anything, be EFFORTFUL. Effort is the only thing that we can give when we don't have too much to offer. Eventually, hard work is all you have, and all you can perform, when you feel like your mind is not going to \"help\" you. Maybe the results are going to last to appear, but if we stay waiting for them to fall from the heavens, they may never fall. So, the attitudes are the only resources sometimes, even if these attitudes are small. Any step forward is still forward.
