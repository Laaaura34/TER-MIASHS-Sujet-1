So I\u2019m a 21 year old guy who is about to graduate from a \u201cprestigious\u201d undergrad with a BS in biology. Coming to this school really fucked up my self esteem as I was a straight A student in all of high school and participated in a ton of extra curriculars and in college I\u2019ve barely scraped back and will probably graduate with just over a 3.0 which is made extra bad as my school is known for grade inflation and everyone it seems has at least a 3.6. \nDespite my shitty grades I still managed to land a decent job but it\u2019s in a very HCOL making around 70k at well known Fortune 50 and I got into a masters program in a quantitative field which I can do part time. Even though on paper it seems like I\u2019ve had success despite my lackluster college career I feel so miserable and confused. I literally only think about money these days and how I\u2019m going to have to scrape by to afford bills, savings and sending money home to my mom(I\u2019m not originally from the US). \nI also have a lot of anxiety around my parents ages as their both on the older side and I feel like if one of them got seriously ill it\u2019d break me. I\u2019m stuck in just an unhealthy mindset of trying to think about how I can make more money and how I can leave this job I got to make more somewhere else. I literally haven\u2019t even started yet and I\u2019m already thinking about leaving. It\u2019s also just tough seeing all my peers go do finance or tech and make 120+ right out the gate. I feel like I\u2019ve wasted my opportunity at this great school by majoring in bio( I originally wanted to be a doctor but my grades  completely disqualify me) and not getting good grades. I\u2019m miserable all the time and most of my time is spent researching different careers and endlessly comparing salaries and planning years ahead and still deep down I feel I\u2019m going to hit a wall some day and never be able to achieve these numbers.\nHow can I escape this mindset? I come from a lower class background and lack of money has always been a constant worry over my head and now that I\u2019m actually about to face the real world in a worse position than if I had just done better in school and job searched more efficiently and purposefully in my first 2 years. I\u2019ve tried stoicism, meditation, praying(I\u2019m Christian ) and nothing seems to work. On one hand I feel ungrateful because I know my life could be so much worse and on the other I\u2019m constantly beating myself up for not having done better and having to worry about money so much.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mqeqtu/how_can_i_start_being_grateful_and_feel_less/", "title": "How can I start being grateful and feel less shitty about where I am?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "thegovthatesyou", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 18, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618358183, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mqeqtu/how_can_i_start_being_grateful_and_feel_less/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435103.4978848, "replies_charged": false}
