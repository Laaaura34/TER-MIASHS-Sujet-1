I don't get self satisfaction by doing these, but I get some negative feelings.\n\nBut from today, I'll start to say NO to those things. I'll be kind to others when I say NO, I'll explain them why I'm saying NO.\n\nI think few along the way won't understand me and I may get a bad impression, but even by always saying YES, I don't feel that everyone likes me and all. It's OK if this doesn't look kind for some situations, I think I'll figure out more later as I approach this journey. Wish me luck and please do give any tips/advice on my approach.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/f8blv2/from_today_im_going_to_say_no_for_the_things_i/", "title": "From today, I'm going to say NO for the things I don't like or want to commit just to please others", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "EliteLower", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 73, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1582474965, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/f8blv2/from_today_im_going_to_say_no_for_the_things_i/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438140.9858663, "replies_charged": false}
