After I had my fill of that, I was in the mood to indulge in some online misogyny by declaring my hatred for women on the basis of them not fucking me. But first, I decided to go downstairs for a midnight snack. As I was scarfing down a bag of Goldfish while pacing around the kitchen, I spotted a photo of my sister sitting out on the counter. Even though I\u2019m not that close to her, seeing her smiling face somehow flipped a switch in my mind. I suddenly felt guilty about having such hateful thoughts just seconds before. I felt that I could no longer make such a generalization when my sister, who is now a young woman herself, has one of the kindest and most pleasant personalities I can imagine. Some of this is probably the alcohol talking, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll slip back into my old misogynistic thinking by tomorrow morning, but this is the first time I\u2019ve really felt how hurtful and untrue my outlook on women can be.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bv480f/i_hate_women_because_they_wont_have_sex_with_me/", "title": "I hate women because they won\u2019t have sex with me\u2026 or not", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ralnainto", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1559285052, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bv480f/i_hate_women_because_they_wont_have_sex_with_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437708.398994, "replies_charged": false}
