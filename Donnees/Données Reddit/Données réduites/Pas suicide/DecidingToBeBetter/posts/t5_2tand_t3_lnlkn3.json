My coping mechanisms that entire time were to tough/wait it out and self-medicate with various poisons. A couple years ago I saw a therapist for about 6 months and it helped to talk things out but my depression always came back. I'd always wondered whether seeing a psychiatrist and getting medication would help but I never had the courage to actually go for it. \n\nAbout a month ago, my girlfriend started seeing a psychiatrist and got on meds and it worked out quite well for her. Today, after about 10 years of contemplating, I finally did it.\n\nI've been prescribed Lithium and Venlafaxine. I've taken my doses for today. I'm quite nauseous and I must've peed like 20 times today, but aside from that, I'm in high spirits. \n\nI'm so glad I finally did this and I'm very optimistic about how it will turn out for me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lnlkn3/i_went_to_a_psychiatrist_today/", "title": "I went to a psychiatrist today", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Julmannen", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613756060, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lnlkn3/i_went_to_a_psychiatrist_today/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437591.2728734, "replies_charged": false}
