I have a roof over my head, a car, a motorcycle, I have good health and my family does too. No kids and I'm not married. I have over 10k in savings and almost have my credit score over 700. I dont have many friends because my job has me around guys over twice my age every day maybe that's part of the issue. Anyway one with it I suppose. Everyday I get this sinking feeling that I'm supposed to be doing something more than I am. That this life I've created isn't what it's supposed to be. I can't get past it. I sometimes wonder if I should go back and get a degree would that make me happy? Start a business of some sort maybe that'll do it. I just don't know. My passion is my health. I go to the gym regularly and eat clean healthy foods above all else. I don't know how to be happy with what I have when. I know I'm capable of doing do much more I just don't know where to focus my drive. I feel like if I had something to focus my energy on that would be highly rewarding once I completed it that I might be happy then. It's sad to say I'm 27 years old and have no idea what I want to do with the rest of my life.
