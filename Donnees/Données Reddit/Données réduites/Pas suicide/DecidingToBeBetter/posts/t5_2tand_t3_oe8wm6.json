My partner is an alcoholic and I decided to quit drinking and using drugs to support him and I gotta say I feel so great. \n\nI sort of downplayed the accomplishment because he\u2019s been struggling with his sobriety but going from drinking every weekend and using party drugs a good part of my early 20s to just stopping wasn\u2019t easy and I\u2019m pretty proud of myself. \n\nI\u2019ve also been attending a 12-step support group that\u2019s been helping me see how sick my actions were. I always thought that there was no room for improvement because I was an adult and this was just the way it was, but it\u2019s never too late to want to change! \n\nSorry I\u2019m just in a lot of gratitude today.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oe8wm6/ive_officially_been_sober_for_a_year/", "title": "I\u2019ve officially been sober for a year.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mysticalplantmama", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 164, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625496537, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oe8wm6/ive_officially_been_sober_for_a_year/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436128.9182417, "replies_charged": false}
