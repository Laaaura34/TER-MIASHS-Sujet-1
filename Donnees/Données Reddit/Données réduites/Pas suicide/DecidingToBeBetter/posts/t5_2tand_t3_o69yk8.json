I'm not sure how true this is. However, it is not really my intention to come off as weird or different, I just try to act in a manner (as best as I can) that conforms with my ideal.\n\n**Question**\n\nThis experience does make me also see myself as someone who is a little different. I don't at all see myself as better than other people though. I'm just trying to create an accurate picture of myself within the larger social world.\n\nHow do I know whether this assessment of mine is accurate or not?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o69yk8/am_i_a_not_like_other_people_sort_of_a_person/", "title": "Am I a \"not like other people\" sort of a person?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "needtosolveaproblem", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624443436, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o69yk8/am_i_a_not_like_other_people_sort_of_a_person/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437242.580433, "replies_charged": false}
