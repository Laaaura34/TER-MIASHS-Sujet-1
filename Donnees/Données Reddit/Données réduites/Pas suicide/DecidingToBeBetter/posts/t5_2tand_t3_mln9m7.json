So after I tried to off myself because of my ex, I got sent to a psych ward. I ended up going to 3 different ones over 8 months. I've been about for about 5/6 months. \n  Originally when I got back I did online school because of bullying, however I wasn't doing enough work and I always missed class so I was sent back to face to face school. \n  Of course I thought it was gonna be terrible going back and I was mad about it. However, it's actually really helped my mental health. I found out I really like being busy and having a schedule. I also decided I wanted a job, and I was able to get one even though I'm only 14. I actually start next Monday. \n  I found my journal from the ward and it's so weird looking back and remembering what my thought process was. I was so negative.\n  I'm definitely not done improving, but I just thought I would share my story.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mln9m7/after_getting_out_of_the_psych_ward_im_doing_a/", "title": "After getting out of the psych ward, I'm doing a lot better.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Otherwise_Page528", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 867, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617746989, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mln9m7/after_getting_out_of_the_psych_ward_im_doing_a/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437503.712147, "replies_charged": false}
