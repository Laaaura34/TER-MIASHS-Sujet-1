I just wanted to share my progress with you all; I've been exercising almost every day, for a little over a month straight! YAY! \n\nWhen the pandemic hit, I honestly gave up on my body and trying to exercise. I barely had the energy to finish my homework for college, and I barely scraped by with the 2 classes I had. I didn't like feeling that low anymore, and decided to give myself the swift kick to get me up off my butt. Now, I'm starting to feel so much better physically, and emotionally (except for the occasional soreness, heh \ud83d\ude05). My stamina is improving too, I'm just so happy and hope I can motivate someone else to start/get back on their feet regarding exercise! :D", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/owvpt8/exercising_for_a_little_over_a_month_straight/", "title": "Exercising for a little over a month straight", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Pariwinklekittycat", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 26, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627964252, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/owvpt8/exercising_for_a_little_over_a_month_straight/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436451.3151574, "replies_charged": false}
