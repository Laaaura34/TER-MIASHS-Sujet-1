Every time I drink, I end up drinking too much. And then the next day, having to lie about it (to my wife) and feel guilty just isn\u2019t worth it anymore. I don\u2019t want this life! I want to be free, and never have to lie to my wife again. \n\nI want to be sober and live a fulfilling life.\n\nI know this sounds cliche, but I don\u2019t want to experience this guilt or pain anymore. It\u2019s not the first time, but I want it to be the last. I\u2019ve lied so many times to my wife about how much I\u2019ve drank. I\u2019ve been through rehab for alcoholism. And I was sober for a year. But the stress from my job makes me want to decompress and unfortunately I always choose alcohol over healthy alternatives because it\u2019s quick and easy.\n\nI don\u2019t want to live this way anymore.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pmy09x/im_not_going_to_drink_anymore/", "title": "I\u2019m not going to drink anymore!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Bettered1", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 161, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631470716, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pmy09x/im_not_going_to_drink_anymore/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436264.4549897, "replies_charged": false}
