But I held onto those compliments for too long. I developed a feeling of superiority towards everyone. I felt as if I was on top.\n\nAs I progressed through elementary school, I was punched in the face when I realized that there were other people who were smarter, or otherwise more competent in some manner, than I was. That was the official start of my issues with envy. I wanted to be better than everybody else. I wanted to be #1. At first, I told myself that I was just competitive. I lied to myself even as I began to resent those with what I didn't. If I didn't have it, I would feel incompetent, I would feel the need to have it at any cost. I just couldn't learn how to be happy with other people. \n\nAt the time of writing, it's the start of my freshman year. The high school I go to is incredibly competitive, with a rigorous academic program. There are people my age who are already mastering pre-calculus and AP Chemistry. And as you might have expected, that disgusting green feeling of envy has begun to surface again. How do I get rid of it, learn how to be happy for others, and learn how to be content with what I have?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvi9kj/how_do_i_deal_with_my_envy_issues/", "title": "How do I deal with my envy issues?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "nickname_useless", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 59, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632613443, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvi9kj/how_do_i_deal_with_my_envy_issues/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437112.4494915, "replies_charged": false}
