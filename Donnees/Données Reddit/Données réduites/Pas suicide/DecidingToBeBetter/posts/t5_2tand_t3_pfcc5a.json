In my resktionsjop my gf has alone time and watches stuff and chats to her friends, this makes me feel unwanted and really annoyed. It's do childish but just feel like she should give me attention all the time. I have no one to talk to like she does on her phone and it annoys me, I have lost all my hobbies and interests which made me me. I just don't know why I am like this I have literally sat there alone starting at the wall whilst my gf has her alone time. I just feel like a spare part in my own life. All I have is my relationship and my crappy job nothing else no friendships which enrich me or anything like that. \n\nI just feel jealous and insecure of my gf all the time, she seems to have it all better than me and I feel like she does not want me at times. I just realise that this stems from some deep hate of myself but just don't know how to move past this. \n\nAny help would be welcome.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfcc5a/not_sure_what_my_problem_is_but_i_want_to_move/", "title": "Not sure what my problem is but I want to move forward from this", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwaway__202111", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630436239, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfcc5a/not_sure_what_my_problem_is_but_i_want_to_move/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438314.028932, "replies_charged": false}
