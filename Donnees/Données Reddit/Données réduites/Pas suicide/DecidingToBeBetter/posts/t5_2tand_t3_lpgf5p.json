I've learned to heal and grow throughout the years and understand that we can grow and change. It's never too late to give out kindness. However for my past bullies i heard about there horrible fate and how there poor choices turned out to take a toll on them. After seeing them i just felt grief for them. I felt awful for them. It's like a human slowly decaying right in front of your eyes. It doesn't change the fact that what they did was wrong but it like a human that could've brought something special to the world. And they didn't give themselves the chance to do better. I knew i should've felt joy and more like \"that's what you get.\" Type of feeling but i didn't feel that. Is it normal to have these feelings?  \n\n\nI know it kinda weird to post this on this subreddit but i couldn't find another one more fitting.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lpgf5p/is_it_normal_or_ok_to_feel_empathy_for_my_past/", "title": "Is it normal or ok to feel empathy for my past bullies?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lunastars111", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 24, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613973031, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lpgf5p/is_it_normal_or_ok_to_feel_empathy_for_my_past/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437313.1176496, "replies_charged": false}
