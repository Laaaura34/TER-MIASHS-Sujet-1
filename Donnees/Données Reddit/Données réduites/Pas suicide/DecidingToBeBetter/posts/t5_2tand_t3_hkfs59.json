So as an occupation, I took engineering just because it seemed like the next best thing, but still I wasn't passionate about it and failed most of the exams. Now I'm changing the degree way too late (4 semesters) and with very little job experience I have a shitty looking cv. Telling myself how great my life actually is (yet) only makes me more frustrated and desperate. Have you experienced sthg like that or have tips how to regain some purpose?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hkfs59/how_do_i_stop_being_a_bitch/", "title": "How do I stop being a bitch?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "henz333", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1593767110, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hkfs59/how_do_i_stop_being_a_bitch/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436381.7841935, "replies_charged": false}
