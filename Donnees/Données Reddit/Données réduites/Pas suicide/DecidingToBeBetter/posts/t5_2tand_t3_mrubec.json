My skin was drying out and although I have seborrheic dermatitis but it became out of control for past few days. I started my medicine that contains steroids to contain the Inflammation but the rate at which my symptoms increased I am suspecting it was because I might have coronavirus. I read it makes your dandruff worse and skin dry. The problem is I am taking Steroid which suppress immune activity and I need my immune system to fight this probable virus in my body. I moved out of my house since April 11 because it was getting unbearable for me there but now I am questioning my decision. Anyways I got selected for a one month internship after clearing the interview. That's something to be happy about in all this sadness.
