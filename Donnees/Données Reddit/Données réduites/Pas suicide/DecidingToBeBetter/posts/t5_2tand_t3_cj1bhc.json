After wiping away tears I started thinking how fortunate I actually am.\n\nI have a great partner who loves me to no end; I have a healthy body that allows me to live and breathe on this earth, I have a loving family who would support me emotionally and financially no matter what happens.\n\nIt is not an antidote to our pains in life but it always gives us another perspective. Whenever I feel grateful, I feel more at peace and it motivates me to improve myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cj1bhc/day_44100_of_being_better_reminder_to_feel/", "title": "Day 44/100 of being better: Reminder to feel fortunate and blessed", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "fondicence", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1564347470, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cj1bhc/day_44100_of_being_better_reminder_to_feel/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435564.6228805, "replies_charged": false}
