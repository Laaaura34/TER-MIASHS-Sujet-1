Ive been drinking at least a bottle of wine a day, often 2.\n\nIt's been difficult for me to commit to not drinking because I haven't seen many of the negative consequences manifest in my life. I'm not an emotional drunk, I've never hurt myself or anyone else due to being intoxicated, none of my family members or friends have expressed real concern. I'm just extremely dependent on alcohol to help me feel good and sometimes I don't remember things from the night before.\n\nBut I can only imagine what I'm doing to my body. I read a post about someone suffering from a debilitating disease that they have no control over. And I thought to myself, this person would probably give anything to be able to improve their health simply by changing a habit, yet here I am taking my health for granted and actively poisoning myself. \n\nI've told myself many times I was going to stop drinking, but today is the first time I'm not afraid of what my life will be like without alcohol. I would love to be able to say that August 24, 2020 was the last time I had a drink. I'm really excited for this new journey, and I really hope I stick to it.
