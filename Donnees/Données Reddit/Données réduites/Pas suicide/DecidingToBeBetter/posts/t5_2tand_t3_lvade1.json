Hoping someone can relate and help me out.\n\nI have always been a huge empath, extrovert and people person. I\u2019ve had amazing friends and family, and always felt well loved. I was an honours student through school and felt capable and intelligent. I struggled largely with self confidence when it came to my physical appearance, but I always believed I was a good person. I was always known as the best friend to everyone. \n\nRecently, i\u2019ve moved out with my boyfriend and I am beginning to notice a plethora of very negative traits that I have. I was an only child growing up (not an excuse), and I find I can be unbearably selfish. I desire attention regularly, and find it hard to respect other\u2019s boundaries at times. I find myself saying/doing things I feel the need to say/do to feel better (venting, over explaining myself, etc) without concern or awareness of the other person\u2019s needs. When I do something wrong, I vent about how upset and disappointed in myself I feel, which I know logically is manipulative and in search of the person I had wronged making me feel better. I feel awful about the way I have been behaving and desperately want to change.\n\nI feel unsure about my career - I\u2019m ignoring important information, slacking off and procrastinating, and I feel like all the ways I used to view myself as a hard worker and intelligent are no longer true. I don\u2019t know what happened.\n\nLong story short, I feel like i\u2019m stuck in an identity crisis. I\u2019ve always believed I was a good person and loved who I am, but now I\u2019m not so sure. It makes me miserable, and all I want in the world is feel confident that I am not causing any distress or emotional/mental harm unintentionally to those around me. I love my friends and family, and I love my career - I just need to break away from whatever is going on with me. I\u2019m scared that it\u2019s \u201cthe real me\u201d or is permanent. I\u2019m scared that I\u2019m a narcissist, as it is so unbelievably far removed from the way i\u2019ve always known myself to be. I don\u2019t know why I am like this or when it happened, but I am terrified.\n\nIf anyone has any idea what i\u2019m talking about or has any resources (books, videos, websites, anything) please let me know.
