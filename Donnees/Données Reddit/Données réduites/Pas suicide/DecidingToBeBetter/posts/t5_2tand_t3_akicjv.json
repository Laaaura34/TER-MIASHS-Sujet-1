It's called a \"mood.\"  \n\nIf you find yourself in a funk, not happy, clear, and satisfied, it is a sign you are out of alignment with our truest self. Think of happiness as true north. When we go off course, there is really only one reason.  We are thinking thoughts that don't serve us.  It is not only possible, but easy to learn how to change your life by switching a few thoughts around. Thoughts are not the truth.  They are there... like your muscles.  The only question is what are you going to do with them.  Learn how to flex your happiness muscle and the world will change for you and around you.  \n\nIf you blame your life on conditions and others, you will never be free.  To be happy is to be free, at peace, and loving your life. Why they don't teach the nature of being human in school is beyond me, but there is a \"happ\" for that.  Happy Mind.  Happy Life.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/akicjv/follow_your_bliss_not_your_blisters_how_to_live/", "title": "FOLLOW YOUR BLISS, NOT YOUR BLISTERS: How To Live Unconditionally Happy.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "happinessexpert", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 0, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1548639002, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/akicjv/follow_your_bliss_not_your_blisters_how_to_live/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435620.0102038, "replies_charged": false}
