I feel hopeless about my life and I\u2019m at the limit of what I can accept. \n\nI\u2019ve decided, I\u2019m overloading courses in university and working myself to the bone. If I make it through by the grace of god, I have a better future ahead and can tell myself that I\u2019m lucky/someone is looking out for me in order for me to make it through. Otherwise, I\u2019ll off myself properly if my grade ever drops below a 4.5. \n\nOne year down, three more years to go.
