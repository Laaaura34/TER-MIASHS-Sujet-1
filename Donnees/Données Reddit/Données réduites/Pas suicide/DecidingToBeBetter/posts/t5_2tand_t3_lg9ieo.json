My crippling anxiety has always prevented me from doing the things that I want and I also lack a lot of confidence in myself. I applied to so many jobs, but barely heard back. Finally last week, I heard back from several employers and mustered up the courage to go through with all my interviews - something that I have an excessive fear/dread of. To my surprise, I did so well on all of them! The interviewers really liked my experience and personality. Although I was a little nervous, I\u2019m so proud of myself and it was just what I needed to instill some confidence back in me. At least now I know I can actually accomplish things if I put my mind to it :) If I can do this, anyone can. It\u2019s a small step, but I\u2019m really happy that I\u2019m at least moving forward a little.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lg9ieo/nailed_all_my_interviews_last_week_after/", "title": "Nailed all my interviews last week after excessively fearing them for ages and got my first ever job offer!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "jin1856", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 314, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612894440, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lg9ieo/nailed_all_my_interviews_last_week_after/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436166.0347953, "replies_charged": false}
