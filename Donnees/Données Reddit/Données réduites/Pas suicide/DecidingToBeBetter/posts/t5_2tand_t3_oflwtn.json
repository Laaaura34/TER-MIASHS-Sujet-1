After years of therapy and self development work, I still struggle with some things. \n\nIt\u2019s seems like I can\u2019t accept the possibility of being in peace and enjoying the present moment. \n\nOn one side, I have made huge movements, got out of the comfort zone and moved to another continent, lost 120 pounds, broke the walls of my terrible academic past and I\u2019m doing a uni carreer I never imagined I would be able to complete.  If I told my past self a story if today I would have not believe it by any means.\n\nOn the other hand I can\u2019t find peace. The most little things such as the anxiety of liking a girl and things not going as I liked or little things, turn into a huge thing and I\u2019m not able to enjoy the present and the blessing of life. Not even a full day. Those situations affect my mood for days.\n\nAny comments or ideas ?\nThanks and love to everyone out there.\n\nPS: I\u2019m open to help anyone on weight loss tips since it\u2019s one of my biggest accomplishments, and I love helping others.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oflwtn/how_to_accept_that_feeling_good_is_possible/", "title": "How to accept that feeling good is possible ?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "JohnTrippe", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625673788, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oflwtn/how_to_accept_that_feeling_good_is_possible/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435557.6965282, "replies_charged": false}
