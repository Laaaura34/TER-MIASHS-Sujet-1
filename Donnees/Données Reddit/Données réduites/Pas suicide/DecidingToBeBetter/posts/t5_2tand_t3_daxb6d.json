This sparks envy of course, considering ADHD makes focusing on work hard and I've always known for being socially inept.\n\nEnvy turns into worship pretty fast, this happens especially when you have low self-esteem. So I would behave in a pathetic dog way. Following them around, going to events I don't like but just to be with them, pleasing them all the time etc. Being a human-pleaser definitely did not alleviate the situation and it just makes people look down me more.\n\nSo i stopped. This isn't hard because the idea of being a pathetic dog is pretty nauseating. \n\nThis also doesn't mean I start to hate them, it means I simply learn to admire but never worship or do any of those pathetic things I did in the past. I note their strengths and merits and I try to understand how to achieve that. Sometimes I realize I can do those things by myself too if I put in the effort and sometimes I realize there are certain things cannot be achieved in the same way without being born with a certain proclivity. So I don't do those.\n\nThis mentality makes me so much more at peace with myself and it actually makes self-improvement a more pleasant journey.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/daxb6d/day_97100_of_being_better_admire_dont_worship/", "title": "Day 97/100 of being better: Admire, don't worship", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "fondicence", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1569774063, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/daxb6d/day_97100_of_being_better_admire_dont_worship/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437711.8064463, "replies_charged": false}
