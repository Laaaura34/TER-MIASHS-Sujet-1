However, today I want to change this. I want to and will take things by the day. I used to do \"Day ***\" for workouts, nofap, and other things but that isn't productive for me. Just doesn't work like it does for others. I plan to do better for myself again, and take it a day at a time and with everything I've learned as well. I hope anyone that reads this does something they oh so desperately need to do for the better, even if it might suck or be the hard option. Do what's best for you, it's your life and you gotta remember that. Thank you to everyone who frequents subs like these helping people out and doing what's right. Have a blessed day everyone, stay safe, and take life a day at a time to really live it in the moment.
