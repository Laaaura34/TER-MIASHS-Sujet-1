I currently can not cook for myself and have to eat cafeteria food. I struggle with ordering out though because I get bored of the cafeteria food and struggle with cravings.\n\nGoals\n - Loose weight, try to get down to around 135 pounds\n - Increase endurance, I would like to be able to run more and for longer periods of time\n - Quite soda, this one has gone well though I did just have one today after a week and a half without one\n - Cut back on fast food and cravings\n - Continue to attend the gym consistently, I have been pretty good so far, I didn\u2019t go today due to weather but will go tomorrow which is normally one of my break days\n - In genera get in a more toned shape\n\nI know all these goals will probably take a couple years to achieve but some advice would be pleasantly enjoyed.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l93qj5/health_journey_looking_for_advice/", "title": "Health Journey: Looking for Advice", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "EZXGamer02", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612064818, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l93qj5/health_journey_looking_for_advice/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437675.4539125, "replies_charged": false}
