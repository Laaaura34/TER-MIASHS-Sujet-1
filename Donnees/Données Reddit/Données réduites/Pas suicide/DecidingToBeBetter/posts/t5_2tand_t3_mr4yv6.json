The job market was so tough and there were many times where I truly didn\u2019t believe in my skills to get a job I actually wanted. I received an offer at the beginning, but it was an okay job so I rejected it in hopes of finding a better one. After I rejected it, I kind of regretted it because I wasn\u2019t getting anything after that. I felt so listless, so many interviews, only to find out I wasn\u2019t chosen. I felt stuck and depressed. However, I just needed to be patient. I kept applying and kept interviewing, even on days where I really didn\u2019t want to and just wanted to sulk in bed. Finally yesterday, I got a call from one of the companies that had a great position open and offered me the job! I\u2019ll get to work from home as well, which is what I really wanted + the job won\u2019t start until end of May so I have time to chill and enjoy myself. I just needed to be patient and everything fell into place. It felt so good that all my persistence finally paid off. Every single interview made me better and better at the process. Just a reminder to those who feel stuck, things will change and things will fall into place for you as long as you keep going :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mr4yv6/finally_accepted_an_offer_for_a_job_i_wanted_for/", "title": "Finally accepted an offer for a job I wanted!
