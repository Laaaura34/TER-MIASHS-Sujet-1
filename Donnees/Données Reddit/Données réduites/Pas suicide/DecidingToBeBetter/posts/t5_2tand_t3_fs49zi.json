Of course many if not most of us are   already making decisions based on their impact on  the environment and   climate. But maybe we should overthink if there  isn't more we can do.\n\nWe  can  choose a career in climate protection, inform ourselves and  others  on  what we should (not) buy, consume less animal products or  none at  all,  share things so you don't have to buy a new one, buy  second-hand,  go by  bike, bus or train, and so on.\n\n[https://www.ecosia.org/search?q=what+can+we+do+to+stop+climate+change](https://www.ecosia.org/search?q=what+can+we+do+to+stop+climate+change)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fs49zi/corona_makes_us_forget_the_biggest_issue_of_our/", "title": "Corona makes us forget the biggest issue of our time", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SatoriTWZ", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 0, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1585620260, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fs49zi/corona_makes_us_forget_the_biggest_issue_of_our/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437856.8058395, "replies_charged": false}
