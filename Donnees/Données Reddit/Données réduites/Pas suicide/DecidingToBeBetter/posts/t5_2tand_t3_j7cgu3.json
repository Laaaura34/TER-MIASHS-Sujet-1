Fortunately, my parents were supportive enough to help me financially, provided I took measures to get back on my feet. I was half-assing getting better, and endless gaming and binge-watching Youtube wasn\u2019t helping.  One day in June, I was just fed up with everything and started sending job applications everywhere.\n\nMostly rejections, except one.\n\nA senior care home was looking for care assistants, and they called me in for an interview.  I wasn\u2019t qualified other than being a warm body who could fill a shift, but I got the job and started mid-July.  It hasn\u2019t been easy, but only a few months later I feel like a new person.  I have muscles for the first time since high school.  My outlook is getting brighter, even if there are sad aspects to my job sometimes.  I\u2019m eating more and eating healthier now that I have my own income.  Working a full-time job forced me back into healthy sleeping habits.\n\nI\u2019m probably going to apply to start the 3 year certification training next year, if/when Covid has calmed down a bit more.  I still have a long way to go before I\u2018m the responsible, mature adult I want to be, but signs are at least pointing in the right direction.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j7cgu3/having_a_job_is_improving_me/", "title": "Having a Job Is Improving Me", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "CthonicFlames", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1602161533, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j7cgu3/having_a_job_is_improving_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436642.3034608, "replies_charged": false}
