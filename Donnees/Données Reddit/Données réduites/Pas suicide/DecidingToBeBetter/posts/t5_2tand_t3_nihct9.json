I've never felt this way before, I literally feel somewhat scared to make deep connections with people now.\n\nI think I managed to get a closure from my above mentioned starting event, but I still have lingering feelings for that person which I see slowly but surely fading. Does it mean I only need more time getting used to my current situation to feel \"normally\" and \"healthily\" towards potential close friends and partners, or do I need to work more on myself (like either by exposure therapy - so me just staying in those situations despite feeling anxious - or spending more time alone and build myself back up first)?\n\nIt's not the sudden anxiety that mainly bothers me (tho it does also bother me) but rather seeing how my mind is basically telling me that I shouldn't try to get close to someone who didn't do anything wrong to me. (We're talking about all online interactions btw which I know isn't ideal, and I definitely want to spend more time in the \"real world\".)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nihct9/the_thought_of_getting_close_to_someone_triggers/", "title": "The thought of getting close to someone triggers my anxiety", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "anxiety___throw", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1621685748, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nihct9/the_thought_of_getting_close_to_someone_triggers/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437230.2904222, "replies_charged": false}
