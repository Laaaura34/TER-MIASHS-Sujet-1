Got a new therapist about a year back, the best decision of my life.\n\nI've now left the most toxic workplace ever, living alone with mortgage and finances in order, have positive relationships with my family even after all the trauma they have caused, cut out toxic friends and the best of all I have feelings!! Most people won't understand not having feelings just being a body, it's horrible and when I look back I think how did I do it. \nI started a new workout regime in April now looking amazing and seeing rapid results! Actually so happy with where I am at now. \n\nPs. Not everyday is positive, such as today I feel pretty shit, anxious about everything but it's how we process and work with that. I've been to the gym hit it hard, tidied my full flat and even ensured it smells amazing! Still feeling anxious but hoping for a better tomorrow. \n\nThanks for reading", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oj2s7h/decided_to_cut_out_the_toxicity_in_my_life/", "title": "Decided to cut out the toxicity in my life!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Yournotworthy101", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 18, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626131063, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oj2s7h/decided_to_cut_out_the_toxicity_in_my_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436140.0324855, "replies_charged": false}
