Recently, I decided to try and stop. I was good for a month. But then I went through personal turmoil and relapsed. Now it\u2019s been another month with no biting at all!\n\nMy fingernails were seriously nubs. But now they\u2019re back! Granted, they look really weird. The white parts are really big and not yet attached to my finger, so they kind of stick upwards. Because they\u2019re not attached, they get dirty very easily and I have to clean out black lines often. But on some nails, I can already see pink parts forming where white used to be. I would say all my nails have grown by at least a centimeter.\n\nHonestly, I haven\u2019t tried any tricks. The reward has been all the motivation; I love being able to open pop cans, easily untie shoelace knots, and actually scratch my itches. I can\u2019t even remember the last time I could do that.\n\nThis is to provide hope for some people.
