Before her or anyone. Part of how me and \"my partner\" work so well is we care for each other but we look out for ourselves more. It's a hard thing to do and not many people will understand it but don't let her or anyone hold you back. I've made this clear with \"my partner\" and its vice versa with me as well. I can't hold her back either. Regardless of what anyone thinks you have to do what is best for you. Otherwise one day you will regret you didn't. Trust me.  Regret is painful. It's better to be single and happy than to be in a relationship miserable. \r- \n - parts in quotes I changed from the person's original name. I was not asking about relationship advice or anything, but rather legal advice for lawsuits and restraining orders and after everything he told me \"one more thing\" then sent me that. After what has happened that called for me to talk to him about it, that really helped open my eyes as a reality check.
