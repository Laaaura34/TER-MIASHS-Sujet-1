But I feel that this is too good to keep to myself, and maybe hopefully it can help others the way it\u2019s helped me. \n\nI\u2019ve always struggled with bizarre jealousy issues in my romantic relationships. People always have given me advice like \u201cdon\u2019t worry\u201d, \u201ctry not to think about it\u201d etc and obviously this is not very helpful. \n\nI\u2019ve had this issue in every romantic relationship I\u2019ve ever been in. The innate craving to look through my partners phone, social media accounts, etc completely takes me over. The thoughts are intrusive, and even though I never find anything, I feel like I have to keep going to get the \u201cright feeling\u201d. Like an itch that\u2019s never scratched. \n\nI\u2019ve tried all kinds of therapy and they always say it\u2019s attachment issues, inner child trauma, etc. I\u2019m not saying it isn\u2019t those things per say, but they always explained it as this lofty deep seeded issue. \n\nBut - I knew for me it much more resembled an addiction than some deep emotional wound, I know that doesn\u2019t make sense, but that\u2019s really how it felt. Like it was bigger than me. I couldn\u2019t control it. It was compulsive; IT chose me, not the other way around. I know it doesn\u2019t make sense but hear me out - I physically could not stop doing it no matter how hard I wanted to. It was a ritual of sorts, and the thought, or rather the URGE to do it is what told me it was time to do it, *not* my environment or things that happened. \n\nI read the book \u201cBrain Lock\u201d by Jeffrey Schwartz - and it\u2019s a book about OCD. For the first time in my life, I felt heard. For the first time in my life, o had actual tangible advice. \n\nAnd guess what - I\u2019m overcoming my intrusive OCD like thoughts using the four steps, and I\u2019ve broken the cycle of shame surrounding the behavior. \n\nI finally feel validated and heard, and it\u2019s been an unbelievable gift. I\u2019m asking my doctor for a referral to a psychiatrist- and for the first time ever, I don\u2019t feel crazy anymore.\n\nPs: there are free versions of the audiobook on YouTube!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mylvz1/i_finally_found_a_book_about_cognitive_behavioral/", "title": "I finally found a book about cognitive behavioral therapy that has given me a new lease on life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Gorl08", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1537, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619398197, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mylvz1/i_finally_found_a_book_about_cognitive_behavioral/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436829.1759925, "replies_charged": false}
