I applied to UCLA out of high school and didn't get in, and instead of going to a lesser UC (I live in California), I went to jc instead.\n\nI can't say I worked as hard as I could have, but it was hard work nonetheless. All the crazy classes (like Calculus) have finally paid off, and I was good enough to make it into that pipe-dream I've had for the last 3 years.\n\nI'm also going into what is, at this point in life, my ideal major: Psychobiology. I'm so excited to learn all this fantastic shit and finally get the college experience. \n\nDon't pinch me :D", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1dgu65/college_acceptance_its_actually_happening/", "title": "College Acceptance - it's actually happening", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "initialgold", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1367388462, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1dgu65/college_acceptance_its_actually_happening/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441495.1070287, "replies_charged": false}
