I was having some issues with my car for a few months now and my uncle just took it for a week, did so much work on it, and gave it back to me as a Christmas present. I feel a lot better about driving it.\n\nIt doesn't chug anymore, the engine pressure is better, i got an oil change, a bunch of tubing replaced for better emission control, a new manifold gasket, license plate lights, signal box, distributor cap, working wiper system, heater, and better gas mileage.\n\nIt would have cost me a fortune to get it fixed in shop...something I couldn't have afforded and would have had to start busing around (including a 1h+ ride to work for 7 a.m.).\n\nI am so grateful to not drive a death trap anymore.
