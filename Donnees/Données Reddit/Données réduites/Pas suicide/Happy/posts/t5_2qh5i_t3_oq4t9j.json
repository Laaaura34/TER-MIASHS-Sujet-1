Not sure what my profile looked like or his or what it said but I\u2019m happy we matched. We went on a date and we were very similar however we were both busy and never set up a second date. \n\nFast forward a year later, he requested me randomly on Instagram. Which we had never shared with each other. I messaged him and the next week we were on a date. It lasted like 8 hours and we just talked and talked and talked. It was amazing. Since then, we\u2019ve been together, moved in, and are almost at a year! We are like the same person, and I could not be more grateful for him. \n\nIt may sound silly but I think of the very tiny chance of meeting him on the app, or the tiny chance of coming across each other again and it makes me so much more grateful for him. Last year before we met again he had a plan to move back East after college. This year, he stayed in my state with me. Just feeling super blessed and I know sometimes dating apps aren\u2019t great, but sometimes you come across some great people.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/oq4t9j/the_thought_of_the_minuscule_chance_of_coming/", "title": "The thought of the minuscule chance of coming across my boyfriend on Bumble two years ago makes me incredibly grateful to have him today.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "surelyshirls", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627054297, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/oq4t9j/the_thought_of_the_minuscule_chance_of_coming/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439156.411182, "replies_charged": false}
