We live 15+ hours away from each other and we work hard and make it work and it\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me. I can tell you I have never loved someone like I\u2019ve loved this man. I have never been as comfortable with someone. I\u2019m trying not to say all the cliche things but, He reminds me everyday how much he loves me and how much I mean to him. He is quite literally my very best friend in the whole world and I thank the stars (and reddit) every night for him, I am so grateful. He is just the most kind, funny, handsome, smart, warm person I have ever had the pleasure of getting to know. I am extremely excited for our future together!!
