It all started with a crazy t-shirt debate one drunken night on discord. He makes me feel so loved and supported. I've never felt anything like this from a SO. \n\nI love his smile, his laugh, his cat, and how he makes my heart overflow with love. He does this one smile and it really pulls at my heart everytime he looks at me. \n\nHe is my favorite. He is my future. He is my forever and always. Just us and our cats. I'm so happy to start our lives together. I'm going to marry him one day. There's no doubt in my mind.
