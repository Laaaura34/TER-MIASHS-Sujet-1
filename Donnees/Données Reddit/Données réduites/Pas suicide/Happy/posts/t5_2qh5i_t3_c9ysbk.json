All alone, with only other 2 classmates near me, but they were doing other things\n\nI was studying on my own when I hear an unexpected \"Hello\" incredible near to me. I raised my head up and I saw one of my classroom's sister watching me while smiling in my direction. She was the older sister of one of my classmate. After that we start having a small conversations, few minutes, but glad for it\n\nI'm a very shy, introvert guy, that find difficult to open to people, to make friends and that is going trought bad years. But that simply \"hello\" turned my day. I wasn't expecting that and the fact that somebody notice me when usually people don't do that, they let me stay on my own, makes me happy, at least for one day\n\nThe girl I'm talking about is already married, with a baby and older than me. But IDK, I was thinking about it right now. She surprised me but at the same time makes me more calm. Maybe it can be stupid but I appreciate it, also now, after hours. It was a pleasure to have a conversation with her\n\n[Sorry for mistakes]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/c9ysbk/i_get_my_day_turned_upsidedown_by_a_simply_hello/", "title": "I get my day turned upside-down by a simply \"hello\" today.
