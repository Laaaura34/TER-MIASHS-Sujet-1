For me at least I believe that some our greatest joys all start from being curious, whether it be in our relationships, in our education, or in our hobbies. The thought of growing older and losing this curiosity seems to bother me, since without it, I think life would feel dull and meaningless. We wouldn't have much of a desire to understand the workings of ourselves and environment. So I made a small piece linked below if anyone is interested on exploring  the origins of curiosity and my perspective on the topic.
