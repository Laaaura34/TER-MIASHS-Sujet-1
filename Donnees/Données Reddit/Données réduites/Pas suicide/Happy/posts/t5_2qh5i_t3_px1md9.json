I've been receiving recognition and praise for the high standards I've been setting. \n\nNow, I've been Asthmatic all my life, and all my doctor would ever tell me was to use a blue inhaler. Worst advice ever. \n\nI've finally started to see an Asthma specialist and to say it's taken too long is a huge understatement, but my Asthma is finally being controlled properly.\n\nI can breathe!\n\nAnd in a two-for, or a three-for? I've been losing weight. My Weight loss is coming on very nicely. I Was told this morning it's noticeable that I've lost weight. \n\nRecognition, feeling better and losing weight! Actually starting to feel good about things.\n\nThis is that positivity I keep hearing about.
