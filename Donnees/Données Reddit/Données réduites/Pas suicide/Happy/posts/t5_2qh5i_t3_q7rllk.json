I used to harbor so much anger and be a trouble maker. Financial instability was always a thing growing up. It\u2019s just how I thought the world was for me. \n\nYesterday I had my final interviews for my dream starting position at my dream firm and shortly after, received a full-time offer as an Audit Associate. It\u2019s literally a life changing opportunity. I\u2019ve had an amazing hiring experience and never thought I\u2019d make it past the resume part. \n\nI\u2019m the first in my family to ever go to college. I survived through athletic scholarships and so many awful, random jobs.\n\nThis December I\u2019ll be receiving both an MBA and MPAcc. I have worked so hard for so many years to get here. This was always my dream, as in literally, I would joke about wanting to be in this position because I thought it was so out of reach.  \n\nIt still doesn\u2019t seem real and honestly not sure how to express my excitement because I\u2019ve been working so hard towards this for so long. \n\nI don\u2019t really have a support system to express my excitement so I\u2019m ranting here. Idk how to express my excitement outward without feeling like I\u2019m bragging. Statistically, there\u2019s no reason i should have reached this point and am just really proud of myself honestly. \n\nI hope I am able to provide proof to my two younger brothers that they can achieve anything they want. College wasn\u2019t even a possible option for us. I hope I can give back to others and be the person who I\u2019ve always needed and searched for.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/q7rllk/ive_worked_so_hard_for_this_i_dont_even_know_how/", "title": "I\u2019ve worked so hard for this, I don\u2019t even know how to express how happy I am.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AttemptingToPaint", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 21, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634182821, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/q7rllk/ive_worked_so_hard_for_this_i_dont_even_know_how/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439669.5321114, "replies_charged": false}
