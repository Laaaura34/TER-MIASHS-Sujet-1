This surgery was needed but was done so quickly after finding out she needed immediately to prevent permanent damage which made me worry. She also recently found out she needs to have her gallbladder removed. I am just so happy she is taking care of herself for once. Recently she quit her job so she can take advantage of being on disability which she needs as her doctors do not understand how she was able to work as long as she has so this is huge. For the first time in my life she is thinking of her self and I am so happy for her. Just thought I would share how happy I am for her for taking care of her self! I love you mommy =]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/19b0am/so_glad_she_made_it_out_okay/", "title": "So glad she made it out okay!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "steph1cleveland", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1361936349, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/19b0am/so_glad_she_made_it_out_okay/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438914.6102083, "replies_charged": false}
