I was spiraling into depression and drug abuse and I honestly wished the worst on myself. I moved home, which I would suggest, if you\u2019re struggling with mental health and are on your own. It\u2019s the best way to ground yourself and become who you once were. I worked on myself throughout the pandemic and ended up reconnecting with a friend that I knew since we were four. We\u2019re now moving into a home together and I finally feel like I\u2019m where I\u2019m supposed to be. I couldn\u2019t be happier and I\u2019m hoping the move in adjustment goes well!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/pm4oss/the_pieces_of_my_life_is_finally_back_together/", "title": "The pieces of my life is finally back together.
