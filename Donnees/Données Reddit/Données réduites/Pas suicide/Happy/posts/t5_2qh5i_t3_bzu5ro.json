{"id": "t5_2qh5i_t3_bzu5ro", "request": ["410541ae-d9ba-4732-8b05-a2de1b3d7065"], "text": "When I was 14 years old, first month of high school, a class mate of mine shot me a text stating he had a crush on me. This was a surprise, because up until a week ago, this classmate was NOT fond of me (found out recently that the reason they didn\u2019t like me was because they \u201calways want to be the smartest kid in the room\u201d, and their ego didn\u2019t like that I was a good student too, lol). We \u201cdated\u201d for a month afterwards, and I broke up with him after a month because he was so shy, he wouldn\u2019t even hold my hand. \n\nWe stayed closed friends. He dated others, I dated others. Fast forward to junior year: I\u2019m dating a mutual friend of ours who is extremely toxic, manipulative, and abusive. My self esteem and quality of life are at an all time low. I was young and naive and didn\u2019t realize my current partner was abusive; that\u2019s just how men show love. (Super traumatic childhood and upbringing, I had a warped perception of love). My friend confesses he\u2019s never lost feelings for me, that he just wanted to grow into a person that would make me happy; no pressure, if I didn\u2019t want to be with him, that would be fine. He told me that love wasn\u2019t what I was getting from my current boyfriend though, and that I deserved better. \n\nSome time passes, and I break up with my abusive partner and give them another chance. And he treats me SO good, unbelievably good. Never raises his voice or hits me. He is kind and gentle and patient. \n\nAnd I become so scared; when does the other shoe drop? I begin to self sabotage our relationship, making up mountains of molehills (it\u2019s common for folks who have abusive pasts to always be on guard; if no one in your life has been kind to you before, then what does this guy gain by being kind to me now? What\u2019s the motive?) \n\nQueue abusive ex. Threatens to kill himself if I don\u2019t do as he wants, uses his own history of abuse to justify his abuse to me. I\u2019m 16, and still so naive, and I fold. I immediately come clean and tell my partner. \n\nWe break up. I give him space. Few months go by. He tells me that he still loves me, and wants to try again. We stay together for the remainder of high school. \n\nWe decide to go to two different universities far from one another. Long distance doesn\u2019t work, and we agree to split up again. Four years pass; I date different people, he goes on a few dates. We see each other every break we go home. He is just as kind as always, and I assume that he\u2019s moved on, which kills me, because I miss him. We graduate with our degrees, and I\u2019m looking towards my masters, completely focused on my career, getting out from under my abusers. \n\nHe asks me to meet him for coffee, which is very normal, as I said, we make a point of always seeing one another. He is nervous and it all just comes spilling out; he says he\u2019s always loved me, from when we were 14 and so stupid. That when he yearns for someone to fall asleep next to, it\u2019s always me he wants. That when he is asleep and dreams of his future family, he always sees me as the mother of his children, and when he day dreams of growing old, it\u2019s next to me. He couldn\u2019t find a partner during college because every woman wasn\u2019t the one. \n\nI\u2019m ecstatic, but if my life has taught me anything, it\u2019s that you can\u2019t rely on anyone, and the way others treat you can be fickle. I tell him that although I\u2019m glad, I have my career to focus on. \n\nHe says all he wants is me, it always has been, and he offers to move to the city I\u2019m studying in, put his career on hold so I can pursue my masters, that he\u2019s sorry he\u2019s waited so long to tell me. \n\nI used to think happy endings didn\u2019t happen to people like me. Too bruised, too battered, maybe even to broken to deserve happiness. From birth till 18 years, my life was endless tragedy. People \u201clike me\u201d were too rough around the edges, too damaged beyond repair. \n\nI\u2019ve been going to therapy to unlearn my trauma and harmful coping skills. I\u2019ve surrounded myself with loving, kind, supportive people, who don\u2019t use me to an end. I\u2019ve forged strong bonds with my family. I\u2019ve put myself through school, I worked 3 jobs for four years, I don\u2019t have ANY DEBT for my bachelors degree, not a single PENNY to anyone. I\u2019m about to buy my first car, all with my OWN savings and no one else\u2019s help. I have a job and an internship already lined up to put me through my masters. \n\nAnd that little 14 year old boy, who was so shy he wouldn\u2019t hold my hand? He\u2019s a fine young man who I\u2019m happy to call my partner, and we are moving into our first apartment together next month. Whenever we see children while we are out and about, he points them out and how excited he is to be a father someday, how he can\u2019t wait to marry me in the church by his grandmother\u2019s house, how we won\u2019t ever make my birth mother\u2019s mistakes.\n\nLife has been a struggle for me, to say the least. But for the first time, I can breathe. I\u2019m free from my past, and I have a future that looks like more than pain, poverty, and homelessness. I can\u2019t wait to wake up each day! From the time I was five, I can remember my birth mom telling me to use my looks and sex to manipulate those around me to bend to my will, that love wasn\u2019t real, and only a good, rich, white man\u2019s wife was all I\u2019d amount to. \n\nI can\u2019t wait for my future with him, I can\u2019t wait for my career to take off. I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m still alive, and I can finally breathe. For the first time, I\u2019m more than \u201cfine\u201d. I\u2019m GREAT, and I can breathe. \n\nHave a good day everyone! \ud83d\udc9b\n\nTLDR: after nearly 10 years of hardship, we are moving in together, and life\u2019s good.
