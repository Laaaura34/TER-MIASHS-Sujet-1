She used to sing in a band that was once quite popular in this area, but has since disbanded and she's now a bit off the radar.\n\nShe's a bit older than I am, but we've had this cool communication over the messages through the years, which started by me hitting her up as a fan, but has since grown to become quite friendly.\n\nWe live a bit far apart, but I'm going to travel close to her soon, so I decided to (bravely) hit her up and ask to meet her, to which she said yes and was really, really nice.\n\nLike, don't get me wrong, it's not a date or anything, but I'm really excited, because her music really helped me through the years, inspired my own works and I've followed her for a very long time, since she seems like a really fun, interesting and awesome person - and I can't wait to have the privilege to have a few drinks with her.\n\nDue to her low radar status, I'll respect her and not share her identity here, just so it doesn't cause an awkward situation or ruin anything.\n\nI'm excited, happy and I hope she turns out to be na awesome person!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/o7q9if/im_going_out_with_my_celebrity_crush/", "title": "I'm going out with my \"celebrity crush\"!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ItsThatGuyAgainWoah", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 25, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624635814, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/o7q9if/im_going_out_with_my_celebrity_crush/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441070.27104, "replies_charged": false}
