In length it has been 20 weeks + the ten weeks I spent at Ft. Benning in Boot Camp. In all my training has lasted 30 weeks.\nBefore joining the Army I was working a 7.25  an hour a job for 7 hours a day living with my parents. Unfortunately the due to financial reasons(my parents were about to lose their house) I had to look at moving out of the home I'd lived in since I was twelve years old(I am 21).\nSitting here I can honestly say I am incredibly happy. Sitting here I feel as though I've actually done something. In basic training getting yelled and screamed at, AIT(Advanced Individual Training) studying in a panic every night trying desperately to pass the next class that I have looming on the Horizon. \nRight now I'm so happy to be in a place where I can breathe and have all my needs taken care of. The Army wasn't always what I wanted for my life, but right now I can say for the first time in years I am happy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/5gw44w/tommorow_will_mark_a_very_important_day_in_my_life/", "title": "Tommorow will mark a very important day in my life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "KnightLord316", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1481064626, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/5gw44w/tommorow_will_mark_a_very_important_day_in_my_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438844.7755322, "replies_charged": false}
