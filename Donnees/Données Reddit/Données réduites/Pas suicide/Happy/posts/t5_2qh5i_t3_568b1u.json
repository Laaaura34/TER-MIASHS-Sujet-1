This awesome, funny, lovely girl I've made friends with at my new school somehow has the most beautiful smile I've ever seen. And it's not the most perfect smile in the world. Nowhere near as bad as mine, but nowhere near perfect either. But somehow it's the best smile ever. I never paid much attention to her in the first few weeks of school. I never saw her smile. But that one day, that day we were working on a group project, and the conversation lulled. and our other partner asked us if we liked memes, that's when I saw it. And I knew I'd just seen an extraordinary ordinary miracle. I barely thought about it at the time, but after we spent some time together, I saw that smile again and again, and I swear it's nothing like I've ever seen before. I can't even articulate what it is about it, it's just... radiant. It makes me feel warm, from my chest out. I feel lucky to see this smile every day. I feel lucky to smile back. I always used to hate my smile. Now I'm glad I can share it.
