And anyone who\u2019s worked fast food will know that it\u2019s rarely a fun job.\n\nWell, today started out with a bunch of rain. Our store doesn\u2019t have an awning, so I was getting soaked. Pretty typical so far. But then it was just rapid fire wholesomeness. \n\nI had one of our regulars hand me a $5 tip and tell me that I deserve it, and that I\u2019m a great worker. I had a pretty damn attractive person ask for my number. I\u2019m already engaged, but that felt really nice to hear. And just before my break, I had 5 customers pay for the person behind them in a row. And the only reason the last guy didn\u2019t is because there wasn\u2019t anyone behind him.\n\nNow, I\u2019m a pretty cynical person, so I\u2019m expecting something awful to happen at some point today to balance everything out. But man, my self esteem is through the roof today. And people are being SO nice. Is there something in the soda?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the awards!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/obmn67/ive_never_had_a_day_start_out_as_good_as_today_has/", "title": "I\u2019ve NEVER had a day start out as good as today has.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "BiSaxual", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 268, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625148646, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/obmn67/ive_never_had_a_day_start_out_as_good_as_today_has/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438934.4073434, "replies_charged": false}
