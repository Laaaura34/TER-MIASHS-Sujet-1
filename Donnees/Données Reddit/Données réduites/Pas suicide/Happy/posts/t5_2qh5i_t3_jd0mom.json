I hated playing piano, I hated cello, I hated everything because it became more of a chore than a passion or hobby. It sucked because those were things that I used to LOVE doing, I would be excited to come home from school to be able to learn my new piece on the piano.\n\nI'm in college now and I came back for the weekend, and opened up the dusty piano and played a song I've been listening to for the past few months (Song for Sienna for those who want to know), and it brought me to tears to play the piano again. I think I'm going to try to play it more often because finding old passions again brings me so much fulfillment :,)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/jd0mom/picking_up_something_that_you_used_to_love/", "title": "Picking up something that you used to love", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Davidkob", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1602960116, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/jd0mom/picking_up_something_that_you_used_to_love/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440972.9078248, "replies_charged": false}
