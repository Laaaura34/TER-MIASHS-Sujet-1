He also helped me get out of an abusive relationship 2 years ago and I\u2019m finally healing from it because I started therapy which is a huge accomplishment for me and I\u2019m so proud of myself. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to marry this guy, he makes me feel like I\u2019m on top of the world, like I matter.\n\nI kicked ass in college and got my extended diploma in engineering. I\u2019m now an apprentice aircraft technician/fitter and I feel incredible about getting the position.\n\nIt might not seem like much but these are huge deals to me, someone who used to feel like life wasn\u2019t worth it.
