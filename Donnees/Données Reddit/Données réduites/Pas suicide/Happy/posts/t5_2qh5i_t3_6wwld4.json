This resulted in broken bones and a severely deviated septum. As you can imagine, this required surgery. Well this morning I went to see the doctor so he could take the cast off and the stents out. After all was said and done, he told me to close my mouth and take a breath through my nose. I was so amazed I immediately started crying. This doctor increased my quality of life so much and I could not be happier!!!! To top it all off (if it's possible to top perfect breathing), I get to sleep HORIZONTALLY in my bed tonight and not propped up on the couch!!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/6wwld4/today_was_a_fulfilling_day/", "title": "Today was a fulfilling day", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "wubbie44", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1504064440, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/6wwld4/today_was_a_fulfilling_day/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440969.1746974, "replies_charged": false}
