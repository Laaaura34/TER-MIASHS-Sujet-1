My husband and I both dropped out of school, me because I was literally unable to walk to my classes and him because he needed to work full time after I had to leave my job. I fell into a very deep depression. He worked his ass off to provide for us. But it looks like we're finally going back to school this summer to finish our degrees! Him in computer science and me in glass blowing. I'm excited to see where this will lead us and looking forward to advancing our careers and how it'll impact our future!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/201fi2/my_husband_and_i_are_going_back_to_school_to/", "title": "My husband and I are going back to school to finish our degrees after years of illness and pain!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "vmfillpot", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 183, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1394449975, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/201fi2/my_husband_and_i_are_going_back_to_school_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438845.0776145, "replies_charged": false}
