We\u2019re spending the weekend together. There\u2019s been a lot of fun times and kisses but more than anything I\u2019ve just been holding her and enjoying the moment. I\u2019m on top of the world and never want this weekend to end. Life is fantastic and I feel so blessed and happy.\n\nToday, i saw a notification in a group chat. My roommate sent a picture of him and his girlfriend with a new ring on her finger. They are engaged and I\u2019m so happy for my bro and his girl. They\u2019ve been dating even longer than me and my girlfriend and I know he is so madly in love with her. I\u2019m so excited for the two of them. If I\u2019m on top of the world, I know he\u2019s on top of the universe.\n\nJust a reminder to my brothers and sisters on Reddit. No matter what you\u2019re going through, if you\u2019re feeling down or alone, it always gets better. There\u2019s always a light around the corner or a person that loves you for you.
