You can tell this dog was not happy and abused the owners did not treat him well he is very under weight he is about roughly one year- two years old. Yesterday I get home and I see he somehow got loose and he was running around freely. I decided to take advantage and rescuing this poor dog and bringing him home. I will be taking him to the vet soon to get checked for any parasites, HW/FEC tests, shots etc. When I brought him home he was so happy to see a big backyard plenty of room to run and do dog stuff. He was starving when I gave him some food. He is very sweet and loves to jump up and say hi to everyone. Plan on teaching him the basic manners etc. Wanted to share this. Welcome to the family Rufus!! Glad to have you!\ud83d\ude0a \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5q8wy2787sg71.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5f49e51a0b326ad9f9e8fd7f50651fb8ed06bc4", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/p2kdnz/rescued_a_dog_to_add_to_my_family_he_is_a_sweetie/", "title": "Rescued A Dog To Add To My Family He Is A Sweetie!!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Beginning_Biscotti94", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628710606, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/p2kdnz/rescued_a_dog_to_add_to_my_family_he_is_a_sweetie/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438906.2120645, "replies_charged": false}
