We have officially begun the process of \"trying\"! We have a rough \"plan\" to try and have March/April be when we conceive (if all goes well - I \\*really\\* hope we're fertile! First step at being a Dad and creating new life with my wife! I'm so excited and can't tell anyone. Literally no one, not my closest friends, my co-workers I'm close with, my sister, or anyone! It's so weird when people in your life, especially older relatives, start asking: \"so when are you gonna have kids?!\". It's kinda rude now that I think about it, to assume we want kids, but we do! Using this forum to express my elation - it's really hard not to share something this exciting. Even if one person reads this, it'll fulfill the need to scream my happiness from the heavens!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/eec1q2/my_wife_just_stopped_taking_her_birth_control_and/", "title": "My wife just stopped taking her birth control and I'm elated!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tree_thoughts", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 25, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1577057150, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/eec1q2/my_wife_just_stopped_taking_her_birth_control_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440975.1240287, "replies_charged": false}
