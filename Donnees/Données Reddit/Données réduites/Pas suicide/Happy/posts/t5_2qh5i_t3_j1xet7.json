I had multiple messy suicide attempts, a tumultuous relationship, I was homeless for years and I could barely keep a job. \n\nNow, I have a job with an awesome and super kind/understanding boss, I\u2019m engaged, and I am now officially in college for my DREAM JOB! I\u2019ve wanted to be in the veterinary field my entire life, and I just enrolled in college to work towards my goal of becoming a vet tech! I always had some reason I couldn\u2019t do it. I was too poor, I didn\u2019t have a computer, I thought I was just too stupid to do math. But after saving up all the money I could from work, and having a blessing in disguise car accident that gave me a small chunk of change, I was finally able to start paying my tuition.\n\nI took my first math exam today, something I thought I could never pass. I passed with 100% my first try! I am so elated. For the first time in my *entire life* I really feel like I\u2019m going somewhere I want to go. Just two years from now, I could be working hands on in a REAL VETERINARY CLINIC! Making more money than I ever have before! I could afford a house and a child someday with a man I am truly happy to be with. When I say I\u2019m beaming, it feels like an understatement.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/j1xet7/feeling_really_good_about_myself_for_the_first/", "title": "Feeling really good about myself for the first time in years!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Bunny613", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1601378893, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/j1xet7/feeling_really_good_about_myself_for_the_first/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438988.0304177, "replies_charged": false}
