We had a wonderful relationship that truly felt fulfilling and meaningful, and I had always intended to marry her.  It was an extremely difficult time for me, as everything had felt right up until we reached that impasse.  It was very difficult for me to let go of the dream of having a family with her.\n\nWell, last week she contacted me for the first time since we split 5 months ago.  She told me that she's done a lot of thinking and examined her priorities, and she's come around to the idea of having a kid with me.  I listened to her reasons and how she changed her mind (she had been adamantly child free) and, what can I say, I believe her.\n\nSo now we're starting to plan our life together again, and it feels wonderful.  Like a second chance at a dream you never thought was possible, even though you were so sure it had to happen.  It's crazy how much my life has been turned upside down in the past few days.\n\nI'm keeping my expectations tempered, but so far it feels like coming home to where I'm meant to be.  Very happy days ahead it seems", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/bmazqz/last_week_i_reunited_with_the_love_of_my_life_and/", "title": "Last week I reunited with the love of my life and it's like she never left", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "CaptnRonn", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 23, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1557350445, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/bmazqz/last_week_i_reunited_with_the_love_of_my_life_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440989.3418958, "replies_charged": false}
