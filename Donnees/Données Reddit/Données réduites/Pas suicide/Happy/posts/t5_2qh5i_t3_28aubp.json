I'd spent the whole weekend with friends, I knew most of the people at the party, and was generally feeling right in my comfort zone. I had a couple lines I'm actually pretty proud of:\n\n* I was already saying my goodbyes when I ran into a gorgeous woman who had just wandered into the party. I was technically still planning on calling it a night early, but we were really hitting it off. At one point as we were making eyes at each other, alone in the kitchen, I said \"I realize if I don't kiss you now, I'll probably never see you again.\" To which she replied, \"You should probably do something about that then.\" So I did.\n\n* Later, when we were talking about the people we'd dated, she asked me if I had a thing for black girls (as she was black). I replied \"Not yet,\" and she laughed and said was a great answer.\n\n* And this last one isn't me being smooth so much as just being something I'm proud I can say and genuinely mean. She brought up the fact that she's technically married, but in the process of separating, and that it was amicable, and I just waved it off and said \"It ain't no thang.\" I know that she's probably had different reactions to that in the past, and really appreciate her being up front about it, but I can honestly say it doesn't bother me in the slightest. I like that I can be non-judgemental like that, and she appreciated it as well.\n\nSo yeah. Sometimes I can be charming. I'm happy about that :D", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/28aubp/i_was_smooth/", "title": "I was smooth!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "themanwhowas", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1402944299, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/28aubp/i_was_smooth/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439409.3107278, "replies_charged": false}
