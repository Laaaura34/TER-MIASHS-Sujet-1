They turned down vodka shots twice and we slowly drank beers and watched twitch. We laughed and I admired their Star Wars collection. We ordered pizza and I gifted them cat treats as a thank you for welcoming me into their home. We talked about current issues in today\u2019s world and they didn\u2019t ask me for a three some! Gosh, as I\u2019m typing this I\u2019m really realizing how fucked up my choice of friends is.. I was so excited that I quickly called my guy friend and told him about the amazing time I had with these good people! Eeeeee I\u2019m so happy that I have good friends for once. My mom is going to be so happy when she meets them. \n\nFinally cutting off contact with my (toxic) best friend was a good decision that I should have done a while ago. She would get inside my head and convince me that everyone around me was insecure and jealous of our relationship. That wasn\u2019t the case at all. It was her who was the problem, not everyone else. These new friends are on my team. They even said they\u2019d come hiking with me :D\n\nCheers to new friends", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/gu99iy/i_did_it_i_finally_did_it_i_made_nontoxic_friends/", "title": "I did it.
