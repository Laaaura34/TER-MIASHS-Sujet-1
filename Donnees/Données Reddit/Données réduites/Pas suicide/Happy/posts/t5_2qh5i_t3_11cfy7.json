As is the greatness of finishing my paper for my online class days in advance so I could study for my other two midterms coming up this Monday and Tuesday.\n\nGoing to work tomorrow is boring, but the day after that, Saturday, will be good. That's payday, and I finally get to break out the dirty-saying Halloween shirt I wanted to wear. That and a coworker I used to hate is now on better terms with me. So that is awesome too.\n\nAnd the greatest news of all technically is my twin's, but I'll share it anyway. I'm really proud of her for finally getting rid of her debt and is finally back to thinking and feeling normally again, thanks to her finally taking my advice and help on finding and holding a job. If there's anything worth taking in high school AND remembering, it's any class that talks about personal finances and finding a job/career. Especially if your parents&relatives were anything like mine, refusing to teach you about credit cards, insurance and etc.\n\nBigger news that is even better, going to NYCC on Sunday to do my shopping will be the best stress reliever of the entire year and semester as a whole. <3", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/11cfy7/pretty_good_for_where_im_at_prioritywise/", "title": "Pretty good for where I'm at priority-wise", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dm2r", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1350008734, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/11cfy7/pretty_good_for_where_im_at_prioritywise/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438858.3881457, "replies_charged": false}
