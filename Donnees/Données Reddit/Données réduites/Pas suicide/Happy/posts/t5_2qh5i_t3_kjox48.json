Last year we still spent Christmas together as I was pretty unwell and this year we're all together again due to covid. I also temporarily moved back in with him (he stayed in the family home with the kids when we split) at the start of lockdown here in the UK in March as my housemate is clinically vulnerable.\n\nMy parents split up when I was about 12 and hated each other for years.
