Didn\u2019t really work for me, but I was able to support her to stay home and raise our children which was great.\n\nI worked, paid the bills to buy new stuff, did a little of what I love (being with family) and a lot of what I didn\u2019t (work). Got promoted a few times, etcetera etcetera.\n\nI wasn\u2019t happy, I wasn\u2019t unhappy I was just trying to get on.\n\nI know it sounds twee, but recently (and maybe the dirge that is 2020 has something to do with it) I had a bit of an existential awakening.\n\nI moved across the country for a better life and ended up just doing the stuff that made me miserable with a different view out of the window.\n\nThing is, it didn\u2019t end up being complicated. I love my kids and my wife. I don\u2019t need any more stuff, or a better car, or a bigger house, I don\u2019t need to spend cash on crap I don\u2019t need to fill a void I don\u2019t have.\n\nSo I\u2019ve redirected myself. I\u2019ll go to work and do my job as best as I can, because having pride in what you do is important. But. When I come home the only thing I want to do is be with my family, not spend time on the phone re work. If I don\u2019t get promoted anymore, so what. Why do I crave the accolades and approval of people who I care nothing for, nor them me.\n\nSo, it may be simple and may even seem like a anticlimax if you\u2019ve read the above, but if it helps anyone, focus on what you have, not what you think you ought to. I\u2019ve chosen to be content with my work, invest myself fully at home and let myself be content.\n\nI\u2019m not the most articulate and I\u2019m sure the above could be said better, but change where you think you want to go.
