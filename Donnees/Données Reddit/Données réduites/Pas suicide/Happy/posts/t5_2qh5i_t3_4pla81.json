I have been cash-strapped for years and could only make minimal payments.  Because I was late with payments sometimes, they saddled me with a very high, punitive interest rate.  I stopped buying things with it years ago, but the balance kept climbing even though I faithfully paid it.  I was trapped like a rat.  BUT!  I recently got a financial windfall (small inheritance) and I used it to pay off my card!  I'M FREE!  I am wild with joy over this!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/4pla81/i_finally_paid_off_my_horribad_credit_card_debt/", "title": "I finally paid off my horribad credit card debt!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ToolPackinMama", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1466746701, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/4pla81/i_finally_paid_off_my_horribad_credit_card_debt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438959.0500665, "replies_charged": false}
