She works in a different part of the store from me and only works part-time, unlike me. Nevertheless, I have seen and heard about all the hard work that she puts in in order to maintain a semblance of order for the customers who shop there. I also like how she puts on a perpetually cheerful front no matter how bad things get. Granted, she has openly admitted to crying in the office sometimes, which makes me feel sad. \n\nThat aside, one thing I really like about her is that she loves giving hugs to people. I remember the first time she ever hugged me back in June of 2015, when I made fudge to celebrate the then-store manager's birthday. For some reason, she thanked me again the next day and gave me another hug. From that moment on, I knew she was some kind of wonderful. Even today, her touch still sends my heart into the stratosphere. I hope that she, her boyfriend and his kid (from another relationship, besides the point) have a really happy life together, because she has really made me happy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/apl0y1/i_just_wanted_to_tell_you_about_this_coworker_who/", "title": "I just wanted to tell you about this coworker who makes me happy", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "NewEnglandSynthOrch", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1549919217, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/apl0y1/i_just_wanted_to_tell_you_about_this_coworker_who/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441316.5549655, "replies_charged": false}
