Before I knew it, I found myself dressed and taking a stroll surrounded by my absolute favorite weather (cloudy and warm), beautiful landscapes, and a pleasant aroma in the air. \n\nFor some reason, things just seemed to fit together to create one of life\u2019s truly simple and beautiful moments, the kind in which I haven\u2019t found myself the active audience in a long time. \n\nAs a result, I have been thinking about how lucky I am to be happy again, even if just for that moment. It\u2019s possible to becomes  productive and happy as I once was, I\u2019ve believed this the whole time I have battled my depression. But today was the first tangible experience I have to point to in my rebuild to happiness. \n\nMy real work started today, and I look forward to highlighting more of life\u2019s little details to paint a portrait of every day. That\u2019s the goal. \n\nThanks to all who read", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ah17ji/took_a_walk_outside_today_and_boy_am_i_grateful/", "title": "Took a walk outside today, and boy am I grateful", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "jhfreud", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1547752041, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ah17ji/took_a_walk_outside_today_and_boy_am_i_grateful/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442182.4585714, "replies_charged": false}
