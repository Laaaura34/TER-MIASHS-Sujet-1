I have recently moved to Australia and, as it turns out, the copy of this game available in Australia is censored.  There is no blood, no decapitation, no riot police zombies and no fun.  The zombies just disappear when you kill them.  This discovery effectively ruined my day.  I was really looking forward to this game.  Anyway, I decided to contact Steam customer support yesterday (even though they explicitly say all purchases are final when you buy).  I told them my problem and asked for a refund.  They came through for me.  I got an e-mail basically saying they're not supposed to issue refunds but they had decided to do me a favor.  The best part is that a friend in North America offered to \"Gift\" me the game over Steam.  I just tried it out and the gifted version is uncensored and awesome.  Thanks Steam customer support.
