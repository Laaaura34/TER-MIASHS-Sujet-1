I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to all the doctors, other health care workers, the essential item's shop's owners and all the other people who are leading the fight against COVID-19 in every way possible.\n\nI'd like to take this moment and ask you all to join this campaign of gratitude where we thank at least three people today, who we think, are making our lives easier and ask them to do the same. Connect with someone and tell them how glad you are because of their existence. Take them by surprise and show how you'll be there for them and the look at their faces beam with joy. Doesn't even matter how big or small the gratitude is. Be it some long lost friend or someone who you talk to on a daily basis, express your love for them.\n\nTake the charge and make a difference :\")\n\nStay safe guys!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/fu4xtu/to_the_people_who_are_out_there_making_a/", "title": "To the people who are out there making a difference and helping the needful during this pandemic, a hearty thank you", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "all_in_vain", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1585904287, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/fu4xtu/to_the_people_who_are_out_there_making_a/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438990.5943308, "replies_charged": false}
