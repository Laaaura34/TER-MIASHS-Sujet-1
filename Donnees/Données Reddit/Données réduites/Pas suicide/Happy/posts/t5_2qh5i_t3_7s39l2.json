I loved my students and made an impact.  I worked 60-90+ hours on average every week.  Because I was loved, I therefore thought I \u201cloved\u201d my job. \n\nI moved to a different city because I got engaged and I was certain I would never find a job that \u201cfulfilled\u201d me like my old position. I cried and seriously mourned the loss of what I thought was the \u201cpeak\u201d of my career.  Was I ever wrong!  \n\nI am happy. I love my new students, I have 1/4 of the work load and make 2x as much. I learned that loving my students and making an impact is DIFFERENT than loving my job and that both can exist together.  I love coming home from work and leaving work behind.  I love 40 hour weeks with full benefits and realistic pay.  I love being able to give time to my (now) husband and know my job will not suffer for it.  I am so happy. \n\nReddit, the future may be scary. And you may not be sure what is ahead. But never be afraid to try something different and really discover what beauty can exist in your life.
