I can get a diagnosis and some medications if needed which is honestly really almost ground breaking for me. I've been going through a lot and my parents refused to actually put me in therapy and what not awhile ago so it's just a great feeling that I can finally do that.\n\nAnother great thing is the fact that my manager came up to me and let me know that she's going to move some people around and possibly give me a higher paying position than she originally planned. That honestly was just great to find out especially given the fact that it's a $7.50 raise. I was struggling for money at the beginning of the year and the fact that I won't have to worry about that as much once I get this position is just amazing. I'm just super excited and I should be starting around Saturday if everything works out :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/prwl76/i_finally_found_a_way_to_get_insurance_to_cover/", "title": "I finally found a way to get insurance to cover seeing a psychiatrist and I got a promotion", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ugghhno", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 66, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632149899, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/prwl76/i_finally_found_a_way_to_get_insurance_to_cover/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442009.56649, "replies_charged": false}
