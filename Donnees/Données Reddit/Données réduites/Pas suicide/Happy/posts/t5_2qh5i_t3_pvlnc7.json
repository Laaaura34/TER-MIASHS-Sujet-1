He loves being on the water and he was so excited to go so I\u2019m so happy we got to do this. It was beautiful we saw multiple humpback whales and many gorgeous bottlenose dolphins!! It was such a lovely experience together! Afterwards, we got really yummy ice cream and had a great lunch by the water where I surprised him with his Christmas present and I really think he is happy about it. I got him tickets to an event in November so I had to give it to him early. We were also going to go ring shopping today which is exciting but the cruise ran a little late so we didn\u2019t make it to the store before they closed so we\u2019re going another day.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/pvlnc7/we_had_such_a_great_day_today_getting_to_go_whale/", "title": "We had such a great day today getting to go whale watching and surprising him with his Christmas gift", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "a-jarof-milk", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632625912, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/pvlnc7/we_had_such_a_great_day_today_getting_to_go_whale/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441112.9094958, "replies_charged": false}
