This time around I decided I was going to do it te right way, which is the slow and difficult way. Instead of crash dieting for the quickest results,  I count every calorie that goes into my body, bapance my micronutrients, lift weights 3 times a week, and train in martial arts 4-6 times a week. \n\nI love what I am doing but some days can be particularly grueling. This Tuesday, I came home after sparring and got really beat up. I was very sore and bruised up, so I was sitting silently at my desk chair kind of sulking.\n\nMy fiancee came over to me and told me she was proud of me, out of the blue. She told the fact that I've been going every night and working this hard amazed her.. She said it has nothing to do with the weightloss, just the fact that I don't quit is what makes her proud. \n\nI took a day off to heal up a bit, and now I have a whole new reserve of motivation knowing that I'm making my family proud, because that's all I've ever wanted. \n\nI'm not married and don't have kids yet but I will soon. I know this is something I need to do for my future family, and it already seems to be paying dividends.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/og87qz/been_struggling_with_becoming_healthy_and_my/", "title": "Been struggling with becoming healthy and my fiancee told me she was proud of me", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MaRs1317", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625754160, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/og87qz/been_struggling_with_becoming_healthy_and_my/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442507.9036937, "replies_charged": false}
