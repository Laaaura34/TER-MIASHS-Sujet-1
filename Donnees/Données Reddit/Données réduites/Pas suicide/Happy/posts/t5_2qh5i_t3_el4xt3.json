We were never able to get all the staffs, the closest we had gotten was me with the ice staff, he with the fire staff, the wind staff only missing the magical stone that powers it, and the eletricity staff only missing the handle and the stone.\n\nNow, after \\~3 years, on a remastered version of the map, I went at it again, and after some 5 or 6 failed attempts and some luck I did it! I finally did it!!!!!!\n\n[https://youtu.be/Jvyn2iwZN-o](https://youtu.be/Jvyn2iwZN-o) The link to the video!!!\n\nIt might seem stupid, but I feel so proud of myself right now! >w<", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/el4xt3/i_have_accomplished_a_silly_goal_from_when_i_was/", "title": "I have accomplished a silly goal from when I was 8 - 11!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Suporte8Amigo", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1578364959, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/el4xt3/i_have_accomplished_a_silly_goal_from_when_i_was/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442060.6980126, "replies_charged": false}
