On days like this, giving myself small goals that I can achieve are key. They may not be what I wanted to achieve, but life is all about adapting with change and riding the ebbs and flows. As much as we plan and think we have control over our lives, there are always going to be challenges thrown our way. Losing expectations and letting go of that control allows me to adapt to those challenges, even when they are persistent.\n\n*Originally posted at https://app.goodnightjournal.com/public-journal/6b308f22-2bb1-4f00-aaea-7f4947b26e60*", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/kgbgs5/so_today_i_am_holding_myself_accountable_to_that/", "title": "So today, I am holding myself accountable to that responsibility by writing in my journal...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "gnjapp", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1608397277, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/kgbgs5/so_today_i_am_holding_myself_accountable_to_that/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442034.1759942, "replies_charged": false}
