My partner and I had managed to get pregnant last year, but things weren't forming (what's called a blighted ovum).  We had to wait a bit before trying again, but have managed to make Baby 2.0.  It's too early yet to know anything for certain, but we're pretty optimistic that this one will be ok.  Pretty amazing to manage it at my age without needing to rely on medical interventions.  Thanks for being the sharers to our news!\n\nEdit: WOW! Thanks guys! Our anonymous Redditor friends have been amazing. Yes, we are aware of the risks, but we'll be fully scienced up on this. I'm a no smoke/drink/drugs/caffeine person, and have been on prenatal vitamins since before our last one. (Remember, 90% of neural tube defects can be prevented with folic acid!). I'll hopefully be posting updates with this account until the end of September (the end of the first trimester)... But, given the subreddit, I'm only doing so if the news is good! Thanks for all the support and the good outcome stories.
