They intubated him 4 days ago and he's not yet stable. You are all so happy, and I'd like to ask that you send some positive vibes my way. If you're the praying type, go for it. If you're not, just some happy thoughts would be appreciated. They're doing everything they can for him, but the rest of us need some positive help. Hopefully I will have a happy update soon!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/8ahzp8/can_i_ask_you_all_a_favor_please_share_some_of/", "title": "Can I ask you all a favor?
