It made me very flexible between work and my college assignments and I got a very supportive professor and she encouraged me to changed from Real Estate to Business Administration, and I am honestly glad where everything has been going for me so far this year... one thing that I learned from myself is don\u2019t let people play with your emotions and be taken an advantage of. As for the future I want to get my permit to drive and hopefully by next year sometime I can transfer to the university of my dreams", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/n2xqk3/after_a_rough_year_of_2020_and_with_the_pandemic/", "title": "After a rough year of 2020 and with the pandemic in the place.
