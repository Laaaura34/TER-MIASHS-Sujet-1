I didn't want to spend a second away from you yet that grace and elegance with which you walked away left me in awe. Your figure has always left an impression, but it was that moment that I said \"Boy I am a lucky guy\". It wasn't just what strolled; it was the way that it did. The way your shirt fluttered and the spring you put into every step was enough to drive my heart crazy but then you did the very thing I wished you would. You looked back at me with those deep blue eyes and shared some of that brilliance in your face with me. You've captivated me in every possible way I can imagine and beyond yet you still have little cute smiles when I give you those tiny kisses. You're everything I could've wanted in someone who would accept me. You're who I've been waiting to meet for a long time.\n\nI'm so happy to be with you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/2j2kc8/i_hate_to_see_her_go_but_i_love_to_watch_her_leave/", "title": "I hate to see her go, but I love to watch her leave.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bcool76092", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1413158951, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2j2kc8/i_hate_to_see_her_go_but_i_love_to_watch_her_leave/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440631.4469998, "replies_charged": false}
