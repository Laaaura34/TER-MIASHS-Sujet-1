This post can't possibly express how I feel, it can't possibly explain the joy and relief and gratitude. But today, for the first time since May, I am happy. And I am employed. Thank you all for keeping me as relatively sane as I've been this whole time. I will do all I can to return the favor.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/fulht/i_got_an_offer_letter_today/", "title": "I GOT AN OFFER LETTER TODAY!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "senatorkneehi", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 19, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1298930794, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/fulht/i_got_an_offer_letter_today/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440771.6487172, "replies_charged": false}
