In the process of opening new checking and savings accounts I decided to apply for a credit card too.\n\nNow, earlier this year was the first time I was ever approved for one. I've never taken out loans, I've never had a cosigner to help me - so, I've never spent money I didn't have.  \nSadly, this didn't help my credit score and the two times in my life I applied, prior to this year, I was denied for a lack of credit!\n\nWhat makes me so happy is that not only have I gotten approved for my *second* credit card **of my life**, in the same year that I was approved for my first, but my second one has a limit **six** times higher!!  \nAll while my old bank is making excuses as to why they can't (won't) increase the limit on my first card. *I've never missed a payment and only once didn't pay off the full balance on the due date*\n\nHappy dance!\n\nMy credit is finally going from non-existent/bad to good and eventually excellent!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/7hrdgi/finally_building_better_credit/", "title": "Finally Building (better) Credit!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SL5456", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1512496160, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7hrdgi/finally_building_better_credit/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438958.746568, "replies_charged": false}
