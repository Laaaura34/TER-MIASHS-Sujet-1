With time it got worse and people started to take my vagina for granted and I was sexually abused quite a times. I still didn't stop being this person till I realised that I got one life and am I really respecting myself, my body and my sexuality. I gradually got into meditation and self and it all started from there. I started to love myself so much that I did not need any outside person to love me or complete me. But after so many years of making myself sexually available, I did not want to get indulged in any sexual activity with anyone, but then I again realized that I had the power of my own life in my own hands and no one can hurt me except my own self. So gradually I discovered tantra, then neo tantra. I understood how sex is not just pleasure but energy and I began to worship my body and indulge in sexuality but this time in a more respectful, conscious, and spiritual manner. And with time I have begun to love myself more.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/mf91zo/i_have_the_power_of_my_own_life_in_my_own_hands/", "title": "I have the power of my own life in my own hands and no one can hurt me except my own self", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Riaas_xo", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616962851, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/mf91zo/i_have_the_power_of_my_own_life_in_my_own_hands/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440684.9035108, "replies_charged": false}
