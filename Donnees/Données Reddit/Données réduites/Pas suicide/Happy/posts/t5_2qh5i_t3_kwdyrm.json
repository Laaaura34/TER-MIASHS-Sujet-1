I keep trying to be the 'ideal person' and it never works. I have pretty bad ADHD so trying to do most of these things and constantly failing is pretty depressing. Well this year I'm over it. I realize I'm different and I don't need be like everyone else. This year, if covid lets me, I want to do more..... become a tourist in my own town. I want to go for walks by myself in local parks, get coffees at random cafes, and just enjoy life. I feel way more optimistic about this than when I try to tell myself I'm going to go to the gym everyday!!
