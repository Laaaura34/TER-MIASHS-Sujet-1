Since my last r/happy post I have moved, and I\u2019m enjoying my new hometown, even if it is filled with boomers :p. All kidding aside, it\u2019s quiet, there\u2019s absolutely no crime, streets are clean, I can comfortably walk to the beach and chill and eat a burger or schnitzel, and best of all I got this new fridge where I\u2019m GUARANTEED cubed ice now!!! :D. It was just fucking awful when there was this really god awful heat wave back in June (got up to 105 degrees) and I literally had to take this big bag of ice and smack it to try and separate them\u2026 what a time that was!!! Also on a side note I didn\u2019t realize room temperature Coke fizzed that much when it hit ice lmao. Also on the note of my new house, some of my extended family came over to see it and we all went in the pool in our backyard for a swim, that was a total blast as I haven\u2019t seen them since my Grandma\u2019s funeral a year ago.\n\nOn the other hand, all my favorite things to do have come back right around now, car shows are back, motorsports are back, football is back, and I\u2019m just thrilled that I can just kick back and enjoy life and see people\u2019s smiles again! And *everyone* is smiling just as I predicted! I\u2019m sure Reddit can agree that last year was perhaps the most dark depressing time of our entire lifetime but hey we all kept up the faith and we stuck through! And trust me, there were times where I was so goddamn depressed throughout all of last year and most of this year where I felt like ending my life as it just got so stressful. I\u2019m glad that I stuck it out, as my patience is now being rewarded! \n\nI honestly think that 2022 will be the happiest year in recent history. Anyways to whoever reads this I hope you have a great day and here\u2019s to much more fun and excitement in 2022! :D", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/pjvr7p/my_life_is_finally_happy_and_hopeful_after_a_long/", "title": "My life is finally happy and hopeful after a long period of darkness and despair!!!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "kentuckychicken1987", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631048112, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/pjvr7p/my_life_is_finally_happy_and_hopeful_after_a_long/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439585.0956988, "replies_charged": false}
