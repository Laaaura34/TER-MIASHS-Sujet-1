Recently I have come to my country and visiting aunts, cousins, siblings that I have no contact with and they all tell me to not exclude myself. Even cousins that I haven't had much contact in my life have told me that they want to know how I'm doing and so and so. I never knew they cared about me like this. Im going through a break up from an abusive relationship and hearing about how they value me as a person makes me happy. I dont know how to explain but it really gives me comfort. I have been so down before that I had to be hospitalized for a week and I felt that no one cared, but I know that it's not the truth. Family is the most important to me and I feel glad that these people want to be apart of my life. The support I am receiving and people that are listening to me and understanding my side and telling me that they want the best for me, that they know I deserve better is overwhelming great. I feel like before people gaslighted the shit out of me, saying I was making a big deal out of nothing and things like that. To not be laughed at is amazing. It feels a lot easier to let go of my traumas with the support I am receiving.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/p86g2c/so_many_people_have_told_me_that_they_care_and/", "title": "So many people have told me that they care and that I need to keep them in my life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Dnotchtiebd", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629470069, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/p86g2c/so_many_people_have_told_me_that_they_care_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439593.536092, "replies_charged": false}
