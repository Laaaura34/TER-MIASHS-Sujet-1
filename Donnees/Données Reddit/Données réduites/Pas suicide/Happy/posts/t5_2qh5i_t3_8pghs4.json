While we\u2019ve had an amazing life together which has produced 3 children and 5 amazing grandchildren, I\u2019ve always regretted not hanging in and finishing my degree.\n\nToday, it\u2019s official. I start back to University in August to finish my degree!!! I want to prove to myself that I can do it and show my family that it\u2019s never too late to achieve your dreams and that your past questionable decisions can\u2019t keep you down. I am so happy right now!!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/8pghs4/25_years_after_i_left_university_to_get_married_i/", "title": "25 years after I left University to get married, I am officially going back to finish my degree!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "crickzac", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 25, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1528427102, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8pghs4/25_years_after_i_left_university_to_get_married_i/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440981.5433314, "replies_charged": false}
