We have our own loft upstairs. Before I moved in here I lived with my family who got evicted from our homes repeatedly and never had anything. Now my boyfriend and I essentially have our own place and I have a tv! The tv can play Netflix and Disney plus so I can watch tv in bed. I have a queen sized bed! I have an amazing boyfriend who I dearly love and I have a daughter who is literally named after rays of sunlight because that\u2019s exactly what she is to me. \n\nMy life seems hard and pathetic to so many people but I\u2019m doing well in school and I\u2019m very pleased with where I am.
