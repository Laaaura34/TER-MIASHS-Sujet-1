In some of my darkest times, I found that simply taking the time to practice gratitude for the things in my life helped to make me happier. My question to this community is, if I created a free app that would prompt you to use it daily and write down the 1\\-3 things you were currently grateful for, would you use it and find it helpful? It's something that has worked for me and I want to find a great, low barrier way to share this.\n\nHave a great day!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/8qcfz1/happiness_app_idea_easy_daily_gratitude_please/", "title": "Happiness App Idea - Easy Daily Gratitude -- please validate!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "YouGotJammed", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1528746765, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8qcfz1/happiness_app_idea_easy_daily_gratitude_please/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440603.0649807, "replies_charged": false}
