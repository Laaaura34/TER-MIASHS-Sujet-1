This man is wise beyond his years and I appreciate his intelligence, his warmth, his compassion. For the last couple of weeks I\u2019ve been going through some things and I\u2019ve been giving him attitude when he didn\u2019t deserve. Tonight I broke down crying and laid it out all out. He responded with so much love and compassion and was not angry. We spoke for over 2 hours about life and god and religion. It was amazing. He is my first love truly. The way he has loved me and encouraged me and believed in me, I hold men to a certain standard. Falling below that standard would be demoralizing to both me and him. He has taught me to love in so many ways. I can\u2019t wait for my children to meet him and hear the word grandpa. Everything i do in my life I will honor both god and my parents. They are my beacon. I LOVE YOU SO FREAKING MUCH DAD\n\nI\u2019m 19 btw :p", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/kc4vz4/i_have_the_most_amazing_dad_gushingandfulloflove/", "title": "I have the most amazing dad #gushingandfulloflove", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Asleep_Cut505", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1607836666, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/kc4vz4/i_have_the_most_amazing_dad_gushingandfulloflove/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438987.6642509, "replies_charged": false}
