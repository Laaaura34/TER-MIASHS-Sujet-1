Left our local daily about 20 years ago, freelanced for Time, Newsweek and others.  That was too inconsistent, so she jumped into the Communications department of our local univ.  Got super PR oriented, even though her passion was placing op-eds for faculty and producing podcasts of their works.  More and more bullshit accumulated.\n\nYesterday, she got an offer through the same university to take a position in the School of Public Policy, teaching journalism with students.  She'll get to focus on all her passions and work with bright young people.\n\nShe is so buoyed by the excitement.  I'm so happy for her!\n\nShe deserves this - she's absolutely brilliant, hard working and big hearted.  She'll be great!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/q82f5l/so_happy_for_my_wife_and_by_extension_me/", "title": "So Happy For My Wife (and by extension, me)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Utterlybored", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 26, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634226483, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/q82f5l/so_happy_for_my_wife_and_by_extension_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441385.1248584, "replies_charged": false}
