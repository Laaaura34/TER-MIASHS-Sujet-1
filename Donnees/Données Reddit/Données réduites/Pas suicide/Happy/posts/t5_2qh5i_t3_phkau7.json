So my SO and I are long distance, been together for three years. A lot of how we hang out is over playing video games, which I love playing with them. I have a decent PC yet theirs wasn\u2019t the greatest, and unfortunately their PC blue screened and they couldn\u2019t really afford to fix it.\n\n\nSo I decided to save up my money and buy them a really nice laptop. Specs wise it\u2019s better then mine, so they can even play the games I can like Witcher and Cyberpunk.  The journey their was tough especially since I work a very physical job. As well as online pricing continuing to rise every single time my paycheck came around, however I finally managed to get them it!! \n\nI love them so much, I cannot wait for them to get it and for us to play again. This literally became my mission and it meant the world to me.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if this seems like rambling, I am just so so so so excited for them! And I needed an outlet to share my excitement.
