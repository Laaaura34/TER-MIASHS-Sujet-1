She was talking about how she greatly prefers the little ones in kindergarten and all, while never being able to emotionally handle the \"sass\" of the older kids like 5th grade.\n\nI kinda sheepishly admitted that I dont do well with pre-K through some 1st grades, since a lot of that teaching is singing (which I dont care for unless it's music I like and listen to myself) instructions and reteaching, and... I just feel EXTREMELY awkward in those situations. \n\n\"Well, you build incredible relationships with the kids, and I've seen you have real conversations with them and tough love conversations they're always receptive to.\"\n\nI didnt even know this woman ever saw me work with these kids. Damn. It really put a massive spring in my step today. Makes me feel like I'm really making a difference with them hehe.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/itzwqz/in_a_staff_meeting_today_i_had_a_coworker_i/", "title": "In a staff meeting today, I had a coworker I rarely deal with praise my skill at relationship building.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Anchovieee", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1600276539, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/itzwqz/in_a_staff_meeting_today_i_had_a_coworker_i/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442619.5743172, "replies_charged": false}
