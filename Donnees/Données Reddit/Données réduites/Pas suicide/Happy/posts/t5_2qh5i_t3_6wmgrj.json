It turned out to be napkins as my dumb ass never actually checked what it was before leaving. I tried to use the napkins and got my fingers covered in her leavings in the process. The dog is lucky I adore her. \n\nWe came across a guy outside a little ways down from there and I asked him if he happened to have any hand sanitizer and a bag with him. He ran inside and came out with a jug of dish soap, a gallon of water, a plastic bag, and some napkins and threw the offending bag out for me. He even found me later in the walk to bring me more paper towels. \n\nThis really made my night pleasant so far. Thanks, random dude and anyone who helps someone out in a shitty situation.\n\nEdit: instead of earning money our doggie ran with me.
