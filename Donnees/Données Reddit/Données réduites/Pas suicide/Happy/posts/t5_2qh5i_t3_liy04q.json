And my ex and I had only been broken up for 2 weeks, so I'm so lucky I found a new apartment this fast. And now to the best part: The apartment is amazing.\n\nIt's a 2 bedroom apartment and the kitchen is larger than anything I've ever had before and it even has a living room. Before I moved in with my ex I only had a small studio, so I'm really excited about all this space.\n\nBut. At what cost?\n\n$730 USD a month. With utilities. In a large city. In a good and calm neighborhood.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like the luckiest person on earth for getting this apartment.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/liy04q/i_moved_out_of_my_ex_apartment_yesterday/", "title": "I moved out of my ex' apartment yesterday", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SecretCupcake420", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 33, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613211396, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/liy04q/i_moved_out_of_my_ex_apartment_yesterday/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439317.663017, "replies_charged": false}
