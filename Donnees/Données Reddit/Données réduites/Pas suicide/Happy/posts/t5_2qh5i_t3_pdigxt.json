I don\u2019t know what\u2019s started, I don\u2019t know when it was. But something has happened where I\u2019ve suddenly snapped, come out of my shell, and I\u2019ve never felt more motivated in my life. \n\nI\u2019m ready to go to the gym tomorrow and make a real change. I\u2019m ready to go to college in two weeks and finally earn something more than GCSEs after 2 years of dropping college and sixth form. It feels like somehow, somewhere, a huge weight has been lifted off my back. \n\nYesterday I spoke to my oldest sister over a phone call for the first time in half a year. It was a huge leap of faith. I had no conversation topics pre thought up, no alterations to my language, no trying to be the best. I\u2019d seen a sentence about dancing, how if you just focus on feeling it instead of thinking of the steps in your head, it works. And it worked. And we spoke for 2 and a half hours, effortlessly just talking. I haven\u2019t  had a conversation like that in years, where I\u2019ve just been able to relax. \n\nI can\u2019t put it into words at all. All I can say is when something happens that\u2019s incredible, I\u2019ll be adding it to this post. Whether it\u2019s a week, month or year from now.
