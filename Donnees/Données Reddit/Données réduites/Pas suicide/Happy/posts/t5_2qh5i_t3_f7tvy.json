Needless to say, I'm ready to get out of this apartment and let the landlord's meth addicted son ruin this unit as well.\n\nThe day after the email came saying we were in escrow and submitted loan paperwork (which I've had ready for months) I bought a gallon of paint and started touching up the exterior.  Scraping, sanding, cleaning and painting it really is starting to give me the feeling of ownership that I've never felt before.\n\nI've waited so long that my fiancee' and I have saved enough to buy some energy star appliances and I've got all the cable, junction boxes and face plates to wire a home run CAT6+A/V to every room.\n\nI am happy, and I wanted to share.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/f7tvy/after_5_months_of_waiting_my_short_sale_has/", "title": "After 5 months of waiting, my short sale has finally gone thru and I'm starting escrow.
