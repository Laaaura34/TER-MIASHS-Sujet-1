It went super well :)\nI've got a long road ahead of me for recovery (which will take twice as long with only one working leg) but im so, so happy to start the hobble.\nEven if the road takes forever, I'm happy to take in the scenery and keep working on myself.\nAbsolutely delighted to have a cup of tea and my family waiting for me at home.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/jtzncr/discharged_from_hospital_and_heading_home_despite/", "title": "Discharged from Hospital and Heading Home Despite 2020", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "nimsaysno", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1605347540, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/jtzncr/discharged_from_hospital_and_heading_home_despite/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440217.2312531, "replies_charged": false}
