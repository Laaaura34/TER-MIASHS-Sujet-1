After a few days I suggested a meetup to continue our conversation in person, and she agreed. We met, ate some food and walked through a park while sharing our lives to eachother.\n\nThe next date didn't go as well - she was in a different state and it was virtual. I wasn't in the right mindspace and it felt awkward throughout the whole thing. I thought I had ruined it. She even picked up on it and suggested we don't date anymore, but wanted to stay friends and maybe meet up after she got back.\n\nA few weeks later, conversation continued and we met up again just to hang out and have fun doing something together. Flirting popped back up between us and it felt like sparks were flying, so at the end of the day I asked if she wanted to try again. She was hesitant and said she'd let me know.\n\nA few months later we're still dating, staying over at each others houses, having 10+ hour phone calls and more recently have been recording ourselves reciting books, poems and short stories for the other to fall asleep to when we can't be together or on the phone.\n\nThis is the first time in a long time I've been this happy with someone else, and I really hope she becomes my forever partner <3", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/p44fpc/found_a_potential_life_partner_and_i_couldnt_be/", "title": "Found a potential life partner and I couldn't be happier!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "JackTheSpudThief", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 17, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628930556, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/p44fpc/found_a_potential_life_partner_and_i_couldnt_be/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441068.51888, "replies_charged": false}
