Improv gave me family and friends and joy and value as an entertainer. It was something that was a personal treasure and something I felt like I was honestly good at (always learning of course!) \n\nWith the pandemic, weekly practices had to be cancelled, shows werent an option, and like so many other people I felt the world turn over with me on the upside down part. Creatively I suffered. \n\nBut me and a couple close friends with the same frustrations started our own improv comedy podcast!!! Weve posted 6 episodes over the span of 6 weeks and have had over 200 downloads from 22 states and 7 countries! My well of self worth is overflowing. The episode linked is a culmination of all our characters and story lines and we did it seemlessly without any planning. I couldnt be more proud. It probably dumb but it fills me with joy!!!\n\nI dont want to market but I do want to spread my passion to anyone interested, or that could use a good laugh.\n\nPodcast is rated NC17 and called Neighborhood Radio, on spotify! \n\nhttps://www.buzzsprout.com/1600537/7748884", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/lljkhy/lost_improv_due_to_pandemic_made_me_feel_like_i/", "title": "Lost Improv due to pandemic, made me feel like i lost friends, family, personal time and a hobby.
