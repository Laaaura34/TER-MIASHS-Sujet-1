Its hard to balance all of this with completing my Master's so the fact that it worked out makes me incredibly happy :) If you'd like to take a look I'll post a link to my channel [here](http://www.youtube.com/friedjohnnycake) and a link to my finished let's play [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB5Mg80wfGIjD2WBCPZd8nSeSH__JPtuN)\nPlease come and take a look if you're interested, but I just got really excited about it and thought I would share :) sorry to ramble", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1spue6/finished_my_first_ever_lets_play_series/", "title": "Finished my first ever Let's Play series", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "friedjohnnycake1", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1386858433, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1spue6/finished_my_first_ever_lets_play_series/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438963.7622218, "replies_charged": false}
