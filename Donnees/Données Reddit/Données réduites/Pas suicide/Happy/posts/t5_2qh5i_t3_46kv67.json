It's been stressful, and I have not at all been a pleasant person to be around. \n\nI've also recently had some major dental work done, which causes me to wake up in a lot of pain. So my husband wakes me up in the middle of the night to give me medicine. \n\nThis morning, around 5, he brought my pills, and because I was awake, I checked my work email. \n\nI mentioned this when he came back to bed, that of course I had an email from work, but it was nothing I had to worry about until Monday. \n\nI guess he got inspired to make sure I got an email I'd like, instead of one that would stress me out. \n\nIt was lovely. It made me smile, and it made me cry. It made me wake him up to say thank you, and that I love him. \n\nI won't share the whole thing, because it's mine. \n\nBut here is a small piece of it that I want to share. \n\n> We have such joy together, and it is not an exaggeration to say that happiness does not come to us easily. Between the fears and doubts we have about ourselves and the pain and failures we have weathered, we come by this happy life but grudgingly, as if stumbled upon by accident.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/46kv67/my_husband_wrote_me_an_unexpected_letter/", "title": "My husband wrote me an unexpected letter", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mlledufarge", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 169, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1455891978, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/46kv67/my_husband_wrote_me_an_unexpected_letter/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442181.9636552, "replies_charged": false}
