I had been worried all month about my baby as my first ultrasound showed no fetal pole, but it was really early so I really shouldn't have been worried (but I was anyway lol). On Wednesday I had my appointment and was so pleased to see my baby jumping around and actually formed like a little baby now! I took a video and haven't stopped watching it. My boyfriend keeps saying \"I can't believe we made an actual baby. There's a little us in you right now.\" after we saw the baby jumping around. Apparently baby can now hear and is able to feel if I push my belly so I've been periodically saying hello to them. My heart is so full it could burst!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/dzxsi3/im_back_to_work_today_and_im_rested_happy_and/", "title": "I'm back to work today and I'm rested, happy and optimistic", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "admirableroof", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1574408520, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/dzxsi3/im_back_to_work_today_and_im_rested_happy_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441975.0141535, "replies_charged": false}
