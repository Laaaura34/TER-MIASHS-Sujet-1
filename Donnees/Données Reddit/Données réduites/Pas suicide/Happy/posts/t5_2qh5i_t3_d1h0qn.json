Money is beyond scarce, but my boyfriend and I don\u2019t want to admit to others we are drowning. I\u2019m not sure his reason, but for me it\u2019s because I\u2019ve had so much help from my dad already and my mom refuses to help. Anyways, today my boyfriend mom reached out and asked if we are doing ok because his answers are short. She told me that she cares about us and wants to help where she can. That little conversation we had made me see that maybe my blah situation will get better, eventually. It just makes me so happy to have found a man that wants to work as a team and his family is just so wholesome, despite bumps. Honestly, just a few years ago,  I didn\u2019t think I would make it to the next year. Now, here I am, with the most kind and loving man. Things do get better! \nThanks for reading, have a fantastic day", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/d1h0qn/i_am_beyond_blessed_and_happy_that_i_decided_to/", "title": "I am beyond blessed and happy that I decided to battle my depression and become victorious!
