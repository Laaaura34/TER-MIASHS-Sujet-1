I had a math exam last week and I studied my ass off for it, but once I took the test itself I realized that I was only like 50% sure that my answers were right on every single problem. I've been stressed about it all weekend but I ended up getting a B! Not the best grade but it is LEAGUES above what I thought I would get. I really straight up thought I would have gotten every single problem wrong. It's my first exam in college too which stressed me out even more lol.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/q1fygu/just_passed_an_exam_i_thought_for_sure_i_had/", "title": "Just passed an exam I thought for sure I had failed!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "YouSlashGlenn", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 25, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633383538, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/q1fygu/just_passed_an_exam_i_thought_for_sure_i_had/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441791.990015, "replies_charged": false}
