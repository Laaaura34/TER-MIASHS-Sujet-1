I didn't even realize it was there until my vision was nothing but airbags. It was an 11 month old car with 10,085 miles on it, my first new car I'd ever bought after years of beaters. The entire engine block was displaced, the hood flew up and smashed the windshield in 3 places, and the side curtain, steering wheel, and driver's chair airbags all deployed. Bits of deer fur were stuck in the engine compartment, and I climbed out with only a small bruise on my hand from the airbag, no bigger than a paintball welt.\n\nAfter limping back home in a rental car, my insurance assessed the car and paid off the remainder of the loan and gave me the remaining balance. Tonight, I bought the current year replacement of my car within $300 of what I bought the first one for, and even after I pay registration I'll have lost less than $1600 and got a boo-boo on my hand. That car saved my life, and my insurance, dealer, and car manufacturer just won customers for life. But most importantly, I'm OK. In pretty much every way possible, I am OK.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/4bvhxv/i_totaled_my_brand_new_car_and_everything_worked/", "title": "I totaled my brand new car and everything worked out fine.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TheKronk", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 30, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1458886528, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/4bvhxv/i_totaled_my_brand_new_car_and_everything_worked/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438958.133268, "replies_charged": false}
