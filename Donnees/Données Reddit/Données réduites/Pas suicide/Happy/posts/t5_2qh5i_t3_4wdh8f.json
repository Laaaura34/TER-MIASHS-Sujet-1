Later that day I got an email that I had triggered my \"high balance alert\" on my card. I was worried and immediately checked to see what happened. Turns out, I had that card set to warn me if I had a balance over $200. Probably haven't used it for anything significant in 4 years.\n\nIt was my primary card during school and I was dirt poor. I'm now doing financially well by my standards. The memories of having to be so careful with money and watching every penny hit me like a ton of bricks. Going to a movie and red robin once a week was a luxury. I'm so grateful for all I have now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/4wdh8f/i_got_a_credit_card_high_balance_alert/", "title": "I got a credit card high balance alert", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "w4lter", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 114, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1470442476, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/4wdh8f/i_got_a_credit_card_high_balance_alert/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438938.8766563, "replies_charged": false}
