He then underwent chemo treatments for about a year. The treatments were pretty effective against the cancer but it wasn't enough to fully eradicate the tumor on his neck. Fortunately, the doctors recommended radiation therapy which wiped out the remaining of it. In July 2017, we received the best possible news - that he was in remission and officially a non-hodgekins survivor! \nI knew my dad was supposed to have two CT scans this month to see if he was still in remission. For months, I had been dreading these tests. For the record, the chances of his type of cancer coming back are 60% which is quite frightening. \nAfter a week of waiting, we received the results last night and they came back clear showing that he is still in remission! I feel as though I am the luckiest daughter in the world. Wanted to share this news with you guys...\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/7dq6w2/my_dad_is_still_in_remission/", "title": "My dad is still in remission", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "kayme45", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1510974275, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7dq6w2/my_dad_is_still_in_remission/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440880.479796, "replies_charged": false}
