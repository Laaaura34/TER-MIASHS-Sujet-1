AM. OVER. THE. MOON. \n\n[Here's the situation, if you didn't see the first post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ox6bzs/im_probably_getting_back_together_with_my_old/)\n\nALRIGHT, so a few nights ago, I invited my old girlfriend from middle school to come over to my place and watch movies. We\u2019ve been hanging out for the last few months, getting to know each-other again, and I\u2019m so, so happy. I\u2019ve been considering seeing if she wanted to start dating again for months, and I finally decided that I was just going to do it and see what happened. I have a friend who I got to do some \\~recon\\~ for me, and he was 100% sure that she was just waiting for me to make a move, so I wasn\u2019t nervous about her saying no or anything. I was just hesitating because getting into a relationship with someone you really like is nerve-wracking, and also probably because I\u2019ve got some horrible problems with intimacy. Dab.\n\nANYWAY. My roommate was home, so we spent some time playing board games together, which was awesome. But after a bit I texted her like, \u201cHey, need to hang out with this lady alone for a bit please let me have the living room.\u201d And so she did. And it was just her and me. I made dinner, which was awful because I\u2019m not a great cook and I meant for us to go out to eat somewhere, but we both bike places, so that wasn\u2019t realistic. So we had a meal of very salty stir fry which she somehow managed to eat without complaining one time.\n\nWhile we were eating, we put on a movie. We started the night on opposite sides of the couch, but I (being the subtle and suave woman of the world that I am) got just a little bit closer to her every time I got up to refill my water (which was a lot). Until eventually she called me out and said that I could just sit next to her if I wanted. Which I did. So I did. And I sort of nestled into the crook of her arm, and she put her arm around me, and I rested my head against her shoulder. Gonna be honest, folks, coulda cried. It\u2019s the most *right* I\u2019ve felt in years. Probably the most right I\u2019ve felt in, oh, something like eight years and three months since she moved away the first time. It was like putting on glasses for the first time when you didn\u2019t know how bad your eyesight had gotten. I didn\u2019t realize how much happiness I hadn\u2019t been feeling. Just being close to her like that again was such a rush. But a weirdly calm rush? Like after you\u2019ve been running for a long time and you finally get to flop down in the grass somewhere. I felt so much stress that I\u2019d been holding on for *years* just melt. Gone. \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t even worry about what I was doing or if I was going too fast or if I looked stupid or anything like that. I didn\u2019t worry about her thinking it was weird that my hand was on her stomach. Or if I was being too affectionate. I was able to just stop thinking and enjoy the moment. Feeling her breathing. How soft her shirt was. How *great* it felt to have someone hold me for the first time in ages. And I was so relaxed and so content that the words just slipped out. \u201cWe should go out again.\u201d Didn\u2019t fret about how I was going to phrase it or what she would think or how it would affect our friendship. Just said it. And she didn\u2019t say yes. She fucking *kissed me*. She put her hand on my cheek and leaned down and put her lips on my lips and she *kissed me*. I wish I could say it was my first kiss, because the other ones were really regrettable, but it was my first kiss with her. I remember how often I would stress about wanting to kiss her when we were alone together. Drawing comics in my room, or watching TV, or doing homework or whatever, and I never did it. And I *always* regretted not doing it.  And now we\u2019ve done it, and it was beautiful and fantastic and I\u2019m gonna scream.\n\nI can\u2019t stop thinking about her. I\u2019m smiling all the time. My friends don\u2019t recognize me when I\u2019m not miserable! Every little thing about her just makes me grin like a loon. She called me by the silly pet name that she had for me in middle school. I didn\u2019t know how much I missed that. And she held my hand. She kissed me at the door. AHHH. We get to hold hands in public and I can introduce her to people as my partner and we don\u2019t have to hide that we\u2019re dating anymore because we\u2019re adults and who cares what anyone thinks! I don\u2019t remember the last time I was *giddy* like this!\n\nAnd, of course, I\u2019m also terrified! Because I\u2019ve spent a long time in therapy trying to learn how to be vulnerable with people and silence my brain when it says that my best friends are going to get shipped off to Mexico at any moment, so getting close to people is dangerous. And I\u2019ve been trying to learn how to develop feelings for other people, since I obviously couldn\u2019t have a relationship with her because she was in Yucatan for all I knew. It feels regressive to date her again when I\u2019ve made so much progress trying to get over losing her. And I worry that I\u2019m romanticizing her. I don\u2019t think I am (at least not too badly), but there\u2019s always the voice in the back of my head telling me that I only love this person because she used to be my middle school girlfriend. We\u2019re both totally different people now, and I\u2019m worried that my brain is just settling into this relationship because I want those eight years back with the girl I knew. And I want her parents to like me! I mean, they *do* like me, but I want them to like me as her girlfriend. I want them to approve of me as a partner. Apparently she\u2019s out to her dad, which surprises me a little, but he always seemed like he might be cool. Her mom still doesn\u2019t know. She\u2019s very religious, but my girlfriend (AHHHH) says that she\u2019s trying to get better about LGBT+ stuff since Pope Francis is cool with it, so maybe there\u2019s a chance? \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m dying over here.
