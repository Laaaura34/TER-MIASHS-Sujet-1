I'm usually a customer, but they needed help and asked me. Of course, I said yes. It's my \"Cheers\" bar, and I'm there quite a bit, but usually just for happy hour. Working the door required me to be there much later than normal, so it wasn't my usual crowd. It was slow, so I got cut early, and stayed to have a beer before I went home. I was sitting at the bar, talking to the bartender, who is a friend, and a girl walked up and told me I was beautiful. I carded her and her boyfriend about an hour before. She said she thought I was beautiful the second I carded her. I'm straight and have a boyfriend. She's straight and has a boyfriend, so I know she wasn't hitting on me.... but she made a point to tell me she thought I was beautiful. Now, I don't think I'm ugly, but I absolutely don't think I'm beautiful. This complete stranger's compliment made my year, and I doubt she'll remember it tomorrow. I don't even know her name, but, because of her, I'm going to make a point to actually give strangers the compliments I usually just think about. It's the simplest things that can truly make a difference.\nPS-Sorry this post is so long. \ud83d\ude0a", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/9c176r/just_a_few_simple_words_made_me_feel_so_special/", "title": "Just a few simple words made me feel so special tonight.
