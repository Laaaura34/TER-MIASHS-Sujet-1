We spent 87 days on the road, 5 of us, camping every night. Except 1, July 20, 1969. We got a motel room that night! All so that we could watch the moon landing! I still remember that night, and am so happy today to be celebrating the 50th anniversary of the occasion!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/cfmw37/so_happy_to_have_witnessed_the_moon_landing_50/", "title": "So happy to have witnessed the moon landing, 50 years ago today!!!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Dojustly", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 24, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1563635770, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cfmw37/so_happy_to_have_witnessed_the_moon_landing_50/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440709.9958217, "replies_charged": false}
