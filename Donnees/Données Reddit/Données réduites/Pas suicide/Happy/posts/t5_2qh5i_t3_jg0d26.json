I worked really hard on my paper and I was super nervous about turning it in. I was almost positive it was going to be a C or something. I\u2019ve never used APA format before so I was scared my formatting was all wrong, and I\u2019m super bad at grammar because they never taught it to me in high school, except periods and commas. But I only had ONE grammatical issue and the rest was awesome!
