I like it because of the cold weather, and the smiles the elderly give me. I also am able to give a good six feet to walk around anyone. \n\nToday I was enjoying my tunes on my new earbuds. My first new thing I have bought myself in years (mom). I love them.\n\nWell on this wall a man with a larger bulldog tries to approach me. I have a pug and a puggle. 2 small dogs. He was using his size and the size of his dog to cross my 6 foot boundary. He then starts to talk to me without a mask on. I am obviously uncomfortable so I back up and dial my SO. (A trick I learned to politely end a conversation with someone being overly aggressive). The minute the guy heard his voice he backed off and left. But not before I knocked out my earbud.  This made me break down in tears. I just wanted to walk my dog.  \n\nI was frantic looking for it as my SO pulled up to pick me up. It was white though and everything was white. After an hour, even when he soon joined me, I could not find my precious gift to myself, that silly wireless earbud. \n\nI was inconsolable. So he has driven me down to the store and is getting me a replacement. He doesn\u2019t make much so this is a huge gift. My Prince Charming. \n\n\nHappy ending.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/lovb63/my_husband_proved_to_me_today_that_its_the_small/", "title": "My husband proved to me today that it\u2019s the small things that keep our love alive", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LongNectarine3", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 183, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613907148, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/lovb63/my_husband_proved_to_me_today_that_its_the_small/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439375.4507477, "replies_charged": false}
