Hundreds of applicantions filled and hundreds of resumes sent off, but for months I've heard nothing back. It's been a real blow to my self-esteem, especially since my career was at such a high before Covid began. But tonight I finally got a call from a hugely respected event company who were eager to schedule an interview with me, first thing in the morning. After so much silence and rejection, I'm just so happy to finally get a shot at restarting things for myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/lzflsr/finally_have_a_job_interview_tomorrow_after/", "title": "Finally have a job interview tomorrow after months of rejection/silence", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ohheyhihellothere25", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 33, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615078705, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/lzflsr/finally_have_a_job_interview_tomorrow_after/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441858.5555923, "replies_charged": false}
