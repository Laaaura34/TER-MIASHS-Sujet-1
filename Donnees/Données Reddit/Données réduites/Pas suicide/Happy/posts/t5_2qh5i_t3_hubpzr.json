She works 50+ hours a week, comes home, is a great mother to our kids, and a loving wife. \n\n   Recently, she found her self feeling overwhelmed and kinda depressed with everything going on in the world and being over worked. (We both work in healthcare and have been working nonstop throughout the pandemic)\n\n   I suggested a hobby. Seeing how she has always loved makeup, I thought she should start an Instagram page about her makeup. \n \n  She did and has slowly started posting pictures to it. She\u2019s really enjoying herself! I was her only follower for about 6 months. Recently she gained 13 followers. She was so excited, and happy about that small gain. It was adorable!! \n\nSo I\u2019m here to ask you all for a favor. I love seeing my wife happy, and I would love for her to gain some more followers on her little makeup page. She deserves all the happiness in the world, and if showing off makeup makes her happy, so be it!! \n\nHer IG is @colormeaddicted\n\nPlease and thank you all! We are all in a weird time in life. I know that we could all use a pick me up. \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffd\u2764\ufe0f", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/hubpzr/pandemic_blues_wife_has_a_new_hobby_and_i_need/", "title": "Pandemic blues!
