I\u2019m graduating with a BS in Molecular and Cellular Biology while minoring in Marine Bio, and while I don\u2019t fully know what lies ahead, I\u2019m excited to continue to learn and find out. I\u2019m just proud of myself for managing to push through the tougher times of college when I seriously considered dropping out to now (hopefully) finding a job in a field I really enjoy (well... not yet but I\u2019ll keep sending out applications and hoping for the best. If anyone\u2019s hiring lmk... pretty please :) ).
