Eight years ago I moved to the suburbs, and it made the issue of getting a driver\u2019s license and owning a car a very urgent matter, but being divorced and having the custody of my son made it difficult to get the money and time to do it. But I finally was able to pass the test yesterday! (First try!) Even with this complicated situation, I was able to get my license. And on top of it all, I was able to buy the car I was dreaming with! I\u2019m just so happy I still can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m now dreaming about going places with my son, going on vacations with the car... It\u2019s pure bliss, and I wanted to share it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/i5jgwg/at_47_i_finally_got_a_drivers_license_and_the_car/", "title": "At 47, I finally got a driver\u2019s license, and the car I was dreaming with.
