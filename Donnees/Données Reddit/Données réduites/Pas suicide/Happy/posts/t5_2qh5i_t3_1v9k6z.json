Starting last week (around Wednesday) one of my decisions was to start walking and I've managed to walk every day since then. I don't really know how far I'm going on these walks (I'm estimating about 2 miles), I just know that I'm walking. Honestly, it feels great. Granted, when I start out my body isn't wanting to cooperate, but by the time I reach the longest part of the walk, my body is pumped and ready. \n\nI do have plans to eventually start running, but that'll be a little ways off. For now, the walks are good and I shut off my phone and just listen to music when I walk. Granted, I know that I'm not as far along as some of you... but I'm proud of where I am and honestly.. I just wanted to share.\n\nThanks for reading.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1v9k6z/promised_myself_i_wouldnt_do_this_until_next_week/", "title": "Promised myself I wouldn't do this until next week, but...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "endlessmonkeys", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 270, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1389778691, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1v9k6z/promised_myself_i_wouldnt_do_this_until_next_week/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441317.3287756, "replies_charged": false}
