I\u2019m 20 yrs old and I never moved out of my parents house after high school and continued to live at home got college. For the past 8 mouths I\u2019ve been telling not only myself but my family and friends that I would be moving. I\u2019m so fortunate to have all of their support and love. My loving and so generous grandmother bought me a new car and will be paying my rent for the next few months. I got so lucky with the house I\u2019m living in. I have the best roommates and live in the best area. I\u2019ve been spending the past few days with my best friend. She\u2019s been helping me unpack and settle in. There isn\u2019t really a point to this post but so many changes happened so fast in my life and I\u2019m still trying to comprehend it. I\u2019m so happy. I\u2019m overwhelmed with how happy I am and how happy I will be. Now that I am here and ready to start this new journey in my life, all I can say is, you attract what you want in life. I wanted this so bad, I told myself constantly how much I wanted this and the universe made it happened. Trust the process. Work hard. Stay true to yourself. Live life.
