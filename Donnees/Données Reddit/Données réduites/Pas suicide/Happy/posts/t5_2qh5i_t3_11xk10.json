I am super excited as it is my first time traveling for pleasure and I'm 26 years old, I have worked almost everyday since high school and was in the military for 3 years. I hope it will give me insight to how people live in another part of the world and give me an idea where I want my life to go. Ultimately this is a good way to see if I even like traveling!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/11xk10/going_on_my_first_holiday/", "title": "Going on my first holiday!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "EKcore", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1350970132, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/11xk10/going_on_my_first_holiday/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442257.307602, "replies_charged": false}
