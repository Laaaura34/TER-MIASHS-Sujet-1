I don't overthink everything as much as I did before.\n\nThat has brought me so much joy in the shape of new friends, new experiences and more emotional stability.\n\nAnd also, I'm starting to be more positive and accepting of my body. I hadn't been in a bikini in the last 4 years or so because I was ashamed and really self-conscious but this summer I'm away from home doing a course abroad and I've made many friends and gone to the beach and I'm just so happy about my current situation that I wanted to share it.\n\nSometimes, getting out of your comfort zone can really pay off :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/cn1ag9/i_got_out_of_my_comfort_zone_and_now_i_have_more/", "title": "I got out of my comfort zone and now I have more friends, great experiences and higher self-esteem levels.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "cleveraway", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1565153021, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cn1ag9/i_got_out_of_my_comfort_zone_and_now_i_have_more/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439606.2187984, "replies_charged": false}
