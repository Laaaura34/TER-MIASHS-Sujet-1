They couldn\u2019t get the switch to connect to the TV and he came to me for some help.  I went about troubleshooting and hear him tell his friend quietly, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, my second dad is going to fix it.\u201d\n\nHe calls me dad by mistake frequently and corrects himself and has for the 4 years I\u2019ve been in his life.  He calls me by name otherwise.  He has a dad and I don\u2019t want to impose on that.  I\u2019m flattered by the mix up and try to make sure he doesn\u2019t feel weird about it when it happens.\n\nI have two older kids.  I have been called dad countless times for over a decade now. Not to say it isn\u2019t everything to me, but if you\u2019d asked me if I was in some way waiting for him to call me dad on purpose I\u2019d have thought that was absurd.\n\nI froze when I heard it, but it only took me a second to compose myself. I went about fixing the TV and then explained how I figured out what was wrong and how it needs to be setup to work next time. They were good, picking between Luigi and Kirby last I heard.\n\nI made it all the way downstairs before things got real blurry and my heart wouldn\u2019t stop trying to run away. \n\nIt\u2019s been a privilege to earn the title a third time.  I think I am as proud of myself in this moment as I have ever been.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/nbs6x4/i_just_overheard_my_nonbiological_son_7_refer_to/", "title": "I just overheard my non-biological son (7) refer to me as his second dad for the first time, and it meant the world to me.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Elbobosan", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 545, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1620942093, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/nbs6x4/i_just_overheard_my_nonbiological_son_7_refer_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442435.8899903, "replies_charged": false}
