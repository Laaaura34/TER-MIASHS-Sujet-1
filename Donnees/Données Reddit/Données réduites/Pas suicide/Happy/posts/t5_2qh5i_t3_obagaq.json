I had to grow a lot and learn to respect myself which wasn't easy at all, but it was worth it. Now I have a boyfriend who:\n\n* once drove 5.5 hours just to spend a weekend with me\n* has a goal to make me laugh every day\n* asked me to write out my family tree so he could memorize everyone's names/facts because he knew how much family means to me\n* Is the epitome of a healthy, gentle, stable relationship\n\nEver since I was 12 (I'll be 23 on Sunday), I never felt like I'd find someone who would love me so much. Idk I'm just happy that I found my favorite person and wanted to share that.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/obagaq/im_in_a_meaningfulhealthy_relationship_for_the/", "title": "I'm in a meaningful/healthy relationship for the first time", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "emmabean74", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 27, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625099892, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/obagaq/im_in_a_meaningfulhealthy_relationship_for_the/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440575.9429483, "replies_charged": false}
