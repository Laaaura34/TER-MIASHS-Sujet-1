It looked like a hillbilly, motorcycle simulator that takes place in the woods.  And I thought that the zombies just looked like bald headed, redneck cannibals.  But I played it for a while, and I really like it.  The visuals are stunning.  The missions and story seem good.  I don't know if the other areas are boring or not, but I had fun taking my time killing a bunch of zombies at Crazy Willie's using a combination of stealth, molotovs, a pistol (with a suppressor), a shotgun, and melee.  I don't know if the game has any replay value or not, but I hope that it does.  I don't want to play the game over and over again, from beginning to end, on increasing difficulty.  I just want to play the game a second time on Normal mode, and have that game last indefinitely.  Only time will tell if I can do that or not, but at least I will get one good playthrough out of this.  I think that I enjoy Days Gone way more than Dying Light and DayZ.  I own one or two dozen or zombie games, and I don't enjoy them that much.  And I always browse zombie games on Steam and none of them interest me.  So it was good to finally find a new zombie game that I enjoy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ng8fpy/i_had_fun_playing_a_game_that_will_hopefully_cure/", "title": "I had fun playing a game that will hopefully cure my boredom, depression, and lonliness.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "idgas01", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1621437135, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ng8fpy/i_had_fun_playing_a_game_that_will_hopefully_cure/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441029.6667473, "replies_charged": false}
