My mind isnt fully healed for sure, i still have a long way to become what I truly want to become. I started doing everything I had set back , I am doing my drivers, im doing my computer course, im travelling in the nezt months, and im already applying for jobs, I am focusing on myself and  I am so proud of me. \nThese may sound like things that are normal for someone to do or to have but they arent for me. For so long i was avoiding my mental issues and I havent been happier for going to therapy, I was so scared at first, but my therapist opened my eyes to so many things. I am truly grateful. We are the boss of our mind and when we learn to control it, we are unstoppable.
