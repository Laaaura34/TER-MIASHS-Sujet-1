However, when I got back, I got together the necessary documents and sent them to my travel-insurance. They didn't even get back to me. No letter, no questions nothing. They just transfered the money to my acount. \n\nI know that's what an insurance company is suposed to do, but I guess sometimes, the gift of happyness lies in recognizing things that make you happy even when they're ordinary, and not just take them for granted. \n\nSo yay for the extra-money!!!!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ax6ia/my_insurance_just_paid_for_everything_i_asked/", "title": "My insurance just paid for everything I asked them to pay for.
