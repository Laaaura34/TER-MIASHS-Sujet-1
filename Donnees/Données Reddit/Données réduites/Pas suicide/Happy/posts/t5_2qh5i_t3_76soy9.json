I just turned 21 and have been working 7 am to 6 pm (longer than just about every other employee) for months and a couple of weeks ago I got a raise and a promotion. Its been a trail by fire, going from a very green CNA to a safety director, but it has been so rewarding. But the real reason I am here is I am finally taking some time off for myself. I had some family issues last thanksgiving so I am flying to Canada to visit a really good friend of mine who I haven't seen in a year (many many bad reasons as to why). If this seems ramblely I'm sorry in advance but this is probably the happiest point in my life so far.
