I really genuinely feel regret for how well things are going for me. That being said, I still can't not feel ecstatic that I'm about to become a homeowner while just recently figuring out my wife is pregnant. I don't want her to know I'm typing this happy rant frantically (she's about to come in from the other room).\n\nI really just don't know who to celebrate this happy news with. I told one of my guy friends, and as much as I love him, he was a typical dude and didn't have a lot to say. I just feel like I need to yell to the heavens how happy I am.\n\nIf one person reads this and smiles 1% I'll feel like my need to share this news, that's defining a significant part of my life, is sane!\n\nAlso, on the off chance you're reading this and your life feels kinda shitty (for whatever reason)... I've been there. Life really does suck sometimes. I'm here to tell you it DEFINITELY (spelling?) gets better.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/goadmh/im_about_to_be_a_homeowner_and_my_wife_and_i_are/", "title": "I'm about to be a homeowner and my wife and I are expecting!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tree_thoughts", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 30, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1590112823, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/goadmh/im_about_to_be_a_homeowner_and_my_wife_and_i_are/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441439.1955595, "replies_charged": false}
