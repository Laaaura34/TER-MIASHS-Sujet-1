Did my morning routine in perfect bliss, got a dog walk in, no stress and used a new soap I had made (tea tree oil and charcoal!).\n\nThen my partner finished work early and we went to IKEA, bought a tonne of stuff on sale for our new flat and got an amazing deal. We picked up a couple of pizzas and beers on the way back to the flat and had an amazing time building flatpacks with drinks and food. I've never been so contented with my life before.\n\nIt sounds really simple, just a pleasant day, but it was one of those moments I have imagined all my life, being in a happy and loving relationship with my best friend and building furniture for our new place together with music banter and a takeaway. \n\nWhen was the last time you felt like life just kind of clicked into place, even if for only a moment?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/iicyci/i_had_the_best_day_of_my_life_this_week_and_im_so/", "title": "I had the best day of my life this week and I'm so excited.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "_Athulu", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1598640514, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/iicyci/i_had_the_best_day_of_my_life_this_week_and_im_so/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439195.6041725, "replies_charged": false}
