Tiring but it's been great! =) \n\nI got my first job as a bus aid, my bus has only one child on it who goes to a special education school about a hour and a half away. My job: sit there.. That's it. I get paid $7.65 per hour to ride a bus 6 hours each day. It's SO EASY and in liking it :) except for all the freaking traffic lol\n\nOn top of that I've been talking to this girl and stopped by for a bit between my morning and afternoon run, stole a kiss on the cheek and she didn't want me to leave =) and now I have a date to the movies tomorrow night. \n\nHad a good day today and so far this summer is great.. Can't wait until I start my first year of college soon =) I'm happy!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1ij7m2/got_an_incredibly_easy_job_and_a_date_tomorrow/", "title": "Got an incredibly easy job and a date tomorrow night!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MisterNikky", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 19, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1374115960, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1ij7m2/got_an_incredibly_easy_job_and_a_date_tomorrow/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440611.0639174, "replies_charged": false}
