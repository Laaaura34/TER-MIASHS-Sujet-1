It was terrible, I was a mess and stressed out, it was my first accident and I'm nearly 30. This was not part of the plan that was laid out (pay off that car, get a newer one, etc etc)... This past Friday we got word that the insurance company is going to total the car. A lot of damage was apparently done at 20MPH.\n\nFor the entire time my parents have known each other, my mother has always wanted a Lincoln. Not sure why, but she has. And because we were in the market for a new car, she went looking at Lincolns.\n\nThis morning she purchased her new Lincoln and I couldn't be happier for her. She finally has something she's wanted for (at least) 32 years.\n\nLike I said, it's the little things.\n\nNow I need to go chill a bottle of wine to celebrate.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/8g3hfk/wrecked_a_car_got_a_new_one_fulfilled_a_32_year/", "title": "Wrecked a Car, got a new one, fulfilled a 32 year long dream", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "coffeenglasses", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1525126966, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8g3hfk/wrecked_a_car_got_a_new_one_fulfilled_a_32_year/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440964.0527644, "replies_charged": false}
