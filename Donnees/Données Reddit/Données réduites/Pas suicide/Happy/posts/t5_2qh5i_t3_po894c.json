I was having a lot of pill issues, I was depressed and I had nobody to talk to. I tried posting something on Reddit and got beat in the comments for only being 14. I ended up taking 35 Excedrin, which you can't have more than 2 in 24 hours. So, I overdosed. I ended up not sleeping well and threw up. The next day, I decided I was gonna quit for good, not for myself, but for my friends, who were very worried. And I ended up making a post later that night on I believe r/friends and I met 3 people in particular. One of them told me I was just like him when he was younger, another said I was just like her boyfriend. On top of that, she made my favorite Kanye cover art for an album, not a huge fan of him, but regardless it was amazing. And another one, all we did was talk about music, it was amazing. It just really helped me, I met someone who worked with a celebrity and I didn't feel alone. Then the next day I called my stepsisters, I told them the news about my pill addiction and they were really proud that I'm trying. And now, today, I'm 4 days free of pills. Not much, but it's a start!\n\nEdit: I made it 2+ weeks now!
