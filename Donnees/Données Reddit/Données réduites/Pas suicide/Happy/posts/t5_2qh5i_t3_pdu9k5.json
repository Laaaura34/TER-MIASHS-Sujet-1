I've dealt with depression for so long I can't even remember what it feels to naturally be happy. I also seem to always have negative thoughts and thinking super down about myself and things around me. I really could use help and guidance in terms of things to watch, read or do to at least get me on track. \n\nI was on effexor for 2 years, but wanted to get off due to some of the side effects and once I finally got off after lower each dose I thought I was going to start feeling better which seems to be the opposite. I don't know if the right thing to do is go back on medicine (specifically an antidepressant) but I really need advice and help :(", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/pdu9k5/would_really_appreciate_some_help_getting_back_on/", "title": "Would really appreciate some help getting back on track and finding happiness", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DekeaSaurusRex", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630239696, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/pdu9k5/would_really_appreciate_some_help_getting_back_on/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441347.7699883, "replies_charged": false}
