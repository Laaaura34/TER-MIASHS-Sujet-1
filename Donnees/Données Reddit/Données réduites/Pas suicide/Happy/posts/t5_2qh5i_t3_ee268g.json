I\u2019m in a different city, and won\u2019t be able to make it back home for the New Year. Last night, a couple of us in my dorm all gathered in the common area with a guitar and sung Christmas carols. It was honestly so much fun. We\u2019re not great singers except for maybe 2 or 3 of us, but I felt so alive and felt like I belonged there. I\u2019ve been feeling pretty lonely for a while and yesterday really made me feel like I\u2019m in the right place for now. \n\nTo whoever may be reading this: you\u2019re not along. Maybe you feel like it, but from one internet stranger to the other: I hope you have a wonderful Christmas and a very happy new year. We\u2019re all gonna find the place where we belong. I hope you have a great day. \ud83c\udf84", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ee268g/its_going_to_be_my_first_christmas_away_from_home/", "title": "It\u2019s going to be my first Christmas away from home and last night was the best I had in years", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "abottledstar", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1576999633, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ee268g/its_going_to_be_my_first_christmas_away_from_home/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440701.182817, "replies_charged": false}
