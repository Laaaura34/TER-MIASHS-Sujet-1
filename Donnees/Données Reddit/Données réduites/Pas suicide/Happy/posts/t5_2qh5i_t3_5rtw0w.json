It also broke his arm in two places.  The doctors at the time said that he would likely never walk or even eat solid foods on his own.  Now, two years later, he is taking 95% of his food solid and I just received a video of him walking all by himself.  He will still be developmentally behind his whole life but has proven that hope is not a stupid thing.  Thank you for letting me share this.  It's such a big deal.\n\nEdit:. Thank you for all your encouraging messages.  We are currently in the middle of the court battle.  It's been a long, frustrating, tiring mess.  These big developments have been much needed in the middle of the court case.  My nephew suffered from severe brain damage due to the daycare provider shaking him.  This has slowed down all motor skills as well.  He's come so far in the last two years... Further than what anybody was expecting.  Thank you again for your interest and concern.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/5rtw0w/my_special_needs_nephew_is_walking_by_himself/", "title": "My special needs nephew is walking by himself.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ControlTheSpice", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 554, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1486128230, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/5rtw0w/my_special_needs_nephew_is_walking_by_himself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442876.4487426, "replies_charged": false}
