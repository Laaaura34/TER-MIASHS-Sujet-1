While still a concern it is very treatable.  Anyway, today is the first day that I am not looking at the pictures of us on the wall and getting sad, i've gone back to looking at them and smiling.   Plus I got a few things done today and last night with her help that were pending and annoying but done now and that in itself was huge.\n\nThen my day gets better...I found out this afternoon that my contract job was being extended for a couple of months.  It was going to end in January so that was playing on my mind.    \n\nI can now look forward to my first holiday season as a married man with more ease and delight and joy!   I'm back on track!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/7hthuj/back_on_track/", "title": "back on track", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "torontomammasboy", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1512513835, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7hthuj/back_on_track/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440225.735741, "replies_charged": false}
