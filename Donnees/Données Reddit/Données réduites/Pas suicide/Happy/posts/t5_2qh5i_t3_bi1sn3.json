Lol) he said he could just read it really fast and so I tell him \u201cOkay, as fast as you can!\u201d He sounded like a sped up cassette tape! After he finished I told him it was amazing. I was laughing the entire time. I\u2019m having a spectacularly shitty day and that really brightened up my mood. Just wanted to share. It feels good to have a good time with other humans. :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/bi1sn3/had_a_blast_on_a_phone_call_with_those_election/", "title": "Had a blast on a phone call with those election survey people", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "wally_westt", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1556388399, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/bi1sn3/had_a_blast_on_a_phone_call_with_those_election/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440762.4142299, "replies_charged": false}
