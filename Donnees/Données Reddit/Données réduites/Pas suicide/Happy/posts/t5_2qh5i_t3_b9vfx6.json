You wanna discuss\n..but guess what\n..too late... Your 'friends' are no another axis\n..who's gonna listen to you complain \n...who's gonna take a time in their day to think about you\n...\nNo-one\n...because now.. You are on your own axis\n...no-one is making time for you\n...because reality won't get you instagram likes \n....party invites\n....a social circle\n...then you got the people tilt give you generic responses and don't actually think about you.. They think about themselves... They tell you things that they think will make them sound empathetic\n\n...like a psychiatrist... Or that friend\n\n....someone and most teenagers and under 30s  are all going to end up becoming very depressed \n....ATM most anti social people who realise these observations... Don't vocalise it..
