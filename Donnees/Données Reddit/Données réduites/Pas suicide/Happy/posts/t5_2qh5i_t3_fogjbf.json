Issues with depression, self harm, and suicidal tendencies, idealization, and attempts. But I survived. I got the right meds, met the right people. I\u2019ve been happy for a long time now. A bit lonely at times, but I know I have people who are there for me. I even moved out, albeit a few years later than some (26) but that made me even happy. Parents home is just too loud, angry, and messy. I have my own place, and with a friend/coworker who cares about me so much. \n\nAnd you know what? For the first time in six years, that person, my friend/coworker/roommate kissed me and told me she was scared to move in with me because she\u2019d fall in love with me, but it\u2019s too late for that now. Y\u2019all, that was the best feeling ever. Actually feeling wanted in a romantic sense? That pushed me over the edge and I\u2019m fucking ecstatic, I\u2019m giddy. Hell, that night my legs were jelly and quivering so bad I thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to walk. And it made me realize just how happy I am with life again.\n\nToday, I got to thinking about everything. Everything that\u2019s happened, and everything that\u2019s going on in life. It\u2019s not just because of the kiss and what she said, I have true friends and family that will always be by my side, I can look in the mirror and be happy, I can smile at myself and think \u201ctoday\u2019s going to be a great day.\u201d \n\nIt took a long time to get here. I\u2019ve had multiple hospitalizations, I have scars that might not ever fully heal, but I\u2019m okay with that. I\u2019ve had a lot of medication changes, and a couple different group therapy things. Heck, my psychiatrist even said I can call his office if anything is wrong and they\u2019ll get me into contact with him right away. \n\nI\u2019m happy.
