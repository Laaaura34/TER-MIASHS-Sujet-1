Today we set a target of him doing 10 pedals without me holding the saddle to balance him. I could feel that he seemed to have his balance, so I let go and started counting to 10. Once he realised he really was doing it by himself, he had this ridiculous grin plastered on his face, and he pedalled off so fast I couldn't keep up. Grandma was out in front of him to catch the whole thing on video, which he has been showing EVERYONE. \n\nHe then immediately hit an S bend in the path, and I was *so sure* he was going to go arse over head, but he just gently leaned into the corners and came out the other side laughing his head off.\n\nSeeing his complete joy at finally learning how to ride his own bike was the most uplifting thing. We then had to do a tour of the local estate so that he could go see Papa and then Daddy and show them how he could ride his bike on his own. It's been a beautiful day :) ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/70qm1w/today_i_taught_my_youngest_nephew_to_ride_a_bike/", "title": "Today I taught my youngest nephew to ride a bike without stabilisers!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "amandycat", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1505685787, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/70qm1w/today_i_taught_my_youngest_nephew_to_ride_a_bike/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438960.7940574, "replies_charged": false}
