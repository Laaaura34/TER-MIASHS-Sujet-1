My mother was abusive and kept me from seeing the rest of my family and I don't get along with the majority of my family except my dad, my half-sister and her kids, who I adore and get along really well with. I don't get to see them often though because my dad works nights, I'm in college full time and my sister lives a few towns over.  Yesterday my sister let me do her makeup for the first time (I'm girly and do makeup pretty well and she's always been a tomboy but decided to switch things up for a change) which was a surprise because she has two other girly sisters that she sees more often but decided to come to me.  today we all went to dinner and just hung out. I never realised how much I yearned for a positive and real relationship with my family until today and now we have decided to all make effort to see each other more. \n\nTl;dr: I felt like I had a real loving family for the first time today it was pretty swell", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/7ka9t1/i_got_to_hang_out_with_some_of_my_family_recently/", "title": "I got to hang out with some of my family recently.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "FlightSatellite23", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1513465848, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7ka9t1/i_got_to_hang_out_with_some_of_my_family_recently/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440721.2498863, "replies_charged": false}
