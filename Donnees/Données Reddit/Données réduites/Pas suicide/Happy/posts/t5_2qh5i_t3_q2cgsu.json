As someone who has literally never had a girlfriend, I am so excited right now and can't wait to see her more!\n\nI know I have to keep my expectations in check, and realize this is still just the early stages, but such a big step for me nonetheless! :D", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/q2cgsu/first_time_a_girl_ever_agreed_to_a_second_date/", "title": "First time a girl ever agreed to a second date!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "shades_3", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 51, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633492070, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/q2cgsu/first_time_a_girl_ever_agreed_to_a_second_date/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441025.2985282, "replies_charged": false}
