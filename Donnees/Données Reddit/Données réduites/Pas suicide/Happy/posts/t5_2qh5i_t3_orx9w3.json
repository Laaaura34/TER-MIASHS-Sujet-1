From the start to the end of my schooling I went to about eight schools so I was never there for too long. I always knew that going to a new school I would have fun and enjoy my time there, but in the back of my mind I had to remember that the people I know now may not always be there.\n\nI\u2019m finally at a place where I have a good handful of close friends and I never thought I\u2019d be there, its nice knowing that there is someone there just a message away and wanting to listen and have a chat.\n\nJust a little win and wanted to share :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/orx9w3/feeling_happy_to_have_some_close_friends/", "title": "Feeling happy to have some close friends", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "artificialquantumIQ", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 15, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627300949, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/orx9w3/feeling_happy_to_have_some_close_friends/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441079.6865873, "replies_charged": false}
