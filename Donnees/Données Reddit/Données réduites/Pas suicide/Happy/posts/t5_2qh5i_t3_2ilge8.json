Why just T?I decided to make it a mental exercise to list five things for each letter of the alphabet. One letter per day. Feel free to join me!\n\n-------------\n\n**A**, 10/7/2014\n\n - Ambivert Status. While neither an introvert nor an extrovert, I get the best of both worlds, and I can feel charged and comfortable in almost any social situation.\n\n - Anthologies. Not only awesome to read, but I get to work on them a lot through my publishing services. Working on books is a pleasure, and reading them is fantastic\n\n - Academics. I'm an autodidact and love teaching myself, but having the opportunities to pursue education are things that not many people have.\n\n - Ambition. I am currently in a band, working three jobs. Love the feeling of seeing myself progress, and seeing new projects get done.\n\n - Awkward people. Let's face it. Sometimes, coming out of an awkward situation, you just have to laugh. Thankfully there are some people who bring forth these situations more often than others. You do you.
