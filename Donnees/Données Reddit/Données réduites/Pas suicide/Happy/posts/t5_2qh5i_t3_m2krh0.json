Once we got back I only let one teammate know what was going on and immediately we looked all through my room and my dorm then she suggested we take a walk because i mentioned placing my phone on the car and we thought it couldve flew off. We walked for like 5 minutes and my hopes were looking pretty dim and then she decided maybe its best we look back in the room and I agreed with her saying, \u201cYea I feel as though if it fell off the car we wouldve noticed and said something like, \u2018what was that?\u2019\u201d Then we both shared a look before our face broke out into disbelief and basically ran towards the direction when we originally said that and lucky me there was l my wallet and airpods (although they were broke) laying on the ground on the side of the rode but I was happy to take what I could get :) so it\u2019s a good day so far.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/m2krh0/i_know_this_probably_isnt_much_to_be_happy_about/", "title": "I know this probably isn\u2019t much to be happy about but my day is starting off amazing already bc", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Zyzizzy", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615448267, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/m2krh0/i_know_this_probably_isnt_much_to_be_happy_about/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442026.3215883, "replies_charged": false}
