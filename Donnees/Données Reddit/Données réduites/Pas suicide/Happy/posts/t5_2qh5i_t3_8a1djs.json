I just got the news from my wife.\n\nWhere to begin?\n\nI never thought I would meet someone who values science as much as I do.  Enter stage left my wife about ten years ago.\n\nThen for years we struggled to get pregnant, and then there she was,  my meaning for living.  Sagan. My daughter.\n\nI was always a proud dad of my wonderful baby girl and I quickly bragged about her all over reddit in every corner nook and cranny.\n\n/r/drama made fun of me and called her \"stem girl\".\n\nWell who is laughing now?\n\nThe wife and I believe a genius child may be born, but they can also be made.\n\nSagan has never had a demanding or rigorous education workload she in fact spends about 80% of her time running around playing with other kids.\n\nBut the education has always been there in everything that we do.\n\nIn fact, we are preparing to film a web series about her education and development but I am not here to plug that I am just here to brag and BE HAPPY!!\n\nWell Sagan just officially tested as a gifted child and they are recommending she be placed in a special learning environment.  \n\nI am one proud father.\n\nThis puts me in a good mood.  I hope all of you are having a nice day.\n\nThe moment after I hit submit on this I am gonna start an outline on my new book.\n\n\"The Correct Way To Parent.\"", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/8a1djs/my_daughter_sagan_just_tested_as_a_gifted_child/", "title": "My daughter Sagan just tested as a gifted child with an IQ above 130.
