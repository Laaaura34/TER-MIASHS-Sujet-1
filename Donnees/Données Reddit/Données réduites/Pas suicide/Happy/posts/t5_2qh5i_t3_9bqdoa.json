The trial lasted 4 years and the results were incredible. I went into pharmacological remission. In October 2017, the FDA approved the drug. \nBecause of my incredible results, the company that manufactures the medicine has asked me to be an Ambassador and travel the country, educating others suffering from the same disease who may be considering the same treatment.  I have never really been able to travel, and there will be opportunities to travel internationally as well. I am beyond thrilled to have been in the study, to still be getting the treatments and to have an opportunity to help others facing the uncertainty of rare disease and limited treatments  options. The idea of bringing hope to people is a level of happiness I never thought I could reach! \nThanks for letting me share!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/9bqdoa/i_was_in_a_drug_trial_that_was_successful_and_now/", "title": "I was in a drug trial that was successful, and now I get to go talk to patients and support groups and tell them about my journey with a rare disease!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "herecomesred411", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1535687897, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9bqdoa/i_was_in_a_drug_trial_that_was_successful_and_now/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442633.32926, "replies_charged": false}
