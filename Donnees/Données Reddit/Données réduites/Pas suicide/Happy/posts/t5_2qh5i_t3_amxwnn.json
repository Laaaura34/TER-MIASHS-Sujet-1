We call it \u201cSushi Wednesday\u201d, & I look forward to it every week!\n\nTips ONLY work if you use them! So **RIGHT NOW**, grab a pen & paper, & write down what you\u2019re excited for!\n\nIf you feel comfortable, you can also put the list in the comments to give others some ideas!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/amxwnn/how_to_cultivate_excitement_boost_happiness/", "title": "How To Cultivate Excitement & Boost Happiness", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "IsaiahTFitz", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1549253822, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/amxwnn/how_to_cultivate_excitement_boost_happiness/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442183.5736778, "replies_charged": false}
