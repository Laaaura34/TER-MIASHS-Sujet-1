But i laugh when I think about how I started as a \"floater \" at a preschool, then the cook, then an aid, then the lead teacher for the infant Tods. next job, I was an aid, somewhere got put in the masters class somehow became the supervisor. Current job, 3 yrs and im the boss bc no one else lives in this area. Sure i work long hard days too.. but I never really see that as a burden, more like just what I need to do. Note that thought doesnt include the days my depression kicks in and I dont have the mental power to work. Lol I just needed to talk about how blessed I feel right now. I like being the big fish in the little pond. I am terrified of the big pond meetings I need to join now lol", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/q886fy/i_realized_that_most_of_my_work_success_is/", "title": "I realized that most of my work success is usually due to me being at the right place, at the right time, and bc I speak spanish.
