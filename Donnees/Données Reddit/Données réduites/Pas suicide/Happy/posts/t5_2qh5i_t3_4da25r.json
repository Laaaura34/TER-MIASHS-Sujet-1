Recently broke up with a girl because were in two different places. Shes 28 and has two kids and im a 23 year old guy who waits tables. But we were still in love. So she reconnects with her husband and thats great for her family it's like the ideal situation. but it sucked for me. Anyway, I started a new job about a week ago at a restaurant and I just scored a date the most attractive girl there. Shes been in america for about 8 months. Shes from moldova and she speaks english russian and romanian. And she is breathtaking. Now. This will part the seas alittle im sure. But shes also 18. Which most dudes are like oh yeah!!! But i feel like its a little young.  Obviously i prefer to have someone my age or older. Its an amazing situation though and i just had to tell someone and its too late for my friends haha", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/4da25r/im_living_in_a_movie_right_now/", "title": "Im living in a movie right now.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "b1eberhole69", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1459754712, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/4da25r/im_living_in_a_movie_right_now/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441494.2845273, "replies_charged": false}
