As a teen, I have to listen to all sorts of different genres of music when I\u2019m in a car with friends.  Some songs are good and some are garbage, but that\u2019s besides the point.  My point is, I\u2019ve been trying the past couple of years to branch out to all sorts of genres of music with inspiration from my friends and family\u2019s tastes.  While I\u2019ve been on this search for awesome songs to listen to, I found out something amazing:  You can blend genres of music.  Now, I know most of you already know that you can combine different types of music, but like me, I don\u2019t think you understand the full extent of it.\n\nI\u2019m talking about COMPLETELY different genres, like jazz, punk, dubstep, rap, and even folk music can be combined to create some amazing tunes.  I\u2019m leaving 3 examples here, but there are countless other genres that I haven\u2019t discovered yet that I\u2019m sure are equally good.  If you have others to show then please leave a reply.\n\nTo start, let\u2019s talk about punk pop.  This is a genre that you may already know about, and it really peaked about 10 years ago.  I know that many people who listen to this style of music are stereotyped as \u201cEdgy\u201d but I can\u2019t help but legitimately love all of these songs.  Recently, artists have started mixing more electric and dubstep into here, one of my favorites being a relatively unheard of artist named SkyeRocket.  [Here\u2019s](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ8LphDbsq3ycz-EdWxwJ1Q) a link to his stuff. (Also yes I\u2019m linking YouTube for now, I can link spotify later on if you guys want it)\n\nNext, there\u2019s a bit of a stranger yet equally fun genre, also involving punk:  Folk Punk.  This genre is very unpopular, yet you can tell the people who write this music are singing from the heart, whether it be for fun or to convey a point about the world or their circumstances.  As I like to put it, half of it is r/im14andthisisdeep while the other half is eye opening stuff.  Ok, maybe most of it is r/im14andthisisdeep but you get the point.  My favorite artist from this genre is a band called the wingnut dish washers union.  [Here\u2019s](https://youtu.be/FO79S-VPkL0) a link to my favorite song of theirs.\n\nLastly, I have a genre that I personally don\u2019t listen to much, but I\u2019m still happy it exists none the less.  It\u2019s called Japanese Ska, and it\u2019s exactly what it sounds like.  Love the bounciness of Ska?  Think of that, except it\u2019s more exciting- and in Japanese.  It\u2019s a bit hard to describe, yet really good! Since I don\u2019t listen to it as much as the other genres I can\u2019t say much else, but [here\u2019s](https://www.youtube.com/user/tokyoskanet) a link to my friend\u2019s favorite artist.\n\nThat\u2019s all I wanted to show for now, because if I showed more this post would go on forever.  If you know about any other of these genre blends, please share them!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/bp6h5n/not_exactly_a_story_but_it_makes_me_super_happy/", "title": "Not exactly a story, but it makes me super happy that different genres of music can combine!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "thespecialpoint", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1557970088, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/bp6h5n/not_exactly_a_story_but_it_makes_me_super_happy/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440711.7335515, "replies_charged": false}
