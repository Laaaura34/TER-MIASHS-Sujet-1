It's on my parent's farm-right next to the house my (soon to be) husband and I will life the rest of our lives in. My grandmother made the napkins, my aunt made the dress, my brother (who just started his own hard cider company \"Bad Seed Cider\") is supplying the alcohol, MY sister is making jam for favors, and my other sister is growing all the tulips! Everything is working out perfectly.  I just sent out the invitations...AND I'M REALLY EXCITED! I just wanted to say how happy I was, and I wish this level of genuine, easy, and core happiness to all of you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/190rw7/im_getting_married_in_99_days/", "title": "I'm getting married in 99 days!
