I failed at all of it and none of it made me happy anyway. I just got a job in a very very well known company with a good salary and benefits. I literally almost started crying when I was told. I just wanted to share this and to anyone else who might be struggling - it will happen for you too, just keep on pushing. I'm just so happy and so relieved. 2 years of constant stress, depression, despair...  feels like forever. It was all worth it. \n\nI'm just lucky enough to have had my SO to keep me going.  And my cat. He's a monstrous cutie pie.
