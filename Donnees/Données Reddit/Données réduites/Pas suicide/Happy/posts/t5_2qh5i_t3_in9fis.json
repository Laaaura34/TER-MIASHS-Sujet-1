Take a short walk, eat lunch outside, go to a park for a half hour, even open a window and listen to the rain. Taking a few minutes to connect with the natural world help me feel grounded and relaxed.\n\n* **Meditation.** At first it was very difficult to sit still for that long. But after the first week, I started to truly realise that all of my problems were in my own head. I was perceiving things poorly, from past images that I\u2019d clung onto.\n* **Yoga.** Please look after your body as well as your life! Follow your internal compass \u2014 your intuition. If something feels right, you\u2019ll know. Even more poignantly, like in yoga, if something feels wrong, you\u2019ll know for certain. When you\u2019re practicing yoga, the movements at hand require a level of focus that demands that you be in the present moment. The practice pulls you from your thoughts because it is stronger than them.Getting into your body in this way is an antidote for rumination and a soother of worry. There are times to think, but during yoga, you are only required to move, and it requires your full participation.\n* **Ritual.** For me, it\u2019s making an afternoon cup of tea. Having a small ritual like this that you do at the same time every day provides a touchstone in the day. It\u2019s best if the ritual is a healthy one, of course (i.e., not lighting up a cigarette or pouring a drink).\n* **Avoid drama and the people who cause it**. Drama is what I call the manufactured junk that causes conflict and unhappiness. Some people seem like they must always be submerged in drama. My husband and I decided long ago that we weren\u2019t going to tolerate it. We don\u2019t befriend people who bring drama, and we work to keep it out of our relationship. It helps us deal much better with the real ups and and downs of life.\n* **Try to maximize time spent on activities that induce \u00abflow.\u00bb** Flow is the term for that magical time when you\u2019re so immersed in what you\u2019re doing that you don\u2019t really notice the time passing. We are happiest when we are in flow. So when you do something and realize this is happening, make a mental note of it, and try to build time into your days for similar activities.\n\nIf you are interested, there\u2019s a lot out there to get you started.
