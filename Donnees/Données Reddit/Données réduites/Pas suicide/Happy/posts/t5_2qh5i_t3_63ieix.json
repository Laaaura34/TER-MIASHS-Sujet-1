Just in the last few months. Things were looking up. I just had to get some paperwork signed by my neurologist. Except she kept fighting me on it. I've only seen her for a few months and I don't have my FULL history so she wasn't sure. I was really afraid she wouldn't sign it. She's kind of... tough, I guess. \n\nShe signed it! I picked it up this morning, I have to fill out one more page and send it in and then I'll keep insurance! I don't have to go off my antidepressants! I can stay in care! I'm getting married in September so I know I'll have insurance then, but this will bridge that five month gap and keep me healthy!
