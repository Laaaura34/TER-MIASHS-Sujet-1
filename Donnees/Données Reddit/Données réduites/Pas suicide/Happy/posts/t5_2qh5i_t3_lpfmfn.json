For the last 5 years, I\u2019ve been the manager at a McDonalds while I went to college. What was supposed to be a 6-month job to help me afford my dream camera, turned into 5 years of stress, anxiety, long days, early mornings, late nights, and irregular schedules. I\u2019ve worked about 50 hours a week for almost two years now- only getting two days off in a row if I specifically requested it. I didn\u2019t get medical, PTO, or any other benefits besides 30% off meals.\n\nStarting tomorrow, I get 3 weeks PTO, Sat/Sun off, I start at 9am and I\u2019m off at 5pm, I get medical, and the best part, my pay has increased. By a lot. I\u2019m having a hard time coping with it, because it just feels too good to be real. When I got the job, I nearly fainted because I thought I did horribly in the interview. For once I\u2019m so excited about my future. I finally have hope again.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/lpfmfn/after_five_years_working_in_a_fast_food_kitchen_i/", "title": "After Five years working in a fast food kitchen, I finally start a comfortable office job in the morning.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Tlr321", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 101, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613970119, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/lpfmfn/after_five_years_working_in_a_fast_food_kitchen_i/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439570.5874395, "replies_charged": false}
