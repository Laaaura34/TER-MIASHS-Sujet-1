And it's just one of the best days ever. Crazy, right? \n\nOver the last three years I've slaved away in two jobs. One took such a major toll on me that at this time last year I had a psychotic episode. The other was below my skill set and somewhat dead-end in its own way (great company and people though). It was a strange and stressful time.\n\nAfter the 1st year, I stayed with this super stressful job because I thought it was going to be a career builder. I figured out what the dream job was (because I'm in my 30s and still figuring out who I am). And I was going to go for it. I was going to try. \n\nAnd I did.\n\nAnd I got it. I got the start date yesterday. I start Monday/Tuesday. \n\nBack out, house a total mess, frantically trying to tie up loose ends while horizontal on the couch... And it's just starting to sink in that I actually made it. \n\nI made it! And the crazy shit is that I got a lot of help. I found out I had a network I didn't realize. And I'm just so thankful. Thankful that I have people in my life, that I got this job, that I built a career and that all my effort and pain and tears and sleepless nights were worth it. \n\nWhile I hoped, I don't think I ever believed that this could be my life. \n\nNow I've just got to make it past probation.
