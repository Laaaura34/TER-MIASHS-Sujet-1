I can't tell you how many days I've spent crying at my SO's bedside due to his mental health issues wrecking our relationship.\n\nKeith and I have been together for 13 years. We have had experiences with inpatient and four intensive outpatient programs, thousand of counseling hours, medication trials, Ketamine infusions, multiple disorders, multiple job losses, two separations, a jail incident and more.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nToday, we are happily married despite living these daily struggles.\u00a0It's not perfect. But it's progress. He sought treatment and I educated myself on his mental illness/conditions.\n\nI promise, the struggle is worth it. It's not going to be easy. But it can be worth it. I told him, \"As long as you don't give up on yourself, I won't give up on you ever.\"\n\nYou CAN have a successful & thriving relationship despite mental illness. Stay the course, get professional help, get plugged into a support network & stay educated with your SO.\n\nLove,\n\nErin Ramachandran\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uqu6i5gozlh51.jpg?width=609&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=245b2133a36e0d5717ca57702fc631840694b2f2", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ibk9c3/celebrating_13_years_of_marriage_despite_dealing/", "title": "Celebrating 13 Years Of Marriage Despite Dealing With Mental Health Illnesses & Setbacks", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MHSTRONG", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1597690239, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ibk9c3/celebrating_13_years_of_marriage_despite_dealing/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440610.2481399, "replies_charged": false}
