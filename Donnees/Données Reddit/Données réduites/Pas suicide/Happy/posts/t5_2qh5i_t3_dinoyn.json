I even lost my faith in the process and took to drugs for the longest time. I worked mostly at coffee bars and the service industry serving drinks and what have you which I totally hated. I always loved tools and working with some so I applied for a tool salesperson position and got accepted. After a solid year of good work I\u2019m happy with my job, I have learned so much from it and made so many connections. I slowly began to regain my faith and one good day a beautiful girl walked into our store. I hadn\u2019t felt that way about someone just by seeing them for the first time since high school and I thought I\u2019d give it a shot. She has become the most amazing partner I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of sharing my time with by being kind, loving and supportive and I try my best to be the same for her. I\u2019m now on vacation from work sitting on my seaside balcony in my hotel room enjoying the sound of the sea crashing against the rocks while writing this post, I can almost feel happy tears fill up my eyes and I thought I\u2019d share these good vibes with you kind people. Keep trying, don\u2019t give up and have a blessed day.
