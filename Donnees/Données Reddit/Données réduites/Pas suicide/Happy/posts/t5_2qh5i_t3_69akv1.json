Dang man take in a deep breath right now and feel that sweet air entering your lungs. Breathing really can be one of the most pleasant and beautiful things there is, if we pay enough attention to it. Plus side is, it's always there to be appreciated and taken in :) \n\nOur heart, also, all day pumps blood, working literally nonstop! Give these systems some love. I am grateful for this working body I have been given. I could have been a more unfortunate person, but I am healthy and young. \n\nWhatever circumstance you find yourself in, create a refuge, create an island of happiness and love, in whatever is unfolding for you in any moment.
