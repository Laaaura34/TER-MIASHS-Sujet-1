When you start, you're generally thrown into the collections department or some other place nobody wants to be.\n\nI was doing ok for a while and even got selected to work a more advanced workload after several months. Then the pandemic happened and I've been thrown all over the Agency, I'm thankful they kept me employed while collections was halted, but it derailed my learning progression. I've been worried a lot recently about my productivity since coming back to collections, I need ground up re-training to function at this point.\n\nThen a miracle happened, my Team Leader announced to us that a different department is expanding and will be filled by officers in my current role. I put my name in and I've been accepted. I don't know when I start training, though it will be sooner rather than later they say. The bottom line is, I finally get to leave collections. For the first time in 4 years I'm going to actually enjoy my job I think.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/pabbgb/i_hate_the_department_i_work_in_im_getting/", "title": "I hate the department I work in, I'm getting transferred finally.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Regnes", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629760742, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/pabbgb/i_hate_the_department_i_work_in_im_getting/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438826.4276752, "replies_charged": false}
