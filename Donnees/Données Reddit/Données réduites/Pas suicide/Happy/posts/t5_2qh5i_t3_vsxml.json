I have worked in retail for 18 years and have longed to get the hell out. Two weeks ago I decided to do just that and contacted the IT company.\n\nI sent them a letter of introduction and told them that I was sending them my resume. The next day I mailed them my resume and a cover letter (I had no IT experience from my jobs). Two days after that  I sent them a third letter saying that I was going to call them to ask for an interview; which I did and they granted.\n\nWe discussed what I wanted to do at the company, seeing as he wasn't looking to hire anybody. We left it that maybe possibly he could find something for me part time doing scut work (change passwords, etc). I didn't mind that because I work for a pool company in Ct, and get laid off every fall.\n\nAfter I wrote them a thank you email, they replied saying that they were thinking of full time position for me with salary and commission. \n\nI called them this morning and the owner gave me an outline of what he was thinking he wanted me to do. He wants me to be his business development/marketing manager. He said that I should be able to get to six digits within the year, if I am who he thought I was. And goddammit I am going to make sure I am who the hell he thinks I am!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/vsxml/how_i_went_from_a_retail_wage_slave_to_business/", "title": "How I went from a retail wage slave to Business Development manager in two weeks", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MjrJWPowell", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 18, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1340990677, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/vsxml/how_i_went_from_a_retail_wage_slave_to_business/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441329.1035852, "replies_charged": false}
