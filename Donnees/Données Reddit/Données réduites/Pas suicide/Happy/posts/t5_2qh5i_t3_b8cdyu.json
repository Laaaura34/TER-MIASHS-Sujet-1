However, I just found this subreddit and all the photos, all the happy stories made me feel grateful for the good things in my life. I'm listening my boyfriend sleeping near me, I enjoying the silence of our room, and I'm... just feeling better because of you. Because better times always come.\n\n\n(I hope this is enough of a happy story to share here! I don't have any other and it could seem like nothing special, but for me it's a big thing.)
