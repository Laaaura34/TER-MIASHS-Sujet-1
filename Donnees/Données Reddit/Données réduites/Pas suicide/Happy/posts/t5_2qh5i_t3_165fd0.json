Without giving away anything, it is a well-established creative media company. Over the last 4 years I've been slowly making good connections with people to the point where people I haven't met know my name and my work.\n\nThey have a kinda-position for a on-call front desk person, which is absolutely not my end goal, but it means I would get to meet everyone and it gets my foot in the door. I've had one informational interview at the end of last November and hadn't heard anything until today. They want me to come in for a \"meet and greet\" which I'm assuming is like an interview only more optimistic. If anyone knows what \"meet and greet\" means in relation to a job position please let me know.\n\nLast I heard, it was a very very on-call thing with probably only a few hours here and there, but there's a possibility they might need a runner every now and then. I really need a steady job, but this is far better than the current unemployment I have going for me. And it opens up the possibility of someday having a career in what I've been working toward my entire life.\n\nMy dream could someday actually come true. I'm so excited I have tears in my eyes.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/165fd0/i_have_a_meet_and_greet_with_a_company_i_have/", "title": "I have a \"meet and greet\" with a company I have dreamed of working for.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dictionarysquirrel", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1357603073, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/165fd0/i_have_a_meet_and_greet_with_a_company_i_have/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441994.948171, "replies_charged": false}
