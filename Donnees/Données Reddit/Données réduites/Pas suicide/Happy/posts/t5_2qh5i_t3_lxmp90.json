The one thing I thought was the best was practice 4- the magical way out of negativity. You basically take any negative event in your life, and look for 10 things you can either learn from that thing or try to find 10 things you are grateful for about that thing. I really loved it, and will be practicing these techniques daily to improve my overall happiness AND life :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf interested, here is the [original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NsgGhNJlCs&t=1s)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/lxmp90/how_to_be_happy_5_practices_you_can_do_to_be/", "title": "How to be Happy: 5 practices you can do to be happier every day!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "minimalismemma", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614870802, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/lxmp90/how_to_be_happy_5_practices_you_can_do_to_be/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442025.7770362, "replies_charged": false}
