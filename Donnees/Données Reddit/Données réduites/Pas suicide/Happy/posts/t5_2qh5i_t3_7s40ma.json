I\u2019ve taken most every antidepressant in every combination available. My oncologist prescribed Adderall to combat fatigue and I\u2019m like a new man. People say they haven\u2019t seen me like this in at least five years. I\u2019m optimistic, I\u2019m almost euphoric, I have the energy to go about my daily routine. It\u2019s been almost three months without a crying jag/pity party.
