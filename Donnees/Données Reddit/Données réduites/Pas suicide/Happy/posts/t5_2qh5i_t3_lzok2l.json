On their quest to finding happiness, they will stumble across a genre of people claiming that all you need is yourself to find happiness. That is where the first big mistake happens. To be happy you must feel a certain level of pleasure and contentment. To want extent, it\u2019s all a matter of personal preference and depends on the situation. Monks for example have a high degree of contentment and pleasure in their simple life. If you were to ask someone to give a discerption of a monk they would most likely say that monks are disciplined. The word happy would not come to mind. When the everyday person is happy, you may ask why are you so happy. If they reply I\u2019m just a happy person, you make think to yourself that this person is a loon. That is not a mistake, you intuitively know happiness comes from external factors but when it comes to yourself, you think differently.\n\nNow it\u2019s not all helpless because what you can attain for yourself is peace. When I say peace I\u2019m not referring to peace in a country or hippie peace and love. Peace for a country means they are not in wartime and hippie peace is more happiness because of all the extracurricular activities needed to achieve that state. What I\u2019m getting at is a constant state of calmness, not too high or not too low. A sense of stillness, that feeling you get knowing that no matter what happens everything is going to turn out all right. Some people will consider that happiness and that\u2019s ok. Some people are happy when they get very angry because they get to break things. We are complicated beings. \n\nHappiness like anger is an intense emotional feeling on the same spectrum. Being level headed or at peace is somewhere above the middle. Indifference is smack dead centered. Maybe I\u2019m wrong but I don\u2019t see how anyone one can reach those extreme emotional feeling without some sort of outside interference. If they do shift from two extremes without external interference that may be due to a medical mental disorder. When you go to a party or a social event that is something that can make you happy. Even when you are cleaning your house or donating to a charity, you may have feelings of happiness but the feelings are short-lived. Repeat actions may not bring the same intensity of happiness. On the other hand meditation and not dwelling on past mistakes will give you a seems of inner peace and that is much more sustainable. \n\nI\u2019m not saying don\u2019t look for external people or objects for happiness. I\u2019m saying don\u2019t look inside you to be happy. Do activities to improve yourself so you can have spikes of happiness. Do things like playing sports, reading, writing, drawing, hanging out with friends, and occasional shopping. You can only look in yourself to find peace. Peace should be the baseline because there are situations where you may have to bring out your dark side. If you\u2019re already close to the middle, you can achieve elevated situation appropriateness. Remember peace and happiness, internal and external. Inner peace is where you live, happiness is where you play. \n\nhttps://noveltytheonly.wordpress.com/", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/lzok2l/happiness_is_external_peace_is_internal/", "title": "Happiness is external, peace is internal", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Negative_Lobster", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615115196, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/lzok2l/happiness_is_external_peace_is_internal/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439318.4860573, "replies_charged": false}
