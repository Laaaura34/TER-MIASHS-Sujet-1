I'm having so much fun brainstorming events and games for the day, I thought I'd share with Reddit so you guys can flex your creative camp counselor brain muscles too.\n\nBasic info:  it's about 400+ kids with somewhere between 80-100 staff, and we have a good amount of sports equipment and both outdoor and indoor space, as well as lots of time to order supplies we need.  We're already planning to use dry ice to make our \"Potions\" seem a little bit more magical :-) \n\nIf you guys request it, I'll post pictures of the day!  It's a blast every year but I'm sure this one will be the best yet.  \n\nEDIT:  This goes in /r/happy because this day is the happiest day of the summer, and this camp is basically the happiest little slice of utopia on earth, and I'm just overflowing with glee that I get to participate again (my sixth consecutive year on staff!).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/cewp4/ever_imagined_400_kids_pretending_to_be_at/", "title": "Ever imagined 400+ kids pretending to be at Hogwarts, competing for the House Cup?
