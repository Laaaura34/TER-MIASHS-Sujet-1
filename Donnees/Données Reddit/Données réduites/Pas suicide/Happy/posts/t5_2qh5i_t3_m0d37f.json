She opened to me about her OCD and told me about it. She gave me the sweetest words of encouragement, and at that moment I knew that she would always be my rock, she would always help me and stand right behind me when I need her. I am so grateful to have her as my older sister.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/m0d37f/opened_up_about_my_depression_to_my_older_sister/", "title": "Opened up about my depression to my older sister.
