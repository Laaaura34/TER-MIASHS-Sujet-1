Second, because of recent changes and refunds to my insurance I don\u2019t have an insurance bill this month either, which means *EVEN MORE* money in my pocket! On top of all the other streams of income I have coming in. \n\nAnd damn, it feels sooo good to have so much  money and to spend money, and well, to have such a happy relationship with money. \n\nI love me some money:) \n\nWhat would you all do if you had all your bills paid, many very healthy savings accounts, a hefty cash stash, and en entire paycheck to blow? I want this to be fun and happy so spending is the name of the game, what are you buying?!?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/in3n09/its_going_to_be_a_great_month_financially/", "title": "It\u2019s going to be a great month (financially)!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MyLifesParody", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1599321858, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/in3n09/its_going_to_be_a_great_month_financially/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440614.0455608, "replies_charged": false}
