My parents aren\u2019t together and I think that they were putting the responsibility of teaching me on each other (think \u201cif her dad isn\u2019t contributing the. I\u2019m not doing it\u201d mentality). So when I left home to go to college and started living on my own, I had to rely on friends, walking and the extremely limited public transportation. Eventually I got a bike and used for literally everything for 3 years. Disclaimer: biking in the rain and attempting to go grocery shopping on a bike is not fun lmao.\n\nI moved in with my grandparents due to COVID and I was able to learn how to drive, save up, and get my ideal first car! Honestly, having a car feels so surreal. I don\u2019t have to feel like a burden to people when I need to get somewhere. I don\u2019t have to commute 30 minuted on a bike to get to my job that\u2019s literally minutes away. Yesterday I went grocery shopping and just being able to fit everything in my car as opposed to balancing 4+ bags in my bike basket was enough to make me super happy. \n\nI\u2019m basically at a point where I want to find any excuse to run errands just because I can. I\u2019ve been wanting to get Coffee Bean for like 3 months but didn\u2019t want to ask my grandparents to take me, so as a reward for myself, I\u2019m getting Coffee Bean this morning. \n\nSorry for the long post, but I\u2019m just so so happy I can finally drive!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/kccob6/at_21_i_finally_got_a_license_and_a_car/", "title": "At 21, I finally got a license and a car!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "veggiebuttt", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 15, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1607874131, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/kccob6/at_21_i_finally_got_a_license_and_a_car/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438940.318718, "replies_charged": false}
