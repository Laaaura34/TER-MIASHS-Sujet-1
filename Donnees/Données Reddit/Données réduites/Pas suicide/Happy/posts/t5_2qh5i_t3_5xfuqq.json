Sometimes I forget this and I get angry with her so I need to work on remembering that she only wants the best for me. She has saved my ass more times than I can count. She's trying her best every day and she's doing a great job of it. So kiss your mother if you still have one and remember that everyone dies in the end so don't take your time with her for granted.\n  \nOn a happier less morbid note, she, my sister, and I are taking a road trip this summer. We'll be spending a lot of time driving and I've decided to make a playlist for her. Give me song suggestions if you can, I would appreciate it greatly. She grew up in the 80's/90's but never got into the big songs that made the charts. Her favorite bands include The Cure, Pixies, Smashing Pumpkins, Grateful Dead, Beastie Boys, The Doors, U2, and The Sex Pistols. Thanks a bunch and thank you mom.  \n  \nEdit: Thank you all for the suggestions. This playlist is going to be killer!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/5xfuqq/my_mom_is_my_best_friend_and_i_love_her_so_much/", "title": "My mom is my best friend and I love her so much.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "hansolo2843", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 247, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1488612755, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/5xfuqq/my_mom_is_my_best_friend_and_i_love_her_so_much/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441314.254967, "replies_charged": false}
