I lost my father to alcoholism, my mother suffers from mental illness, I adopted my kids because my sister couldn't hack it as a parent (or functional adult for that matter), and my marriage was basically 15 years of torture at the hands of the person that I desperately tried to understand and love. \n\nI'm posting because tonight I finally realized that all of these things have led me to my best possible life. Raising my kids has been the most terrifying and fulfilling experience. My mother's mental illness has taught me patience and compassion for my kids. My father's alcoholism and death taught me that heartbreak can consume you from the inside and that seeking help is crucial to recovery. \n\nLastly, my marriage ending has led me to the most amazing person I have ever met. He has literally saved me from a cold, dead existence where I was just surviving for my kids. This man has been my best friend and rock for a year and a half and now we are very much in love. I am the absolute luckiest woman alive.\n(If you're reading this pup, I love you.)\n\nIt's been so hard and I have chased happiness for so long, but I genuinely believe that I've come out on the other side of it all winning.
