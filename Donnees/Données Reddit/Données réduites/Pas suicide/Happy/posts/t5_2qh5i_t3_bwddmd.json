The mind is a random rascal, yet your *entire* life experience takes place there. Take control of the mind\u2019s on/off switch and live happier every after. Once you get it, you\u2019ll not forget it.\n\nBeliefs: They are not the truth. They are the result of a perspective we adopted from our family and community at a young age. Left unexamined, they take take the wheel and we follow. You know a belief isn't serving you when you feel unhappy or disconnected. Time to look at it for what it is - a thought you keep thinking. Nothing more.\n\nPerspective: There are as many perspectives as there are people. Learning how to see things through another's eyes teaches love and patience. Perspective, like belief is either chosen or a default mode of viewing the world.\n\nInterpretation: There is nothing in this world that is not subject to interpretation. Not a building, a piece of artwork, or even the purpose of a tree. Becoming mindful that interpreting is another aspect of perspective requires awareness and a willingness to let go and allow.\n\nHappiness is letting things go that don't fill you with joy.
