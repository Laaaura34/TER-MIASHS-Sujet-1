I was depressed and not doing well at all before. First class presented a paper and had a debate - ended up mostly winning the debate from a very difficult stance I was assigned (In favor of Rolling Stone putting the Boston bomber on the cover) and got an A+, and the teacher wanted a copy of my paper for himself! Then I got the results of my first history test back, mine was late because I get accommodations and the testing center put it in the wrong folder for my prof. Judging by the rest of the class I was expecting an 85 but I pulled out a 93!\n\nAnd today, oh man today! I performed improv with my class (a class that is not affiliated with my school, just something I do on the side) and it was great! We had fun and everyone came up and told us how good we were. My sister, who had seen a lot of shows and helped get me in to improv, even made a point to tell me that our show was one of the best ones she'd seen. On top of that, the people in my class have become some of my best friends over the past few months. \n\nRemember reddit, there are good things out there and people that love you.
