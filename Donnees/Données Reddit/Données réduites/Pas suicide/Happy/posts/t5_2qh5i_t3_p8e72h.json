I really didn't think I would be \"alright\". My parents even told me they had almost no hope for me and didn't think I'd make anything of myself. \nI have done well enough in 10 years that I'll never be forced to work again unless I decide I want to. I have no idea how I even managed that as it was never my intention. \nI looked in the mirror this morning and couldn't stop smiling.\n I feel so blessed and am so proud of myself for never letting anyone stop me or hold me back. \nI'm so happy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/p8e72h/i_feel_like_ive_won_the_lottery_of_life/", "title": "I feel like I've won the lottery of life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "karnli", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 31, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629494232, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/p8e72h/i_feel_like_ive_won_the_lottery_of_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439144.4920778, "replies_charged": false}
