Being too creative can also mean lack of focus and follow-through. It can mean chasing that new shiny thing and not sticking to what I truly is my purpose in life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've done many things that seemed like a good idea. At some of them I was quite successful, but most of them a failure, and almost all of them didn't really bring me lasting happiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne thing that I always noticed I'm doing is obsessively envying and comparing - Why can't I have this or that? Why am I not earning enough, like him or her? Which also meant that I've done many things out of the wrong reasons - prestige and financial reward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been searching for a new path for years now, and yesterday I started something that truly feels me with joy. Whether it succeeds or not - that's yet to be seen, but it does make me happy, and maybe that's what's most important.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIronically, that thing is about combating my natural envy by writing about everything I'm actually rich with - things that I should just spend more time appreciating rather than chasing what I think I want.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo whether this remains my modest personal journal, or helps others like me - I'm happy that I'm doing it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/kixnzf/finally_doing_what_makes_me_happy_by_counting_my/", "title": "Finally doing what makes me happy by counting my blessings", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "saarshai", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1608745807, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/kixnzf/finally_doing_what_makes_me_happy_by_counting_my/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439145.6686351, "replies_charged": false}
