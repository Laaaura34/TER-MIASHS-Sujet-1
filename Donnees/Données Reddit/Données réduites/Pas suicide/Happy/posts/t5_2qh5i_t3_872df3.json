While I was waiting in line I noticed the woman in front of me had a ton of school supplies and knowing how underpaid and over worked teachers are I wanted to express my gratitude. \n\nI asked if she was a teacher and she said yes. She told me she was a special ed teacher, worked with children in foster care, was adopting another child this month. She has raised over 56 children and then proceeded to show me pictures of her family. I\u2019ve heard horror stories about the foster care system but this frazzled kind woman seems to be an exception. I thanked her for sharing her story and she told me this isn\u2019t the life she had planned for but she couldn\u2019t be happier. We ended up exchanging numbers and I was invited to meet and talk to the kids sometime in the future. When I was checking out, the man in line behind me insisted on paying for my balloons and supplies. Its been a good Sunday.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/872df3/i_never_thought_going_to_the_dollar_store_would/", "title": "I never thought going to the dollar store would make me this happy, I walked in just wanting balloons but walked out with a whole lot more.
