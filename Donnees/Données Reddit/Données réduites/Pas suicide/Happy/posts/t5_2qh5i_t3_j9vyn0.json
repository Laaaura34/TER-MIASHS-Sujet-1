She just had her first baby four weeks ago so we\u2019re taking it slow and easy to build her back up. (She had a c-section and her doctor cleared her for under 2 miles walking daily before we started.) \n\nThe two weeks ago I did 2.5 miles twice, last week I did 3.6 miles twice, and today I wanted to go for it and did a full 6 miles. \n\nMy handle bars somewhat broke 1 mile in but I didn\u2019t use that as an excuse to go home. \n\nI\u2019m very proud of myself and I feel great. I\u2019ve been in a depression fog for the last five or six weeks so this is a very big to me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/j9vyn0/i_went_on_a_175_mile_walk_and_then_a_6_mile_bike/", "title": "I went on a 1.75 mile walk and then a 6 mile bike ride this morning!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "yellingsnowloaf", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 72, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1602525724, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/j9vyn0/i_went_on_a_175_mile_walk_and_then_a_6_mile_bike/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440601.5419967, "replies_charged": false}
