I've been in a very dark place, with a thousand different stress factors.  It has been the lowest I've ever felt.  Thanksgiving brought it all to a head, we walked out of my family's home during dinner.  We went home, the night was shot.  \n\nYesterday, though, we had our own dinner, my husband and daughters and I.  It was our first holiday just us 4.  It was lovely, and delightful, and so pleasant to be in warm, happy company.  We made pies and cookies, and we watched movies and just enjoyed being together. \n\nSo, although I am far from well and our families are lunatics, we have each other together in our own little home and we are so full of love.  This year, I am thankful to have a loving husband and beautiful, healthy girls whose company fills my heart to the very brim with such a fierce love.
