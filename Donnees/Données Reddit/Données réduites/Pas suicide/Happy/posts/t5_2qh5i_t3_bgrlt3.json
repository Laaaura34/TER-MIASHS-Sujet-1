My abusive STBX was still attending the same spiritual center so we kept it quiet when we started dating, and when the other women in the community found out the engagement was off, they were all over him. Neither they nor I knew yet that the first second he saw me he knew he was going to marry me, but he politely kept them all at a distance. (He didn\u2019t tell me that he knew immediately until the night after he proposed, 6 months later, and that\u2019s the part of our story where he always cries.)\n\nFast forward over 13 years. We\u2019ve been married for over 12, and just now when I came into the bedroom and looked at him asleep, my heart just overflowed with gratitude \u2014 yet again \u2014 that I\u2019m the one who won the jackpot, i.e., the heart of this wonderful man. \n\nHe\u2019s not perfect, but he is freaking amazing. He\u2019s trusted me to help him heal emotionally and is genuinely grateful for that \u2014 and tells me so \u2014 and he has supported me to heal. Despite the fact that I developed a debilitating, painful chronic illness less than a year into our marriage, he will never cheat on me or leave me, he\u2019s even incapable of flirting with other women. I\u2019m on a weirdly restricted diet and he goes out of his way to read ingredients labels to make sure I can eat what he wants to buy. He posts a romantic meme and a sweet comment on my FB wall. Every. Single. Day.  His \u201chiking wives\u201d tell me that when they\u2019re out hiking he often talks about me, about how great our marriage is, and about how much he loves and appreciates me. Unlike my wusbands he\u2019s widely respected among our friends, and has been in all three of the spiritual communities we\u2019ve belonged to since we met and eventually moved across the country, and \u2014 also unlike my wusbands \u2014 I\u2019m extremely proud to be married to him. \n\nThe most important piece though is the level of commitment he has to us having an extraordinary marriage, and the level of deep emotional work he\u2019s been willing to do as his part for us to get there. We both came into this marriage far more emotionally damaged than we knew; I know very few men who even have this radical vision of what\u2019s possible, let alone who are actually willing to do the hard work to achieve it, *cuz it definitely ain\u2019t for sissies.*\n\nI\u2019m just so d*mn grateful to finally have the marriage of my dreams, and he feels exactly the same way.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/bgrlt3/im_so_happy_and_grateful_to_be_married_to_my/", "title": "I\u2019m so happy and grateful to be married to my wonderful husband.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Anonymous0212", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1556089893, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/bgrlt3/im_so_happy_and_grateful_to_be_married_to_my/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442130.8419657, "replies_charged": false}
