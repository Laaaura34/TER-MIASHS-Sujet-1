I have a condition that causes balance problems and makes my muscles stiffen unexpectedly. I was very anxious that I had forgotten how to ride or that I wouldn't be able to. But, I rented a bike on Thursday and tried it out and went for 10 km. Everything went better than expected. Liked it so much that I went out and bought a bike last night.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/yh479/went_on_my_first_bike_ride_in_20_years/", "title": "Went on my first bike ride in 20 years!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "jplank1983", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 42, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1345391184, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/yh479/went_on_my_first_bike_ride_in_20_years/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438959.4640212, "replies_charged": false}
