And my job even fulfills ALL of the many requirements I need for my next education (they pay very badly though, but I know about jobs that pay even less). \n\n* My colleagues are amazing and so supportive (I left University feeling like I know nothing).\n\n* And I just went to have a drink at the Christmas market with some other people from the course I had this weekend and we had a lot of fun. It is great meeting people who are in the same situation as I am. \n\n* And even the course was great. I really liked the teacher and learned a lot. I am so enthusiastic right now I don't even feel tired :)\n\nNo idea how I deserve all of that...\n\nEdit: please excuse my English, my job/education situation is pretty complicated and hard to explain in another language.
