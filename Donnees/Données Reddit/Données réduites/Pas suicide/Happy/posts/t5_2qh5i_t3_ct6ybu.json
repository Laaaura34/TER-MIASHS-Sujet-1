When I was 18 I was kicked out of home with nowhere to go, and absolutely nothing but the clothes on my back. I've managed to put myself through University (I am extremely lucky I live in a country where the government will fund that, and you only have to start paying your loan back when you earn enough - without that I would 100% still be homeless), and I've been informed I've been approved with my home loan application, and I'm going to sign the papers today! It's been a very very tough road, it's been scary, and miserable, but today is a rare day where I am honestly, truly happy (but also quite scared)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ct6ybu/going_to_sign_the_mortgage_papers_on_my_first/", "title": "Going to sign the mortgage papers on my first house today!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SYNTHES1SE", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 19, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1566337983, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ct6ybu/going_to_sign_the_mortgage_papers_on_my_first/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442653.9530828, "replies_charged": false}
