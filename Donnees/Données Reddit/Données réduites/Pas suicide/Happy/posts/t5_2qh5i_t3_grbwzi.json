It wasn't a bad thought brought on by depression. It wasn't an idea imposed upon me by those who have hurt me, nor was it an my eating disorder screaming at me. \n\nI hardly have moments where I can genuinely look inside and realise things about me, and have... well, original thoughts. My mind wandered and it just kind of went to plants. An image of a sunflower popped into my head, and it brought me so much peace and happiness. I love sunflowers. That is ME. Not anyone else. This is the first good thought I've had in years. A genuinely good thought.\n\nSorry if this is stupid or not right for this sub, but I thought it might be. I can't believe how happy I am to know that I love sunflowers. God, they're so pretty and big and yellow and tall! I could go on and on!\n\nI never had a good thought pass before, and I started crying. All because I like sunflowers.\n\nTLDR: I love sunflowers.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/grbwzi/i_realised_something_about_myself_and_it_made_me/", "title": "I realised something about myself, and it made me cry.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "PlantLifeIsBeautiful", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1590550041, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/grbwzi/i_realised_something_about_myself_and_it_made_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442041.2413018, "replies_charged": false}
