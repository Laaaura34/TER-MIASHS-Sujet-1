My boyfriend and I were able to go for a walk and it was so much fun just walking and spending meaningful time together. We live together and we are both quite independent so it meant a lot to be able to spend some time together in that way. He's now playing games with his friends online and I'm intermittently feeding him snacks. I know it's a small thing but it makes me feel so calm and fulfilled. It's a warm fuzzy feeling, a bit like a bubble - I'm so happy I just wanted to share it with someone.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/gtn28m/i_can_see_the_light_at_the_end_of_the_tunnel_with/", "title": "I can see the light at the end of the tunnel with the current situation and I honestly can't wait to resume my life with my boyfriend, he makes me feel so fulfilled", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "whynotnemesis", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1590876947, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/gtn28m/i_can_see_the_light_at_the_end_of_the_tunnel_with/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439344.5277302, "replies_charged": false}
