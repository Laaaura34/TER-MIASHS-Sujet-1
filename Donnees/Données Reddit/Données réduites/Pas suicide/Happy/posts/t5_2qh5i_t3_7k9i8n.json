We both said that we'd try to save money together to meet up somewhere along the line if we could. Then, out of nowhere, an estranged family member passed away and left her enough money to take a plane up to NY (originally I was going to take a bus down to her). \n\nThat was a couple months ago. She's not coming until Tuesday. Three days left, and I can barely focus on finals. \n\nI didn't get as many work hours as I thought I would, so I only have about $100 to last us a whole week. Still, I think we can make it work. I have a monthly Metrocard, and the places we want to go (the NY Aquarium, the Metropolitan Museum of Art) have \"pay what you want\" days while she's here, so we're going to take advantage of them.\n\nI sold my BTC (~$50) today so she wouldn't have to pay for anything for me- I'm embarrassed about taking handouts from people. She knows I'm broke. She doesn't care. \n\nWhen I get to the airport, I'm going to give her the warmest hug ever. \n\nSorry for gushing. I've had very little reason to be happy for a long time, financially and politically, and I just wanted to share.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/7k9i8n/my_longdistance_gf_is_coming_on_tuesday/", "title": "My long-distance GF is coming on Tuesday!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Devonmartino", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1513458073, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7k9i8n/my_longdistance_gf_is_coming_on_tuesday/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438913.2772126, "replies_charged": false}
