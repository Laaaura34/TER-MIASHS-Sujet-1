Homeless for a while. \n\nNow I\u2019ve got a good job, and an apartment, and a little bit of money in the bank. Who cares that I\u2019m on my own and pregnant? Clearly I can do this. I have a couple of good friends for support and more importantly, I know I can rely on myself.\n\nSo I\u2019m enjoying a well deserved day off before a long week of work. My friend and his mom who\u2019ve been instrumental in support lately are bringing over supper from my work (I work in a restaurant in town) and coming over to watch silly tv (American Ninja Warrior) and keep me company.\n\nI\u2019m happy today. I\u2019ve had a lot of sad days this summer.
