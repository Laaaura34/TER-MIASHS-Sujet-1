I didn't feel like the scholarship offered was deserved.  I didn't feel proud, or happy, or grateful.  I felt like I went through the motions.  I didn't have a sense of ownership.  I transferred, graduated, and now I'm feeling a bit better about myself.\n\nMy brother on the other hand, suffers from many of the same insecurities and shortcomings in motivation that I did.  He was just offered two scholarships (each about 50% larger than mine) to two colleges he was genuinely interested in.\n\nHe's currently in a different state, so I opened his letters for him while on the phone, and I was so happy to give him the news.  After hanging up and sending him the photos, I burst out crying.  He struggles a lot, and I've feared for him.\n\nBut right now, I'm so incredibly thankful.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/lty7am/im_crying_tears_of_joy_over_the_two_acceptance/", "title": "I'm crying tears of joy over the two acceptance letters my brother received.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SirHammyTheGreat", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 25, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614462712, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/lty7am/im_crying_tears_of_joy_over_the_two_acceptance/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441530.845269, "replies_charged": false}
