I figured we could splurge on 2 meals so I picked Breakfast with Minnie Mouse. (I really really wanted her to go to the Princess Breakfast because I am certain her head would explode. But its $125 Each!! Ouch!) And Blue Bayou which comes with passes for Fantasmic seating.\n\nI am so happy and excited. I cannot wait to see her face when she figures it out. I bought her an Elsa dress off of Offer Up, but it's like a nice Disney store one and is so pretty.\n\nI am kinda nervous because its just her and I going. I have never gone on a solo trip like this with her. We occasionally road trip 12 hours to my grandparents, but even then family is on the other side. So I am just hoping I've thought everything through and budgeted right. I can't imagine too many bumps in the road except finding affordable food. \n\nI am really happy that after so much crap happening, I did this. I am always so scared to spend money on fun things. \n\nThanks everyone, I haven't told many people on my end because I don't want them to blow it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/b03fl2/im_taking_my_daughter_to_disneyland_next_month/", "title": "I'm taking my Daughter to Disneyland next month and she has no idea.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Buckditch", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 23, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1552364486, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/b03fl2/im_taking_my_daughter_to_disneyland_next_month/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440703.9473398, "replies_charged": false}
