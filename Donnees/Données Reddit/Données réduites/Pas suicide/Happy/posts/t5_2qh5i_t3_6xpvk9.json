Like, a lot.  80 billion years old and she could out-drink most of the family.  \n\nA trait that I inherited as well -- through genes or social structure; doesn't matter -- but I did.  Specifically with G&Ts myself.  \n\nMy girlfriend at the time (still friends with, she is awesome), knowing how stressful family interactions were with me, made me a insanely strong drink.  80% Gin.  At least. (And foregoing the traditional lime garnish in favor of olives, as my weird family does.  This drink is like the bastard child of a Gin & Tonic and a Martini.)\n\nSo: GRANDMA INTERCEPTS.\n\nThere was only 10 feet between my girlfriend making the drink and me receiving it,  but somehow grandma intercepted.  She came out of nowhere.  Took the drink right out of her hands and dived in to gulp.\n\n\"OH, THIS IS JUST HOW I LIKE IT!  THANK YOU CHILD.\"\n\nThis story probably sounds stupid and boring but it still entertains me to this day.  To anyone that has actually had an 80% gin G&T might understand; it's not exactly drinkable, the point is, well, you know :D", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/6xpvk9/just_a_short_silly_story_that_makes_me_smile/", "title": "Just a short silly story that makes me smile", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dustball", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 20, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1504396393, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/6xpvk9/just_a_short_silly_story_that_makes_me_smile/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440770.3163335, "replies_charged": false}
