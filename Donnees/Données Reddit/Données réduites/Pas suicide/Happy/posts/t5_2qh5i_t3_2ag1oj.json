I originally thought that I had no chance of getting my dream internship, so, even though I had sent my CV to the companies, I was planning on working in some fast-food chain. \n\nNow, not only am I hired as a Java intern, I am working for the best company from the ones I applied to :D\n\n\nBut wait, that's not all. Yesterday, while checking my e-mail I stumbled upon one from the Cambridge Certification Centre. Since I had just taken a CPE exam, I was extremely nervous about opening it. To my delight, I passed with the highest possible mark (A)! I can't even express how happy I feel with all the good that has happened to me during the last few days!\n\n\nSo, everyone, I wish you the best of luck and keep smiling!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/2ag1oj/lifes_good/", "title": "Life's good :)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AcrobotPL", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 22, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1405102169, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2ag1oj/lifes_good/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440228.6993694, "replies_charged": false}
