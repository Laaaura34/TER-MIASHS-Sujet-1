I could very well be dead right now but fortune has it that I\u2019m not. Whether it be of one disease or another, I\u2019m still around kicking it. I\u2019ve made serious progress with a lot of things from when I was younger and I\u2019m slowly but surely getting better socially, which I would consider my main flaw at the moment. I\u2019ve received offers from great universities where mostly A*s are required, showing my hard work has paid off. I\u2019m reasonably happy with my health and fitness (though can always improve). My confidence is growing by the day working a part time job where speaking to people is necessary, where my sales figures aren\u2019t ok (I think). I\u2019ve learnt you can\u2019t please everybody as someone will always dislike something about you, but that\u2019s good. It\u2019s helped me come to terms with just being who I want to be. I\u2019m more confident with my appearance now then ever. Yes I gotta grow up in some regards but I\u2019m gonna let it come naturally. I\u2019m looking forward to the next day nowadays and I\u2019m reddy for the next challenge that comes my way.\n\n(I just wanted a place to put this so I can look back on it in the future when I have an off day.)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ebf9tn/i_need_to_stop_being_so_hard_on_myself_because/", "title": "I need to stop being so hard on myself because I\u2019ve come so far since I was 16.
