After a brief bout of unemployment, I racked up a bit of credit card debt as I had to use it for food, rent, etc. I've been chipping away at it, but with rent, my high loan bills, and other expenses it's been difficult to knock it out as quickly as I would like.\n\nI found out once I filed taxes that my refund was larger than I had expected it to be - enough to pay off my entire credit card balance, in fact, with some leftover for some medical expenses I have accrued as well. It may be a drop in my large debt bucket, but pressing the button to put that payment through just made my week. I didn't realize how much this has been weighing on me until I found out how good it feels to watch one of my balances go to zero.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/86cqw5/just_paid_off_all_of_my_credit_card_debt/", "title": "Just paid off all of my credit card debt!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "howyabean", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 48, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1521735513, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/86cqw5/just_paid_off_all_of_my_credit_card_debt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438951.855957, "replies_charged": false}
