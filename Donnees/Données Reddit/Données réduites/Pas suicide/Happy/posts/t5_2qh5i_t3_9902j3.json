I was overjoyed and excited! I worked really hard and did well in all my classes..... except one. I failed one of the core courses. One that\u2019s a prerequisite for every course in the following semester so I couldn\u2019t advance in the program without it. I was devastated. A week later I moved into a beautiful new apartment and got in a huge fight with my best friend. We didn\u2019t talk for a month. My friends from school stopped answering my messages and disappeared from my life. I felt like I had lost everything. \n\nFour months later I tried to register for the course I failed but it was full (that class has a 40-50% fail rate! Awful teacher imo). Another four months later and I try to register for the class again. There were only eight spots and I was ninth in line... so another four months pass and I find out they\u2019re offering the course in the spring semester too. So I register and I get in! Got my final marks for the course last week. 87! That\u2019s 20% more than last time. I had to do an internal application to renter the program into the proper semester. The admissions are given on a first come first serve basis (provided you pass whatever course you failed). I was so anxious that I didn\u2019t apply until mid June. I applied for September but also January because I did not believe I would get in for September. I\u2019ve also been applying for jobs because money. \n\nToday I got a call to come in for a job interview tomorrow morning. And then I got an email from my school. It was an offer of admission to my program starting in two weeks... I cried. I cried happy tears and felt a huge weight get lifted from my shoulders. \n\nThe next two weeks are going to be super busy for me! I have to run around and get all my non academic requirements taken care of and I need to pack and get ready to move. I still have to apply for financial aid, but thankfully I have enough to pay my initial fees. But I am so excited.
