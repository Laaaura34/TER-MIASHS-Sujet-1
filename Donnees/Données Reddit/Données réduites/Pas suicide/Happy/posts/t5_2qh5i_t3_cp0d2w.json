Now that I\u2019m in high school, I waited for the tryout date, and once it was released, I realized I couldn\u2019t make the tryout day because I\u2019ll be out of town. Then, I found out I could send a video submission, and I had two weeks to practice and send it. But the dance was HARD. I practiced everyday for an hour or two, and stretching out my jumps. On the last day, I eventually ended up sending it with no confidence in making the team, and the next day, the results were posted.
