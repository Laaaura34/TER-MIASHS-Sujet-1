While on our way out of the hotel to pick up dinner, my dad and i noticed a newly-wed couple (the wife was still in her gorgeous wedding dress, the husband still in his tux) and when they had turned the corner, my dad asked the person at the front desk if he could upgrade their room. we aren't rich or anything, but my dad remembers his honeymoon with my mom and wished he could have given her a better one, and wanted to help this new couple out. The lady at the desk said they had a honeymoon suite open. since it was 9:30 at night, and the chances of someone booking it were non-existent, she upgraded the couples room for free! Everyone looked happy, and I'm so glad that their honeymoon could be special.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/mtoen8/remembering_a_fun_memory_from_a_while_back/", "title": "Remembering a fun memory from a while back.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "idkthisisaspare", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618789342, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/mtoen8/remembering_a_fun_memory_from_a_while_back/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441042.6841404, "replies_charged": false}
