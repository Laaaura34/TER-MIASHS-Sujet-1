Honestly, I've been going through a really rough period lately. Without going into too much detail, not only has breaking up with a ~2 year partner been understandably terrible, but she has become a nightmare throughout it and caused me incredible stress.\n\nThat said, this weekend was a beautiful, welcome, wonderful reminder of what real love is, and its incredible power to shine light into this world. Our whole family came together to see my little sister marry her boyfriend of 5+ years whom we all love too, in a beautiful ceremony officiated by one of my other brothers. It was a night of joy and celebration, and completely rekindled my faith that no matter how awful an ex might be, there are still absolutely good people in this world who are kind, loving, and rejuvenating and they will bring a beaming light to your life, if you only open your heart to them and look beyond your current troubles.\n\nThank you for letting me share my happiness here, r/happy. I'm even more delighted being able to have a place to tell this story and share these smiles.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/68g765/its_been_a_rough_year_i_broke_up_with_my/", "title": "It's been a rough year.
