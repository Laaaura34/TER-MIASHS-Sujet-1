This month I don't have much money (due to poor financial planning), and this single bill changes everything. I'm not longer stressing about reaching the end of the month, and I'm still in shock because this was SO unlikely to happen (I'm not in the US, and it's really weird for people to have dollars with them instead of in the bank). I know someone lost them, and I feel bad for them, as it's a lot of money... But I'm just so happy I can relax and I won't have to ask my boss for an advance payment", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/b4z2s4/yesterday_i_found_100_us_dollars_on_the_street/", "title": "Yesterday I found 100 US dollars on the street.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LadyHeatherr", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1553449299, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/b4z2s4/yesterday_i_found_100_us_dollars_on_the_street/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438835.9682937, "replies_charged": false}
