I don\u2019t say anything I just pay and leave, and hope that person (or small group) smiles a little when they go to leave.\nToday at a cafe (which wasn\u2019t the cheapest place I might add) I noticed a table of 4, with a caregiver and 3 intellectually challenged individuals having a meal. \nI asked the cashier quietly to pay their bill as I paid my own. \nAs I walked to my car I was really happy and it was purely because of the feeling I had from that moment of doing something anonymously for someone else. \nI\u2019m posting this not to boast, but to share a smile of my own - that hopefully was shared by that caregiver when she went to pay her bill.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/p3jb99/i_made_myself_smile_today_and_hopefully_a_few/", "title": "I made myself smile today, and hopefully a few others too", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "L1013876509", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628843146, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/p3jb99/i_made_myself_smile_today_and_hopefully_a_few/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439589.94175, "replies_charged": false}
