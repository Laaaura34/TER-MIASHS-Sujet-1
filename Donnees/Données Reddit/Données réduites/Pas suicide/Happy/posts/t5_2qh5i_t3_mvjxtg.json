Even during times when I wasn't depressed, I thought about killing myself, so I had always sort of figured I wouldn't live past 25. That the regularly resurfacing battle with ending it all would somehow have won.\n\n\nYet here I am, 26 years old today. I have some really, really excellent friends who love me and care about me and make effort to show it; I have been able to live out experiences that I never would have dreamed I'd get to do; I have hurt, and I have healed; I have danced with strangers in the rain; I have seen sunrises I will never forget and sunsets that will never fade from my mind; I even saw a total solar eclipse.\n\n\nThe world has so many beautiful things in it, and I can feel that in my heart even when I'm not able to see them. To be alive is the greatest gift I have ever been given, and I'm so thankful that I didn't lose it in a weak moment.\n\n\nHere's to all the years to come and everything they will bring.
