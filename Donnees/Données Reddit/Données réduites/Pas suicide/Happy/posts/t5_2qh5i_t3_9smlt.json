Yes, yes she did.\n\n[edit edit] She now has brought me the book and claimed it was about \"The dinosaurs who went to school.\" when I asked how they went to school, she told me \"They took their bag.\"\n\n[edit edit edit] She just explained to me that the book is about dinosaurs... the dinosaurs are sad. When asked why, she told me that something was broken. I asked her what was broken and she told me the dinosaur was sad.  Turns out it had something to do with a wall... a few questions later and it turns out: the dinosaur is sad because it ripped the wall with his bare hands.\n\n[edit edit edit edit] This is great! She has further explained that the dinosaur... something 'handle'. So I asked if the dinosaur broke the handle, to which she said yes. I asked if this is why the dinosaur was sad and she said yes. So I asked, where was the dinosaur going? And she told me \"to school.\"\n\nSO this is the story she just invented while reading a book way too advanced for her: How did the dinosaur go to school? Did the dinosaur go in a car? Did the dinosaur go in a bus? Yes, he did and he took his bag. The dinosaur was going to school, but he became sad when he broke the handle on the door with his bare hands.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/9smlt/my_twoyearold_daughter_is_reading_a_book_way_too/", "title": "My two-year-old daughter is reading a book way too advanced for her.
