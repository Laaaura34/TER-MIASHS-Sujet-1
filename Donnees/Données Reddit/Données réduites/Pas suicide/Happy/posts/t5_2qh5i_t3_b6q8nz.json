A mixture of being complacent, thinking the job was good enough, not a lot of jobs in my chosen field, and a lack of confidence has kept me here (along with genuinely good people). It\u2019s a stressful environment, and really hasn\u2019t been good for my mental health the last few years. \n\nThis month, I applied for and got a job with a nonprofit in town. I will be doing mainly the same things, but in a much less stressful environment, and working on issues I\u2019m most interested in.
