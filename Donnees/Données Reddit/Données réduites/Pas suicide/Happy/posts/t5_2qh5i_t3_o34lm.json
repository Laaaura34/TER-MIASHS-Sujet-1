After a decade in sales, I finally grew the balls to start my dream field of writing. I found something part time working for a niche NJ magazine, and it has since grown into a more committed job. My boss is great and compliments me all the time on my good work, which makes me work harder. This morning I got to interview 2 fire chiefs, the head of a county's OEM department, and the mayor of a Jersey city about a major fire that just happened. (It is a fire fighter magazine btw) Now I get to spend all day (and probably the night) writing about the people I got to interview for a magazine that will be read by tens of thousands of people. \n\nI also finished my first song that I've written since the break up, and it's one of my favorites so far. \n\nFurther, I've been on OkC, and have a few dates lined up, some of which I'm excited about lol.\n\nI don't know if this feeling will last, but it is close to where I was back in May when I made the decision to change careers and travel (I spent the summer in Europe). It was that euphoric period that got me my ex, and it's the happiest I've ever been. I'm not there yet, but this is the best day I've had in a long time. \n\nThought I'd share!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/o34lm/first_post_never_thought_i_would/", "title": "First post... never thought I would!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "JoshuaSigmund", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1325718035, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/o34lm/first_post_never_thought_i_would/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440670.6624084, "replies_charged": false}
