Figured I wasn't getting calls because I have no experience. 2 years ago I started school for Library Science. Was given an opportunity to finally leave my job field a month ago to pursue this dream full-time. Today I got a call back for my very first library position! I am now the newest Reference Assistant!! I am beyond elated! This will be my first job non-security related in 10 years, my first ever professional position, and my highest paying job to date. It's only part-time, but it's perfect for school. Plus they help pay for my schooling which is a major plus! Oh, and they are ranked the 3rd best library in the state! I can not put enough exclamation marks in this post!! Sorry if it seems over the top, I just have no one to celebrate with right now except for my cats, and they are scared of my jumping up and down :-D", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/86e1y3/after_5_years_of_searching_i_finally_landed_a_job/", "title": "After 5 years of searching, I finally landed a job in my dream career!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Green_Day_16", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 27, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1521744971, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/86e1y3/after_5_years_of_searching_i_finally_landed_a_job/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440714.2951598, "replies_charged": false}
