Weight loss has never come easy to me, I have always had a poor self image of myself and low self esteem as a result. \n\nI weigh less than I did in high school over 15 years ago, I am finally feeling healthy for the first time, I work out every day now and do not dread it, and I naturally want to eat healthy. \n\nIf you are out there struggling, just keep at it! You will be so amazed and happy with yourself in the long run!
