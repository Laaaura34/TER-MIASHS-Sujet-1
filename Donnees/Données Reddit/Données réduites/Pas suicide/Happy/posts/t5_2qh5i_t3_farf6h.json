I am going to LA from Phoenix, for the first time ever. I have bought my concert ticket and just tonight I bought my Bus ticket. Now all I have left to do is book a hotel or Airbnb, I have not decided which one I want yet. I have been wanting to go on a solo trip for a few years and this is going to be fun!!! I just know I am gonna have a great time. I plan on seeing the sights and (hopefully) meeting some cool new people. I found this cool Hostel near the concert venue that I might try, they have private rooms so it would be just like a hotel. Granted it might cost me 200 dollars so I am not sure I want to drop that much on a place to stay. I am just super excited for this whole thing, I can't wait!!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/farf6h/i_am_going_on_a_trip_to_la_at_the_end_of_march/", "title": "I am going on a trip to LA at the end of March and I am super excited about it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mikeweasy", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1582877052, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/farf6h/i_am_going_on_a_trip_to_la_at_the_end_of_march/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441311.3855603, "replies_charged": false}
