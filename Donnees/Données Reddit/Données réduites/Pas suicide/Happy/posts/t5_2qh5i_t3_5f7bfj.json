She asked the cashier to cancel the transaction.  Cashier motions for manager.  I smile and offer to pay the balance, which was $20 something dollars.  Woman is very thankful, I tell her to pay it forward someday, cashier is happy.\n\nOn my way out the manager hands me a bouquet of mixed flowers.  He doesn't say anything, just holds the flowers out to me.\n\nI see he is overcome with emotion.  I suspect if he opened his mouth he would start to cry.  I accept the flowers with thanks and walk out feeling that, for just a few moments, the world has become a better place.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/5f7bfj/paid_for_a_young_womans_groceries/", "title": "Paid for a young woman's groceries", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "nanmart", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 400, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1480278460, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/5f7bfj/paid_for_a_young_womans_groceries/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438950.2239764, "replies_charged": false}
