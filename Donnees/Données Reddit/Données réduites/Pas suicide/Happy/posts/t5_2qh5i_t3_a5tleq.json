This year I\u2019ve had an uncle die, a man that was like a second father to me die, and a teacher that changed my life killed himself last week due to his new medications conflicting with each other. It\u2019s finals week, and I\u2019m about to take my hardest final, and I\u2019m so nervous and scared about it. This whole year has just sucked, but that one moment of kindness just made me overflow with joy. I am literally on the verge of tears writing this. So for anyone that is thinking about paying it forward, do it, I promise it will make someone\u2019s day, I know I plan on giving back. And to all you amazing people out there who have ever paid forwards, thank you all, you are truly amazing human beings.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/a5tleq/i_just_had_a_stranger_pay_for_my_breakfast_at/", "title": "I just had a stranger pay for my breakfast at McDonalds and it made me so happy it nearly brought me to tears.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "jas0942", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 28, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1544708537, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/a5tleq/i_just_had_a_stranger_pay_for_my_breakfast_at/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442130.4898624, "replies_charged": false}
