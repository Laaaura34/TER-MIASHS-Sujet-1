Not only that, but over the past year, I was able to save up 6 months of living expenses if anything happens (I'm so thankful to still have my job throughout COVID).  I increased my credit score from 640 to 785!  I also am now engaged and planning a wedding to my amazing fiance (and paying for it all in cash)!\n\nFor all of you struggling, keep persisting and you can do it!  I was in debt up to my ears and sobbing almost nightly taking care of an infant.  Anything beyond that seemed unobtainable.  Now, I have awards and shout outs from my new job, and my team increased from 5 to 15 people...I have a huge future and career growth ahead of me.
