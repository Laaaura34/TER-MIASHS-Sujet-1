For the first time ever I am actually managing my anxiety very well. I\u2019m sleeping better than I have in two years. My friends have shown me how much they care and would support me no matter what. \n\nI\u2019ve also met someone new who I talk to every day. I really feel like we have something special and it makes me super excited. I even get to meet them this weekend! \n\nOn top of all of that, things are going well with school. I\u2019ve had a lot going on recently that would usually get me down but I\u2019m feeling pretty optimistic. \n\nOnward and upward! :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/lyxafo/despite_many_challenges_recently_things_are/", "title": "Despite many challenges recently, things are looking up and it makes me optimistic", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "No__face_____1", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615018839, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/lyxafo/despite_many_challenges_recently_things_are/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441972.3148208, "replies_charged": false}
