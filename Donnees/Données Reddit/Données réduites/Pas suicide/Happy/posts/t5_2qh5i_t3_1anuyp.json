Three years since I first witnessed your charm and wit. Three years since I began to admire you and value your friendship. You have always been there for me as I have for you. You are the most wonderful, sweet, caring person I have ever met in my life. I was there for you through your divorce, as emotional support. Someone to talk to. Someone who understands you never did anything wrong and that you deserve so much more than what they could ever offer. \n\nTwo days. It\u2019s been two days since we decided to meet up for a drink. Two days since we sat for hours and talked about anything and everything. Two days since you walked me to my car. Two days since you pulled me close and gave me the most electrifying kiss goodbye. Two days since I drove home shocked and dumbfounded but so giddy and alive. \n\nOne second. There has not been one second you have not crossed my mind. \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1anuyp/its_been_three_years/", "title": "It's been three years.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "shutupandtakemybunny", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 22, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1363787995, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1anuyp/its_been_three_years/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439401.4245846, "replies_charged": false}
