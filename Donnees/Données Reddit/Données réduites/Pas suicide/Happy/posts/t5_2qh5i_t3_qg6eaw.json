Then Cole got a girlfriend. Then Cole\u2019s girlfriend wanted total control over the group, and staged a dispute between us regarding our mutual suicidalness in an (successful) attempt to turn my buddies against me. New Year\u2019s Eve, I was exiled from the group, a new group chat was made without out me, and I was left to rot in a state of perpetual suicidalness for the next few months. Cole did not care what happened to me because he thought he would get laid. He did not get laid. He got dumped. He came back to me shortly after to try and get me to be his friend again. I rejected his half-assed apology. He roasted me, officially ended the friendship, and would continue to harass me for the next month for not getting over it. I haven\u2019t spoken a word in our group chat since 2020.\n    Now that you\u2019re all caught up, things might possibly be about to change. I\u2019ve not been feeling well lately, so I took off the first few classes of the school day to go to the Doctor. By the time I got to school, it was Lunch Break. As I\u2019m walking up to Jack in the lunch line, I hear Cole say to him, \u201cYou ever wish you could be friends with somebody again, but you fucked it all up?\u201d I can\u2019t prove that he\u2019s talking about me, but if he is, that\u2019s incredible, because keep in mind the last time I texted him he was boldly refusing to accept any responsibility for what happened. It\u2019s good to know that he could finally be coming to his senses almost a year later.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/qg6eaw/the_coles_girlfriend_saga_may_finally_be_ending/", "title": "The Cole\u2019s Girlfriend Saga May Finally Be Ending!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "x_xacious", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635254890, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/qg6eaw/the_coles_girlfriend_saga_may_finally_be_ending/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442008.4988751, "replies_charged": false}
