See, what happened was that my mother was a victim of conjugal violence. We ran away, but my father was able to keep tabs on us because whenever we would go somewhere he would appear and start talking to anyone we were being friendly with. \n\nHe is able to really charm people and so everyone started liking him and when he would start asking for information as to where I was and what I was doing, they would tell him. He would show up there, and the pattern would start all over. So I started trusting people less, didn't go out much and didn't tell people much about my past. I even stopped attending religious meetings because he kept showing up and manipulating everyone into believing he was some saint. This caused me to be depressed and worn out more and more.\n\nBut finally, after about a decade of running, I've been able to turn around and start resuming life. \n\nAnd you know what? Life is great. :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/gxsr5/finally_stopped_letting_my_father_control_my_life/", "title": "Finally stopped letting my father control my life through fear :D", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lukjad007", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 168, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1303829050, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/gxsr5/finally_stopped_letting_my_father_control_my_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439391.8996813, "replies_charged": false}
