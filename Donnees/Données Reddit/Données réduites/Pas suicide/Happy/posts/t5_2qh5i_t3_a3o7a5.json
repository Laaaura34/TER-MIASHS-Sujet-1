I adore, cherish, and love him so much it hurts my heart.\n\n\nLately I am beginning to lose confidence in several aspects of my life. While at work today, I lamented to my husband via text that I am painfully dreading at the office and can't wait to get out of this toxic corporation.\n\n\nHe told me he would support my decision if I was to quit this instant. He makes enough to be able to get us by for several months, so he even suggested that I take a hiatus from the working world, and during then we could perhaps use the time to plan for our impending family of 3.\n\n\n\"You have supported me through my lowest point in life and I will not let you fall like me. It's now my turn to carry your weight, just like you did mine!\"\n\n\nGuys, I love this man so much. Having him say that (with an exclamation mark that shows determination) brought tears to my eyes it was so hard to focus on my 101 unread emails.\n\n\nMy shift ended late today and I came home to a table full of my favorite chocolate snacks. And more in the fridge. This man also knows that that day of the month is nearing.\n\n\nI found him deep asleep and gave him plenty of light kisses. Didn't wanna interrupt his sleep with my advances. Will reward him with *more* tomorrow night.
