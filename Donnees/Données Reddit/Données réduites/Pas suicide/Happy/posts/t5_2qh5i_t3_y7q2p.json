Also, one of the nicest, sweetest, most wonderful people I've ever known, despite being Baptist.\n\nI told her that my husband and I are both ordained ministers, and she asked what denomination.  I told her that I'm Pagan and my husband is Atheist.  She asked a few questions, and when I explained that atheists grieve, too, and Pagans need ministers, just like everybody else, she relaxed and said that was fine.  She told me about a conversation she'd had with a fellow Baptist and a Jewish friend of theirs, and the three ladies all agreed that once you get to heaven, there are no tags separating people from each other.\n\nIt made me happy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/y7q2p/grandmaw_didnt_give_me_crap_for_being_pagan/", "title": "Grandmaw didn't give me crap for being Pagan.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "RosieMuffysticks", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1344967664, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/y7q2p/grandmaw_didnt_give_me_crap_for_being_pagan/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441459.362429, "replies_charged": false}
