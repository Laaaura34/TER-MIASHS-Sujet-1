One day at a time, this is a lesson I never stop learning. I am at a point in my life where I truly feel I can do anything. I am free from the anxiety, and self doubt that almost destroyed me. \n\nI am very thankful for my family and friends that stick by me. They are the reasons I am alive and thriving today. I wanted to write this to say how happy and grateful I am! \n\nThis is for everyone, and a special shout out to anyone suffering from addition or depression. If you\u2019re reading these words then I am telling you you\u2019re on the first step to taking back your health and well being. It may seem bleak but, help is out there. Love is out there. I am proof of that.
