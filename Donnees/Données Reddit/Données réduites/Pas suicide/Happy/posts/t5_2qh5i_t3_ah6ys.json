The landlords said it was parked in a red zone, but it wasn't.  They went so far as to paint curb where we parked red a week *after* they had us towed.  Luckily I took a picture of the curb before they painted and showed the judge the before and after...case closed in our favor!\n\nThey are corporate so I'm sure they'll pay before it gets nasty.\n\n**EDIT** I've [included](http://imgur.com/GxAi3.jpg) a pic of the curb when I was towed and after.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ah6ys/yay_i_sued_my_landlord_for_wrongful_tow_and_found/", "title": "Yay!
