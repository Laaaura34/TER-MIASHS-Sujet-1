When we were done she told me that I was really pleasant and she liked to see how happy I was. The past few years I've been struggling with anxiety, the death of a relative and stomach issues. I've now got some good friends,  I'm starting to travel the world (my dream) and am going to be studying social sciences soon. It made me think about how far I've come :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/2ubr8u/got_a_really_nice_compliment_off_an_old_lady_in/", "title": "Got a really nice compliment off an old lady in work yesterday", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "rutterrr", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 29, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1422729364, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2ubr8u/got_a_really_nice_compliment_off_an_old_lady_in/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442185.73563, "replies_charged": false}
