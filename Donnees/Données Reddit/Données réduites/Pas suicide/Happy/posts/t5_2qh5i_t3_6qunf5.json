We've had a couple of dates, which went really well. Knowing there's someone out there thinking about me lifts up my heart the entire day, because I'm always thinking about this. She's funny, easy to talk to, smart, passionate, is honestly the most beautiful girl I've ever met, and most importantly she accepts me for my goofy self. Whether I mess it up or manage to hang on for years, I'm just glad to have had the opportunity to get to know her... I've been blessed with the opportunity to mess it up. In 3 weeks we leave to be freshmen at the same university, and I'll get to see her lots more, and I can't wait! \n\nI'm at a party at my own house right now, and it's hard for me to focus on having fun because she's not here, but is rather on my mind in whatever I do. I needed to sit down and make this post because I need to share how happy I am about my life right now. I'm happy, I'm excited, and terrified of messing it up in some way. \n\nThank you for reading, and I hope that some of my fortune is spread to all of this posts readers (if there are any). What comes around goes around, so as long as you do good things, well good things will come, I promise! I waited a long time for this exact opportunity, and not patiently, but it eventually came around.
