Now I\u2019m working full time with the largest independent broker/dealer in the US with benefits and a 401(k). Recently realized how far I\u2019ve made it and became a little complacent.

Don\u2019t compare yourself to others. These nasty habits can be broken but it\u2019s not easy. Find someone you can lean on when things get rough.
