Today I finally started gathering some courage (normally, posting on new platforms gets my anxiety up and running) and posted a survey for my media class. The response was so much more than I ever hoped to expect!\n\nI couldn't stop smiling when I left the survey for a few hours... only to come back with so many responses!!! All well thought out too!! I was beaming while reading through people's opinions! GAH, it's just so lovely knowing that this community can actually be very kind and helpful. You always hear the spooky stories about Reddit trolls and, of course, they're here and there but, for now, I'm really happy (roll credits)!\n\nHopefully, I'll be more active on Reddit... maybe even make more posts? Join more subreddits? Who knows?? The platform has endless possibilities and I want to make the most of it! Still got that fuzzy feeling from the responses though... I don't know why!! Maybe it's the pleasant surprise of it all? I'm just absolutely glowing with joy!! :D", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/f09esz/im_so_giddy_about_my_first_time_using_reddit/", "title": "I'm so giddy about my first time using Reddit properly!!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "sophald", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 15, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1581076171, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/f09esz/im_so_giddy_about_my_first_time_using_reddit/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438988.4424725, "replies_charged": false}
