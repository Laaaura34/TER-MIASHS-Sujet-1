Both relationships are going really well.  My son is genuinely Trying His Best and my wife and I respect and enjoy each other.  And we're all laughing together.  I'm not the best at making people like me but the important ones are much to be grateful for.\n\nJust read the side bar and saw that more details are required.  So...\n\nMy son is 12 and is just getting to the age of possessing some detached introspection and it's making him much more interesting.  But most importantly it's making him own his behavior and making him make good choices.  As a dad I literally could not be prouder.  That's the ideal right there and he's thereabouts.\n\nMy wife and I have been together for 13 years.   She's weird in her weird ways and I'm weird in mine.  But somewhere along the line we found a working acceptable equilibrium and became stable (summer 2010 actually) and since then our relationship has maintained momentum in positive directions.  It's still weird and quirky and might even look unhealthy if edited harshly, but it's not just satisfactory these days - it's rewarding.  She's my companion in this world.
