I was driving just now and suddenly through the clouds, the sun just peeked out for a nice minute or so. Shone bright like a summer day.\n\n\nAnd looking at it made me ridiculously happy. \n\nAnd then I realized something amazing that made me even happier. It was a joy I would have till the day I die. No matter how poor or rich I ended up, what part of the world I was in or who I was with, I will have this pleasure right until the very end.\n\n\nYep, one ticket to Flakey Land please.\n\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/nskr8/you_know_what_i_just_realized/", "title": "You know what I just realized?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mv46", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1325014309, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/nskr8/you_know_what_i_just_realized/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442259.3556724, "replies_charged": false}
