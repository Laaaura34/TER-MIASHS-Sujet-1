Lately he\u2019s been on a contract with a new yard and has been having issues. His work schedule has been absolutely insane so he\u2019s been getting home exhausted. Generally he\u2019ll eat dinner, shower, hang out with me and the kiddo for a bit then he\u2019s off to bed and snoring within minutes.\nLast night I stayed up a bit late to read. When I crawled into bed he was snoring softly so I just kissed his forehead and started to tuck up. All of a sudden he rolled over and glared at me. \nHim- \u201care we gonna do this or not?\u201d\nMe- \u201cummm do what?\u201d \nHim- \u201cload my truck?? Or are you just a lousy operator?! Huh?\u201d \nMe- \u201cbabe? You\u2019re asleep. You\u2019re not at work anymore.\u201d\nHim- \u201cyeah that\u2019s what I thought. You just don\u2019t want to work. I gotta get home to my girls and you won\u2019t load!\u201d \nMe- \u201cbaby go to sleep.\u201d\nHim- \u201cyup!\u201d\n\nFinally he stopped glaring at me and laid back down. Unfortunately ended up having a giggle fit and didn\u2019t get to sleep for another hour. \nPoor guy is so overtired he can\u2019t escape work even in his dreams!\nI love him soo freaking much.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/dfryod/15_hours_behind_the_wheel_of_a_log_truck_and_he/", "title": "15 hours behind the wheel of a log truck and he still can\u2019t escape!
