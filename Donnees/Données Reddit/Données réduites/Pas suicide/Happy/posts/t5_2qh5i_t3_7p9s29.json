I turned 18 recently and I'm starting to catch on that being an adult is just a term. I realize now that adults are nothing more than experienced kids. This has led me to question so many things about myself that I thought would be solved with age. \n\nAs a senior in high school, I desperately crave to leave my home state of Minnesota and head for Colorado( I got accepted into a college there). And yet, I wonder if I am just wrongfully assuming that a change of location means leaving behind 'my baggage'. My baggage includes things like always needing approval and being jaded/cynical. I have no idea why I'm like this and I feel like I only barely stay afloat these days. So that's why I'm here. How did you experienced kids handle these coming of age problems?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/7p9s29/guys_i_want_to_ask_you_something/", "title": "Guys I want to ask you something", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dabrit34", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1515528059, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7p9s29/guys_i_want_to_ask_you_something/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440997.3214731, "replies_charged": false}
