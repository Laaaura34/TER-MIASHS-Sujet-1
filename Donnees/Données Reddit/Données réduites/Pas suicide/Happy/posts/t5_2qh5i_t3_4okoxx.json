I loved that thing and it went everywhere with me. As the years went on, I saved my pennies through mowing lawns and eventually purchased Crystal, a Gameboy Advance, Ruby, LeafGreen, and Emerald.\n\nAnd there I stopped, because at the time the DS was ridiculously expensive for a guy who didn't have a lot of income. I did different things to pass the time; I started speedrunning Ruby (4h:29m from start to Elite 4!), played LeafGreen so much I could quote the characters, and played Crystal over and over. I made myself a promise that when I considered myself financially stable, I'd buy myself a DS and keep playing Pokemon games.\n\nI played those games as a decade went by, watching new releases come out left and right, knowing I'd eventually be able to play them. Yesterday, I made good on that promise with the 20th Anniversary Pokemon New3Ds and a used copy of Diamond. I've literally waited ten years to play these games and it's finally here! It's like seeing old friends again; this is the happiest I've been in a long time :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/4okoxx/i_finally_got_a_ds/", "title": "I finally got a DS!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Itsthejoker", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 61, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1466188709, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/4okoxx/i_finally_got_a_ds/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438846.4687982, "replies_charged": false}
