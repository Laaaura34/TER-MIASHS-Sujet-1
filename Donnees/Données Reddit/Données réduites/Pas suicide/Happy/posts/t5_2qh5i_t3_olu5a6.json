I missed him so much it landed me in the psychward 3 times trying to kms. \n\nBut im finally over it. I have a new boyfriend who I love to pieces. We hung out today and went to a park ( and made out in a tunnel so that was fun ) and im just. So happy. I havent felt _actually_ happy since my ex left me. But for once im happy.\n\nI won't be checking my ex's reddit anymore. Never again. I shouldn't care about someone who hates me when I have someone right in front of me who loves me. And I love him. \n\nOn Tuesday were gonna get drunk and maybe fuck in said tunnel. Because why tf not. \n\nIts time I moved on.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/olu5a6/now_boyfriend_inally_over_my_ex_who_i_o_seemed/", "title": "Now boyfriend, inally over my ex who i o seemed over", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "kanijn", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626483305, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/olu5a6/now_boyfriend_inally_over_my_ex_who_i_o_seemed/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441086.30884, "replies_charged": false}
