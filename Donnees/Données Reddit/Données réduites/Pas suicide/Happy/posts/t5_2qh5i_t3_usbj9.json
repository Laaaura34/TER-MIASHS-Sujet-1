Anyone who has it can spend it.  I didn't even know it was missing - must have fallen out of my handbag. \n\nShe called the card company and they were able to find me because 3 days ago I'd registered it online to be able to check the balance, etc. \n\nI was very VERY grateful, and the only info I had on the finder was a mobile number and a first name. I checked the number w/ the phone company's website to see it was a pre-pay number, and topped her credit up w/ \u20ac25...I don't have a lot of spare money or I would have done more. \n\nSo happy to see such honesty in a stranger!!
