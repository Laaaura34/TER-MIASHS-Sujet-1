Most of the posts by people (roasts and otherwise) I take it people do with good intentions of getting a chuckle and I've learnt not to take everything so literally.\nLife is short but I'm just gratuitous to having you all around who just make it better.\nI just thought I'd take some time out and just share my feelings on how amazing each and everyone of you are in your own unique ways be it being supportive or helpful or even roasting...... It just helps and it's pretty awesome.\nYou people are awesome and I just wanted to put it out there.\nHave a good one,\n13th___monkey.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/l78b2c/redditors_are_the_best_and_put_a_smile_on_my_face/", "title": "Redditors are the best and put a smile on my face every day.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "13th___Monkey", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1611866824, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/l78b2c/redditors_are_the_best_and_put_a_smile_on_my_face/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441303.485557, "replies_charged": false}
