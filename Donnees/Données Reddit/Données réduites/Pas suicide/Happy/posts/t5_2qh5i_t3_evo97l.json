So no more anxiety about my job, no more waking up @ 4am and leaving my house in the dark to commute for 2 hours via bus! No more homophobic coteacher with poor communication skills; no more observations from admin where I\u2019m stressed out about the results. No more trying to hold space for children going thru traumatic experiences while trying to sort through my own traumatic childhood. No more self-neglect and feeling \u201cnot good enough\u201d because teachers are under so much pressure, with little resources and direction. \n\nNO MORE!!!\n\nI taught for 2.5 years, in different countries and cities. I tried my best. It\u2019s too stressful for me.
