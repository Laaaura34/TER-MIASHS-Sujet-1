To be completely honest, we weren't meant to be. We didn't have much in common except that we both had shitty lives growing up. Around 3 months into the relationship, he cheated on me and proceeded to break up with me because he thought that I could, \"do better than him.\" \n\nTurns out, I could.\n\nFast forward to now, and I've been seeing this new guy for about a week now. He's kind, quirky, and super passionate about everything he gets into. He has so many hobbies and obsessions, it's so much fun to watch him run around and try to do them all. In a lot of aspects, I'm the same way. We have so many interests in common and we can just talk for hours about everything. I'm very happy with how things are going.\n\nWhile I understand that it's only been a few days, and things can change quickly, I finally feel free from the burden of feeling not good enough. Even if this guy and I don't make it far, at least I know now that I can feel safe in someone's arms again.
