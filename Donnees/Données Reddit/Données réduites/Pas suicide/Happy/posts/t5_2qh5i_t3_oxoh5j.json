I am doing good both academically and career wise but have become a shell of a person. I used to like art, dance and baking but now I can't get myself to do anything. \nBut now I want to change it and live life to the fullest and develop new passions and hobbies but the problem is how to know what I like and what I want to do. \n\n\nOn a side note, this is my attempt at starting something. Please check it out and reviews are welcomed.\n\nhttps://instagram.com/are_they_related?utm_medium=copy_link", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/oxoh5j/i_want_to_develop_a_personality_and_explore_new/", "title": "I want to develop a personality and explore new things in life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Either-Back6001", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628066898, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/oxoh5j/i_want_to_develop_a_personality_and_explore_new/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442961.3437932, "replies_charged": false}
