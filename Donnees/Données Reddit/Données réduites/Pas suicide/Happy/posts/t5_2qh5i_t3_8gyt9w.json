Coming from Venezuela, I had to get a student visa to come all the way here, and I did! In January 2017 I was able to move to Madrid, the thing I had to do now was to sustain myself and pay off my debt to the university.\n\nWhile I am technically allowed to work, it is such a long process most companies don't bother hiring people on student visas. So, I've been working as a ESL teacher, and today, after 461 days, I have finally paid off every last cent I owed, apart from paying my bills, insurance, etc. \n\nI am SO HAPPY!!!!!!!!!! Even having 50% scholarship, it was a lot of money, and now I don't have to worry about this month after month!!!!!!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/8gyt9w/after_one_year_and_four_months_of_struggling_i/", "title": "After one year and four months of struggling, I finally paid off my Master's degree!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LeoGotHisOscar", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1525436517, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8gyt9w/after_one_year_and_four_months_of_struggling_i/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441322.7943878, "replies_charged": false}
