I have never met my Grandfather (that was married to that Grandmother). He died when I was young. When my parents, aunts, and uncles were going threw photo albums, trying to take our minds off of our recent loss. We decided to take a break and look for jewelry in the casket. Inside one of her drawers we found splatter paints that my brother and I did when we were young. We also found this card given to my Grandmother from my Grandfather (we assume it was when she was ill, and he was trying to make her feel better). I haven't heard too many things about my Grandfather, except for how he died. But this sums up what type of man he was. \n\ntl;dr Never met my Grandfather, but found this card he gave to my Grandmother when she was (possibly) sick.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/cks2s/my_grandmother_died_today_this_made_it_better/", "title": "My Grandmother died today.
