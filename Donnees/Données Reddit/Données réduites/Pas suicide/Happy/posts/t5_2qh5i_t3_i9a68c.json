I\u2019ve been having a really rough time mentally the past few months and my anxiety has been at a high. \n\nI haven\u2019t been very optimistic about getting better and was very skeptical about starting therapy as well as very anxious, but it went super well! I was afraid we wouldn\u2019t get along but the therapist was a really lovely person, and we actually have a ton in common. \n\nShe managed to seamlessly balance casual conversation with mental health discussion. Talking to her felt like talking to a friend. I didn\u2019t expect but I\u2019m actually very excited and optimistic for our next session! One session and I\u2019m already in a way better mood than usual. \n\n\nTo all those out there struggling mentally that are afraid to start therapy, please do give it a try. I was incredibly anxious beforehand and as I am very socially anxious I was afraid it would be awkward, but the conversation flowed perfectly! I\u2019m really glad I gave it a try.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/i9a68c/i_was_scared_to_start_therapy_but_i_just_finished/", "title": "I was scared to start therapy but I just finished my first session and loved it!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "epicfurry360", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1597358965, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/i9a68c/i_was_scared_to_start_therapy_but_i_just_finished/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438942.2578003, "replies_charged": false}
