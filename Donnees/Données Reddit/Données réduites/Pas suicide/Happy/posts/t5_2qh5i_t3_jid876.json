It's cold and damp, and you can feel winter coming right around the corner.  I'm not a cold weather lover at all haha. Many times, the weather is a factor in my mood. This is not one of those times.\n\nIn my mind and my heart, I feel good. I feel happy. It just feels good, to feel good. To feel at peace, and just be grateful for the simplest of life's pleasures.\n\nMaybe the next time you look outside, and you see the weather isn't great, you'll remember that it doesn't matter whats going on out there --\n\nHappiness starts with you.\n\nI hope each and every one of you, embraces your happiness today :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/jid876/happiness_isnt_out_there_it_starts_in_you/", "title": "Happiness isn't out there, it starts in you! :)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "BeYourself2021", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1603713593, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/jid876/happiness_isnt_out_there_it_starts_in_you/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442222.1778996, "replies_charged": false}
