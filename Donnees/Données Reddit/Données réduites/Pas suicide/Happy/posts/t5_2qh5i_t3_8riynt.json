I\u2019m a Muslim living in Malaysia(which makes me double Muslim lol!)\n\nI\u2019ve invited some friends over to my house for a party like I do every summer.\nHowever this year the invitees are ppl from the hospital I work at. Last year were my uni friends.\n\nI knew that one of my friend is gonna bring his boyfriend as his +1. So I quickly went back through my list of invites and texted each and every one of them this note:\n\n\ud83c\udf08note: among the invites are open LGBT. If you are uncomfortable with this scene, please excuse yourself from the event. We\u2019ll catch up another time at another event. \ud83e\udd17\n\nI expected some of them would back out, with our community being pro muslim, but NOPE!\n\nThey all expressed their support and love. \n\n-Some said they\u2019d come BECAUSE it\u2019s LGBT friendly while being straight themselves. \n-One came out to me (I\u2019m very shocked, I\u2019ve known this particular friend for 8 years!)\n-Some asked me what happened the previous year that I suddenly had to add that note in...they just basically want to grab a popcorn and gossip.\n\nI.AM.FLOORED. \nI\u2019ve never expected such a reaction. \n\nMaybe some of you would not understand my excitement. Especially if you come from a country that has advanced LGBT rights movements. I get it. But nonetheless I\u2019m very happy. \nI knew that I have some great work friends: they\u2019re funny, driven and smart. But I didn\u2019t know they were THIS great, you know? \n\nAll we do is hustle hustle hustle at work. Barely have time to talk about our personal lives. We text each other only about work. \nSo I thought they were one way, suddenly it turns out they\u2019re another way.\n\nAh~ there\u2019s hope yet for my little country.
