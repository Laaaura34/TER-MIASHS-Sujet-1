The struggles we have faced such as a bad roommate, money, job issues and the feeling of not being comfortable. I had lived in the same house for my whole life but wanted to move out with my boyfriend. When I did I had such a hard time adjusting. But so much good came out of it. We now live totally alone, brought a dog into our home which we love, my lizards all have play areas outside of their cage and we've gotten so much closer. We're even building our dream business together!\n\nMy favorite part is we're finally replacing our secondhand couch and mattress!! ( they were from family member times were tough)  the best part is we got the mattress of our dreams an adjustable tempur-pedic and got a couch that we both comprised for. My sofa that includes his recliner!! \n\nTimes were so rough for so long that we thought we weren't going to make it after the lease was over but we grew to understand eachother faults and challenges which made us love eachother even more!! \n\nThe struggles made me realize that this man is the love of my life. He's my home and we built one together.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ou51jw/i_am_finally_home_after_a_year_of_struggling_with/", "title": "I am finally home after a year of struggling with comfort in my new house.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "winnie800", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 15, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627588774, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ou51jw/i_am_finally_home_after_a_year_of_struggling_with/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439569.9149592, "replies_charged": false}
