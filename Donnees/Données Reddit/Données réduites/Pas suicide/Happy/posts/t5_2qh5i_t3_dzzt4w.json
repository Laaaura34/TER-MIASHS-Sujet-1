I have a degenerative genetic condition that means my right leg no longer works, but my left leg still does. \n\nI managed to get an iWalk (it\u2019s a weird looking thing, but google it!) to start learning to \u201cwalk\u201d again. \n\nToday, for the first time in nearly 4 years, I walked for a combined total of 30 minutes! Two of the PTs at the gym said they were proud of me, because they\u2019ve seen me weight train for the last year and they know I\u2019ve been wanting and working for this for a long time. \n\nAfter the first 5 minutes, I almost cried, because this is something I never thought I\u2019d be able to do again! I\u2019m absolutely overjoyed!\n\nEdit - thank you guys so much for your lovely comments and for the gold and platinum!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/dzzt4w/i_walked_on_a_treadmill_for_the_first_time_in/", "title": "I walked on a treadmill for the first time in nearly 4 years and almost cried with joy!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "BetweenBakerSt", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 1173, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1574422613, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/dzzt4w/i_walked_on_a_treadmill_for_the_first_time_in/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441599.5861769, "replies_charged": false}
