I was in a very dark place when someone I hurt badly convinced me to change.  I tried my best and in the last year of changing myself and the friendgroup gaining more people I have never been so happy with life. I have my bad days but I know there are always people to help me. I started working out, I got back into drumming. There is a girl I still like that is in the friend group and yet even though she doesn\u2019t feel the same way, her support through my depression has been overwhelming and she has truly showed me what it means to love. Thanks for listening to my random rant lol I just wanted to express how good I\u2019ve been feeling.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/oubty7/i_am_a_15_year_old_boy_who_has_finally_found_what/", "title": "I am a 15 year old boy who has finally found what true happiness is.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Bpzieff", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627612061, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/oubty7/i_am_a_15_year_old_boy_who_has_finally_found_what/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441352.6748993, "replies_charged": false}
