I was hospitalized for two weeks. I had two major abdominal surgeries (including a bowel resectional), two blood transfusions and plasma. After release, I was quickly put into a chemotherapy program for eight months. After about a year, I was deemed healthy, but doctors told me to be cautious as it would take time to officially declare myself in remission.\n\nWell, today, I went in for a routine colonoscopy to check and see if anything has popped up. After twelve hours of peeing out of my butt with the peglyte prep, as well as a good dose of fentanyl, I was able to get an up close and personal look at my bowel and... it's beautiful! My results are all clear! No tumours or irregularities found!!!\n\nGuys, I'm honestly, actually, bowel cancer free.\n\nI... I don't even know what to do with myself now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/d013bb/my_last_title_was_too_short_so_im_letting_all_of/", "title": "My last title was too short so i'm letting all of Reddit know that I am bowel cancer free as of today, September 5th 2019.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Spankwell", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 72, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1567691479, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/d013bb/my_last_title_was_too_short_so_im_letting_all_of/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635442646.9544766, "replies_charged": false}
