A couple months after I took over, I decided it would be a good idea to have monthly get-togethers at random Asian restaurants around the state and discuss anime and other fun stuff. Granted, not a lot of people have attended these events, and at one event, nobody but me showed, but those who did have had a fun time. \n\nFast-forward to yesterday: I had another get-together, and just at the moment when I'd given up hope of anyone else ever showing, a young lady who signed up came in and sat down at my table. She seemed rather awkward, but we had a fun time talking about anime and other related stuff such as video games, and she was super-receptive to anime and video games I suggested. More importantly, it was the first time I'd ever gone out to eat with a lady, and it made me feel like I'd accomplished something. Now, I wasn't there to try to establish any romantic connections, but still, she seemed like a good person, and it was nice to make contact with someone else who was into anime.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/btf2ep/i_went_out_to_eat_with_a_lady_for_the_first_time/", "title": "I went out to eat with a lady for the first time in my life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "NewEnglandSynthOrch", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 19, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1558915009, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/btf2ep/i_went_out_to_eat_with_a_lady_for_the_first_time/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441312.6217225, "replies_charged": false}
