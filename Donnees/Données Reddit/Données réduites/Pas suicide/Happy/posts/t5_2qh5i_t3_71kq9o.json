I was always terrible at having bosses. Hated school, abhorred working for other people. Saw no way out. Figuring out I could make money selling vintage clothes was so fucking awesome to me. When I was growing up in the '90s I was addicted to The Mary Tyler-Moore show. I remember going to my first thrift store when I was in tenth grade and getting to see and feel all the clothes like from that show. I was in heaven. I was always obsessed with vintage clothes. I certainly don't make a killing doing this, but it allows me to use my creativity and blossom some business skills, learn about advertising and social media, be my own boss and in control of my own time (which is utterly essential to my well-being and constitution) and how much money I make, make my own schedule so I can focus on my other blossoming interests and businesses, and live a healthy life that feels good to me. So I'm feeling very appreciative of that today. <3 I hope you get to do work that makes you feel good, r/happy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/71kq9o/today_is_my_sixth_anniversary_of_getting_to_work/", "title": "Today is my sixth anniversary of getting to work for myself and be in complete control of my own life and time.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "starchildx", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1506014945, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/71kq9o/today_is_my_sixth_anniversary_of_getting_to_work/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635441453.4375882, "replies_charged": false}
