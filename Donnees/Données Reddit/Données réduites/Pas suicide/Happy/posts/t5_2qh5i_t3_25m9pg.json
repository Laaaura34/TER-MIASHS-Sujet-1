But I'm so happy I want to share!\n\nAs the title says, the blood results show amazing improvement. And all this without medication. I'm not one of those conspiracy theorists who believe that medicines are evil but I was very reluctant to go on medication: it's very new and I wasn't willing to live with the side effects. Fortunately my condition is rather good so the doctor has not seen any reason to prescribe medicine. The improved results just mean I'll less likely require them.\n\nI attribute the improvement to taking responsibility over my own life and making healthy changes. I started running and remain physically active through the week. I've also been meditating daily for the past 2 months along with some yoga breathing and tai chi. I take my vitamins, eat healthy and -- most importantly -- I started sleeping by 11pm.\n\nI've also been doing a lot of therapy exercises. I'm human too, I've got that inner typhoon to take care of.\n\nI've also started taking the time to do things I enjoy, things that really matter to me. Which got me thinking: how many of us put that off? Yes, there is work to do and bills to pay but after all that how many of us are too tired to give ourselves the time to do what truly matters to us? It's like we give everyone else our time but ourselves.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/25m9pg/the_blood_results_show_significant_improvement/", "title": "The blood results show significant improvement!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lim2me", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1400154342, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/25m9pg/the_blood_results_show_significant_improvement/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438855.730571, "replies_charged": false}
