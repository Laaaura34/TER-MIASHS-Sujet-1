We have this tradition of having long hugs everytime we run into each other. And she's managed to make my heart melt and feel like I'm in heaven on multiple occasions. \n\nShe's like the perfect hug buddy to me. We're both in our early 20s, but she has that youthful expression on her face and in her attitude. And there's just the right height difference to where I can just melt into her and she can feel protected in my arms. \n\nPrior to the hug, I can hear so much happiness in her voice and uses the right words to express it. Last time, she told me \"I miss you!\"  When we literally last saw each other three days ago. All this was accompanied by very slight swaying. \n\nI love seeing her so happy. Like her life feels so perfect and all of her problems disappear when she's in my arms. \n\nCall it a special friendship, so close to each other, whatever. Even though a bf/gf relationship seems highly unlikely, she still has a special place in my heart.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/pnwimp/i_love_seeing_her_so_happy_especially_when_we_hug/", "title": "I love seeing her so happy.
