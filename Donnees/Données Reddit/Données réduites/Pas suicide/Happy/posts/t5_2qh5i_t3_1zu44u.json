I can express myself, release energy, get away from my desk job, help raise money for multiple causes (heart cancer, autism research, etc.), and provide great memories for myself and, more importantly, the children. I like to think that as long as I add a little happiness to their lives then I have done a decent enough job.  \n  \nTL;DR I love working with children and I have combined that love with my love for helping people into an opportunity to work with children and raise thousands of dollars for cancer research", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/1zu44u/i_have_always_been_better_at_working_with/", "title": "I have always been better at working with children than adults", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Take_A_Penguin_Break", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1394223954, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1zu44u/i_have_always_been_better_at_working_with/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438915.4294474, "replies_charged": false}
