When I sit down next to him, he calmly instructs me to move. When I talk to him, he firmly suggests that I stop. When i call him bubba, he patiently reminds me of his christian name.\n\n\nThis toddler is made of stone.\n\n\nBut I've been working on this little brat, it only took him a year and a half to say my name, and today, for whatever reason, we had a breakthrough. Weirdly, it was my high heeled shoes.\n\n\nMy family is kind of natural, and I must be the only person he knows who wears clackity heels, and he heard me clacking across the floor and asked to try on my 'boots.'\n\n\nWe sat down and tried to put them on but stepping into them worked better. It was a detailed extravaganza, but 'THEY'RE TOO BIG.' Yep, told ya! So then we put all his toy snakes inside them instead.\n\n\nBut the real happy is that my strict fundy christian family didn't say a damn thing because THEY'RE JUST SHOES, and we were having a great time, and he learned high heeled maryjanes just aren't his style.\n\n\nLater he dropped something valuable in the river. He's the best.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/kgnnrs/my_three_year_old_nephew_tried_on_my_shoes_today/", "title": "My three year old nephew tried on my shoes today", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Alabaster_Canary", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1608438985, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/kgnnrs/my_three_year_old_nephew_tried_on_my_shoes_today/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635439326.3652723, "replies_charged": false}
