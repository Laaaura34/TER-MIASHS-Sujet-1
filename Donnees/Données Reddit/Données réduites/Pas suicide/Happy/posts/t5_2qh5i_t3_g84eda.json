Lying here with him makes me realise how fortunate I am to have him, and I\u2019m so glad I get to spend the rest of my life with him! \n\nHope everybody is finding little moments of happiness at this current time :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/g84eda/lying_in_bed_with_my_sleeping_boyfriend_and/", "title": "Lying in bed with my sleeping boyfriend and realising that there\u2019s literally nothing better", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "beckforddd", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 15, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1587859936, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/g84eda/lying_in_bed_with_my_sleeping_boyfriend_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440864.4045737, "replies_charged": false}
