Today I went to work on my day off to help facilitate a meet and greet with potential adopters for him. I was really proud of how well the dog did during his greeting, he had some reaction at first to the strangers but he quickly turned around. We actually had 2 meets and the dog did well with both, then the original owner picked the couple I favored to adopt his dog. I am so happy for them all!! \n\nDuring the time I was doing the meet and greet, I got a text from my sister. She and her husband have been going through the process of becoming foster parents, and they have finally had 2 kids placed with them! Over the moon happy for them!! They've had lots of struggles and have worked so hard to become foster parents. I called my sister as soon as I was able and the joy in her voice fills my heart. \n\nCrying happy tears thinking about it all even though I should be sleeping. It feels good to have a fulfilling job and an awesome family.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/d4vvkc/i_had_a_really_awesome_day_helped_a_dog_and/", "title": "I had a really awesome day!
