To allow you to feel tender and express emotions without feeling stressed by them or like they're gonna run away with you. Soothing and comforting I suppose is what I want to impart. I can't seem to get it right, so I've been asking people: what scent comforts you and makes you feel happy, or when you smell it you have a sense that everything is gonna be ok?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/mfgtwv/making_emotional_support_fragrance_but_cant/", "title": "Making emotional support fragrance but can't capture the right scent.
