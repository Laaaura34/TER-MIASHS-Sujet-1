It honestly made me feel terrible about myself. She was my first kiss (I was 19, I know I'm a late bloomer)\n\nTonight, I finally kissed someone else. I know it doesn't seem like much, but I'm a person who doesn't make many advances on people I fancy. I feel that this is me finally starting a new chapter, regaining confidence and getting over someone who used me and then left me. \n\nI also just realised it happened on Valentine's Day, so here's to new love and beginnings! I'm just really happy about this, so I figured I'd post about it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/2vurpa/finally_kissed_someone_who_wasnt_my_ex/", "title": "Finally kissed someone who wasn't my ex!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "doctorpotters", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 35, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1423898172, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2vurpa/finally_kissed_someone_who_wasnt_my_ex/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438851.8395445, "replies_charged": false}
