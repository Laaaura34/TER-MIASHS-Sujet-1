I was neglected as a child making it feel like there was no safe place for me to escape and relax to and I\u2019ve been living on my own, moving from place to place for the past few years and nothing has felt \u201cright\u201d. It\u2019s always felt so temporary and like I\u2019m just waiting and hoping the next place fulfils that void. \n\nI am moving again, mid-month, so I\u2019m crashing at my boyfriends place for two weeks and he has made it his mission to make his space feel like a home for me because he knows how much it means to me. He has been cleaning, organizing and prepping his room for my stay and im just so grateful for how much he\u2019s doing for me. \n\nHe even said that I could make a small garden in his backyard because he knows how much I\u2019ve always wanted one of my own and since I\u2019ve been apartment living, I\u2019ve never been able to have one myself. \n\nI\u2019ve never felt this loved before nor experienced someone making me feel so happy and grateful for their existence.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/o4myvy/so_grateful_for_my_partners_support_and_love/", "title": "So grateful for my partners support and love.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "littlebeanterritory-", "subreddit": "happy", "subreddit_path": "r/happy/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624249517, "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/o4myvy/so_grateful_for_my_partners_support_and_love/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635440965.0639565, "replies_charged": false}
