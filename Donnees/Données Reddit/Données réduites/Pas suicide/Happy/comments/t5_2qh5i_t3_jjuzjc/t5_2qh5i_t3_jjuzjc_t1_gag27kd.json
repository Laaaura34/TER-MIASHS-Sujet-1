The reason I\u2019ve never voted before personally is because I didn\u2019t think my vote would matter anyways. Being a liberal in Florida, at least in the area I live in, I\u2019m surrounded by Trump signs everywhere I go. Even back in 2016 it was that way. So I figured \u201cwhy bother, when he\u2019s going to win the state anyways.\u201d Also, back then, I honestly did think Hillary was going to win, so thought foolishly \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to vote because no way someone like trump could actually win right?\u201d I mean that\u2019s what \u201ccommon sense\u201d dictated and all the \u201cpolls\u201d were saying, right? I literally remember hearing about the access Hollywood recording and saying/laughing out loud \u201cTrump is done for. There\u2019s absolutely no way he\u2019s going to win now.\u201d\nYea.....I learned that year to never underestimate the stupidity/gullibility of the average person, and the power of free press. \n\nThat being said, I, like a lot of first time voters who have had the declined opportunity before, feel like there\u2019s a lot more at stake now, (for obvious reasons) and that things have been going far too south the the last four years. Thanks to Trump and the varied and widespread media coverage he has created, I\u2019m also a lot more educated on how the the government works overall and that the president isn\u2019t the only thing you\u2019re voting for when voting....think about it....how many people around my age back in 2012 and earlier could say they know details about as many people and as many names in the government? At least that\u2019s one good thing that has come of all of this.....I think people are definitely learning a lot more about the system and paying more attention these days. It\u2019s unavoidable. \n\nThat being said....screw the polls, my money is still on Trump taking it home again. I feel like as a pessimist; that\u2019s the only stance/expectation I can reasonably make.....if I\u2019m wrong, then yay! If I\u2019m right, then at least the blow will be less disappointing, since I expect it coming.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/jjuzjc/i_am_34_years_old_and_just_voted_for_the_very/gag27kd/"}
