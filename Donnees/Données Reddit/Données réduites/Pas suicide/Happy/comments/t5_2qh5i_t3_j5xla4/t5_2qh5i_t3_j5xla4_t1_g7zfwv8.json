I had a similar situation with my dog, a 2 year old Pitbull, from the beginning. The dog park was very scary and nerve racking for him. I looked into why this might be happening, and I discovered that many veterinarians, dog trainers, and even animal psychologists, actually believe the dog park, while sometimes necessary, is not all it\u2019s cracked up to be, or just generally worthy of some caution. While its true dogs originally evolved as social animals, these groups were mostly consistent, allowing dogs to form bonds and have constant companionship to feel more secure when meeting new groups. Domestic dogs also are used to socializing with your household, and smaller groups of dogs they meet on the street in their everyday life. A large group of totally unfamiliar animals can be quite foreign to them. It\u2019s totally normal for dogs to feel overwhelmed and anxious being there. Obviously this is something you and your pup will need to feel out together but I thought I\u2019d mention it <3 \n\n[https://apdt.com/resource-center/dog-parks-good-bad-ugly/](https://apdt.com/resource-center/dog-parks-good-bad-ugly/)\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/smarter-living/the-dog-park-is-bad-actually.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/smarter-living/the-dog-park-is-bad-actually.html)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/j5xla4/our_first_dog_park_trip_it_wasnt_fun_but_i_think/g7zfwv8/"}
