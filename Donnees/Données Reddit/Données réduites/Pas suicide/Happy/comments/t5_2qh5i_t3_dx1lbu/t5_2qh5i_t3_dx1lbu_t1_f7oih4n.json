Those people would be better served with a CICO approach because the signals their body sends aren't in line with their caloric needs.\n\nIt's downvoted because it's lazy, unsolicited advice that also happens to not be very helpful.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/dx1lbu/im_16_and_very_over_wate_yet_i_look_at_my_self/f7oih4n/"}
