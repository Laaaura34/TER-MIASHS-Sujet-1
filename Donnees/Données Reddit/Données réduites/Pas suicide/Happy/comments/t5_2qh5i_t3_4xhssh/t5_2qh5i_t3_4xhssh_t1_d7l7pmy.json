Escaping to it was like a coping mechanism of sorts, to help fulfil something in your life that wasn't being fulfilled in reality- namely the romance. \n\nWhen you proposed to your now wife (congratulations) your mind had to go back to that dream world one more time to show you that, that land you needed is now barren. Almost as if it was all along, but for the first time you were able to see it through critical eyes- as if you took the Rose goggles off. Telling your dream girl you'll always love her was like saying goodbye to a loved one before they pass away. It was your mind's way of saying goodbye to your old self and throwing you into the next chapter of your life, that you'll share with your wife. \n\nI have similar dreams and similar themes that stopped not too long ago due to a similar reason. \nI could easily be absolutely wrong but it's definitely something worth thinking about, and if it's right, then that's all the more reason to be happy! :) ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/4xhssh/my_dream_girl_although_this_is_a_repost_i_think/d7l7pmy/"}
