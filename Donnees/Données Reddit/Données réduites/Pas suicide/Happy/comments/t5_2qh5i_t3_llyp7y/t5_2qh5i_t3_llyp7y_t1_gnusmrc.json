Thanks, as well, for the compliments. They mean a lot to me. The moment I captured here was by far the most powerful set of emotions I've felt so far. \n\nTo answer your question, it certainly moves in phases and it's not linear at all. Some days, I feel like a frickin' princess. Some days... not so much. I will say that it continues to provide more all the time. Every time I say to myself, \"okay, I guess that's all I'm really going to get out of this,\" I get something more. I feel more aligned. I'm only 16 months into my transition right now, meaning I have years to go still before the effects of hormone replacement plateau. It's just phenomenal to constantly realize I'm growing more into my own self with each day.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/llyp7y/im_hesitant_to_post_this_outside_of_lgbt_specific/gnusmrc/"}
