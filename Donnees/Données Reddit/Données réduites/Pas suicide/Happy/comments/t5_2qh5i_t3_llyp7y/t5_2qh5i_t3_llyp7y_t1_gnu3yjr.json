We are just starting to try shopping for women\u2019s clothing together. It\u2019s a bit nerve wracking. I want to do the best job at making it easier and better but I don\u2019t always know exactly how. Did you do any shopping for items in person?  Did you try things on?  How did you handle that?  Do you have any tips for the two of us?\n\nWe did work out last trip that I will do the actual purchase and get paid back since the purchase of items is scary but would be interested in any other tips before our next shopping excursion. \n\nAnd thank you for being here where I could ask.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/llyp7y/im_hesitant_to_post_this_outside_of_lgbt_specific/gnu3yjr/"}
