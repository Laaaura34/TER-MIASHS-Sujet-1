I have wanted SO BADLY to grow some shrooms as a personal supply to help with my severe MDD and GAD. I remember whenever I was tripping that I truly felt great and appreciative and warm and happy. And I\u2019ve been doing Ketamine treatments for it, but they cost $400 a pop. So since I\u2019ve heard about psilocybin helping with PTSD, MDD, and GAD, I\u2019ve really wanted to try it again. I just don\u2019t have a connection. I even bought a book about it. I\u2019m gonna try this ASAP.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/pc66ev/life_is_so_dang_hard_and_my_cluster_headaches_are/hahw48c/"}
