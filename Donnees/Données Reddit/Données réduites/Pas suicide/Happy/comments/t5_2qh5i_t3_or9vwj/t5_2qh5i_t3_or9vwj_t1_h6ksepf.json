My phobia is on a pretty functional level, so I can cook meat fine, but I get extremely nervous when trying out new places or when I can't see the kitchen/know if they're handling their meat properly. Others have this phobia on a deeper level and will avoid all eating out, cook their own food and maybe never eat meat because of it.\n\nThere's also the fear of cross-contamination, or catching norovirus (gastro). The Norovirus fear is my biggest stress factor, personally. It's also to a point that most emetophobes will want to prevent vomiting that we'll \"force\" it down.\n\nWhich is silly (and we know it) because you feel better after. but phobias are rarely logical.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/or9vwj/i_have_severe_emetephobia_and_wont_let_raw_meat/h6ksepf/"}
