So far with my time here in Toronto since November everyone\u2019s been amazing! I haven\u2019t really had anyone who\u2019s been too inebriated because of the lockdowns! And since I decorated for Christmas and then Valentines I thought \u201chey I should decorate for St. Patrick\u2019s Day and while people get into the Uber car and take pictures remind them that We can still celebrate St. Patrick\u2019s Day at home!
