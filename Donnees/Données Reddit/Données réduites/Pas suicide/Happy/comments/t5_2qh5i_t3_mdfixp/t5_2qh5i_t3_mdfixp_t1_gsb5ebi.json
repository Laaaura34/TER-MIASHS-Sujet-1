The company I was with I believe was dangerous in how they treated employees especially ones with mental illness. There were multiple suicide attempts and one success at the place I worked and when I brought it up they tried to claim that work environment has nothing to do with why anyone would try to commit suicide and it\u2019s only because their brains are fucked up. I\u2019ve struggled with those feelings my entire life and while I understand sometimes people just give up, work environment absolutely has a lot to do with mental stability. \n\nI once told them I couldn\u2019t stay late because I had to go home to take care of my dogs and they told me \u201cno, your dogs will be fine we need you here\u201d. I was flabbergasted to say the least.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/mdfixp/i_got_the_job_i_really_wanted_and_start_monday_i/gsb5ebi/"}
