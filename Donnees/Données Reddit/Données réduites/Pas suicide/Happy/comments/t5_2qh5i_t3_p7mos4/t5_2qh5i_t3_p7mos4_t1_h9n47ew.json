Massive congratulations!!! \n\nI remember when my husband proposed. I knew he was going to. (We\u2019d been together 10 years. Had kids together.  But I\u2019d never wanted to marry.  I\u2019d changed my name.) \n\nIt was simple. In a hotel room. We had the most beautiful wedding. 12 guests. I wanted it small.  It was besutiful! He gave the most stunning speech. Our children were bridesmaids and it\u2019s been the best day. \n\nWe\u2019re still happily married. Years later. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/p7mos4/my_best_friend_proposed_to_me_this_morning_and_i/h9n47ew/"}
