Nothing feels better that this moment right here. It's truly a new world journey. Looking forward to the update post in your new job! And after your 3 month probationary period when you are pleading with HR for more personal time. When you realize you left a great job to get this start up company running and its beautiful! But nobody sees your vision and so your stocks go down for a while. Hopefully your company plan includes an EPA line. I found that helpful after 8 months.\nBut seriously though,  Hold on to those stocks because your initial investment will pay off big time in years to come. This is good work and it might feel underappreciated and solitary at times but you will be rewarded so much more down the road. Enjoy the ride! Remember,  HR is only a call away ;)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/iu480a/just_started_a_new_job_with_higher_pay_and_no/g5j1700/"}
