I also do intermittent fasting - I only eat from noon to 6 pm. Switched to only drinking water and I hover around 1500 calories a day. Was 294 on June 2nd and hit the above weight today. Good luck on your journey my dude!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/p01tze/after_3_years_of_being_close_to_300_today_i/h83uu96/"}
