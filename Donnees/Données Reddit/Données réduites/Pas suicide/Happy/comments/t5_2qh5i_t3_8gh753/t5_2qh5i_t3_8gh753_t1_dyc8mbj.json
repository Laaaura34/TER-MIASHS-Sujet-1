Take comfort in the fact that it's just going to get better from this point on. I don't know what substance you are struggling with, but if it's heroin or opiates, don't hesitate to see a doctor who prescribes Suboxone. Not only will it lessen the withdrawals, it will also prevent you from being able to get high from opiates for several hours after you take it. \n\nFeel free to message me at any time, for any reason. I promise that I will have time for you, and I promise that you don't have to face this alone. \n\nAnd I promise that, from here on out, things will only get better.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8gh753/well_folks_today_i_have_been_sober_for_one_year/dyc8mbj/"}
