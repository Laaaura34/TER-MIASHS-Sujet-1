Heroin is a mother fucker. I\u2019ve never tried it but after my ex and I broke up she got shot up by a bf and she\u2019s been on a bender for 4 years or more. She\u2019s been in and out of rehab and jail. It\u2019s so sad since she was so smart and funny and could of done anything. Now she\u2019s just posts pics of herself strung out in lingerie and nudies on social media. Also had a couple close friends struggle with opiates and alcohol. It sucks knowing you cant control yourself but that\u2019s just how life\u2019s gonna be. Definitely going sober tonight :) before you know it you will be at day 100!
