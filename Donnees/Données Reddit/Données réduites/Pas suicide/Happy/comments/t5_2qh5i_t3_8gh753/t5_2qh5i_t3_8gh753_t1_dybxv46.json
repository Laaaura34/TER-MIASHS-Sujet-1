Looking back, I can hardly remember how happy I was, but I know I was happy and felt better than any other time in my life. \n\nI remember the day I decided to drink. I bought my favorite beer and sat in my room with it for hours, and couldn\u2019t bring myself to drink it. I didn\u2019t even really want it. But I\u2019d decided that I was going to have it.\n\nI drank the first beer and didn\u2019t like the way it made me feel, so I drank another, and another, until they were gone. I went to bed frustrated and angry. It had lost its magic. \n\nThe next day the hangover was horrible. I felt nauseous and fatigued and the fabric of reality had a hostile hue. I immediately bought more beer and have basically been drinking every free moment since. \n\nNow it brings me pleasure again, because I have a tolerance, and it\u2019s the only way to feel relief from hangover/withdrawal. \n\nI know I need to get sober again. But because my life isn\u2019t in crisis, I don\u2019t see it coming.\n\nI miss waking up feeling good, excited for the day, full of life.
