To simplify it, there are 2 receptors in your brain, on, and off. Alcohol is a depressant, right? So it attaches to the off receptor I think, which increases how it works. This makes the on receptor try to play catch up. If you continue to drink often your on receptor will start working overtime, so if you quit cold turkey, it will still be doing that. This can cause things like trembles (this is also why your hands might shake the morning after drinking), and of course seizures. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to seek medical help because they can help you slowly work down to being sober.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8gh753/well_folks_today_i_have_been_sober_for_one_year/dycmd40/"}
