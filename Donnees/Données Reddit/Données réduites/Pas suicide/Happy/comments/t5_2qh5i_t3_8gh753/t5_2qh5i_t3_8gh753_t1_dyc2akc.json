They are open back planar headphones. Perfect bass reproduction and extend really low. They have a felt earpad, so I can wear them forever and never get sweaty or uncomfortable. Can be had for under $200. Best with a headphone amp like a FiiO Q1 or something, but work fine with a phone. I use them for gaming and music on my PC.\n\nFor closed back I enjoy the M50x and AKG K553 PRO. I use my K553 far more than my M50x. I use closed back for work and mobile use.\n\nYou can obviously spend more in each category but these were the price/quality sweet spot for me.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8gh753/well_folks_today_i_have_been_sober_for_one_year/dyc2akc/"}
