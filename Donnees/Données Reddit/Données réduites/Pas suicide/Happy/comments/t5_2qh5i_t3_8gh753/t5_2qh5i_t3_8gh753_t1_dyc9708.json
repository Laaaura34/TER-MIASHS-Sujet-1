Funny thing is, even when I was drinking, alcohol didn\u2019t make me feel the way I wanted. Maybe one night out of seven, I felt carefree, silly, unstoppable and happy. Most other nights I felt pretty shitty, but didn\u2019t have any solution other than to keep drinking. \n\nNow that I\u2019m sober, I don\u2019t have those happy carefree nights nearly as often, but my overall happiness has gone way up. And those miserable, \u201cI don\u2019t want to feel this way anymore but I don\u2019t want to sober up,\u201d nights are gone forever.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely worth it to try again.
