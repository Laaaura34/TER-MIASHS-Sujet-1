I literally recently did some basic yoga for about 10 minutes and I was awfully dizzy for a good 20 minutes. I still struggle to motivate myself to get healthy, even as my health is obviously declining. Please and try to take care of yourself, for your future self that has a chance to be happy <3", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/nrfw6p/pushed_myself_to_go_to_the_gym_despite_being_in_a/h0gp0w6/"}
