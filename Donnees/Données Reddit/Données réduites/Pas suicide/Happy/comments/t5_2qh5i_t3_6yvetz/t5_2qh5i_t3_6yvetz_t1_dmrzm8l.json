Did you teach yourself? I ask because my dad never taught me any skills and paid people to do everything. I have taught myself every skill I know (within reason) and I'm very proud of myself for it. I do wish my dad (step dad/dad since I was 4) had cared to learn some skills and than taught me. I taught myself to do almost all my own car diagnostic/work, gun safety/shootings/basic plumbing/tile, you get the idea...\nAnyways I would love to learn to make those joints using the various tools you used...
