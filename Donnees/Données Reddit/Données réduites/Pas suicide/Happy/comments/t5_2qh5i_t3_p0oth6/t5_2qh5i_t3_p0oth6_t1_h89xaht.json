I tried to end a toxic relationship several times and she would talk me back in. Once she pulled a knife on me and put it to my throat it was finally over. It was the best but yet worst relationship I've been in. It's been 6 months and I still think about her and still can't find another who matches her energy in or out of the bedroom. I know I'm better off without her and I know I'll find someone else who won't kill me or demand my phone once a week for random checks.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/p0oth6/i_finally_did_it_i_stood_up_for_myself_and_ended/h89xaht/"}
