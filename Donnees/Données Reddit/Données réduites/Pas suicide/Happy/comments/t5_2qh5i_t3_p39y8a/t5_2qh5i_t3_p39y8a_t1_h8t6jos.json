When you\u2019re approaching an intersection, even if you have the greenlight look to see what the people coming from the perpendicular directions are doing. Don\u2019t immediately rushed into an intersection if you\u2019re first in line at a green light. slow down and take your time if it makes you more comfortable, don\u2019t block people who are merging, pull over if somebody is driving dangerously behind you.\n\nWhile a lot of these things are not your responsibility, and you can\u2019t change them through your actions, you can remove yourself from the situation and make your driving experience safer through small actions.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/p39y8a/got_my_drivers_license_at_19_after_years_being/h8t6jos/"}
