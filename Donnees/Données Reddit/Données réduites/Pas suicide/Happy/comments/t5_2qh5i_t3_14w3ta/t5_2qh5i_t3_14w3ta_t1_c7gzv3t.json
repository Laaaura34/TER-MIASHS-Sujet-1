Congratulations, I am super proud of you! :hug:\n\nThree things: please apply for your scholarships now for next semester, try for the technical book grants at your college financial aid office and ask about any foundation scholarships available. Also, remember to connect with your college by joining a fun club and jumping into activities on campus. If you ever lose your way or get stressed and or lonely, you pay for a service on your college campus that has student assistance and counseling for free which is cool. (in case you ever need advice or need to talk). \n\nGood luck in school,  kiddo! \nEdit:typo\n", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/14w3ta/just_wanted_somewhere_to_post_that_isnt_facebook/c7gzv3t/"}
