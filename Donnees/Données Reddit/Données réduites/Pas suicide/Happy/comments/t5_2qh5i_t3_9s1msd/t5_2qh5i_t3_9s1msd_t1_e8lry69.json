That percentage diminishes with age but the best advice I can that I was given is not to worry about any scheduling (ovulation detection etc.)  Just have intercourse every other day (since sperm lives for 1-3 days up to a week inside.) your basically ensuring sperm should be hanging out at the egg when it's time)to allow the male time to recover with fresh sperm.
