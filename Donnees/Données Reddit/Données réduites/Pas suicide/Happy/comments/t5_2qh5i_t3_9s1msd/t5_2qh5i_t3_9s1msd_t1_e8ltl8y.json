Copy and paste from another post I tell everyone this. First congrats! \n\nCongrats OP! \n\nIf you don\u2019t already have a will established and advanced directives you should set that up. If you don\u2019t have life insurance I urge you to look into it. Also write your son a letter in case something happens to you, along with a hand written letter. \n\nAlso if your into it, write him a letter every birthday. Give him those when he gets older. \n\nLastly, make a email for him (or flash drive whatever) take pictures of him and add stories to it. Give it to him whenever. \n\nYou never know when something could happen to you. I lost my dad at 9 and always wonder about him and what he would think of me now. \n\nGood luck OP, it\u2019s an amazing journey! \n\n\nAlso OP. I have a flash drive with different letters to my wife. One for her. One for her for different scenarios if she needs help, as if I\u2019m in a coma for x amount of time or I\u2019m in surgery and they want to take a appendage etc. it\u2019s all written out for her. But at the end it says something like, I love you and I trust you with my life I know you\u2019ll make the right call and don\u2019t ever question yourself. \n\nI deal with death a lot and I\u2019ve seen people set their family up for success vs those who don\u2019t and it\u2019s night and day. \n", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9s1msd/after_my_wife_and_i_had_two_failed_pregnancies/e8ltl8y/"}
