Biochemically no different than eating large quantities of chocolate. \n\nI've been in love before and while it does feel great - uncontrollably smiling all the time, feeling giddy with happiness and having amazing sex - it pales in comparison to one particular experience I had on ecstasy in a club in London called Fabric. \n\nAs I was coming up I remember feeling like there was something unnaturally sinister at work - like it was hacking into my brain and overriding the serotonin receptors with brute force. The pleasure was so intense it felt like electricity. I honestly don't think I could have that experience without drugs. I suspect our nervous-systems have not evolved to process that level of intensity.\n\nEdit: FWIW, I only took ecstasy about 10 times in my life. I haven't taken it in about 5 years. I don't think its a good idea and I don't recommend it. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9m5n0/i_just_realized_my_girlfriend_is_my_best_friend/c0dcyc1/"}
