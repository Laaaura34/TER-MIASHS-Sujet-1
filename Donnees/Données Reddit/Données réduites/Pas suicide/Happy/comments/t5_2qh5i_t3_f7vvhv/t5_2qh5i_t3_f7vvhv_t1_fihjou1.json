When I was 16 I told my step mom, while we were folding laundry, that I had asked a girl to homecoming. Her hand sprung out so fast to slap me across the face, I barely had time to flinch. My dad lectured me on how I needed to find a better way/ time to tell them, and that they hoped it was only a phase. Still bisexual, over 14 years later. \n\nYour girl is luckier than she knows.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/f7vvhv/my_16_year_old_daughter_went_on_her_first_date/fihjou1/"}
