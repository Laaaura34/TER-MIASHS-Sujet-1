He would carry it over to my spot on the couch and put it in my spot then curl up next to it.  The day I came home he smelled me as soon as the door opened and got so excited that he was literally running into walls and doors trying to track me down.  He buried his face in my arms and just kept sniffing me and wagging his tail.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/a38ek/dogs_welcoming_home_soldiers/c0foibz/"}
