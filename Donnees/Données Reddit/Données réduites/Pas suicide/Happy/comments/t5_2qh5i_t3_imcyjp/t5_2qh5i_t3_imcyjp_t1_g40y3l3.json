I think I smoke, call out people's bullshit, and swear too much for that \ud83d\ude02 I just was never happy to settle and I have always had a mind geared for medical stuff but never the patience to do university or a desk job future. I also am /not/ nurse material. I hugely respect those that do it but my MIL was the absolute best I'd seen. She could scare a patient who was being an absolute dick without uttering a single curse and her voice sounded like a Disney character when she got mad as she never ever raised her voice either. She was the inspiration. She genuinely ran away to nursing school for her escape. I miss her every day.\n\nI just was tired of being abused and poor and too scared to stand up for anything. The army helped me find my anger and use it to my advantage. Anger can be a weapon when you don't let it control you but also don't hide from it. I literally bled to get where I am but I don't regret a thing.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/imcyjp/i_did_it_i_finally_made_it_and_it_took_buying_a/g40y3l3/"}
