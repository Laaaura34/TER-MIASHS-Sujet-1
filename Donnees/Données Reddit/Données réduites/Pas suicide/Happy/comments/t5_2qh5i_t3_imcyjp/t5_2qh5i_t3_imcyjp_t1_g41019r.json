I'm just happy to prove the statistics wrong and keep working my way up so my future child never has these hurdles to overcome. My husband has not had much of any adversity financially and he sometimes doesn't get it. He still sees us as poor cause his mum was a nurse, step dad works in a nuclear plant (60+/hr), and his dad also works at the nuclear plant making a boatload. He's learning though. He decided to become a mechanic after releasing and it truly doesn't pay nearly enough for the work so I'm the actual bread winner and he sometimes beats himself up for it. That's why I want to buy a rental property together so we can share it and it will help him more than me.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/imcyjp/i_did_it_i_finally_made_it_and_it_took_buying_a/g41019r/"}
