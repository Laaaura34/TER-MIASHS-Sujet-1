So you have 3 types of color-detecting cell in your eyes. One is most sensitive to red light, one to green light, and one to blue light. You see color by comparing how much each cell type gets stimulated.\n\nColorblindness completely or partially knocks out one of these cell types, impairing your ability to make those comparisons. The brain quite literally isn't getting the full picture. It's like old RGB component cables: if you don't plug in the red cable, the machine still produces an image with the limited information it does have.\n\nPilestone is more cagey than Enchroma, the other major brand producing these glasses, but they seem to work on the same principle: by blocking certain wavelengths of light, you actually help the brain make these decisions. Now it can go, \"Oh, this actually isn't brown or green, it's just that those deadbeat red cones aren't doing their job. I'll go ahead and fill it in. And this purple business, I thought maybe there was something missing, but I filed it under blue just to be safe. Now I'm sure of it, there should be some red in there.\"\n\nAs to why you've never heard of them: the tech is relatively new, and there isn't much market penetration of what is already a pretty small market to begin with.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/kkpamx/for_the_first_time_in_my_life_i_am_able_to_see/gh5e8a4/"}
