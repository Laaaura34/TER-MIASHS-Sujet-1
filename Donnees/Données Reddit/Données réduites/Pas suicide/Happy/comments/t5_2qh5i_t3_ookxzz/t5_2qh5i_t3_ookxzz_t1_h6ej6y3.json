And then he was held back when I went to kindergarten (I\u2019m 3 weeks older than him but a lot taller as a child so even though I was young they let me go ahead to kindergarten, most of my preschool friends didn\u2019t) and then didn\u2019t talk again until high school. Almost dated then, but didn\u2019t, and then didn\u2019t talk until college when I posted that I had broken up with my bf and he slid in my DMs. Close friends for over a year and then we started dating! 4 years later we\u2019re engaged!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ookxzz/20_years_later_and_we_just_got_engaged/h6ej6y3/"}
