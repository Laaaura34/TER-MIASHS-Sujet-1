And yes, women my size (height and weight wise) are considered big girls out here because the average woman in the Philippines is maybe about 5'2\"/5'3\" and only around 55-60 kg (120-130 lbs). However, I've been given to understand  that at 5'6\" and 158 lbs, I'm actually average-sized overseas. Out here though, people always tell me I should keep losing weight and should not wear heels at all because I'm already \"too big/too tall\" lol", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8h7aid/two_weeks_into_shopping_for_gowns_for_my/dymusgr/"}
