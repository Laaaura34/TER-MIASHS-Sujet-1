I worked at this pizza place in high school. The manager there was best buddies with the owner so basically got away with everything. And a lot of the customers were old men who basically loved him. It was such an old boys' club there. Of course lots of families came in. But the manager was so friendly and nice to the kids and everyone loved him. But, behind the scenes, he would do shit like corner the register girl and scream in her face until she cried, or make me work four hours past my shift because I was the only cashier/waitress who was over 18 and he needed someone to close. And girls were never allowed to be delivery drivers. It was so frustrating. I'd see the delivery drivers come in counting their giant stacks of tips, and the four other waitresses/front of house girls and I would sadly divide up our tip jar that contained about $50 on a good night. And of course we were sure to give the manager his cut. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1urx58/you_would_not_believe_the_hell_ive_endured_at/cel9ryw/"}
