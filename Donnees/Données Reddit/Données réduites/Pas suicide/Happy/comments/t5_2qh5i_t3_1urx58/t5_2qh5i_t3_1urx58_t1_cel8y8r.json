As somebody who just left a job that made me terribly unhappy after 3 years, let me just say life is about to get immensely better!  I was coming home stressed, angry, and ultimately depressed for the last 6 months at my last job and I thought it was me.  Finally took a risk and changed jobs thinking it may make ME happy and holy cow, every day is enjoyable, then I come home and every night I'm happy!  A good work environment goes a long way and I'm happy to hear you've found one also.  :)\n\nEdit: a word", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1urx58/you_would_not_believe_the_hell_ive_endured_at/cel8y8r/"}
