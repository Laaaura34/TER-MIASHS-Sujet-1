I'm hoping to quit my job soon here in Australia as well. The main problem is that I'm on salary and I do a LOT of unpaid hours. Many of the people I work with are in the same boat as me. People who have already left have reported the business to Fair Work Australia. I'm told by a previous employee that Fair Work Australia has a file on our company. \n\nYou owe to, not only yourself, but to future employees of that business to report the behavior of that boss. Eventually, after enough complaints, he will get investigated.\n\nhttp://www.fairwork.gov.au/complaints/how-to-make-a-complaint/pages/default.aspx", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1urx58/you_would_not_believe_the_hell_ive_endured_at/cell0w4/"}
