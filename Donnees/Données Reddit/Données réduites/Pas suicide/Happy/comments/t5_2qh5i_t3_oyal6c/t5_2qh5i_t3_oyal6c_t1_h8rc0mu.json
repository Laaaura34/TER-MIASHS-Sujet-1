It\u2019s very hard for me to explain. Speaking for myself only, the pressure from depression when I didn\u2019t feel anything or especially mixed episodes, which are a combo of depression and mania, would make me feel like I was going to explode. Like a balloon or tire. Once I cut myself, it relieved that pressure. Mostly happens during mixed episodes of Bipolar 1, which can bring on serious agitation. For some reason, it never hurt when I did it. I actually liked doing it, which makes it \u201caddictive\u201d. Just want that relief. I was never suicidal at the time. I started on my arms, but the scars show, so I moved to my thighs. Anyone dealing with this behavior needs immediate help. I ended up in the hospital three times because of it. And I can never wear a bathing suit again. Proper medication can alleviate these terrible urges. Part of it was anger at myself too. I am now getting ketamine infusions, since no meds ever seemed to have a lasting effect on me. It is fantastic for me to feel better and not want to do that ever again. I still get the urge occasionally, but after the experience in that one hospital, it did truly make me think twice about doing it. I never want to be in such a horrible place again!!!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/oyal6c/ive_officially_made_it_200_days_self_harm_free/h8rc0mu/"}
