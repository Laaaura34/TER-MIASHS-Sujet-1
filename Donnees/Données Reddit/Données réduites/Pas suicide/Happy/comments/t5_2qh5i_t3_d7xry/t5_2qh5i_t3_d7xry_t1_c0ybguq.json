But it is easy to get more!  I know people that have had 20 credit cards (or more) each with a $2K to $3K balance.\n\nAnd honestly, a $25,000 credit limit on a card isn't that big of a deal.  I've got immediate access to about $60,000 in credit not counting my American Express which has no limit.  (BTW, my balance is $0)\n\nIf you can live for the rest of your life on $25,000 then go for it and disappear.  The rest of us still need to function in society and can't just walk away from debt.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/d7xry/7_in_12_i_did_it_i_am_completely_credit_card_debt/c0ybguq/"}
