Sometimes things in life don't go according to plan.  You may have a great budget set up that's been working smoothly for a few months then all of a sudden, in one month, your car needs a new transmission and you didn't save for that.  You get sick and have to go to the doctor more than planned.  Your grandparents decided to have a family reunion and you didn't plan for it but everyone wants to see you so you buy the plane ticket home for the weekend.\n\nBut since you didn't budget for these things, you don't always have the cash to pay for them immediately.  Sometimes it takes a few months to pay off a big expense but then a couple more unexpected things happen.  Before you know it you're $5,000 in credit card debt.  You don't think that's too bad and you're making a payment every month and you're being good and sticking to your budget.  But a few years roll on and it is easier and easier to charge things.  You're always making a payment every month and you don't think about the balance too much.  Before you know it, you're $25,000 in debt and under a mountain of problems.\n\nIt is a lot easier than you think!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/d7xry/7_in_12_i_did_it_i_am_completely_credit_card_debt/c0y9f8z/"}
