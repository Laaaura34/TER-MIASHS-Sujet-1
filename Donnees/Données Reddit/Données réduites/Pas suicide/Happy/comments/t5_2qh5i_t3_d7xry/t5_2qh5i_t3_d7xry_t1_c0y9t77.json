So people are encouraged to have a credit card and to use it to \"prove\" that they can pay their bills. Which usually bites people in the butt.\n\nPlus, credit cards are offered on a store specific basis here as well. So if your Visa is maxed out, you can get a Target credit card to use at Target stores. These \"little\" cards often lure people in by offering discounts on merchandise periodically, but end up killing them with the interest rates. But these are often advertised as great ways to save money on your purchase and then just pay it all off...but most people don't do that.\n\nIt's really easy in the US to hang yourself with your own rope.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/d7xry/7_in_12_i_did_it_i_am_completely_credit_card_debt/c0y9t77/"}
