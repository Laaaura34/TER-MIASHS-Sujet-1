Some people have no sense of consequence or ability to foresee and curtail future repercussions. \n\nHowever, there are some who have it all planned out perfectly, but some crazy life event happens.

Or, a car wreck, and only liability (or none at all) insurance. \n\nI had 2 of those 3 things, immediately after borrowing a sizable chunk of money.
