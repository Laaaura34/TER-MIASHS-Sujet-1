Though I've had my share of debts in different ways, and haven't always been too smart with money, I can't really imagine working up a big credit card debt.\n\nIf friends or family saw me paying for stuff with credit cards, they'd probably frown on it and question my judgement.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/d7xry/7_in_12_i_did_it_i_am_completely_credit_card_debt/c0y8zky/"}
