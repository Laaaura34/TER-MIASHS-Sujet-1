I got sober when my son was 8 mo old and his mother did not want to come with me. So after like 6-7 years I was able to get enough money for a lawyer and he was not in school and had some health issues so when we went to court I thought it was just going to be like a pulmonary hearing , so I was not even ready for him. And when I showed up the judge looked at her and said the boy is going with dad\u2026\u2026.. fucking blew my mind. Still to this day I\u2019m taken back. If you keep at it you will get those kids back. Especially if they want to live with you. Do you have a lawyer, can you afford one? Because there\u2019s no way I would\u2019ve been able to do that without one", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/q2tli1/i_got_full_custody_of_my_son_seven_years_ago_and/hfp1krd/"}
