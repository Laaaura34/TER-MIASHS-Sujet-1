I did the greater part of my own custody battling without a lawyer abd ended up successful. It\u2019ll also depend on the state you live in as well as if there are free resources to assist those seeking legal knowledge.\n\nSince you\u2019ve already \u201clost\u201d your case I\u2019d recommend the following:\n\n-keep good on any court agreed documents regarding parenting time/responsibilities\n\n-keep a WRITTEN log of any problems you encounter with the other parent, and be very concise with said log as it\u2019ll have to relate to the children. Make sure any events are dated and roughly timed too (all this coming from a lawyer to me btw)\n\n-watch for any and all signs that might point towards the other parent as being \u201cunfit\u201d. Document all instances\n\n-research into the legal process if you haven\u2019t done so already. Find out the legal age a child can decide to live with a chosen parent and plan accordingly\n\n-utilize people resources as best as you can to keep tabs on your children when you\u2019re not around. Try to have a positive standing with the other parent so you can keep tabs on your children and their well being throughout this situation.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a long term game now. It took me seven years and much planning to get my child, something the other parent did not do/care to do. It\u2019ll be a trial but if the other parent isn\u2019t fit then eventually you\u2019ll prevail.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/q2tli1/i_got_full_custody_of_my_son_seven_years_ago_and/hfpg1wg/"}
