Showing up for me, highs and lows, celebrating with me, meeting my friends and significant other, etc.  Just feeling like you have a present parent in your corner always matters so much. \n\nWhen I got a bit older, I realized what an addiction actually was, and how hard it can be to make the choice to sober up. Cheers to you, your son, and your future together!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/q2tli1/i_got_full_custody_of_my_son_seven_years_ago_and/hfodm56/"}
