This is a huge boon to the recipient. If your friend isn\u2019t on dialysis, this is good. If on dialysis, look for the foods beneficial to their specific condition. Diet makes a big difference, and then post-transplant, they get to eat whatever! After transplant, I had a more challenging time than my husband, who literally perked way up hours after transplant, nothing like a new super kidney (my kidneys were 112% at age 62, the beauty of genetics), and he did great! It took me quite a bit longer to recover, and I certainly did recover fully. It took months. The good news is after a year, and my remaining kidney functions at 90% of 2 kidneys. The human body and modern medicine blows me away.\nMay great good fortune bless you both in this endeavor. It\u2019s a great gift you give your fortunate friend. Bless your loving heart for doing this.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/motq8e/taking_a_walk_with_my_husband_in_august_2018_five/gu6agxl/"}
