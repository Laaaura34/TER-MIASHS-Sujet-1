Only inexperienced and not mature people would marry so early.\n\nPeople generally go through a few relationships till they really connect. You also need to live together and not in separate homes for a few years to know if the relationship will last. There is no \"high school love\" that you marry here - by the time people find the right person initially they are mostly over 25+ closer to 30, and then to be sure it takes another few years to consider marriage.\n\nBesides that, there is really no reason to marry any more except tax exempts, since that generation is basically religion free they arent forced into anything. There is also no stigmata having a child and not being married - its basically the norm here to first have kids and maybe later marry.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2k3zqf/in_2012_one_of_my_best_friends_asked_me_to_be_his/clic8j5/"}
