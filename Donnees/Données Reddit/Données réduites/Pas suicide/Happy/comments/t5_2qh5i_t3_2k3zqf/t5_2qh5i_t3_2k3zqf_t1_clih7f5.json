I'm born and raised in the US but my family is Puerto Rican, and I can assure you that if I tried to tell my Puerto Rican cousins that they are culturally the same as Cubans they would disagree strongly.\n\nThe cultures are sufficiently similar that my cultural experience as a Puerto Rican American grants me insight into and familiarity with many aspects of Cuban culture, but Cuban culture is not nearly as familiar to me.  If the two places were culturally the same then I would be equally familiar with Cuban culture and Puerto Rican culture.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2k3zqf/in_2012_one_of_my_best_friends_asked_me_to_be_his/clih7f5/"}
