You see Chinese people driving expensive L version luxury cars on impeccable roads in the city but as soon as you leave the city, the roads look worse than 2 millennia old Roman roads. There is so much abundance, so much wealth, so many people, so many possibilities - but they're somehow not overwhelming.\n\nThe language is very interesting because it is tonal - very unlike anything European.\n\nThe food is incredibly rich and tasty - \"Chinese\" food you eat in Europe isn't really Chinese.\n\nInfrastructure is very well developed, much more so than in my home country, but do keep in mind I stayed in a tier 1 city.\n\nI also got the chance to visit Hong Kong and Macau which were fantastic, but unfortunately I couldn't go to Shanghai or Beijing.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7zwczv/20_years_ago_i_dreamed_of_traveling_the_world_but/dus04g3/"}
