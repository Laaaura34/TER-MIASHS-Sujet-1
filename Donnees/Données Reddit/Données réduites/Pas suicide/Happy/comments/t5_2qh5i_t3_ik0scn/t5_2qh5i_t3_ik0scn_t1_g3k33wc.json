When we have social anxiety, one of the biggest pleasure rewards we get is NOT doing the thing that scares us. Once we decide that we\u2019re just not going to make conversation/ go to a social event/ make a phone call, we\u2019re flooded with relief and the removal of our anxiety teaches our brain that, hey, not doing stuff is GREAT so then the anxiety is reinforced over and over again. This is what \u201cnegative reinforcement\u201d means, and it\u2019s my asshole brain\u2019s favorite shit even though it gets in the way of everything I actually want to do and who I want to be. \n\nI\u2019ve actually mostly conquered my social anxiety (through cognitive behavioral therapy and a low dose of antidepressants), but just taking a deep breath and doing the thing you\u2019re afraid of, that\u2019s the beginning and the way through.  You did great and you\u2019ll continue to do great, even if you hit a few bumps in the road.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ik0scn/socially_awkward_me_with_severe_anxiety_relieved/g3k33wc/"}
