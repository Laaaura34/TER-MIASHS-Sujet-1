I went on to interview and get my masters that required a lot of social interaction but it was so gratifying knowing that I could do it. College is plagued with group work and group discussion but they are onto something there... \n\nProud of you. \ud83d\udc95", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ik0scn/socially_awkward_me_with_severe_anxiety_relieved/g3hrcwc/"}
