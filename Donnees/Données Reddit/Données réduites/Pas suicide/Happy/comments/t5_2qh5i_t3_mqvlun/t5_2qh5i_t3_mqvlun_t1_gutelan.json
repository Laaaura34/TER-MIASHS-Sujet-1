This is so sweet! \n\nIdk if you have older children or not, but my son is 24 now. There are some vivid memories, but a lot of the silly/sweet moments fade over the years.\nI have started a little notebook with \"Michelle says...\" and write down her funny comments, pronunciations, incorrect song lyrics, etc that she comes up with, as well as putting a date/age on the back of some art/notes with it. She ABSOLUTELY eats it up it's clear to see how special she feels when I show her things from 4-5 years ago. So, from one happy parent to another, a little tip, you can choose if you like. Some days I don't have time to grab the notebook, so I just talk to text it to myself. Haha \n\nEnjoy these days, they're so special!!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/mqvlun/my_5_year_old_son_handed_this_to_me_before_he/gutelan/"}
