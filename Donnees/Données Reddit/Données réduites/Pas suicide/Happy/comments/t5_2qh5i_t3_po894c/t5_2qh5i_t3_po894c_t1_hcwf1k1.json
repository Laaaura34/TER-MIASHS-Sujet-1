I, myself, used to overdose once a week basically. I took 8 ibuprofen, then 6 more, then the next week I took 12 more, then I took around 45. All 200 mg. I never once threw up, but I felt like shit. I basically did it for a really fucked up reason. I took it so I could feel like I'm dying, so I looked forward to something. Sometimes I took them just to make myself cry from pain so I could cry. I took them so I could feel like I'm dying and get the suicide urge out while still being alive.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/po894c/terrible_week_but_i_turned_it_around_and_made_my/hcwf1k1/"}
