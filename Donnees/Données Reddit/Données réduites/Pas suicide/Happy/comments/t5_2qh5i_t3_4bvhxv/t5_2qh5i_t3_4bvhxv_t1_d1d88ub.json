The initial assessment seemed to be mostly superficial damage--hood and one quarter panel, radiator, headlights, things like that.  Even though I'd only had the car for a couple months, and only made one insurance payment, the company authorized the repair.\n\nIt was only after all of these fixes that they realized the accident had somehow fried the main and subordinate computers, that controlled, well, everything.  Those two parts were another $2800, before labor.  The insurance company was stuck--do they total the car now, having already sunk $3k into repairs, or do they authorize the additional repairs?\n\nIn the end all the repairs cost a little more than I paid for the car in the first place.  I'm sure the adjuster got a firm talking-to that quarter.\n", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/4bvhxv/i_totaled_my_brand_new_car_and_everything_worked/d1d88ub/"}
