It takes alot to get up on a stage, and perform comedy for a room full of people that came to see someone bomb on stage (I go to open mics alot, and for some people that's the only reason they go)  \n\nCongrats!  \n\nI hope this gives you enough confidence to keep going!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cden4b/i_performed_standup_for_the_very_first_time_at_an/etvjqmq/"}
