I love how it's so realistic, yet still cartoon-ish. The one that really  struck me was the second image. I thought that was a real photo of a guitar from some 90s or 200s band until I noticed the shirt and hands. You perfectly captured how the light plays off the finish of the different surfaces of the guitar. The lighting in all the other pieces is just as excellent, too. Excellent stuff, dude, keep up the great work.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ppj0lp/for_the_past_2_months_i_have_finally_been_making/hd5tt5t/"}
