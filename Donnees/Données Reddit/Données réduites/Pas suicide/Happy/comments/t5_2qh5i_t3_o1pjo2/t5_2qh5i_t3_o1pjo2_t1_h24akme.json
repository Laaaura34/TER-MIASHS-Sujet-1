We grew up in a very conservative home in a tiny conservative town. Our lives consisted of church, fox News and some more church. I \"loved\" gay people, but believed that being gay was wrong (I'm also bi so I had some self loathing thrown in there.) In my junior year of high school I had 2 gay friends, that's when I started to change my mind. At 18 I moved out of that conservative town and met my hippie liberal boyfriend. My twin stayed in that conservative mindset and town well into her late 20s. We used to be so different spiritually and our views were polar opposite. Something softened her heart, she's now a proud mom of an openly bi daughter and supports her 100%, she even bought her the bi flag colors to hang in her room. We've both come such a long way from our immature not fully developed world view. Just pains me to see the rest of the family still so clouded by their nasty \"Christian\" morals that they miss out on all this joy and beauty.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/o1pjo2/i_was_raised_a_bigot_and_tonight_i_got_to_pay_for/h24akme/"}
