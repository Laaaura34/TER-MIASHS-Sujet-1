At the time I asked about night vision loss and they said that early versions of the procedure reshaped only part of the cornea, a circle measuring 8 mm across. If the pupil dilates more than 8 mm (which it does in the dark, to let in more light) then the edge of that circle messes up the vision in the form of halos, etc. But that now they're doing a full 11 mm across to eliminate this problem. If you ever do get it done make sure that is how they are doing it. I imagine there are still some places that offer older technology at a lower price, which just seems like a bad idea all around.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/b97p8/dear_reddit_in_one_week_i_will_be_administered_a/c0lryhw/"}
