The procedure I'm having is called \"wavefront\" or \"custom lasik\" which costs more, but does an aspherical reshaping of the cornea. This corrects secondary aberrations that cause colour fringing, halos, smearing, etc. During the day those aren't noticeable because your pupils aren't dilated, and you have depth of focus to compensate, but at night when your pupils dilate the problems become evident.\n\nThis explanation totally made sense to me from my background in photography (i.e. knowing that aspherical lenses and stopping down the aperture improve picture quality -- your camera lens performs better at f/8 than at f/2.8) so it was a no-brainer deciding to go for this version of the procedure.\n\nWith the old way they would correct for your basic prescription (and possibly astigmatism, I'm not sure) but that's it, the new way is a total custom reshaping of the cornea taking all the different \"warpages\" at different angles along the way into account. Then since the secondary aberrations are gone, you can see clearly even with your pupils dilated, and the night vision issues become a thing of the past. Hope that makes sense.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/b97p8/dear_reddit_in_one_week_i_will_be_administered_a/c0lojkj/"}
