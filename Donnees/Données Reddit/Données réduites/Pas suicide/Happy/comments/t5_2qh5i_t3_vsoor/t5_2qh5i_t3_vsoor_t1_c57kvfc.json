How would you know? This depends on a lot of factors none of us really know about. \n\nMy neighbor has Down Syndrome. We talk a lot. He tells me how upset he gets when he knows that people are just pitying him. He wasn't SEVERELY handicapped. He still had a job, could go through high school. However, he could tell that many people would do things for him generally do pity things like this and find it upsetting that the only way for him to get acceptance was through other people acting differently about him because they pitied him. He knew he could never talk closely or be close to 95% of the people he knew because they'd treat him as the Down Syndrome kid and talk to him like he was the Down Syndrome kid. Made him very unhappy and sad.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/vsoor/my_friends_sister_and_her_boyfriend_both_have/c57kvfc/"}
