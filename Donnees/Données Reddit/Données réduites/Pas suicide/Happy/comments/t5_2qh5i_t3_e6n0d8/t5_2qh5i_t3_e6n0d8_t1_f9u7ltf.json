How much I needed to pay for all my monthly necessities, then the left over I was pretty stringent with. I typically am semi frugal with money, but I was looking forward to getting rid of them, so I made it my focus. All extra money was put aside month after month, while still making my standard payment, then paid the remainder off in two lump sums.\n\nI only had about 12k left when I started doing this, and it could just as easily have been paid directly to the loan rather than saving, but it felt better to do a few larger payments for me.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/e6n0d8/i_paid_of_my_student_loans_today_through_a_lot_of/f9u7ltf/"}
