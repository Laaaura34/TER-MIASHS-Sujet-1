If I was walking alone at night, I'd do so on a well lit sidewalk (preferably with other people surrounding me), if I was staying at a hostel, I'd do research and find one that was women only or one that had a good reputation, etc. \n\nAs for managing travel, Norwegian Air and Google Flights were lifesavers- cheap, cheap, cheeaaap flights! I never use third party travel sites like Expedia or Hotwire. I don't have any airline credit cards or am a member of a frequent flyer club, but I met a lot of travelers on the road who were so that might be worth checking out. \n\nI know it may seem scary to have your daughter away from home, but supporting her with her dreams is one of the best things you can do as a parent. You're awesome and I hope your daughter gets to see the world! ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8x276b/two_years_ago_i_dropped_out_of_university_to/e20s9xn/"}
