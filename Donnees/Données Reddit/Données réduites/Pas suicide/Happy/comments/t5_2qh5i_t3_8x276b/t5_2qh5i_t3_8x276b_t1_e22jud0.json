(Sorry for the late reply). It will DEFINITELY be scary for my wife and I to 'let go'. But we know she has to pursue her dreams and take control of her life. We've spent our parenting lives trying to make her happy and fulfilled. We have to get used to letting her take control of that. She DEFINITELY looks forward to seeing the world and I hope she gets to do just that! Thank you again for your advice and inspiration!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8x276b/two_years_ago_i_dropped_out_of_university_to/e22jud0/"}
