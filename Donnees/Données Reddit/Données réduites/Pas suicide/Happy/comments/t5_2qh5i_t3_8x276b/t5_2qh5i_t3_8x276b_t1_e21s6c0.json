Just being in the right place at the right time, bright and useful enough that its worth it for someone to sponsor you. On my visa application CV I was vague about whether or not I actually held a degree and it was fine. I\u2019m going back to university online now at 32, but I\u2019m doing it to advance my knowledge, not necessarily because it makes getting work visas easier! In Australia at least, applying independently of a sponsor (as a skilled migrant) is really hard and having a degree (even in the desired fields) doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you will be awarded a working visa.
