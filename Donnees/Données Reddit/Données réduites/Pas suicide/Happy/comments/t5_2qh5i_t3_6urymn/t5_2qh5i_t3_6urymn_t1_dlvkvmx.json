It doesn't happen often because she is still in the ignoring phase when it comes to her new brother.  She still hasn't warmed up to him yet.  Anyway, when this happens I can't help singing in my horribly scratchy voice, *Heaven, I'm in heaven, and my heart beats so that I can barely speak*.  It's that Fred Astaire song from The Green Mile.\n\nThere's no greater feeling in the world.  I truly cherish those rare moments.  And the song is so fitting.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/6urymn/this_is_my_son_last_night_i_was_sitting_on_the/dlvkvmx/"}
