I had a horrible mom and a stellar father. He was and still is my superhero. But he's just a normal guy, Clark Kent. He was the best dad in the world and he wasn't competing with anyone, he just wanted to do better than his own shitty father. \n\nMy mother asks me all the time if I'll care for her when she's old. She didn't care for her own mother, she was horrible to me as a helpless child, why should I? I deflect the question with \"we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.\"\n\nDad? He's never asked. But I've promised him I'll be there no matter what. And I will.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/6urymn/this_is_my_son_last_night_i_was_sitting_on_the/dlvgcji/"}
