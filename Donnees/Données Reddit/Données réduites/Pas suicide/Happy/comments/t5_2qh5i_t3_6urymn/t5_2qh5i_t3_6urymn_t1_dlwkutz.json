It's so nice to meet another parent who gets it. My daughter still nurses (her choice, definitely not mine at this rate, lol - the therapist thinks it may actually *help* with her meltdowns because it's the quickest way to snap her out of them without injuring herself), so I haven't even been able to get pregnant again. I told my husband that perhaps this has all been a gift without realizing it! I can't imagine trying to nurse a newborn with the meltdowns and neediness she's displayed this past year, and it's made me REALLY grateful I've been able to pour myself into her and give her everything she needs \"from Mommy\" now that she's been diagnosed!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/6urymn/this_is_my_son_last_night_i_was_sitting_on_the/dlwkutz/"}
