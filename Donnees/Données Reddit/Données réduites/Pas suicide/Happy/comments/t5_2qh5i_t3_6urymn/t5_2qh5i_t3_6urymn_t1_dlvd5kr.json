Savor that moment. I have a seven year old boy, I remember laying in a similar pose with my little baby too. I remember thinking that I had won life, that it doesn't get better. Then, over a few months I started worrying about my baby growing up and some joy was gone because I thought the magic wouldn't last and had grow up too soon. But, life happened. I can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt that that love and euphoria only gets better with each passing second you spend with that handsome young fella. The joy and awesomeness of raising a child is unparalleled. I wish you, your wife, and Jr. there all the best. Its obvious from your post alone that you are glowing and one proud dad. Good on you brother! Also, if you haven't already, get your wife something nice, she deserves it! Cheers.
