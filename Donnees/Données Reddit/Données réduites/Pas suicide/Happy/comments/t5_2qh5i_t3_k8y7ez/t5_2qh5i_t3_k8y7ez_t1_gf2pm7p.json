Same! The loan is such a mental burden, and due to visa issues finding a job is also so hard. There was so much job stress for the first year, I was so worried they would remove me and hire a US citizen lol because immigration cost is so high! Now, it has settled down a bit for me. I realized when the loan is gone, 80% negative thoughts came from anxiety about loan. Once that is gone, I feel much happier like i can take risks and spend a little :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/k8y7ez/im_finally_soooo_happy_to_clear_off_my_student/gf2pm7p/"}
