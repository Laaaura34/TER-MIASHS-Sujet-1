Indian from a small town and moved to the US. This month, I will also finish off my loans. I will start 2021 with a net positive wealth!!!!!!!!!! 50k in loan paid off. I am so excited!\n\nOther things are different though. My dad was pumped about me going to US for masters, he wanted me to do PhD though. I paid off my undergrad engineering loan in India in 1 year so they trusted me to be financially smart. They put the house up as collateral and saved up a bit in case I need money! But I never asked them for any money. It was my decision to move to the US, so I should take the responsibility. It was a struggle. I lived poor in India for 3.5 years to save money to afford my GRE fees, flight fees, VISA fees, and initial house deposit in US, etc!!! What money I had left I used to buy a laptop and used for groceries for 4 months. After that, lived off part time money. Ate bread for so many days, budgeted, working part time. College was no fun, no trips, no eating out, etc. Saw others enjoying, could not join them. But finally it paid off! I did it. The feeling is amazing. I am so pleased. I get you 100%.\n\nI get your feeling completely. You deserve it! Do something fun you have been putting off. Treat yourself! <3 <3 <3\n\nMy similar post is coming in a month. I have only 3.5 lakh left. :) Yes, excited. Never forget! And keep dreaming!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/k8y7ez/im_finally_soooo_happy_to_clear_off_my_student/gf15f53/"}
