I just want to drink beer and make fart jokes.\n\nIf by convert you mean am I a leftist now? No, I have been and still am a constitutional libertarian. I voted for rand paul in 2012 and Gary johnson in 2016. Only voted for trump in 20 because there was no solid 3rd in my opinion. The libertarians kept trying to bring in the woke progressives for some reason, and biden is a lame duck and Harris is a corrupt cop.
