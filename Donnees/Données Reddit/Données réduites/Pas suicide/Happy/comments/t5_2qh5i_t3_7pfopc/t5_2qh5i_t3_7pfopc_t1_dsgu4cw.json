We almost lost her when her intensities ruptured and she went septic, she has fought through living hell and back to get where she is today. Lost her best friend to breast cancer during recovery, had to have her bag moved twice, and surgerys rescheduled on multiple occasions. We are one happy family today! She's most excited to poop in a toilet again. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7pfopc/sister_just_had_her_final_surgery_which_was_a/dsgu4cw/"}
