Depression sucks big fat hairy balls but right now, at this very minute, you\u2019re kicking it\u2019s arse. Sometimes you have to just get through the day minute by minute. Today, you\u2019re up, showered and out to lunch - a huge achievement and it shows in your smile - it\u2019s lighting up your face. \n\nI have three things on my \u2018to do\u2019 list every single day.
