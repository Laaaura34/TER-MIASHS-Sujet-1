I read through [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/ohu3ay/one_week_ago_i_finished_my_hopefully_last_round/h4rbk7r/), and was totally shocked by how hard it got you. All I remember was extreme headaches with seemingly no end in sight. Unconscious for like two weeks at the hospital while they tried to figure out the diagnosis and treatment. \n\nThen there's you having to suffer for this long! This better be the last treatment dangit lol. I'm so happy for you, wishing you a much smoother future ahead.
