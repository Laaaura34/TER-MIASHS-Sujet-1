Every situation is different but for me it was like magically I stopped even wanting to drink, I stopped having craving for opiates (let me rephrase that\u2026I had all my withdrawal symptoms during the hospital stay in a facility\u2026I didn\u2019t have the desire to relapse), etc.\n\nThings are not perfect by any means and I still struggle with other areas of mental illnesses (anxiety / paranoia). But my life is exponentially better than it was previously.\n\nI can even drink alcohol socially now, after 4 years my partner no longer gets nervous when I drink and occasionally suggests we get some alcohol. \n\nThat was a huge thing for us (me always starting out semi slow and then getting hammered before 10pm and we had to go home)\n\nThank you for being so open minded. We (trans people) are painted in such a negative light in a lot of the media.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/o3v016/im_a_transwoman_m2f_in_2017_i_may_have_been/h2f4z4j/"}
