I had to really focus on substituting my bad habits for good ones. I started exercising more, painting, organized my living space.. but one thing I have to say is that it\u2019s *okay* if you literally just lay in bed or watch tv to avoid drinking. In my early sobriety I was doing just about anything I could to keep my mind off of it. I watched a LOT of Netflix. I didn\u2019t feel guilty about it because I was vulnerable, fragile and healing. Sometimes you\u2019re not just doing it one day at a time... sometimes it\u2019s one hour at a time... one minute at a time. Just have to hold on through the hard parts.
