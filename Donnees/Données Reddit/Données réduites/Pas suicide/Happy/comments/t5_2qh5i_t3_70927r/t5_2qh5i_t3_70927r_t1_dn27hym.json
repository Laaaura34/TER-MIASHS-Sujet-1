It always made me WTF. They had all the parts and it was usually over something silly that made no sense. And I kept thinking, either the patient misunderstood, is lying, or the doctor is completely incompetent. Because everything looks completely normal. \n\nThen after a while I realized.. I'm starting to see a pattern. The doctors never told that to the druggies and psychos or criminals or the very poor and uneducated. They were telling it to people I assume they wanted to procreate. Gave them a license to bone worry free. No contraception. Boom! Baby. \n\nThere's more.. \n\nThen I put this together with the fact that I kept seeing mommies who were told that their baby was dead (early pregnancy with the use of fetal doppler) and they needed a D&C to scrape it out. But the mommies wanted to see for themselves with an ultrasound instead of blindly trusting the doctor. They paid out of pocket for a scan that their insurance wouldn't pay for, because the doctor said dead baby. Just scrape it out right? Yeah. Their little ones were alive. I showed them the beating hearts. They would have aborted their wanted babies had they not come to me for a second opinion. \n\nSo, it seems that some doctors are performing eugenics in this fashion. I've seen licenses pulled and malpractice suits filed. But how many don't get caught? \n\nJust food for thought. \n\n\nEdit: accidentally a word.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/70927r/just_over_a_year_ago_my_partner_was_told_by_a/dn27hym/"}
