I believe in you. I'm not going to lie and say HS didn't *suck* for me...because it did and I hated it. BUUUUUUUUUUT when you get out the world is your oyster. Live the life you want to live. Want to move to a borough of NYC and live the bohemian/thespian life? DO IT! Want to save  up and travel the theaters of other countries? DO IT!...man, it might take a bit of planning but everything is possible for you. You deserve to do what makes you happiest and if thats music and theater I'd say go all in. Soon enough you'll realize that you're 36 and you have now lived as long of a life outside of HS as you did when you ended your time there. Wild. At 18 I thought I had seen some stuff/lived some stuff, I think we all do at 18, but life is so awesome man. The best is surely yet to come for you.
