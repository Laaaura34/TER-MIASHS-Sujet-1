I've spent a lot of time lately trying to peel away my values and figure out what core beliefs I have that go unsaid, *why* I feel the way I do, and whether those reasons are valid. For example, I'm a socially anxious introvert, and always have been. Only recently have I realized that deep down I live my life as if I *need* an active social life to be happy. Why do I feel that way? Is it true? Can I change how I feel? I'm honestly not sure. The pandemic has forced me to accept social isolation in a way I never really have before -- even though I've been much more isolated in the past, I never accepted it is an okay state of affairs. Now I'm questioning that.\n\nIn a sense, I \"worship\" connectedness, so I always feel isolated. This is the first time in my life I've felt *okay* with feeling isolated.\n\nIf you feel ugly and fat, and that makes you feel terrible (does it? Or is that independent?), there are two ways to approach that:\n\n1. Accept that it is not true.\n2. Accept that even if it is true, it's okay.\n\nI understand neither is a snap-your-fingers magical solution. People go to great lengths to receive validation because deep down they feel ugly...or stupid...or generally unlovable. Personally I've held onto terrible relationships because I had so little self-esteem, not even realizing that was the problem. I cringe looking back at it but it's still something I struggle with.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/mi6b84/i_have_major_depressive_disorder_and_have_had/gtd1o1q/"}
