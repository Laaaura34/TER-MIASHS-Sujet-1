That is simply not why I posted this. And I\u2019m honestly embarrassed this got as much attention as it did.  But I\u2019m probably not going to change your mind as to what you think my \u201ctrue\u201d motives are.\n\nBut I just want to ask you to explain something to me so I understand where you are coming from better - even if people here think I\u2019m pretty and are commenting and giving me attention does not mean I am taking away from others. They can also comment and give attention to those posts as well can\u2019t they? There is NOT a finite amount of love in the world to give. And everyone deserves the same love and attention. And to be able to share happiness with others, ugly, pretty, whatever or who ever you are. You should be allowed to share your happiness.  I thought that\u2019s what this sub was about. And that\u2019s why I posted here.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/mi6b84/i_have_major_depressive_disorder_and_have_had/gtckd9g/"}
