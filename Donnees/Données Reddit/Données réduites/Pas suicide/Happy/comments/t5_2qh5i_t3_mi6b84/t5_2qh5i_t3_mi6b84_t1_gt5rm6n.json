Don't you dare listen to all the morons on here. From reading your replies to all these comments, it is clear that you have a beautiful soul. And can I just say, your eyes are SO pretty! They're such a beautiful shade of green/blue.\n\nFWIW, and this is my own personal opinion...but no woman ever needs makeup. My wife looks more beautiful with her freckles and dimples than she does with foundation and all that other stuff. It took years of me saying this to her before she stopped worrying about it. But ya know what...that's just my opinion. You. Do. You.\n\nAlso, Happy Belated Birthday :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/mi6b84/i_have_major_depressive_disorder_and_have_had/gt5rm6n/"}
