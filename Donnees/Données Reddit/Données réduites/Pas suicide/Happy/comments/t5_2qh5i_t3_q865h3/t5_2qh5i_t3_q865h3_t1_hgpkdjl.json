He was taken away from her in the 60s after she was put in a \u2018halfway house\u2019 of sorts when she was a pregnant teen. (This was typical in Canada back then and wasn\u2019t well known I guess. Also the fault of the Catholic church.) She had lifelong PTSD from it but she\u2019s so happy he had a good upbringing and really cherishes his company now. What was the process? Where did you start? What happened that you weren\u2019t raised by her? How do you feel now after finding her? Curious so I can better understand my mom and how she feels!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/q865h3/today_i_found_my_biological_mother_and_her/hgpkdjl/"}
