He had no idea she existed. She also found a biological brother she didn\u2019t know existed which is a nice happy thing considering both her brothers died many decades ago. Now she has another brother who is alive. \n\nShe found her brother first and his wife found their dad\u2019s wife on Facebook. Her dad (my grandfather) had just survived multi-system organ failure (by a miracle) and his wife yelled at him to get out of bed because \u201cyou have children\u201d. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cI said you have kids! A daughter and a son.\u201d\n\nWe all met last summer. Now he has a great granddaughter because I had my baby this year. \n\nHappy endings are the best endings. I\u2019m so happy for you, too.
