I messaged a half sister when she popped up on 23& Me, no response.  When my other new half sisters and I flew to another state several months later to meet our donor, she wound up coming to the dinner with him.  We\u2019ve been texting in the last couple of months, then a couple of days ago I get a message from her through 23 & Me saying she just now saw that message.  23 & me didn\u2019t notify her of the message, and she hadn\u2019t signed on for over 6 months.\n\nI had similar experiences with another sister on Ancestry.  One of my new brothers wound up being able to track her down and contact her outside of the website.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/q865h3/today_i_found_my_biological_mother_and_her/hgr8n3p/"}
