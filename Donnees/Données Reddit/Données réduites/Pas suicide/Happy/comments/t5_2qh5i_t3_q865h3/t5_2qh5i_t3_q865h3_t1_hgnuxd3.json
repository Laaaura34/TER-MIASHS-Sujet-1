They told me they spoke about me every day, everyone was searching everywhere to find me.\n\nEach one and myself have cried for a bit. We plan to all meet up at some point. Its really incredible that people you don't even fully remember, that your only loved with for a little bit, still consider you as family and sincerely love and care for you.\n\nI'm grateful for knowing that my birth family is full of wonderful humans!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/q865h3/today_i_found_my_biological_mother_and_her/hgnuxd3/"}
