Thats the scouts law. Be prepared. Thats the motto. Ive learned things in boys scouts that i still use all the time. Im confident in my ability to pursue happiness in my life. There have been and will be many mistakes along the way. Some devastating. That applies to everyone. Having the willingness and ability to overcome and adapt and become a new, better version of oneself time and time again is pretty helpful. Id say the scouts had a hand in it with me. Will being an eagle scout make you rich? Naw, probably not. At the time it was all just fun times hangin with friends and camping and stuff but looking back on it, the experience i gained helped to shape me into a man who can look at himself in the mirror with confidence. Go for it, if you want. You dont get to try it later, though", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/744wxi/finally_got_the_rank_of_eagle_scout_today_its/dnxj3dg/"}
