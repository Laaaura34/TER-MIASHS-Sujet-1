It's easy to loose interest when you go to college or the military or what ever.  after that you'll be chasing chicks or dudes and working on a career, but if you just make it to once meeting a month as an assistant or junior assistance scoutmaster, that would be really awesome for those boys.  most assistant/scoutmasters are someone's dad.  being the cool assistant-SM mentor/role model who **is living** the stage of life those boys are **just about** to enter is a a huge service to them.  and service is what it's all about", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/744wxi/finally_got_the_rank_of_eagle_scout_today_its/dnw4lqd/"}
