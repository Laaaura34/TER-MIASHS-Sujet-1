Let me give you some advice.  Make sure you pimp the hell out of your accomplishment.   As you go through life many people will have no idea what this even means.  However, for the few select who do they will look favorably upon you.  I always was told that it would open doors along my way and it has.   Be proud of what you have accomplished.   It means that you stuck with something for many years which is an accomplishment in itself.   Good job", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/744wxi/finally_got_the_rank_of_eagle_scout_today_its/dnwq6yh/"}
