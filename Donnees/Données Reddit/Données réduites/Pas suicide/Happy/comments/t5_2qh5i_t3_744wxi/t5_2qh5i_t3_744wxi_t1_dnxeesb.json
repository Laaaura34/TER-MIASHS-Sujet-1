Yesterday I had to take him into the \"city\" to get his project approval.  We parked and walked across the street to the building where we were meeting the guy.  I came back out to the first parking ticket I've ever received in my life.  I had no idea there was a sign that said no parking between such and such hours.  I'm super glad that it wasn't towed!  \n\nThanks for the story. The tow was worth it, I'm sure!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/744wxi/finally_got_the_rank_of_eagle_scout_today_its/dnxeesb/"}
