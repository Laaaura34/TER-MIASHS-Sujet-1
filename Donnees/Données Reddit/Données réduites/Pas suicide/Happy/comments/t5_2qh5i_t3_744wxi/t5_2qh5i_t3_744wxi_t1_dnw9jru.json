It's based on service to others and helping the community. In my council our OA chapter is pretty huge. They do their own events, camp outs and everything. OA is on a national scale as well. Chapters are in \"sections\" which is how they organize the entire country. Sections typically do a big camp out once a year or every other year and there is a national event similar to the national jamboree.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/744wxi/finally_got_the_rank_of_eagle_scout_today_its/dnw9jru/"}
