Eagle is the highest ranking achieved in the Boy Scouts. In order to achieve this rank, you need to complete all the previous ranks (6 lower ranks all increasing in work/difficulty as you go up), earn 13 required Eagle Scout merit badges and 8 non Eagle required, and complete an Eagle Scout project which consists of planning, leading, and ultimately finishing a community service project that benefits your local community. All of these requirements will need to be completed before your 18th birthday, which gives you about 10 years to do so. It should also be noted that roughly 5% of Boy Scouts who start scouting reach Eagle Scout.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/744wxi/finally_got_the_rank_of_eagle_scout_today_its/dnvv8qi/"}
