I haven\u2019t had a coke since 2018, and I had coke/Pepsi everyday.\n\nI drink lots of water, and I walk a lot. I play Pok\u00e9mon Go, and that gets me out of the house and I walk to help hatch eggs and what not. (If you\u2019re into mobile gaming)\n\nWhen I used to get bored, I\u2019d sit down and basically stuff my face with just junk, bags of chips, candy, all that crappy stuff. Now, if I\u2019m hungry, I substitute junk for fruits. My favorites are blueberries and strawberries, I just go to a store and get a basket of fresh mixed fruit and chow down on that.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/goyc58/im_really_proud_of_myself_not_only_for_losing_all/frjxeu2/"}
