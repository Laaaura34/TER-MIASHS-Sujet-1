I also still went to the gym, but mostly focused on squatting with weights, and my legs got huge.\n\nOn the left, in 2018, I was around 190lbs / 5\u20199 (but I slouched, so I looked shorter).\n\nI am currently 145lbs now.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/goyc58/im_really_proud_of_myself_not_only_for_losing_all/frjwidt/"}
