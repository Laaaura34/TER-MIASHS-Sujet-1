We\u2019ve shared a lot of great Halloween\u2019s together. What I think is really special about my dad, is he hasn\u2019t been inside a Halloween store since I was maybe 13 and was done Trick or Treating. He transforms our entire front yard into a spooky haunted house all with items we grab from the back yard and garage. We spend maybe $35 bucks for fog juice (for our smoke machine), changing light bulbs, and spider webs. Everything else is lumber, trash bags, old clothes, etc etc.  and I\u2019m telling you, at least 30 people see our yard, start to shake, and run off! It\u2019s awesome to see how much we can scare people :D it\u2019s truly very very fun! We are already talking ideas for next year haha", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9t67a8/my_dad_the_man_in_the_mask_has_been_transforming/e99qif7/"}
