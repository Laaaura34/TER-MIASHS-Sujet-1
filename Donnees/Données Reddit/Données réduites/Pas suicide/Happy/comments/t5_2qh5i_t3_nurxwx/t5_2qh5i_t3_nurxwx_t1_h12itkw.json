I have a question if you could answer. I went through your post history and it seems like you have quite a history with psychedelics. I loved reading some of the trip reports. Usually people don\u2019t consider those types of drugs to be addictive or necessarily bad for you; in fact it can be quite beneficial. I have done all types of psychedelics myself and have had positive and negative experiences that definitely have changed who I am today. I am wondering if psychedelics were starting to give you problems which made you make a decision to quit? Did you feel like you were dependent on them for happiness at all? Do you regret using them?", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/nurxwx/finally_starting_to_love_myself_this_is_a_genuine/h12itkw/"}
