After seeing some.of the things that I am capable of, how could I hate myself? \n\nAnd I also stopped telling myself sob stories all day. If something \"bad\" happens, its only bad because I perceive it as bad. So now I have an inner knowing and trust that everything that is happening, is working in my favor toward my higher purpose. \n\nI also replaced a lot of the negativiry in my life qith uplifting things. Social media, people, music, what I read. Basically, Im on a \"mental diet\". I dont think about what I dont want (anxiety and worry) and I think about what I do want (completed goals, situations going in my favor, confidence). \n\nThis life really is a game of beliefs and perception. The more you focus on positive things, the more you will see them in your life. Sounds woo-woo hippie-esque, but I assure you, it is real stuff. \n\nAnd when your whole life is going good, how could you hate yourself?!?! Youre the only person who can make youre life as good as it is!!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/nurxwx/finally_starting_to_love_myself_this_is_a_genuine/h0zdh1l/"}
