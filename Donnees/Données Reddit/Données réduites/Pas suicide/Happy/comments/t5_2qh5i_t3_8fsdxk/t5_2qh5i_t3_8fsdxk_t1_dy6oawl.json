They caught it just in time and my surgeon was incredible, he left no scarring or damage.\n\nThis is almost exactly the same with my daughter, she was originally misdiagnosed and wasnt until a routine hospital appointment that a newer doctor noticed something and took a hunch, we were told that if it had gone unnoticed, she would have had roughly 2weeks before falling into a coma. \n\n>I\u2019m glad you\u2019re daughter is doing just as well! Hopefully this\u2019ll be her when she\u2019s older!\n\nThankyou so much, I hope so too. Good luck with everything in your future :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8fsdxk/graduated_with_my_bachelors_on_friday_with_a_40_9/dy6oawl/"}
