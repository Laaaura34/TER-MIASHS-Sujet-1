The tumor was benign but inoperable, so they had to create a new pathway for the brain fluid to drain from the cavity. It was an emergency surgery because any longer could have caused my brain to burst and create permanent brain damage. They caught it just in time and my surgeon was incredible, he left no scarring or damage. Truly a man that saved my life and future. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re daughter is doing just as well! Hopefully this\u2019ll be her when she\u2019s older!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8fsdxk/graduated_with_my_bachelors_on_friday_with_a_40_9/dy6mv55/"}
