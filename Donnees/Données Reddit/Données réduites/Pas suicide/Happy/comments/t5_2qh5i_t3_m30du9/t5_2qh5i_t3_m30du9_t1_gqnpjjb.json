I had broken up with my girlfriend of 3 1/2 years and within a month I was talking to someone new who had started pursuing me. I fell head over heels in love with her the second date we had and now almost 2 years later she\u2019s still sleeping peacefully next to me. Best of luck to you and keep that shine my brother, your best days are ahead of you!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/m30du9/after_a_breakup_with_a_girlfriend_of_4_years_a/gqnpjjb/"}
