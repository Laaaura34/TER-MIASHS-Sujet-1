I have had calls pop up before and have tried to answer them but someone else always got their first. This last time I was just getting out of the car at home and had my phone in my hand when the call came through.  \n\nA visually impaired couple were trying to cook dinner and were trying to find a can of chopped tomatoes. I helped the guy search through 2 separate cupboard trying to find some but it appears they were all out. I found myself being very apologetic for his lack of tomatoes and hoped that it didn't spoil their dinner.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/hdw0e0/i_just_got_my_first_call_on_be_my_eyes_after/fvqcmj3/"}
