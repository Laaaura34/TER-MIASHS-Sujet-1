Then I\u2019d round it out, and solder the seam shut, so I now have an O shaped piece of silver. Next, I basically map out the measurements of all the settings and use a tool called a flex shaft to carve the settings and prongwork for each stone. The last part is to set the stones (in this case rubies!) and polish it up with a buff wheel. Finally I just had to check to see if the stones were tight in the settings and it\u2019s ready to go:) thank you for the kind words! I hope that shed some light :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/a0193m/just_sold_one_of_my_rings_that_i_made_as_a/eae5cum/"}
