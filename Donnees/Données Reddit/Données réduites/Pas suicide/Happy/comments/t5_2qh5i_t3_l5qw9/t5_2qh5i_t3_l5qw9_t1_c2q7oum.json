I spent a long time unhappy because I was hoping for a day that I won both the Nobel Peace Prize and a million dollars.\nThat probably will never happen, but I can still choose to be happy when Im with my kids, petting my dog, reading a good book, or just sitting with a cup of perfectly brewed tea. For me, it's become about contentment, and that's a far more reasonable definition of happiness.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/l5qw9/what_does_happiness_mean_to_you/c2q7oum/"}
