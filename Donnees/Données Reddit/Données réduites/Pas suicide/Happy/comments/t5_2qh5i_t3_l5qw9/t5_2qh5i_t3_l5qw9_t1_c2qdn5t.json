So did I ever feel sadness or anger before I knew what sadness or anger were? Unfortunately, the answer is a bit tautological. If I have felt sadness, then I knew what it was, regardless if what I felt was known to me as \"sadness\". So by asking what happiness is, one must acknowledge that they had not felt it before, otherwise they would not be asking.
