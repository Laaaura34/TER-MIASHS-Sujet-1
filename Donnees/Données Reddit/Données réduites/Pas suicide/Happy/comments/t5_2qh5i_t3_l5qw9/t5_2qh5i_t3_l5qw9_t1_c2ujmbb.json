Fell in love with it the moment I heard it. I tried to find the title to no avail. Felt quite sad cause I may have never heard it again. A week ago, I found a new song that I really liked. Three days ago I got new headphones and listened to that song with them, and then realized it was in fact that same exact song I heard back then. I got one hell of a euphoric rush that not even drugs could make.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/l5qw9/what_does_happiness_mean_to_you/c2ujmbb/"}
