This particular mountain is the highest summit in Europe where you can get to without actual climbing with ropes and stuff. It took me 10 and half hours with breaks included. Physically by far the most challenging thing I have ever done and that is why it was so rewarding to be up there.\n\nI drove from the town of Visp to S\u00e4nntum parking which is in about 1800 meters altitude. From there it takes about 5-6 hours to the summit. Terrain is tough from time to time, rough sand, slidind rocks of different sizes, very steep parts but none that require a rope. \n\nI also descended from the mountain top partly off-trail which was one of the best adventures I have had. I met few englishmen at the top and we slid down the glacier on our backpacks a few times because it was the only way to get down from where we were \"lost\". It was so much fun!\n\nOverall the Swiss alps provide something for everyone. If you are in good physical condition I can warmly suggest Barrhorn. It is tough but very rewarding hike!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/91qmib/after_a_tough_year_and_a_breakup_i_began_focusing/e2zz8vb/"}
