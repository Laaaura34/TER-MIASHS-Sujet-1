Beautiful dress. I just got married 2 weeks ago and it was so much fun. Make sure you really take time to enjoy the day and also don\u2019t let little things ruin anything for you. Little things will go wrong (like my best man bending over and ripping his pants WIDE open 20 min before the ceremony started lmao) but everything will be great. I felt like the day was such a blur but I made sure to make time to at least say hello and have a short conversation with everyone who came and it was cool to have little moments with people that we\u2019ll remember. Have fun, it will be amazing! Congrats again to you and your fianc\u00e9", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/przcil/i_picked_out_my_wedding_dress_yesterday_once_they/hdnt49m/"}
