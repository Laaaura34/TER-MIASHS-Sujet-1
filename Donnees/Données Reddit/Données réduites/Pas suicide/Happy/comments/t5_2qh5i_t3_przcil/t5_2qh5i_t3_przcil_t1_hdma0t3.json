Don\u2019t say a thing about it! I never really thought about it like how you hear about girls always imagining their perfect wedding. But the morning of our wedding I couldn\u2019t have been more excited just to see her and realized that is such an amazing thing for the guy in all of it, obviously it\u2019s all great, but that\u2019s such an extra treat to see your love looking magical. And she was (and very much so still is) stunning. \n\nYou\u2019re a beautiful woman and he\u2019ll melt inside when he sees you! Congrats again\u2026wishing you the best!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/przcil/i_picked_out_my_wedding_dress_yesterday_once_they/hdma0t3/"}
