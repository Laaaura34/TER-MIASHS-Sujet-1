If it were I\u2019d completely agree with you but it\u2019s not that serious of an agreement. I\u2019m sure someone else in my fam will prob have a surprise too. It\u2019s just how my family is. We\u2019re all adults, it\u2019s not really that we are too poor or anything. We were still getting the little kids gifts anyway. They\u2019ve always given me gifts when I couldn\u2019t give back and now it\u2019s my turn! Cheers", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/eeekij/my_dad_sometimes_dresses_up_as_something_funny/fbugx94/"}
