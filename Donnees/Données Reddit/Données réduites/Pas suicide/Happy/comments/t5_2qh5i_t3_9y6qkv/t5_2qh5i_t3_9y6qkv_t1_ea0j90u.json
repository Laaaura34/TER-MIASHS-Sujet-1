You could be super talented and she might love you to the end of the earth and back but she still might not get much joy out of listening. My partner creates music sometimes and I listen to finished pieces because it makes them happy And give feedback, but it isn\u2019t my style and I wouldn\u2019t ever ask them to play me something just randomly. I love them very much though. \n\nEdited to add I also play an instrument and I\u2019ve never been asked to play something either, which is fine. I am sure they would sit politely and listen if I asked but it\u2019s just not that interesting to listen without participating. Maybe you can include your wife somehow and make sweet tunes together. The only time my partner and I really listen to each other\u2019s music is when we play together. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9y6qkv/im_listening_to_my_boyfriend_playing_piano_in_the/ea0j90u/"}
