Then the both of us went shopping at her favorite little boutique clothing store where she found a whole outfit that i bought for her. The goal for me was to just treat the day as me wanting to spoil her as i randomly do sometimes. I made dinner reservations at this little Italian restaurant that she loves and invited her whole family and best friend as well to have them involved in the plan. Once dinner was finished and the waitress took the plates away, I ordered \u201cdessert\u201d for the table and excused myself to the restroom soon after that. Waiting in the bathroom was a change of clothes for me (a shirt, tie, slacks and shoes) I quickly changed and came out to give the waitress the cue to bring out the \u201cdessert\u201d, which was a plate with the words \u201cwill you merry me\u201d drizzled in chocolate. In the middle was an James Avery engagement ring charm that she could add to her new charm bracelet. I snuck in behind her (her back was to the entrance of the back room where we were sitting) and got on a knee. She turned around and seen me knelt with the ring already out. She was so shocked surprised by it all and her mom and dad was there to witness it all. Was such a special night!
