Not enough people applaud sobriety as we should. I'm super proud of you stranger... Addiction is one of the toughest demons to face. I have watched friends and family suffer from it and some didn't make it. If you ever just want a third party to vent to please feel free to dm me. I know somedays are easier and others feel impossible. While I can't say I understand what your going through I can always lend an ear. Don't let anyone lessen how amazing this accomplishment is for you and I wish you nothing but luck and health. \u2764\ufe0f And remember to go gently should you have any bumps in the road because we are all human here and it truly is part of the process.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/imkosg/went_from_coma_to_four_months_sober_from_cocaine/g43iaq7/"}
