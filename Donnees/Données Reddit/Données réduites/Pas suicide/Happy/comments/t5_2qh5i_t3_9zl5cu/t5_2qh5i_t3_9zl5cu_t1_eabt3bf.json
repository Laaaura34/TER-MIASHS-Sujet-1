I didn't even visit the doctor until 10 weeks for both of my pregnancies.  Just tried to eat well as possible, exercise and limit my stress.  I knew I was pregnant so why bother with doctor until necessary?  I didn't tell anyone until I was 22 weeks along. Also didn't go to birthing classes because having a birthing plan seemed kinda dumb because nature does its thing regardless of our plans.  I had a good idea of what to expect and it all worked out, thankfully.  Best of luck!\n", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9zl5cu/just_found_out_im_4_weeks_pregnant_too_early_to/eabt3bf/"}
