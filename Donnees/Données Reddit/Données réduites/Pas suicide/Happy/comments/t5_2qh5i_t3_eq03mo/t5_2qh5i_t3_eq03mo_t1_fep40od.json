Hmm. Okay, I'd recommend looking up Disneyland disability passes. I've heard that they've been changing drastically as Disney attempts to redesign its lines to accommodate people with disabilities. Newer parks have been built in a certain way, and old parks' line areas have been gradually redesigned... but that's a tough order for Disneyland because it's the smallest Disney park and there's not much room to spare.\n\nIt may sound good that they're redesigning with disability in mind, but the downside is that people with disabilities don't always get to skip the lines anymore. :/\n\nAlso, I've heard some problematic things about the new Star Wars Galaxy's Edge area in Disneyland. They've designed the walkways to keep people moving, and that means very few places to stop and rest. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f That means it's harder to take a break and enjoy the atmosphere. Just... keep that in mind when you visit that section of the park, OK?\n\nLastly, does your daughter like Cars? If so, she will love love LOVE Cars Land in California Adventure. It's amazing.\n\nI'm not sure whether she's big enough for roller coaster-ish rides. If she is, Radiator Springs Racers in Cars Land is the most impressive Disney ride I've ever experienced... but the lines were *crazy* long a few years ago. I'm not sure how they are now, but looking into the quickest way to get on that ride in particular would be a worthy goal!\n\nI hope your family has a fantastic time!! \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/eq03mo/my_daughter_got_her_wish_granted_from_make_a_wish/fep40od/"}
