It just wasn't what I need in a relationship.\n\nA week later, the guy who checked us in and out of the hotel we spent our early valentine's day/late one year anniversary showed up on the list of visitors to my okcupid profile - he lives about an hour away - and I sent him a message to offer to buy him a beer if he was ever in town where I live, because he seemed really cool and I thought perhaps we could be friends.\n\nThree weeks later, we're in like, we talk on the phone every night we don't see each other for hours (and I hate talking on the phone), and we see each other more often than I saw my ex while he was living in the same damn city as me.  I'm happier than I've been in a really long time.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1n6ujc/just_found_out_my_best_friend_of_seven_years_is/ccg6srj/"}
