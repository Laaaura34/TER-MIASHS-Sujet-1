The brightness and use of color really brings across the joy you're feeling. Wonderful work!\n\nOne minor suggestion: the angle of the light sources seems to be a bit off. The moon is illuminated from the left, but the mountains are illuminated from the right. A tip for your next work: you can tie string to a pin somewhere off your canvas and stretch the string out to see what angle the light would hit each object in your painting.\n\nNever stop creating joy (and art)!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/nw5426/painting_this_giant_galaxy_scene_brought_me_so/h19rd8w/"}
