Women I've dated have been super hot by my personal standards; surely they found me attractive since we were dating, but a quick insecure post to /r/rateme (from a different account of course) during a spree of bad dating luck gave me a reality check that by the general population's standards I'm average looking at best - 5'8, had a hideous hairstyle and dressed very poorly at the time.\n\nOf course that's not to say that women don't go for better-looking dudes more eagerly by default (looking at the current dating lives of female friends and/or exes - almost all have been typically dating somebody better-looking), but it seems like being average is definitely not a deal-breaker per se.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9eyzip/please_help_me_shock_my_husband_by_our_picture/e5ssdmx/"}
