Time management is something I've had to get good at!\n\nMy first rule is that I come first. I meet my needs first, then everyone else gets what's left. If I don't put myself first I get burnt out quick and turn irritable.\n\nIf you're an introvert at all schedule time for yourself like you would anyone else.\n\nOnce you've got yourself managed you can turn your focus on your partner and be able to give them all of it because your needs have been met.\n\nI hope that helps.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/l7rei8/i_have_big_problems_managing_time_and/gl892tw/"}
