I\u2019m proud of you too. I lost my brother to suicide and it breaks my heart to see anyone go through the pain he went through, or to see any other family go through the impalpable grief that my family went through. \nYou are a beautiful young woman and I\u2019m sure you have people in your life who care about you deeply. I hope you are getting the help you need in order to combat the terrible affliction that is depression and suicidal thoughts. Never feel you can\u2019t reach out to people and you are never being a burden, we all need help sometimes and some of us more than others. \nGood luck and take care. You look amazing btw! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude0a", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/l1qkuk/i_turned_25_today_i_grapple_with_depression/gk3m0jj/"}
