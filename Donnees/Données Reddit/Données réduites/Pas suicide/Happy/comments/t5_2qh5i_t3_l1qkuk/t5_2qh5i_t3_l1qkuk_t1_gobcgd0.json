It literally saved my life and is amazing for treating suicidal thoughts because it heals instead of medicates or hides the issue like medication and antidepressants do (believe me, I've tried my fair share). If you have any questions at all about psychedelic therapy please let me know! \n\nIn my opinion, the best psychedelics for depression and suicidal thoughts would be Ketamine and even more so psilocybin mushrooms. There have been multiple studies done by John Hopkins Hospital and imperial College of London in England that have shown psilocybin to be nearly 80% affective at healing depression. Around 60% of the trial participants in England remained depression free for over four months. Psilocybin heals you because it allows you to work on past trauma and actually HEAL instead of numb!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/l1qkuk/i_turned_25_today_i_grapple_with_depression/gobcgd0/"}
