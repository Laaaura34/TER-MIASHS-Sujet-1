Keep a positive attitude and remind yourself that this is temporary. Eventually you'll no longer love him/her. It's still painful if I really let myself dwell on it, but that's why I don't let myself do that anymore. It's very unhealthy after you've dissected it enough to understand what went wrong. One day you can look at those memories and they won't cause pain anymore but it takes years. And that's okay. Just give yourself all the time you need. Cry as much as you feel you need to. Visit /r/breakups if you haven't. Don't force anything to happen with anyone, because it just won't work if you do. It's okay to casually date to keep distracted if you need to, as long as the other person understands that too. Everyday you're a little stronger. You'll survive this.
