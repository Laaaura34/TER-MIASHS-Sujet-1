I went  on a long motorcycle ride with my dad to clear my head, about 900 miles over 3 days.   When I got back I met a girl on OkCupid.  We had our first date the next night, we got married 1 year later on the beach where she grew up lifeguarding!  It was amazing!     You never know when you are going to meet the person you want to spend the rest of your life with!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9sps8e/5_years_ago_i_commented_on_a_random_meme_a/e8rdr3s/"}
