Her arms aren\u2019t big. So what if her stomach is full? You don\u2019t know why. Women bloat. Women have hormonal issues. \n\nThe point is, you chose to come into a lovely post of a man celebrating his marriage and made unwanted comments on her body. Not his, but hers. Don\u2019t act shocked that people think it\u2019s rude. \n\nYou sound like a jealous little man in his basement upset someone has a woman and is happy.
