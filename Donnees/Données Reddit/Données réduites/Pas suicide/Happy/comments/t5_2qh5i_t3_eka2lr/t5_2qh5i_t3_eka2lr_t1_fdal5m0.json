Lord knows if they have any of that at home), but you can\u2019t be that role model at the expense of your mental and physical health (I know you already know all of this). It\u2019s just sad all the way around. If the administration would just work with the troubled students, they wouldn\u2019t have caring teachers, such as yourself, feeling the need to leave! I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through so much in just a years time- but you\u2019re already showing that what doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger! You\u2019re truly a remarkable woman (remember that when someone tries to take that shine away from you!!). \ud83c\udf3b", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/eka2lr/2019_was_incredibly_rough_but_im_feeling_really/fdal5m0/"}
