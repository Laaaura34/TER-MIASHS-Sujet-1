The people who knew me from before aren't around to compare my current state to my previous spirit.    \nI checked recently and my only interactions in the last half a year or so has been interacting with strangers such as waiters, bank tellers, customers service reps, and retail cashiers.\n\nHolidays have been hard but it's becoming the same thing every year. I'm hoping the weather eases off in the next little bit so I could get out and about a little.\n\nThank you for reaching out. I'm gonna chalk this under \"positive interaction with a fellow survivor\".", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/eka2lr/2019_was_incredibly_rough_but_im_feeling_really/fdbwo1e/"}
