I didn\u2019t expect such a pleasant response from so many people. I\u2019m a low-key person, and I don\u2019t talk to a lot of people, but I cannot express how happy I feel to have people show simple kindness.\n\nFor the record, because people seem to dig it, [this](https://electrothreads.com/products/galaxy-2-0-hooded-dress-1) is my hoodie. If any of y\u2019all get something, mention my username and maybe someone will give me a discount (kidding).\n\nThank you again, you\u2019re all electronic strangers but definitely helped put a smile on my face this morning!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/eka2lr/2019_was_incredibly_rough_but_im_feeling_really/fda4nhb/"}
