So we got married at City Hall first thing in the morning. Then we went home and a professional helped my wife get into her family kimono. Almost two hours. Then we headed to the shrine to meet friends and family and have our wedding blessed. Not the official shrine marriage ceremony you might be familiar with. Just getting blessed with everyone else that happened to be there that day.\n\nHere we are 3 years later and still happy (with some other if my favorite wedding day photos).\n\n I'm home sick and just thinking about how we didn't fall for the old stereotype of marriage ending your happy life. It's not easy, but as long as we never stop working at it, it'll be alright.\n\nhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/5kPd4DyQxl58pLUg1\n", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8akuj4/3_hours_of_being_married_we_hired_a_photographer/dwzexy6/"}
