I feel like I can read what you write for quite a while lol.\n\nWhat's weird is I started diving online about anxiety to see who else has shit going on. Then I saw a few posts about palpitations, how they're related to the thyroid (not discounting that) but one thing led to another.\n\nWell, THEN I started getting heart palpitations. Then I thought about my heart beat all damn day. All. Day. Every beat. Guess what happens when you become conscious of palpitations and trying to find more? Your mind, sure enough, creates more for you.\n\nBut for some reason, when you explained how you felt in the shower, I became ok. I mean who can you tell that to? But it got to the point where I now hate taking showers. And I'm a 33 year old \"normal\" social Male, but all of the sudden this random shit popped up. With no rhyme or reason. \n\nIt's so weird tho. Maybe there's so much on my mind (now because I'm on mobile, and also because I'm sometimes bad at organizing meaningful thoughts) that I'll get into the shower and my mind races. Heart rate goes like 180bpm. And my resting is about 50 with a resting super low BP of 105/50. \n\nI guess this is what happens when someone hears about someone else experiencing the exact same thing. I haven't experienced that before. Sorry for not writing better.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/coswp8/ive_hit_seven_months_without_a_single_panic/ewqhbed/"}
