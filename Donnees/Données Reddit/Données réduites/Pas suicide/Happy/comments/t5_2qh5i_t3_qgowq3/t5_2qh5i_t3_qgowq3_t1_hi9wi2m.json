Mine's middle name is after my grandfather who passed a few years ago after a really valiant battle with cancer. He was given six months to live in '05, then went into remission for 12 years before it came back. Many formative years I got to have him in my life. He taught me to drive, walked me down the aisle (my dad can't walk, but he did give me away from his chair), and was present for the birth of his first great grandchild =) We were always going to give a boy his name as a middle name, but when it turned out the baby had a fight ahead of him, it was especially relevant. Everyone says that grandpa held his hand \ud83d\ude2d", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/qgowq3/my_son_is_12_months_corrected_after_being_born/hi9wi2m/"}
