I worked for 3 years with special needs adults 18-21 before they aged out of the public school system. One student was such a light and example to everyone around her. She was non verbal but was great at using pictures. Her last year with us we finally got a portable computer that she could push pictures and it would speak for her, she was so happy and amazing at using it. It is sad it took so long to get her something like this. You are a great teacher, I wish you luck down the road!
