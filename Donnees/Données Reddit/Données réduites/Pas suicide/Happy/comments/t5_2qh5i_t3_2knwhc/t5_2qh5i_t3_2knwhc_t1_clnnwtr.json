I tried looking up videos but there mostly seems to be demos rather than the app being used. It's great because it's fully customizable and can grow with the student's vocabulary! To give an example of how it works, one thing we are working on is with her making requests. So to do this there is a main \"I want...\" button on the home screen which I've set to show her commonly requested items. She can than select which item based on the pictures. The program verbalizes what she chooses, so I would hear something like, \u201cI want computer.\" Also on the home screen she has categories such as feelings, conversational items, an about me section, among a few others. This is starting somewhat basic and will eventually expand. By the end of the year I'd like her to be using this for full basic conversations!
