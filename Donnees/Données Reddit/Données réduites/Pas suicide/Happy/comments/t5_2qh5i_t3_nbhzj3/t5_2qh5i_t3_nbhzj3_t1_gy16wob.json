Good job!  Nice work! \n\nAs others have said, stain it.  Then 3 coats of polyurethane.  \n\nCan use a spray poly.  Very lightly sand between coats with like 400-600 grit sandpaper. You just want to rough up the last coat a bit to give the next coat something to grab on to. Let each coat dry completely.  Definitely YouTube it.  Good info there. \n\nA few thoughts for your next build?\n\nUse flat head wood screws and countersink them slightly under the surface of the table.  Or screw from the underside so they don't show. Just have to measure carefully so they don't go through.  If from the top, then you can fill the screw holes with wood putty/filler, glue+sawdust, or a wooden plug.  \n\nThere's also an interesting method to hide screws where you use a sharp chisel to peel back a small, thin patch where the screw will go, like 3/4\" x 3/4\" but do not take it off, leaving it attached.  Screw the screw in under the flap of wood then glue the flap of wood back into place over the countersunk screw head and sand and finish. \n\nI would also knock down the sharp edges just a little with some sandpaper, a small block plane, or a small router with a small chamfer bit or a small round over bit.\n\nBut excellent work for a first time!
