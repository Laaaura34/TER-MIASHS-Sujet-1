Some students struggle to sit in a hard chair at a desk and actually work better with other options. I have had many students prefer to work on the floor if it's an option and some prefer to stand! Once students explore the options they learn what works for them. There is less need to have everyone facing the front as teachers have methods other than having students look at or copy of off the whiteboard. This kind of seating also allows for small groups to collaborate and discuss with each other. \nCongratulations to the teacher for thinking outside the box!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cxca4y/after_spending_all_summer_redesigning_my/eyldxnq/"}
