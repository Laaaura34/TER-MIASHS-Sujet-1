I teach middle school 6th-8th grade Spanish :)\n\n\n\nP.s\u2014 I\u2019m getting a lot of negative comments which is kindof making me sad, I only teach about 40 minute classes. My kids are always in really restrictive desks all day, and they don\u2019t allow for group work because of their shape. The vases are plastic and filled with flower pens, and my students have previously begged for more bean bag chairs just to be out of their desks. They have to change seats everyday, and for tests they have dividers. I hope that answers everyone\u2019s questions, I\u2019m just trying to do my best :(", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cxca4y/after_spending_all_summer_redesigning_my/eyn2pvi/"}
