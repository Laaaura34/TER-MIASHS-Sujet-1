I\u2019ve been doing kick boxing\nFor the past 5-6 months or so and yes it\u2019s expensive but I get a really good work out every time I go. I screwed up my health pretty bad, I\u2019m on blood pressure pills, cholesterol and heart burn medication. It\u2019s tough but it\u2019s good to take care of it now before it gets worse. My doctor said it\u2019s good that I lost weight because it really contributes to everything else. \ud83c\udf7b cheers to good health.
