All the messed up things that happened...  my x-wife's sister was the notary for the papers I was served.  She let my daughter stamp the papers (yeah you read that right, my kid rubber stamped her parents divorce papers with her aunts notary stamp), my x served me papers but didn't file them wih the courts for a few years.\n\n\nBut this year on my bday (early sep)  my divorce was finalized.  Best bday present ever.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9gjyng/soon_after_my_divorce_i_found_my_ideal_job_and/e651eky/"}
