You\u2019re gonna travel across a couple states to go on a date? It\u2019s just not really appropriate to be asking people out on this sub , it\u2019s r/happy lol, maybe a hookup sub or something like that. \n\nIt\u2019s also odd to jump on someone when they just ended a serious relationship, predatory. They didn\u2019t say they needed or were looking for help, friends or a hookup. It\u2019s just weird and desperate.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to tear into you, just trying to help you get an idea of what\u2019s appropriate and how it came off.
