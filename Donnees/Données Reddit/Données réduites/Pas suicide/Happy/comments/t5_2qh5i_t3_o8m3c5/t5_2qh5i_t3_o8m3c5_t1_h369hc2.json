That's it. \"Most people grossly overestimate what they can accomplish in a year. Most people also grossly underestimate what they can accomplish in 10 years.\"   \n\n\nCleaning your room might seem small, but I shit you not, it's step one of working through depression. If you can keep your room consistently clean (and be kind to yourself if you slack sometimes. Wars are won over many battles), soon you'll be working on the kitchen. If you can keep your room AND your kitchen clean...then it's getting in 2-4 workouts a week (or even long walks). And fuck me, if you're consistently doing all three of those things, you can literally do anything. Totally serious.   \n\n\nI know that battle OP. And I'm fucking proud of you.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/o8m3c5/depression_is_a_long_war_but_i_think_i_just_won/h369hc2/"}
