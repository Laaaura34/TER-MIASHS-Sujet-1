I\u2019ve been learning almost 4 years now, but I thought took month long br wow because I thought I\u2019d never be able to finish my programme. That was a huge mistake, and I really regret that now. It may seem hard to start a language, but you have to start somewhere, and it\u2019s worth all the effort to be able to speak any language. \n\nI\u2019m within a month of finishing my Duolingo Swedish programme, and while Duolingo isn\u2019t proficiency, it means a lot that I\u2019m finally so close to completing this.\n\nI do 3 Duolingo programmes every day, and I rewrite each new word twice and use it in a sentence, and I type it twice in a spreadsheet I\u2019ve created, and use it in a sentence again, after which I practise saying it. This is the best way to lock in the word and be able to speak easier. \n\nI am very proud of my hard work for Swedish, the many times I stayed up until midnight, all the times my parents told me to stop learning Swedish. I ignored all of the haters, and I\u2019m glad I kept learning. When I complete the programme, I can just imagine how happy it will make me. \n\nAlways keep going. It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t like Swedish in the end, but I encourage you to try another language, because it\u2019s hard for a while but in the end it pays off so much.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/a3qvnk/i_have_been_advancing_in_my_swedish_program_on/ec0a29l/"}
