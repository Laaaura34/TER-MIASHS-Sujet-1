I\u2019m about 75% done with my Swedish program on Duolingo, which means a lot to me since my life goal is to obtain Swedish citizenship [after University]. \n\nMy parents have told me not to learn Swedish, and my mum doesn\u2019t want me learning it, because the thinks I\u2019ll study abroad in China and then come back to Missouri. However, I don\u2019t know much Chinese (which J learn in school), I hate Missouri, and I\u2019m intent studying abroad in Sweden. \n\nI\u2019ll be very pleased when they can see finished program, however it may be. It\u2019s very hurtful to have your dreams played down by your parents, but I have worked harder than ever on this program, so I\u2019m very happy.
