When you apply in 2019, they're going to calculate your payment based on your earnings from roughly 2009-2019, during which you'd have 5 years of PT income.\n\nOnce approved for SSDI payments, you can still work and earn up to a certain amount without affecting your payments. Once approved, qualifying for government health insurance is possible and in some cases automatic. \n\nDon't be a proud hero. You have MS. Statistically speaking, though I wish you the best, you will likely need SSDI, apply for it now regardless of how well you're currently doing. Just remember, you want your income to be as high as possible in the 10 years beforehand. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2i9fn0/in_the_past_year_i_have_was_robbed_at_gunpoint_my/cl050zl/"}
