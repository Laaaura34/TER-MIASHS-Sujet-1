You just compared slavery to immigrants doing cheap labor voluntarily after traveling hundreds of miles to escape persecution (sound familiar?).  Do you even know the definition of slavery?  At first I took you seriously, know I see the lack of education coming out.  \n\nIt's not your fault, your school system failed you.  We need to do better and kick out Betsy Devos so you can get the education you desperately still need.\n\n   We are traitors because we point out the hypocrisy, we are traitors because we don't look at people suffering and say \"Well.... sorry, you weren't born here!\"  We are the traitors because we don't separate mothers from children and put them in concentration camps?  \n\nNewsflash, I don't affiliate with either political party, I'm just not a selfish asshole who gets off on hurting people for no reason.  Also newsflash, Obama deported more immigrants than any president.  Ever.  In fact, Trump has already said he won't be able to deport as many as Obama.  The system was fine, and we benefit MUTUALLY from the immigrants that make their way into the country.  The ONLY logical reason to hate them is racism.  Which, unfortunately, is another side effect of your very apparent lack of education.  \n\nIncase I didn't trigger you enough, god isn't real, we need to abort more babies for stem cell research, evolution needs to be taught in schools since it actually has scientific base, and muslims are actually nice people.
