Now that you are full fledged citizen i can share 1 important fact about voting. You vote means nothing here. This country is ran by special interest groups/lobbies that pay the people in office that already have money to pass the bills that benefit them so they can get more money. A person that is in the poverty backet will never win a seat in any part of government unless its the welfare line. Just keep that in mind. Also be prepared to be turned away at the so called polling station due to you not looking \"American\".\n\nSorry for the brutal truth.... good luck", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/905w6z/im_officially_a_us_citizen_im_so_proud_and_happy/e2p5uao/"}
