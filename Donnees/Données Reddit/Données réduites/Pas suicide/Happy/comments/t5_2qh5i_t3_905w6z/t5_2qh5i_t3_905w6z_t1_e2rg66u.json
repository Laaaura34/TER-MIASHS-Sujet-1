We don't welcome them. Democrats welcome them while telling Americans that we have no right to decide who comes to our country.\n\n\"They're just doing jobs Americans don't want to do!\" Good job defending slavery. Democrats never change.\n\nAlso complaining about us being the invaders is actually an argument against illegal immigration. Maybe those natives should have had strong borders and a wall.\n\nThis is why everyone thinks you're a traitor by the way. Because you make excuses for illegal foreign aliens invading our country. As if we're not a sovereign nation. Because you hate our country and everything it stands for. Shameful. I'm so glad your party is burning.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/905w6z/im_officially_a_us_citizen_im_so_proud_and_happy/e2rg66u/"}
