I know I\u2019ve still got work to do as my emotions are still up and down ya know, but I look forward to the future with this new found confidence and the unwavering support of my husband. When I told him I actually got a job at a Crystal shop he was sooooooo proud of me!! That brings tears to my eyes that I almost fucked up my marriage, the best thing to ever happen to me. I even hiked a mountain recently! Like I never left the house before and just experiencing life again (which was mad scary at first btw) has become so refreshing! Sometimes I just go to the park, sit in the sun and feed the ducks. Like I can do anything I want!!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n3lhbf/the_first_photo_is_me_off_benzos_and_opioids_for/gwr7e0x/"}
