Well done and congratulations! I hope the detox and recovery hasn't been too brutal. :-)\n\n\nIf you don't mind my asking, I'd love to hear more details of your story, how you got onto these drugs, what it was like coming off of them, how exactly your husband stepped in, etc. If that's a little much to talk about for any reason, no worries whatsoever. I'm just happy for you. :-)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n3lhbf/the_first_photo_is_me_off_benzos_and_opioids_for/gwu2qly/"}
