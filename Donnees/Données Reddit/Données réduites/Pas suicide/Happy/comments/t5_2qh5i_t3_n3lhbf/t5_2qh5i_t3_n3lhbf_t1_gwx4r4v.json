The drugs blunt that shine and puts a darkness in those addicted. I'm so very happy for you and I'm proud of you that you found your strength to once again shine and live. You're a very beautiful woman and an even more beautiful and amazing soul and you most definitely sound like you have this.. As much as it can be had. My daughters name is Senova, she was also a bright star, loved by many, a soft giving heart who never knew a stranger and drug in every stray she ever came across be it animal or human and she had this infectious laugh that once you heard it you would never mistake it and would forever after be able to pick her out of a crowd of hundreds and hundreds just by hearing it.... It just passed two years last month and it's still as raw as if just happened. Again I'm so happy for you and proud of you if ever you feel like you need to talk to someone who understands where you're at or the things you're feeling or you hit a rough spot please feel free to holler at me, i'd be more than happy to talk to you.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n3lhbf/the_first_photo_is_me_off_benzos_and_opioids_for/gwx4r4v/"}
