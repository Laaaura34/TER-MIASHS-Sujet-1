I hid it s best as I could fit as long as I could. Plus I generally have an autoimmune disorder so he too thought I legit needed these meds.

He explained that he would be terrified at work or when I\u2019d go to sleep that he\u2019d find me dead. \n\nThat really hurt me. He\u2019d tell me things \u201cthe other Angie\u201d would do. How she was mean, dismissive, hostile, everything I\u2019m not ya know?
