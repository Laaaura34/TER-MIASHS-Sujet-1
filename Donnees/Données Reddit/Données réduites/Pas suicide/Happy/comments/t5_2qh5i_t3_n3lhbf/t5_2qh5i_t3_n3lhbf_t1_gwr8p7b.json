It doesn\u2019t allow us to think about those who we hurt along the way, it doesn\u2019t allow us to stop and look at how beautiful the sunset is, it doesn\u2019t allow us to feel any joy! It just wants  to rob us of everything that makes us *us*, and ultimately it wants us dead.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you this right now, 10 years later my emotions are *still* up and down, but that\u2019s just living life on life\u2019s terms, you know? Just remember this happy joyous and free feeling, and remember that even your worst day clean is a lot better than your \u201cbest\u201d day using. \n\nKeep up the great work, and remember, you **never have to use again**. If you ever need to talk, drop me a line! It keeps guys like me in line knowing that the disease is still out there kicking ass.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n3lhbf/the_first_photo_is_me_off_benzos_and_opioids_for/gwr8p7b/"}
