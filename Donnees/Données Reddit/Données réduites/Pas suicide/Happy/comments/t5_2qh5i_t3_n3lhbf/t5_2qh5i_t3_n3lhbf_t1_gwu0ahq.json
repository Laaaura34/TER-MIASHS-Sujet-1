I don't normally chat this much on Reddit but I love your attitude and what comes thru as a sincere determination to stay on track.  Keep up the amazing job and keep posting so we can follow your success. I really don't interact much with random Redditors but if there's anything ya ever need look me up (not looking to hit on ya or be a Redditor creep) I just understand recovery and it takes a long time to rebuild trust from those around you. So if ya need a random kick in the butt or someone to scream at..... anyways congrats 1 min, 1 moment 1 hour 1 day at a time", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n3lhbf/the_first_photo_is_me_off_benzos_and_opioids_for/gwu0ahq/"}
