May I give some advice? I find meditating for 5mins helps calm down anxiousness. Once you've overcome that (and it's okay if you don't immediately, just do what you can!), try to challenge the thought by saying, \"I \\*WILL\\* get a job! No matter what!\"  \n\n\nI'm a negative thinking kinda person and it takes a lot of time to change that (I'm still fighting these negative thinking). I try to be like my friend who's always trying to challenge her setbacks by speaking positive phrases out loud for herself. \"I will overcome this! I will get what I want!\" and tbh, it helps a lot! I know saying this is easy, but you can always try if you want to :)  \n\n\nI pray that you too will get a job! Always be kind to yourself, okay?", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/lwo7cf/i_got_a_job_after_so_many_months_of_being_jobless/gpiuphk/"}
