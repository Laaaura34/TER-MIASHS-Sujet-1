I really do love to laugh and smile - and I agree, it\u2019s contagious. I enjoy seeing other people smiling and laughing in public - especially when someone makes someone else laugh; it\u2019s spontaneous and organic and beautiful. In the moments when I realize I no longer have to cover my mouth to laugh, there\u2019s a combination feeling of freedom and relief - like, I can smile and laugh again without having to cover up or feel ashamed. It\u2019s such a huge weight off my shoulders. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9aucex/recently_down_on_my_luck_trying_to_get_things/e4yii8p/"}
