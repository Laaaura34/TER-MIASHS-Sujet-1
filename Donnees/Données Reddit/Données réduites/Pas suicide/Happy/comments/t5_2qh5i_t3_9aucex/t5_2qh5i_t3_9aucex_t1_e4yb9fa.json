I asked him if he ever does those, and told him I would definitely go to one where he was participating. So he asked to see a picture of my teeth, and the rest is history. He took an unorthodox approach to this cosmetic situation, and he plans on presenting (t)his success and these results to the ADA. I\u2019m hesitant to post his information, because I don\u2019t want him to be inundated with messages - but I\u2019ll ask him how he feels about me posting it or sharing it.
