They generally pull bread off shelves 4 days before the sell by date, and most companies have literally tons of stale per week. If he's friendly, and most are, they'll give you as much as you can carry.\n\nMy dad used to be one, and our family and our friends' families almost never bought bread because of the amount of stale that would otherwise be thrown out.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/171qyo/most_awesome_thing_happened_to_me_like_5_min_ago/c81l2rw/"}
