That's pretty awesome, actually. I worked for the USGS National Wildlife Health Center for a bit and they were really concerned with the White Nose Syndrome, and rightfully so--poor bats! ): Was that a big thing that affected you guys? Or hasn't it hit where you're at yet?\n\nThat's still pretty cool. I mean, I don't think I could do that because my viison is too awful, but I've always really loved bats. If I wasn't doing primates, bats would be one of my top choices for other species to work with. Pipistrelles are some of my favorites, so I'm quite jealous!\n\nThe howlers was just a quick field school study on alpha male behavior; didn't get to conclude it because of coming down with an illness before getting to finish, but it was pretty awesome. The lemurs was a study on feeding preferences in a semi-captive setting--I'm presenting it in a few weeks and I'm so excited! Lemurs are really fun. If you ever get the chance to work with them, they're really nice animals for the most part. Very laidback. Kind of like way more curious cats.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/xv2nz/after_25_years_of_part_time_work_i_finally_got_a/c5qckck/"}
