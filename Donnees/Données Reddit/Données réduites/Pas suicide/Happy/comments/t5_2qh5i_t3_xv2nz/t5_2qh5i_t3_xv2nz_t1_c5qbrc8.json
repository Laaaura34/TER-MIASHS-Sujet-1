Essentially, I used acoustic recorders in various habitats and used the number of calls as an indicator of activity. So, if you show me a sound file, I can likely identify identify a bat to species.\n\nA fellow grad student was also doing work at caves that involved mist-netting and harp trapping, and I did get to handle some bat species. Mainly eastern pipistrelles, little brown bats, big brown bats and northern long-eared bats. I also got to see two gray bats, which are federally endangered!\n\nSince they are nocturnal flying mammals, I can only identify them in the hand or maybe I can be lucky during dusk. Eastern pipistrelles have a very distinct flying pattern and big brown bats are just... big. Then again, so are hoary bats.\n\nWhat was it like studying them? Many long hours throughout the night. I became a night owl by the end of summer, LOL.  I loved it, though. Bats are truly fascinating mammals, and I don't regret it for a second.\n\nWhat was your research with lemurs and howlers about?", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/xv2nz/after_25_years_of_part_time_work_i_finally_got_a/c5qbrc8/"}
