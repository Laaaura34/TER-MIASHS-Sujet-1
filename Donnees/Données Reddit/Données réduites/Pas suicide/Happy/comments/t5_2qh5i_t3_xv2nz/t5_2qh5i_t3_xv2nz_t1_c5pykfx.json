Yes. But it is possible. My advice to you is to look at the various schools you are considering applying to, see if they offer assistantships. Some universities have EXCELLENT assistantships that pay decently.  Also, it's a great way to make connections to further your career. (Keep in mind that I am an American. I don't know how it works where you may be).\n\nLook around, talk to faculty, get your name out there.  In my personal view, your background in philosophy will be very useful because (I presume) it taught you how to think AND how to think in different ways. That can be invaluable to a researcher.\n\nSee what is out there. I believe in you. Make your world better. :)\n\nEDIT:\n\nAlso. When it comes to being a teacher itself. See if you can squeeze yourself into a different teaching assignment for the time being. Perhaps you could teach German full time instead rather than teaching students learning English?  Granted, this is a shameless plug of a person who loves to teach. ;)\n\nALSO EDIT:\n\nBehavioural neurobiology? That sounds like a truly awesome field. Any particular aspect? Humans? Mammals? I studied the feeding ecology of bats in a national forest, and so I had to read up some animal behavior.  I'd love to pick your brain!
