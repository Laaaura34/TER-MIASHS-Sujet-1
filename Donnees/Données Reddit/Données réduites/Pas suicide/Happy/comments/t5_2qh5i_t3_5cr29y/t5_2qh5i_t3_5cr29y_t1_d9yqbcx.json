I claimed animals do not experience eros, and they have sex based on pleasure and/or instinct.\n\nI used work by Plato (The Symposium) and two other philosophers to prove my point that humans have sex based on eros, and contrasted that with animals as I made my points. Also included a few studies on animal mating behaviour and monogamy within animals. \n\nThe whole thing seemed a bit overly romantic, but I guess it worked.
