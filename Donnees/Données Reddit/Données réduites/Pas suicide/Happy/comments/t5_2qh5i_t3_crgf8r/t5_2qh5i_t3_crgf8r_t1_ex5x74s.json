I just want to make sure you realize that the reason your friends and family are going to such an effort to make your day fun is because they care about you.  I always say, it\u2019s way easier to not do something than to do something, so when someone does something for you it means they wanted to take time out of their day to make you happy.  I hope your day is everything you hoped for, happy birthday bud!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/crgf8r/first_time_happy_looking_forward_to_something_in/ex5x74s/"}
