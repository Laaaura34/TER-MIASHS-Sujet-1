This woman, surely with lots of luck and some hard times, has managed to grow a baby inside of her! It's really a miracle, regardless of how much science helped up to this point. There is still a large amount of risk for her, but she will likely be fine because of doctors and science. \n\nAll of that luck and chance that has led her here, and all the uncertainty going forward - positive vibes are a real thing, and if you don't want to call it God, that's fine. But there are things we can't explain, and some people call that God. Some atheist people might just wish this pregnant woman good luck and good health. But a religious person would see God working in a positive way in this pregos life, so they want to let her know that they are sending good vibes and good luck her way.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/drs1hd/after_four_years_of_infertility_im_28_weeks/f6lgz9p/"}
