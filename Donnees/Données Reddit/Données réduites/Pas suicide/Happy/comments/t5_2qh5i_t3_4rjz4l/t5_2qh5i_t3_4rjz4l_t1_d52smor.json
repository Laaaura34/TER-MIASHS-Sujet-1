It's funny you say that, we were both abused by people as children because our parents were selfish and neglectful. I've always said that I'll never trust anybody but my brother and sister with our child. A friend said that's unrealistic to never separate from my child, but every time I imagine leaving my baby with someone else (even my own mother) i remember all the evil that took advantage of my vulnerability. I feel like the only way i can ensure my baby will never be harmed the way I was, is too always be with them. Maybe things will change when I'm actually raising the lil munchkin, but I cant shake the feeling.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/4rjz4l/just_found_out_yesterday_that_im_21f_carrying_the/d52smor/"}
