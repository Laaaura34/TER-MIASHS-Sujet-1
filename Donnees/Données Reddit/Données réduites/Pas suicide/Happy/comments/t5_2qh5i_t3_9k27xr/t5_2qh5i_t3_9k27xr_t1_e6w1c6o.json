Fake it till you make it! LOL!\n\nI conquered debilitating shyness in that manner\u2026 I would go to shiny car shows. Find some old dude who is 50 or 60 years old, and ask him, \u201cWhere did you find that gem?\u201d They\u2019ll talk for hours\u2026 all you have to do is smile, nod, and occasionally say \u201coh my gosh\u201c or \u201cthat was lucky\u201c! Hold a bottle of water. It gives your hand something to do, and also gives you something to focus on when you start to panic. Taking a drink will also help calm you, because you have to control your breathing while you\u2019re swallowing.\n\nPractice will help you master the roiling emotions inside. It\u2019s like a skill or a muscle - you\u2019ve got to strengthen it. \n\nDo it again! Soon! :-D", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9k27xr/i_did_it_i_took_a_step_outside_my_comfort_zone/e6w1c6o/"}
