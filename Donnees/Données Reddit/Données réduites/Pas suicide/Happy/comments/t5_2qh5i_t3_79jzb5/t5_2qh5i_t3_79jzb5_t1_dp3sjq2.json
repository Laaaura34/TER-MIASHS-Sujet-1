The issue is not \"why not?\" The issue is \"why cant?\" As in, why can't we, two healthy fertile young adults with no history of fertility issues in either family, conceive. There are mechanisms at work that we don't fully understand. There is literally nothing identifiable in my friend, or his wife, that says they can't conceive. He creates healthy sperm, and she has fertile eggs. But it just isn't happening. It's different for everyone, but for them, this is the last try. Kind of a three strike mentality (or third times the charm) but either way, it is incredibly expensive, and incredibly painful. (Both physically and mentally) for the parties involved.
