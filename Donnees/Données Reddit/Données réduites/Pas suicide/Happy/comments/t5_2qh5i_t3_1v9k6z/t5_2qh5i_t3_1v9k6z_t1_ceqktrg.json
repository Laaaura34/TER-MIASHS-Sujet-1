I started getting in to shape the exact way you are, just by walking.  At some point you'll start to feel like you want to run but it can be discouraging if you get winded quickly.  Also, if you're overweight (like I was) running could be painful on your knees and ankles until you shed some lbs.  When you feel ready though, you should look into a C25k program (Couch to 5k).  You do walking/running intervals until eventually you are just running.  If you get an app like RunKeeper you can create your own run (with however many intervals you want).  RunKeeper let's you listen to music while you're running and it lowers the music volume to tell you when to start running or walking.  I highly recommend that app.  Anyway, for credibility, I've lost 63 pounds in the last year and I began that journey with walking!  Good luck to you!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1v9k6z/promised_myself_i_wouldnt_do_this_until_next_week/ceqktrg/"}
