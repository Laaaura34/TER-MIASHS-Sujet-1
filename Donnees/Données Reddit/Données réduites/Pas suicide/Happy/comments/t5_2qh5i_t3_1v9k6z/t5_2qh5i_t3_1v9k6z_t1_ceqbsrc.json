Just woke up a bit ago and logged in and saw all of these replies. Thank you all so very much for your positivity. :) There are a lot of great suggestions here that I'll be looking into for help with (gradually) changing from walking to running... and that is my plan. \n\nI do intend to start tracking and such, however for now I don't want to because I'm enjoying the feeling I'm getting from the walks. Again, it's really nice and when I finally get home I'm a little worn out, but I feel soooo much better, especially when I shower. And for the record (man, this post is completely disjointed) I am also a Type 2 diabetic and want to get off my med (metformin @ 1000mg for anyone who wants to know). I do plan to start testing my blood sugar again soon, but for now I don't because I know it's just high. Blah.\n\nAgain, thank you to everyone who's responded so far and for all the positivity. This forum has been outstanding and I'm so very glad I found it. Take care!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1v9k6z/promised_myself_i_wouldnt_do_this_until_next_week/ceqbsrc/"}
