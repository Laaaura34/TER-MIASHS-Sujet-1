Accomplished very little in that time, except developing an alcohol problem. Also had some run ins with the police and courts after suicide attempts. Their main preventive measure is scaring you into never trying to commit suicide again by making life as miserable as possible. I'm still traumatised from my mental hospital stay. Apparently I'm BPD.\n\nThing is the girlfriend has similar issues, partly why we get along. But cause of how our heads work we don't help each other sometimes, we attack. And her father was an alcoholic (which isn't the worst thing about him). \n\nI'm torn by believing my life being better alone, or she's the best chance I've got in a life long partner.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/a0dqmb/yesterday_i_sat_next_to_my_so_and_told_him_i_had/eahnwpg/"}
