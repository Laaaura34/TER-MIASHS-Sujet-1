Star sapphires are cut in the cabochon shape to properly display the asterism property when interacting with light. I'm not seeing the star showing in this image, so it can just as well be a sapphire cabochon. Prices vary based on several variables including size/weight, natural vs synthetic, treatments (such as heat), and source location. Still it's cool to see people venturing from the diamond path towards some of the other interesting options!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/a0dqmb/yesterday_i_sat_next_to_my_so_and_told_him_i_had/eaisqcn/"}
