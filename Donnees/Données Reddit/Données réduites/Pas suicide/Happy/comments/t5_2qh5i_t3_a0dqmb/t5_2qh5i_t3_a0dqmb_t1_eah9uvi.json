This is a sub to celebrate in others' happiness. By coming in and pointing out that endings are sad, you're actively putting a damper on that happiness, which tends to make people upset. \n\nLife ends in death 100% of the time, but if we all dwelt on that none of us would ever do anything. If you feel that major happy life events are miserable I'd suggest you see a doctor, because that's not how life is. We have ups and downs, happy bits and miserable bits, but the idea is to enjoy the good bits and work through the bad. \n\nMarriage is a celebration of two people who love each other and want to share that with the world. That's pretty high up there on the good bits list. People generally feel that the risk of divorce or the anguish of death is worth the good bits, or marriage wouldn't exist!\n\nI wish you all the best.
