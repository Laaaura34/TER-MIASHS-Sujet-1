Reading the title I thought this was going to be some kind of joke or something because I honestly can't imagine having such a perfect life. It almost seems fake and it makes me sad because I know there are people out there that truly have been blessed by the universe. Not like me lol, I have no family, my mother and my sister used to abuse me when I was a child, my father is absent, I grew up in poverty with no stability which later made me develop depression and BPD and now I'm struggling to stay in college because I have absolutely no one and my health is rapidly declining. I have a boyfriend and he is all I have in the world but thinking about how we will never have a proper wedding because we have no family or friends is depressing. Such a fun, happy life :D", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/a0dqmb/yesterday_i_sat_next_to_my_so_and_told_him_i_had/eahhvkd/"}
