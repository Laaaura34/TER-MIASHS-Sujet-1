It's just a little village business and a little village job. Those two are happy cos they found their little place in life and they're happy enough with it. Had it been someone else maybe they would've wanted to move to a big city grow the business big get a big league job get into modeling acting etc find a better partner etc etc.\n\nI actually know a couple like them but more so. The girl I knew from her highschool days and she could've probably gone on to be a supermodel if she'd wanted to, she really has stunning perfect ten looks, everybody told her so early on, tall and thin and absolutely gorgeous. But she loves her family, both old and young, helped her older sister raise her children and dotes over her neice, seems to be best friends with her mom and dad and often seen out with them helping them with errands or shopping or having coffee with them, she has a very ordinary low level retail job the sort everyone here complains about but she seems content with it, has a boyfriend she'd been with for years now and he's ordinary looking shorter than her but a wholesome decent guy who treats everyone with respect and she seems to love him a lot, he too has an very ordinary retail job, but they're both happy with each other and everyone likes and admires them. \n\nThis isn't uncommon if you drive through rural areas whether in Europe or America you'll often see someone you'd think she'd probably be big in London or Paris or New York but instead she's just working in a little village tea shop serving the same few elderly folks day after day after day.
