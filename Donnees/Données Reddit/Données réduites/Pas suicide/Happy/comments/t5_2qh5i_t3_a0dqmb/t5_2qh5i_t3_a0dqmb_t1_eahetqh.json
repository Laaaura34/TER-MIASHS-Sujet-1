I'm happy for these folks and right now I feel pretty good myself but this was a shock to me as my life is the exact opposite. \n\nI am single, on unemployment insurance, my teeth are crooked and one of the front ones is broken in half, my parents are dead, I live in a dead end town, and I have been fairly depressed this year. \n\nIt's alright though, we all have our own paths with our own circumstances. I'm able to live my life pretty comfortably despite everything being wrong so I feel pretty good for now. \n\n\nAnyways, Congrats to OP and this wonderful life :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/a0dqmb/yesterday_i_sat_next_to_my_so_and_told_him_i_had/eahetqh/"}
