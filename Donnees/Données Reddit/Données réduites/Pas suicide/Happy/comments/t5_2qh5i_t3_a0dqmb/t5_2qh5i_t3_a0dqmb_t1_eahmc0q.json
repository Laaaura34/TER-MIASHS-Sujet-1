Why shit on someone to make them miserable just because you're in pain right now? We come here to be HAPPY for other people, that's the point. \n\nYou have NO clue what other people have gone through or suffered. Everyone has experienced loss, heartbreak, pain, etc. \n\nI wish you happiness OP! Everyone deserves love and is worthy of all this happiness you worked for. \n\nBecause that's just it, happiness takes work. For some of us -most of us- it takes a shit ton of work.
