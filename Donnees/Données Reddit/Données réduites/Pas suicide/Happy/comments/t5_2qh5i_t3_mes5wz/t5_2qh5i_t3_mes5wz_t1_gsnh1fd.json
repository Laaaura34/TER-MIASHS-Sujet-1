I can't imagine your heartbreak, but thank God your daughter has you and you have her. You are so very brave to keep walking forward and making strides like this after such a loss. It takes my breath away even to think about how much you're hurting, but I SO appreciate you sharing your healing journey. We will all have to go through this kind of loss at some point and we never want to think about it before it happens, but getting to read how you're handling it helps me wrap my brain around the notion that life really does go on, and we are far more resilient creatures than it sometimes seems. You and your baby girl are so lovely and brave. I'm sending you lots of love and thoughts/prayers of support. Your wife is shining all kinds of light on you two right now.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/mes5wz/we_moved_today_and_im_just_glad_my_daughter_likes/gsnh1fd/"}
