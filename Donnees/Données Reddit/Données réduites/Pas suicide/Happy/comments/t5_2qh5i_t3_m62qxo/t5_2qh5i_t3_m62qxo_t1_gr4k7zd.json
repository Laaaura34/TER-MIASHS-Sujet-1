And I'm truly happy for you and your daughter that you're saying this again! But I would be careful in specifying *what* is ok. \n\nMy parents would always say things like \"it'll be ok, you'll be fine, you're tough\" Now as an adult I can hear their love, but as a child I took it more as \"it'll be fine so there's no need to talk about it. You're tough, I trust you to get through it on your own\" \n\nTry just \"ok\" \"it's ok\" \"get it out\" \"*I hear you*\" just validate their feelings in the moment, knowing that they are raw. I've found that the relationships where I'm allowed to show when I truly feel horrible are also the ones that I tell the most truth in.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/m62qxo/my_daughter_said_i_love_you_too_to_me_for_the/gr4k7zd/"}
