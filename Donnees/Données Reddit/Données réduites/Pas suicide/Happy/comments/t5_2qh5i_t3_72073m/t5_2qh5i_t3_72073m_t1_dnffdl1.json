You look amazing. I\u2019m so happy to see you\u2019ve gained the confidence and self respect to fully understand how naturally beautiful you are. I can tell it\u2019s been a hard journey just because of my family\u2019s experience as a nutritionist and all the stories my cousin would tell me about the disorder. She\u2019s a licensed nutritionist with a MS. I respect your transformation and wish you well. You can now appreciate lots of love and positive energy that you\u2019ve been deserving all along. All the best :)\n\n-Chris", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/72073m/fighting_my_battle_against_anorexia_nervosa_hasnt/dnffdl1/"}
