Not either but both.  \nLike you still have some tears to cry but they are mixed sadness, regret and a little worry but also confidence and peace.  \n  \nThe heart takes time to heal. Don't rush it. If you ever need to just shout at something I can recommend /r/totallynotrobots. All caps is a wonderful catharsis.  \n  \nOr start a chat in here. We can be a bit of a bunch of twats some times but we mean well and we do \"listen\", as it were.  \n  \nHappy days ahead so don't worry. Let yourself heal and keep smiling.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8ygqd4/down_90_lbs_almost_done_with_my_nursing_degree_on/e2bb3ou/"}
