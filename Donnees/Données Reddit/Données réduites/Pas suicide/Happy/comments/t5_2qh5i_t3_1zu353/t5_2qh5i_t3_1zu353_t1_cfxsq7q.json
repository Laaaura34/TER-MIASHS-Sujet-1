I'm allowed to bring food in so I'm going to make him a nice quiche for tomorrow. The stuff they gave him today looked like cat food. Eating solid food again after over a month is tough enough without the food being absolutely disgusting. When he's home I want to take him to his favorite restaurants. Hopefully I'll have money. I don't actually live in this country and arranging to stay and the exchange rate has really depleted my bank account. \n\nI imagine his family will be all over him, but it will be great for you to see him again!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1zu353/my_partner_is_finally_out_of_the_icu/cfxsq7q/"}
