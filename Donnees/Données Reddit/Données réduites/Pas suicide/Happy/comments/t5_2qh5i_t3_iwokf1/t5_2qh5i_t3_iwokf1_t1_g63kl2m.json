Looking awesome so far!!\n\nOne thing that might help is to print out some of the writing line guides that little kids use when learning to write letters and later learn cursive...the ones with the two solid lines and the dotted line in the middle? You can tape it to your table, then tape a piece of plastic Saran Wrap or wax paper over it. \n\nIf you search amazon for \u201ccake decorating practice board\u201d lots of stuff shows up :) we used things like that in pastry school to practice writing.\n\nBest of luck in your new job!!!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/iwokf1/happy_that_i_have_a_job_where_i_get_to_spend_time/g63kl2m/"}
