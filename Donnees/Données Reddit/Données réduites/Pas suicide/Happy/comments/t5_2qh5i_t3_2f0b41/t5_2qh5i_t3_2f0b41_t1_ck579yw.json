Cisgendered: gender identity matches the genetalia you were born with. So I was born male, and I identify as male: I am thus cis male.\n\n Most terms I know I've picked up through context, and some experience within the lgbt community,  some I've looked up on the web after having seen the usage in various lgbt literature and subreddits. \n\n/r/lgbt can be a fairly decent place to gain some insight,  and I recommend exploring their sidebar and faq. If you are specifically looking for advice or guidance in learning your own sexuality you may be interested in /r/questioning. Alternatively you can look up a gender and/or sexuality glossary on the web. \n\nI've been actively exploring my own identity through regular introspection, experimentation, and discussion over the last ten years.
