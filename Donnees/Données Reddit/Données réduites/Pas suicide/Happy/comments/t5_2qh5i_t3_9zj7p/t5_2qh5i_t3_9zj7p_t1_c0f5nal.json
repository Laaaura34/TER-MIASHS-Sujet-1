Take it easy, man, and just enjoy it for what it is: one-on-one time to spend with a girl you're attracted to. There are many, many other girls you could be (and eventually *will* be) having an amazing conversation with.\n\nYour self-confidence is brutalized because of your university, job and family issues, but give yourself a chance here by not making this date the answer to everything -- don't *try* to get laid; don't *try* to impress her so much she wants to get married; don't be something you're not. But don't be blas\u00e9, either. Just relax, listen, smile, nod, reply, converse and enjoy every minute. It takes a *lot* of practice, and keep in mind you're on your first date ever. If you click and the opportunity comes up to do something amazing and memorable -- to sneak into a neighbor's hot tub or drive to the mountains for a playful snowball fight -- by all means, do it. And if you fail and the date is awkward, the conversation is stilted, you just don't seem to like each other that much, then don't freak out about it. Just think about the next girl and the next date, and know that you'll be one date better and more experienced.\n", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9zj7p/today_i_asked_out_a_girl_for_the_first_time_ever/c0f5nal/"}
