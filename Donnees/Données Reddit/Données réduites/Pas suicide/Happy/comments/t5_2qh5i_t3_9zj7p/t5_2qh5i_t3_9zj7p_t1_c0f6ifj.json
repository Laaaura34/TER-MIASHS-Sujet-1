Earlier this week, I tried asking out a girl, who's number I got over the weekend, over the phone but I only got her voice-mail. I left her a voice-mail asking her if to go out sometime for a couple drinks this week. This is the first time I've ever asked a girl out over the phone, or even left a voice-mail. I have yet to hear from her. Yeah I was bummed, but I got over it like my first girlfriend.\n\nAnways, yesterday I met a cute girl who's even an atheist like myself who seemed kinda eager to meet me. It turned out that I had impressed her a few weeks ago because I gave a presentation and talked about Theodor Adorno.
