And difficult to follow.  But in all things, not just in dating:  You are your own source of happiness, you are your own source of sorrow.  All others are aids and accomplices, to be sure... but they'll follow your lead.\n\nI spent 12-18 in such deep depression that I slept every hour I wasn't working out or going to school.  I'm the only male anorexic I've ever met, going from 220lbs to 130lbs in six months.  And it wasn't until I'd resolved to live my life for *me* (well, and honestly, got away from all the bullshit that was making me depressed) that I really started enjoying life.\n\nYou're making great steps.  Just remember: this is a *first* step, not an *only* step, and the more you step, the easier the dance becomes.\n\nYou've much to be happy about.  Hold that happy to you and nurture it - it shall only grow.  As it grows, you will find yourself with a surplus - never be afraid to share.\n\nGood luck.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9zj7p/today_i_asked_out_a_girl_for_the_first_time_ever/c0f5lw3/"}
