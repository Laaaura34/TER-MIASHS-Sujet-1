I asked out a girl I really liked and went on my first date ever. I'm 17. We went out on another date last Friday and we were going to hang out yesterday, but she broke up with me on Tuesday.\n\nAnyway, I learned three things from this. 1) Enjoy the moment and do not overthink things. Chill out and relax. 2) Don't get you hopes up too much. Seriously. 3) Don't spend a lot of money on her. Trust me on this one. I spent way too much on only two dates.\n\nOther than that, enjoy yourself and have a great first date.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9zj7p/today_i_asked_out_a_girl_for_the_first_time_ever/c0f6d1a/"}
