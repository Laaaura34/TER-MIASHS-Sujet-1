You are a *source* of happiness, not a receiver of happiness.  Give off that happiness like a candle gives off light and heat.  She shall be drawn to it like a moth to a flame.\n\nWhatever you do, do not indicate to her that you \"wouldn't be happy without her.\"  Or she'll put you to the test.  Ain't her fault; people like being with people that make them feel good.\n\nShare, don't take, and this shall be a long and happy road.  Congratulations and good luck.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9zj7p/today_i_asked_out_a_girl_for_the_first_time_ever/c0f5jgt/"}
