This made up for the years lost at high school where i was called \"fool\" and \"you will never get anywhere\". I have an especially difficult time in any study as I am dyslexic.\n\n* I feel I can walk taller as I said because I conquered my 'demons'.\n* I was left with a far greater sense of self confidence than ever before.\n\nAs Winston Churchill said; \"*When you are going through hell, keep going.\"*\n\nMy very best wishes to you.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ji26pl/can_you_guys_describe_to_me_what/ga4yklr/"}
