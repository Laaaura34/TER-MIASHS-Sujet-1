I didn't want to live.  Then my brother in-law got deployed during my sister's pregnancy and so she stayed with us.  When my nephew was born I knew I needed to see the person that little dude would become and nearly 10 years later I am so so SO glad I did.  He is such an amazing little man and an awesome big brother too his little sister.  The two of them fill my heart with so much love and joy.  Also since he was born my life has changed so much and even though I thought I'd never find someone and be happy I have .... It's all just amazing to me.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/g0cw4f/my_daughter_saved_my_life_she_was_a_joyful/fna1qr9/"}
