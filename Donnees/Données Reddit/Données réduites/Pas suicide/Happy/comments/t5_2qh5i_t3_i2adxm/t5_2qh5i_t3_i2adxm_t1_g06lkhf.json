The pan is hot enough when you add your batter, and it pretty much starts cooking immediately.\n\nThe other thing is to make sure you're oiling right. I normally take my block of butter, and *very* quickly run it all over the inside of the pan (make sure to cover the middle!) - no more than, like, 3 seconds of running. My friend used to swear by doing that, then running a piece of kitchen paper all around the pan, because even the scant amount you get off the block is still too much.\n\nSo, if you use more heat and less fat, the pancake shouldn't stick as much.\n\nHope this helps, OP :) Glad to see someone struggling with the same kitchen stuff I do overcoming it :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/i2adxm/i_am_starting_to_trust_myself_again_in_the/g06lkhf/"}
