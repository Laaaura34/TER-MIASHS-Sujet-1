Making my bed every day also makes me more aware of how long my sheets have been on there, and when I need to change them. I used to be gross bachelorette frog and not change sheets for months on end; now I can't stand to go more than two weeks, even in the depths of depression. Even if I end up rage-laundering, they get changed. Sometimes that's the chore that begins the process of dragging myself back to the surface. I generally bob at just-barely-not-drowning, so the serenity and calm of slipping under a ways is actually really attractive and hard to fight.\n\nAnd I'm rambling again.
