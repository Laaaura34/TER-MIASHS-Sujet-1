I'd recommend any physical activity that (a) you enjoy and (b) requires intelligence. I used to climb a lot and loved the process of figuring out new routes (regardless of level, if you push your limits you have to plan where your body will be). Rings are a lot like this too, you have to control/use your mind to be better at the physical sport. I could never get excited about weight lifting or other routine based stuff, Explore and find the activity that excites you... don't give a fuck about what people think in the process ;)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/61bc27/anxious_and_depressed_i_stumbled_into_aerial/dfde3pl/"}
