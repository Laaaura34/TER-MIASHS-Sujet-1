So I have three option to choose from :) I can also be a special ed teacher in high school, college or university, but I want to work with kids. But it's great to have more options. We don't teach one grade or subject, unless you want to teach in high school. \n\nI still have 4 years to go, I first studied to be a kindergarten teacher but that wasn't for me.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cp6nlv/a_year_ago_i_was_told_by_this_math_teacher_to_not/ewp17c7/"}
