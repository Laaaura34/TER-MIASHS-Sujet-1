I wanted to work for the space program but I didn't share that with anyone. But I knew I would need math classes. \n\nI was having a bit of trouble but I felt like I just needed a little help from the teacher. It was like the answer was just beyond by fingertips and I just needed a little help. I went to my teacher and before I could ask for help she told me she felt the class was too difficult for me and I should transfer out. I was heartbroken but who was I to argue with a teacher. This was in the 80s and the STEM program was nowhere in sight. It was accepted that girls didn't understand math as well as boys. So I transferred out but I remember there was a boy in the class who she favored. I saw him a few years ago and he's a pharmacist! \n\nI can't help wonder what I could have been if she would have helped me. I'm not blaming her but if I could do it over again I would stand up for myself. \n\nI applaud your friend and I can't wait to see the students she helps and the great things they will do!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cp6nlv/a_year_ago_i_was_told_by_this_math_teacher_to_not/ewosju1/"}
