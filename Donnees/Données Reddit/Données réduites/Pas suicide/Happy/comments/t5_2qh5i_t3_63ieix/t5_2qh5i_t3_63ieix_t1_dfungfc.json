Degenerative is kind of an off term to use for it, but basically I have fluid filled cysts within my spinal cord and up near my brain stem that cause a bunch of nerve problems/weakness/dizziness/numbness, and it's slowly getting a bit worse as they grow a little/my spine moves (I'm losing weight, which we're not sure if it's helpful or harmful but either way I need to lose more weight.) Luckily mine isn't too bad! I can still walk and move fine most days, but as I get older I could get really weak and have problems with limbs. I shouldn't need a wheelchair probably ever, but things get tricky. I need MRIs at least twice a year, I have all kinds of maintenance pain management things. I'm just lucky it's not too bad and is manageable! ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/63ieix/im_not_going_to_lose_my_insurance_i_can_stay_on/dfungfc/"}
