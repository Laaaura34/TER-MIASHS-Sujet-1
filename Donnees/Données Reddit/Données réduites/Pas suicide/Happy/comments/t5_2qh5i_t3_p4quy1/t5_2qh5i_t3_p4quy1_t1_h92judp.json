That's what it's all about.  You have someone who should be there NO MATTER WHAT.  Maybe someday you have to sell the ring to get through a tough time.  Remember it is a symbol of love, and that nobody else's opinion of it is really important if you and he are happy.    \n\n\nAlso you won't be happy all of the time, and he'll have more power to make you unhappy than parents and teachers ever had.  Make sure you're both ready for good times AND bad.  This isn't just a period of being congratulated.  It's also a trial period so you both make sure of this.  It's so much harder to split up when you have assets and children.    \n\n\nStart saving money for the proverbial rainy day and retirement.  I always have my doubts about big rings, dresses, weddings and honeymoon followed by debt.  This is not the way to start off in life.  Debt kills love.  Money trouble creates bitter argument.  Interest robs a young family of so many opportunities to do fun things with the same money.  Bank America can get by without that money.  Do all you can to avoid paying it.  Instead go for experiences!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/p4quy1/im_engaged_and_had_no_one_to_share_it_with_so_im/h92judp/"}
