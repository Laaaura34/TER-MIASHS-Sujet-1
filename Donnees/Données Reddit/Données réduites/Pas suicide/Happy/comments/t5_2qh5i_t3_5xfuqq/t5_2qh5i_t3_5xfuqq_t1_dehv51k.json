I'm actually on my way too, I just quit my job and moving back to live with her and work with her (she's a sucessful retail entrepreneur) and I've never been more excited. Most of the reason I worked a job I hated and lived away from home was cause thats the image I thought I had to live, the blue print. But then I realized, it's just a image, and I've always wanted to work with my mom, and thought\"the hell am I doing?!\"  and im on my way home too.  \n\nso thank you for sharing this. and much love to you and your mom as well!
