Heat it in the oven at 300 for about 15 minutes. It makes a huge difference. Doesn't get chewy or weird.\n\nETA: Except cannoli. Those can stay in the crisper drawer of the fridge for about 2 days before the shells start getting soggy.\n\nAdditional edit/LPT: Also for cannoli, if they're made in-house, you can ask if they can send the shell and filling separate. Shell stays nice for about 5 days that way if it's fresh made.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/568ig2/an_anecdote_about_why_being_a_goodtipping_regular/d8hu4qj/"}
