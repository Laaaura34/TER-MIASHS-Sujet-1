It's your money to do with as you please but to claim that you're being \"hooked up\"  or getting something for free is just fallacious. Your order can be as \"ridiculous\" as you want because you're paying for it, they're not doing anything special for you. There's no extra \"care and appreciation\"  that goes into it, it's just a fucking item on the fucking menu. If your barista can't manage to make the item you're paying a premium for then that would be noteworthy.
