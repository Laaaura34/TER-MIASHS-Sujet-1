I work in a restaurant, hosting and serving. I can honestly say that 90% of the time, I'm trying to deliver a great guest experience. It's fulfilling to me to know that you are happy and having a good time. I try and get to know regulars and I try to learn about them and their lives.

Serving and hosting at a chain restaurant can be pretty grueling and spirit-crushing, but it can also be fun and heartwarming. \n\nWhen Sylvia comes in on Wednesdays and tells me about her kids and her grandkids and I get to have a real human conversation with someone so pure, that is what makes my Wednesday great.
