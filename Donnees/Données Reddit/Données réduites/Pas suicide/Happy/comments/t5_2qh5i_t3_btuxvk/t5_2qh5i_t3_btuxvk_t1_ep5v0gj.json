I recently accepted my body but then I went to the doctors and weighed the heaviest I\u2019ve ever weighed in my life. I workout almost everyday and eat a clean diet but I also allow myself to have treats on the weekends. This is the happiest I\u2019ve been and felt in my whole life and stopped yo yo dieting. Not going to lie, that number on the scale messed with my head for months. I come to realize I need to listen to my body and not the scale. I\u2019m more than my weight on the scale. Yes I\u2019ve increased a pants size but it\u2019s because of booty and quad gains. My abs are finally getting definition. My biceps are coming in. And most importantly my mental health around food has changed entirely. I still would like to cut but I\u2019m being patient with my body and treating it kindly.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/btuxvk/first_time_i_was_able_to_wear_a_bathing_suit_to/ep5v0gj/"}
