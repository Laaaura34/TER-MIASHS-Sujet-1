I could have continued to live without the earbuds. But I didn\u2019t have a cell phone for five years (2013. 2018) because they are too expensive. He got me a cell phone in 2018 because he said he was tired of me stealing his to play angry birds. I think it\u2019s was because I\u2019m disabled and he wants me entertained. \n\nI felt like he gave me a house with the upgrade to my lifestyle. I just wanted to show him I was really appreciative with the earbuds.  The sound quality is not so good.  I also gave up having a tv when I needed medication so they are a big gift to myself. I\u2019m I know I am weird and he accepts me. :). \n\nThank you for your lovely comment. :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/lovb63/my_husband_proved_to_me_today_that_its_the_small/go7z5ph/"}
