I have it up for $350 CAD cause I bought it brand new right when they first sold out everywhere for $200 and then tracked a dude down and travelled to him to get it modded for $75 ... and it's been used maybe 4 times for 20-30 mins a time ... so I've got it listed pretty high because of what I paid and how much time and effort I put into making it awesome etc. But if you're interested, feel free to PM me.
