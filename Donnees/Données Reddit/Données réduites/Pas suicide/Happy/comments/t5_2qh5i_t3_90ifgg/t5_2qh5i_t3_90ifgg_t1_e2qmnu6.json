He purred the whole way home. Now he gets frequent walks outside, play time with both his dads, road trips to play with my parent's dogs (and parents too). He gets to travel everywhere with us. He even helped us with set building in a theater. \n\nWorm, pictured above is one of two identical toy worms he has. He carries a Worm everywhere with him. Particularly he likes taking Work into bed with him for sleep time.  \n\nMilo will be 4 months old at the end of July. <3", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/90ifgg/milo_travelled_halfway_across_the_country_in/e2qmnu6/"}
