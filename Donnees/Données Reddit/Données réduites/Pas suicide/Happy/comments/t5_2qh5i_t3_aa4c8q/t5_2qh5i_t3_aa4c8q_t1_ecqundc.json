Her skin and hair are beautiful. She takes good care of both. She was a dance instructor her whole life so I\u2019m sure that\u2019s kept her moving and active much more than normal. There\u2019s no special diet but they do eat really well (very few processed foods, lots of fruit and vegetables, good quality meat and fish, very little alcohol...maybe a glass of wine per day, no over eating). They both like to cook a lot, it\u2019s something they enjoy doing together and for each other which is really nice. But I think the thing that keeps her looking so young is her amazing attitude - she finds so much joy in even the smallest things. She chooses to be happy and positive because her life is so precious to her and she wants to now enjoy every minute. She laughs easily, smiles often and her eyes absolutely sparkle.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/aa4c8q/for_christmas_this_year_my_89_year_old_dad_gave/ecqundc/"}
