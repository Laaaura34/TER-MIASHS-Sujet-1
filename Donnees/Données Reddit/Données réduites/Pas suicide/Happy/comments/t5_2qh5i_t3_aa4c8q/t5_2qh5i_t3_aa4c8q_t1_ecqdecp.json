Losing my grandfather some 15 years ago my soon to be 90 year old grandmother had a pretty solitary life, being with her daughter and son (my father) and our families most of the time. Not sad, but a tad alone at times, I guess.\n\nCome spring about 2 years ago. An old acquittance to both my grandparents happened to pass by her home town. He thought \"I wonder how Skioldmans grandmother and grandfather are these days?\" so he looked up their address and knocked on the door.\n\nAt the same time my grandmother had complained to her landlord about a draft from the windows. That was about one week ago so when she heard someone was at the door, she opened the door and at the same time exclaimed: \"you sure took your sweet time!\". \u201cWell hello, yes about 42 years I guess!\" he replied.\n\nAfter that they started chatting on the phone daily since he lived about 300 miles apart. \n\nIn the last year she lives with him and I guess both are so very happy that their lives and a bit of chance brought them (back) together.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/aa4c8q/for_christmas_this_year_my_89_year_old_dad_gave/ecqdecp/"}
