I'm still slightly nervous around larger swarms because I've never been stung by one and don't know if I'm allergic, but for the most part I've realized they're a fairly chill lil thing. You really have to piss them off to merit getting stung.\n\nOn a slightly befuddling note, bees in my city seem to have a thing for taking a dive into my drinks. My tea, my juice, whatever drink I'm having, if it has the slightlest hint of sugar in it they'll make a beeline (ba dum psh) for it... and only mine, to that. Everyone else at the table may be drinking the same as me but they'll go for a swim in mine every single time. This year I've rescued four bees out of my beverages already. :|", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cu0wv3/well_hello_there_my_little_honeybee_friend_at_one/exrut00/"}
