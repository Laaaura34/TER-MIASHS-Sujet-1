Yes women on average earn somewhere between 75-80 cents to a man's dollar. That's just comparing the average male salary vs the average female salary. There have been several studies (will have to provide those later, am on mobile and searching for academic articles is not something easily done on mobile ;) ) that shows that once you moderate for things like education, experience, years worked etc, the difference is less then 1%, which is non-significant. \n\nPaying women employed more is simply not the solution. We should rather be focusing on women choosing for careers more often than families, and man doing it the other way around. This is arguably the biggest reason for the gap between average salaries.\n\nAnother interesting study (will also link later) found that lesbians actually earn a lot more than the average women and men do. Pretty much shows how it's not women earning less because they are women, but because of their choices (again, which we should stimulate to change). \n\nSalesforce, Tesla and other companies announcing they are going to pay women more is pretty much just for publicity, or also caused by misinformation. I do think we need to work on getting more women in managerial positions, as this diversity has shown to have a great positive influence, but achieving that requires women to make different career&family choices.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/48b6mc/wife_received_an_exceptional_review_75_raise_and/d0jnbgs/"}
