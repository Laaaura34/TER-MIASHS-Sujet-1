I got married to wonderful boy who makes me super, super happy, and we (my sister and my new little brother-in-law, who is nine, and I) made a gingerbread house that, as a first in my history of gingerbread house construction, actually stayed up.\n\nAlso, I have just convinced most members of my family to train for a half-marathon with me, so I am super-excited about that too.  Oh, and I just came back from an Old Year's Party hosted by the family my cousin's about to marry into, and they and their friends were super-nice, and I had a great time, and I'm so pleased for my cousin that she seems to have chosen a great guy with a great family.\n\n:D :D :D!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/es3bt/i_had_one_of_my_best_christmases_this_year/c1axxqw/"}
