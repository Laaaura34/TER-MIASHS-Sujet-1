My kids are 5, 3, and 4 months. I have such bad wanderlust tho so I end up dragging them all over the place anyway. All the parks. All the playgrounds. All the stuff. I\u2019m in love with it tho. It\u2019s stressful, but it makes life wonderful. All I want is for them to remember childhood with smiles on their faces \u263a\ufe0f. Thank you for the encouragement!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/qge131/spent_all_day_with_my_daughter_and_that_makes_me/hi8i00q/"}
