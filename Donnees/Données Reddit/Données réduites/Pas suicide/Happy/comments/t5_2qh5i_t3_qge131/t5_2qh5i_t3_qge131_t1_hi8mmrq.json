I have two daughters and a son, but when I first found I was gonna be a girl dad I kinda freaked out lol. I didn\u2019t grow up with sisters or many girl cousins and so ended up turning towards books for help. I read sooo many different things about the \u201cdaddy/daughter\u201d relationship and how meaningful it actually is from the girls perspective.\nOne quote that\u2019ll hold with me forever is this: \u201cdaughters see time spent with their fathers as a dance recital\u2026with dad, she learns all the steps, she learns where to place her arms, she learns how to move navigate the dance floor with grace. After the recital, she steps onto the dance floor by herself.\u201d\nWhen I think about it like that, I\u2019m pretty much responsible for what she\u2019ll look for in a relationship. And really, I just want them to learn the moves. I want them to own the dance floor. I want them to know exactly how they want to be loved by another. \nThank you for your encouragement!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/qge131/spent_all_day_with_my_daughter_and_that_makes_me/hi8mmrq/"}
