Which is the first red flag. Why would you not want to tell the father of your child that they have a child? Then the CPS allegations from her neighbors started flooding in from her neighbors about abuse and neglect. The courts held out because \"she'll get better with the CPS services\" but it never got better and eventually my daughter had to be removed because her mother was escalated to a category 1 for abuse and neglect. That was finally enough for the court to award me full legal and physical custody after 3 years of trying.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9qe11h/1_on_sept_26th_i_finally_got_full_custody_of_my/e8aiqa7/"}
