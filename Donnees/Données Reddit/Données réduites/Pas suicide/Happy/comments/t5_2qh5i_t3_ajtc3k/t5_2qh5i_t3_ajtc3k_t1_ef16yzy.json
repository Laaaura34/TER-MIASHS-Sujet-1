I developed it in my teens and it advanced exponentially in my mid 20's to the point that my large intestine was literally falling apart in the surgeons hand when they removed it. The severity had not showed up fully on the scans so we weren't sure if we should do surgery, but I decided not to wait and once they went in there what they found was basically a ticking timebomb. I am very lucky to be alive. Not so lucky to have crohns, but lucky to be alive. My rectum and anus were removed at a later surgery because it was at high risk of developing colorectal cancer among other issues, and I now have what many patients affectionately refer to as a 'barbie butt\" for it's similar appearance. Basically just a butt without a butthole. Took me some time to wrap my head around the concept, but now its my new normal.
