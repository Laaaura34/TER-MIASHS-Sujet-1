It's awesome. \n\nI re-did all the floors in my last house with that shit and loved it. Looks nice, feels nice, and is easily cleaned (learn to love the Swiffer).\n\nThe only caveat is furniture. Chairs, tables, and couches can scratch up the pergo. Luckily it's easily fixed by area rugs, and pergo is cheap / easy to replace anyway.\n\nSweet pad, congrats!\n\n", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/aq2neu/a_place_to_call_my_own_first_place_i_ever_rented/egf54eh/"}
