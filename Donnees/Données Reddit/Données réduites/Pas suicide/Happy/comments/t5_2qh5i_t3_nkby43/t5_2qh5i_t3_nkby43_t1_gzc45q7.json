That's just how I was raised and how my dad treated me and my siblings. Not abusive or anything like that, just having expectations of who he wanted us to be and running a tight ship around the house. That was my greatest mistake of all, especially given her situation. I didn't have that healthy balance of both toughness AND tenderness like I should have. \n\nBut, I do now. What really sparked my change was when I had to leave her with other family for a week while I was out of town for work. She went to sleep crying the night before I left because of an argument we had and it broke me, knowing how much I fucked up. But, I wouldn't let it get to me. So I wrote her a letter for her to find apologizing for everything and even cried myself a little while I was on the road. But thankfully, she forgave me when I got back and our relationship has blossomed since. \n\nI can honestly say I'm a new person now. Or at least trying to be. I'm trying my best to maintain that healthy balance of gentleness and firmness like I guess any dad would try to be. Though, not to sound hypocritical, I've been leaning on the gentle and loving side a lot more recently for her. I really can't describe how much love I have for her. Like I can't even put it to words. I've never loved anyone as much as I do her. Truly. \n\nShe's the best thing to ever happen to me.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/nkby43/on_this_day_a_year_ago_i_officially_became_a_dad/gzc45q7/"}
