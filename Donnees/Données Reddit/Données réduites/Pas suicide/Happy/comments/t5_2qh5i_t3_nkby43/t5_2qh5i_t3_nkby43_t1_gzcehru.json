It is also one of the most difficult jobs on the planet. If you are there for your kid, and they know that you have their back through anything. That is everything for a kid. Life sucks. Losing both of your biological parents is extremely difficult, and going to live with someone else. it adds a sense of extreme fear for that child. I see this photo with both of you smiling. That is proof that both of you are strong and amazing. Never let those smiles go away. Every child needs that. \n\nThere is a song where an Artist talks about something similar about what you are going through. It is called 4 Your Eyez only by J Cole. I added a link to the song. I do hope you listen to it, it is an amazing song where the artist talks to a friend's daughter, and how her father loved her, and how even in his death. He saw the only thing that mattered, his daughter. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g\\_W9af\\_CQDs&ab\\_channel=ConnectConnect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_W9af_CQDs&ab_channel=ConnectConnect)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish you both the best. Congrats on being a father. You both deserve to be happy.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/nkby43/on_this_day_a_year_ago_i_officially_became_a_dad/gzcehru/"}
