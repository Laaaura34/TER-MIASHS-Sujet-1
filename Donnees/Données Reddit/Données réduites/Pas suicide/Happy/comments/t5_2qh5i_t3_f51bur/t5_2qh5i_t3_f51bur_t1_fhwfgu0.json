I'm a middle-aged man and my blood pressure is really high, like comedically, \"this must be wrong\" high.\n\nBut I've had a really good life, and if I go tomorrow I guess it was totally worth it, but I would certainly regret not taking better care of myself. Plus like this girl I was lucky enough to be born in an awesome place and time and live comfortably. Even though I have had that kind of existential ennui a lot of people get when their lives are pretty easy, I've still enjoyed myself most of the time. Never been to prison, never been in a work camp or anything like that, never gone to war, never even been close to a war, never starved, no really crazy diseases like those worm parasites that eat their way into your eyeball, practically never so much as lived without air conditioning when I wasn't doing it on purpose. Never been raped or stabbed. Plus I'm a white guy so a lot of things are even easier than they might have been.\n\nSo on the whole, not too bad, really, even if it may be over soon.\n\nHow are you? Who are you?", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/f51bur/just_wanted_to_say_im_happy_to_still_be_alive_and/fhwfgu0/"}
