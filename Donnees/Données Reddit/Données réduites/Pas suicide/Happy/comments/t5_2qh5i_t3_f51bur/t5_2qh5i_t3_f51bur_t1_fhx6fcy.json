Do not stop behaving in this way. You're a good person.\n\nThe reason I know all of this is because I have a doctor and I'm very happy with what he's done for me. Like, I'm happy to know all of this stuff and it's resulted in some pretty significant life changes that are really positive.\n\nI'm pretty much the opposite of suicidal: I desperately want to stay alive. That's the most disappointing thing about the whole mortality deal. I became an uncle a few years ago and I'm super happy about that, for example; I really want to see where that goes and what these kids turn into. Plus I moved 10 years ago and lost a hobby (I moved away from the ocean) and I'm literally in the process of moving back to somewhere on the coast so I can do it again, and it brought me a lot of joy.\n\nSo thank you, but no. Very very decent of you to be like this though.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/f51bur/just_wanted_to_say_im_happy_to_still_be_alive_and/fhx6fcy/"}
