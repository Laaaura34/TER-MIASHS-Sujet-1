Life throws alot at everyone in lots of ways. I really hope your health improves and am very glad you are able to see a doctor!(saw your reply to someone else). Life is odd, the luckiest of us can feel sad and the poorest can feel happy, and vice versa. I'm glad you are grateful for your life as is. I feel much the same way.  I have had an easier time than most through life too and am grateful for it. I like my work and love my family, lucky for me! \n\nHope the best for you and more happiness as time goes on, longer rather than shorter. May your days be more than meh, may they be that way for us all! I know well wishes dont change realities directly, but I always feel like well wishes make for better outlooks. \n\nCheers!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/f51bur/just_wanted_to_say_im_happy_to_still_be_alive_and/fhzjdhg/"}
