It was almost 40 degrees celcius that day & the material of my dress made me sweat. I also suffer from chronic pain that I'm not treating during my pregnancy, lupus, chronic fatigue, morning sickness that I've been dealing with since the beginning and I had just traveled almost 6 hours to get to my destination for my shower.
