I was filming with my other hand using his camera.  The backstory here is that my brother is differently abled, and we were told that he was likely to die in utero, and then right after birth, and then by five, etc. When he started speaking, we were all taken aback, and the doctors stopped making projections about what might and might not be possible for him. He absolutely loves to spell, and his vocabulary is limited. So he's not able to express complex emotions, but he lays a lot of emotional feeling into the words he does know how to spell. So this is when we were catching up at Christmas, and you can tell that we are both very excited - using the words he is used to spelling, but conveying the feeling: \"I love you, I'm happy to talk to you, I'm excited to hear your voice.\" This is a very typical conversation for us, almost word for word. \"Shane\" is one of the other handicapped boys who lives in his group home, and he often switches my name for his - I think it's his way of telling a joke. You can see a picture of him here, in this post I posted here a few months ago (it's rare we get to facetime): [https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/8lalkq/my\\_brothers\\_happy\\_face\\_when\\_seeing\\_me\\_for\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/8lalkq/my_brothers_happy_face_when_seeing_me_for_the/)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/aadjgo/ive_been_having_this_exact_same_delightful/ecr1xmr/"}
