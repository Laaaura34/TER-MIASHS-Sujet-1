Glad you\u2019re having a good day. It\u2019s rainy and humid in Dublin, Ireland making for uncomfortable days and horrid, sweaty nights where my wife and I look at each other as total villains just for being co-habitants in a home with only one bed. A few years ago I didn\u2019t know this villain and now I ruin the sleep of my favourite person in the world. You never know what\u2019s around the corner.\n\nLots of love anyway man. Best of luck with everything and along with all the others here, I\u2019ll be thinking of you sitting listening to tunes in hopefully a warm, yet temperate, climate wherever you reside.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/iawxga/tried_killing_myself_earlier_this_year_but_im/g1rzjmf/"}
