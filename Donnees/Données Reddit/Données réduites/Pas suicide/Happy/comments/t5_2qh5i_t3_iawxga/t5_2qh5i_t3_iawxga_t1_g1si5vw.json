Idk if you have a support system in place of friends/family to talk to, though I hope you do! However if you ever feel like you don\u2019t, feel free to consider me a friend and send me a DM and I\u2019ll be here to talk to you about whatever is getting you down! I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m not a trained professional, but I am largely an optimist and hopefully I can help you either look on the bright side or tell you when to see a trained professional when things are getting too dark", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/iawxga/tried_killing_myself_earlier_this_year_but_im/g1si5vw/"}
