Awesome job. \n\nI am also having a very bad time with my mental health and am jumping on here to share. Last night I overreacted to a disagreement and completely broke down. Was not okay. \n\nInstead of screaming at this person I drove to a parking lot close by, wrote down all my thoughts, practiced breathing, and called a therapist. She was SO PROUD of me it made me start sobbing again.\n\nWe made a plan and everything felt manageable again. The hard part starts now but all we can do is try.\n\nKeep it up dude. Thanks for the extra inspiration.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/iawxga/tried_killing_myself_earlier_this_year_but_im/g1rotl3/"}
