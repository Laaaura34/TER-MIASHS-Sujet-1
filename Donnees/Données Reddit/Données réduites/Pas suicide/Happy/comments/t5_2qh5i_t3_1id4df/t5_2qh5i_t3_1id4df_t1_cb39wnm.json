My mom said she could lend me her van instead!!! Thanks mom! \n\nI didn't realize how much it was bothering me. I'm so glad it's a weight off my mind. I know this tour is happening :) This song is one I wrote about doing what you want no matter what, at every second, even if I wasn't really sure about it at the time. \n\nI posted it because I am truly happy, and nothing personifies happiness to me more, than a Pop-Punk riff (4/4 Drum beat with double time metre above 160 BPM, and chordal progression from the major scale), and this is the song I wrote that uses the beat the most frequently. I played this for someone named Breanna once and she described it as \"It sounds Happy.\" \n\nHappy!!!!!!!!!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1id4df/original_song_said_it_all_before_im_not_gonna/cb39wnm/"}
