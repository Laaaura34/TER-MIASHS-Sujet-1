I really look forward to paying those cards off. It's shitty paying interest, but the way I see it, these credit card companies saved my life for four months. For them to charge interest is perfectly fair. Then I will pay them back and reap all the rewards points from hereon out. :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/lxlp2/i_was_unemployed_for_a_portion_of_last_year_it/c2wmnic/"}
