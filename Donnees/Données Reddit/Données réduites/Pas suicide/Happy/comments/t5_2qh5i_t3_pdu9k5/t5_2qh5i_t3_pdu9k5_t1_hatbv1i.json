I really think you should talk with your therapist about your next step.  Maybe that's simply not the right medicine for you.  As a psychologist told me recently, when her clients are sure they want to get off medications she always recommends that they reconsider because if you're feeling like you no longer need the medications often means they are working completely as intended.  I don't really know any more than that and/or if that even makes sense as I know people do come off medications.  But, I'm also not sure the people here (who aren't familiar with your history, etc.) are the best people to advise you on how to move forward.

I wish you much luck in finding the right path and your future happiness.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/pdu9k5/would_really_appreciate_some_help_getting_back_on/hatbv1i/"}
