I just hit my 30y anniversary of my darkest day. I can tell you that things can and will get better. Life is beautiful beyond measure and absolutely worth living.\n For myself, my biggest advisory was my own ego. By ego I am referring to the incessant narrator in my head. I have been meditating for 7 years now and today is my 641 day consecutive sitting. I say that because I am being accountable to myself in my practice. Because I am tracking my efforts, my ego can\u2019t put it on the back burner and then never actually follow through with. \n The first place I would suggest is make it your habit to look for and find ANYTHING to be grateful for. The fact that I can breath is a good starting point. Choose to look at \u201cwhat you have\u201d as opposed to the egos focus on what is lacking. Clean drinking water, a safe place to sleep, shoes, a job, not being in pain, eyes to see with, toilet paper, hot showers, toothpaste, etc.etc. \n The 2ed thing I would suggest is make a point of choosing kind thoughts as you go to sleep and choose the night before what will be your first thought on waking. My first and last is \u201c I am grateful for my life, it is good to be alive.\u201d This has been a mantra for 30 years. It has a solid track record. You are welcome to use it if you like. \n Hopefully these can help. They don\u2019t cost anything and they ain\u2019t a pill. But they have helped me to survive myself. Best wishes to you.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/pdu9k5/would_really_appreciate_some_help_getting_back_on/hatldgx/"}
