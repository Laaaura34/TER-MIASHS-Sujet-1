I am very proud of my heritage and the best thing my family ever did was make sure that I was very excited about my Japanese roots! To make sure she feels connected I would introduce her to Japanese media and food! I really love the movies that Miyazaki has made, so Studio Ghibli movies like Totoro and Ponyo! Also reading her lots of books about Japan and trying to make Japanese food (that's my favorite way to celebrate my culture and now Japanese food always reminds me of home and I can really relate to other Japanese kids by talking about our favorite dishes!)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/d5ii44/i_used_to_get_made_fun_of_for_bringing_different/f0ntql5/"}
