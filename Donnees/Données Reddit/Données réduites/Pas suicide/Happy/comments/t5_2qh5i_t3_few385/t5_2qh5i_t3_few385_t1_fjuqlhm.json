I hardly ever post anything at all on any platform unless it\u2019s about my motorcycles and that\u2019s only because there is a shared interest with other people or I am trying ask a question or something.  my ex girlfriend was pretty big into social media and for some reason was all about me showing other people and had a problem with the fact I don\u2019t need other people to validate my love for someone. I hope you don\u2019t feel as if he/she doesn\u2019t love you any less just because they aren\u2019t having people \u201clike\u201d a picture of you.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/few385/my_girlfriend_makes_me_the_happiest_person_in_the/fjuqlhm/"}
