Yeah I\u2019ve got a friend that was pretty hardcore into having as many followers/ friends and stuff like that as he could and then he started dating a girl who was the complete opposite. Hardly ever used social media, and even still uses a flip phone at 21. She just doesn\u2019t see the point in people that don\u2019t really know you, and a majority of them probably don\u2019t really care too much about what is going on in your life, simply \u201cliking\u201d your posts to feel validated. He ended up deleting almost all of his social media and their relationship has improved so much. Watching it all happen was kind of mind boggling. Granted there are definitely people that can use social media in a healthy way, I use a decent amount of platforms on a pretty much daily basis but I rarely post as I said and mainly use it for news, info, memes, and things like that haha. There story is just two of the extremes on each end of the spectrum. Nice to meet a fellow rider though! What do y\u2019all ride?", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/few385/my_girlfriend_makes_me_the_happiest_person_in_the/fjuzohf/"}
