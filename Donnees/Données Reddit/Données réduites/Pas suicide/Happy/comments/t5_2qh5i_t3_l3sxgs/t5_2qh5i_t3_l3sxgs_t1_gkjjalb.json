This past year I got pregnant and during covid my family had outdoor gatherings in my dads yard. The day I told my parents I was pregnant I found one. And the the next 2 visits after that. It was unbelievable! I wasn't even looking, just happened to look down and see them. Had my son 9 days ago and we gave him an Irish name. Hopefully he continues to be a lucky one!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/l3sxgs/after_moving_two_years_ago_i_started_noticing_a/gkjjalb/"}
