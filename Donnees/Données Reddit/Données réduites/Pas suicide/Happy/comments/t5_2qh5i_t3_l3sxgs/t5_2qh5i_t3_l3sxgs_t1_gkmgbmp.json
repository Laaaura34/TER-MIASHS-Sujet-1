By the end of the year I had found nearly 400 of them.  They're all still sitting in a ziploc bag at my parents house.  I can find a small patch of clover and know within 20 seconds if its a lucky patch or not. I'm reeeeally good at those hidden picture books that were popular years ago. I've always wondered if there was some sort of connection.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/l3sxgs/after_moving_two_years_ago_i_started_noticing_a/gkmgbmp/"}
