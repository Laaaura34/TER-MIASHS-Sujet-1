I don't really like the way it looks now, but I had made a portfolio site for myself with a bunch of parallax effects. The site was ugly, colors were awful, and it was a laggy mess but I was soooo proud of figuring out how to make the parallax scroll just so.\n\nI also recreated a few pages of my school's (ASU) site completely from scratch and there was a lot of jQuery and Javascript involved. So there wasn't any design to it (just following brand guidelines) but it was technical and satisfying.\n\nOH and I did mockup an e-commerce site in about 2 hours for a job application that turned out kind of nice! I just don't have a ton of experience to pull from haha", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/m1c300/hello_reddit_not_only_am_i_120_days_sober_but/gqefwwh/"}
