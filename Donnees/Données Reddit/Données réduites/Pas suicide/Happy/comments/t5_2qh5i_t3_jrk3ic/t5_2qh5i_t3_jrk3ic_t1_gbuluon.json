The main reason being I don\u2019t want to deal with open adoptions, I don\u2019t like the amount of involvement that adoptive parents are expected to have with the birth parents. Other people are ok with that and that\u2019s fine, but it\u2019s not for me. \n\nPlus being infertile doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re obligated to adopt children. Fertile people can adopt too, it\u2019s the same process for them.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/jrk3ic/years_of_infertility_rough_pregnancy_and_failed/gbuluon/"}
