I still struggle with getting over my 2 year long gf from 2 years ago. I\u2019ve been with a beautiful girl named fe for the past 6 months, and I would be lying to you if I said I don\u2019t think about my ex everyday still but I do. Just know that you\u2019re not alone in this kind of thing. My best advice would be to accept you\u2019re always in some capacity gonna care for that person. Keep your chin up my guy, you\u2019re a fine looking hombre you are definitely gonna find someone who\u2019s gonna keep that smile on your face. :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/c9e5y1/been_struggling_with_getting_over_an_old_ex_from/esxv7tm/"}
