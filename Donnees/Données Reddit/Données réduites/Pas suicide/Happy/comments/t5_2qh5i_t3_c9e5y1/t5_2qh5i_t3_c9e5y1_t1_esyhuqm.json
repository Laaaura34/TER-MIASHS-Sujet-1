The ex thing will go over with time and this research internship is a nice opportunity to boost your social life, too! At least, you'll probably get to meet new people :D  \n\n\nAlso, regarding your ex: i've been in situations where I was single for 4\\~5\\~6years after na ex. I'd say I'm one of those guys that takes A LOT of time to get over things like these. There are people who will get over it much faster. Just take your time. Don't compare yourself to others. Focus on you, on your wellbeing, on doing stuff you like, and soon, you end up meeting new people, finding new opportunities in life.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/c9e5y1/been_struggling_with_getting_over_an_old_ex_from/esyhuqm/"}
