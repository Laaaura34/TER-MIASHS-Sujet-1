I worked from age 12 on. Paper route, babysitting anything.  Never took anything from anybody. When I was diagnosed with cancer and started chemo I had to stop working- I just couldn\u2019t physically handle it. I felt like such a failure!  I lost my hair and my self esteem was in the toilet. One night I asked my husband, \u201cHow can you stand me?\u201d  He looked at me so sweetly and said, \u201cBecause I finally know what unconditional love is\u201d.  I had a wonderful partner too!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/esf8ob/im_getting_laid_off_at_my_job_this_week_but/ffau8h6/"}
