He decided to conduct an experiment. He filled the pessimist's bedroom with boxes of toys, amusements and all kinds of goodies then told the pessimist to go into the room and shut the door.\n\n>He filled the optimists bedroom with horse manure and put the optimist in it.\n\n>Some time later he looked in on them. The pessimistic son was standing with his hands on his hips looking at all the goodies in the room with a suspicious expression on his face. The father asked why he looked so glum and why he hadn't opened any of the boxes and the son replied: \" I'm sure I wont like any of them, if I do open them up and play with them they'll probably break, it'll just be a big mess, and I'll have to clean it all up and throw them all out.\n\n>He looked in on his other son. The optimist was smiling, standing waist deep in the manure, shoveling it as fast as he could over his shoulder. \"What are you up to?\" the dad asked his son. \"Well, dad, with all this horseshit, I figured there's go to be a pony in here someplace!\" ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/da8e4/til_that_there_is_a_rsad_it_makes_me_feel_good/c0yzeqs/"}
