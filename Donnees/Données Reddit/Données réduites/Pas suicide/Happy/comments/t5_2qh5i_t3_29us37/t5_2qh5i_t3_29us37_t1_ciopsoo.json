I am friendly with people I work with, but they are all considerably older, so it's far from a real friendship. I had one buddy I went climbing with, but she moved away.\n\nI am planning to move back to my home state. At least with my siblings around me, I might be forced into some social interactions! Considering I mostly enjoy solitary pursuits, it's not a surprise I haven't made any friends. That, and I am a total wuss. \n\nBe brave! Don't do what I did and assume people will see how great you are from a distance.  I only have shyness to overcome, and you have already demonstrated more courage than me.
