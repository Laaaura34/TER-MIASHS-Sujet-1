Because it was an abusive toxic marriage. Instead of seeking help I coped by turning to drugs. So I posted this picture because I\u2019m damn proud of myself. Proud of myself for becoming a survivor, beating the odds, getting into recovery, seeking therapy and making something out of myself. I wanted to share my picture with the world because I\u2019m no longer ashamed of myself, not ashamed of the woman I am. That\u2019s why I shared this with strangers. If you were so bothered by it you could have scrolled on by. It literally costs nothing to be a decent human being.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/pu47wh/officially_divorced_and_back_to_my_maiden_name/he18tmz/"}
