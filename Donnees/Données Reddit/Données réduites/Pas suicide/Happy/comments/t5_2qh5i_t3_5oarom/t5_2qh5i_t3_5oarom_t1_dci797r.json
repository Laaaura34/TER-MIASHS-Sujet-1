I'm not arguing for or against the \"thank you for your service\" thing, but I think Americans have a \"marine on the front lines of Iraq\" kind of mentality for military service. If, like the OP, you're just stationed in Japan or somewhere it's just training and boredom really. The military also requires a vast number of desk jobs to stay organized. So while I wouldn't say they don't deserve to be thanked for their service not everyone is a \"hero\" (nor should they need to be), and as an example your waiter probably also deserves to be thanked for their service.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/5oarom/i_am_in_a_bar_alone_in_japan_and_i_havent_been/dci797r/"}
