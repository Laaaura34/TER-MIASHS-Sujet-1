Congratulations!!! A piece of unsolicited advice in regards to opal. I LOVE opal (it\u2019s my birthstone) and I inherited a ring my dad gave my mom on their wedding day. Opal is fragile and can be easily damaged by cold and impact. My mom had to get the opal replaced and I honestly suggest you lean into the joy. Enjoy the gorgeous beauty of your ring. Wear it with abandon and if you have to replace the stone because of life then do so joyfully. Don\u2019t let the fragility rob you of the daily beauty. Congratulations on your future!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/metf13/so_happy_my_boyfriend_asked_me_to_marry_him_today/gsjqgcs/"}
