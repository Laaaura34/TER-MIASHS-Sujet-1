I don't know about soon, but I'll get there eventually. (I took the decision 6 years ago, started Uni but had to stop because I couldn't afford it since I am an immigrant, but hopefully next year I'll be able to start Uni again. So maybe ready to go in 4 to 6 years, which will give me time to improve my Japanese a lot.\nThank you for your kind words and sharing your wife's channel! I really appreciate it.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/o709j7/my_wifes_silver_play_button_from_youtube_arrived/h6nuymy/"}
