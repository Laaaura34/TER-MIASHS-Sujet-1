My husband also suffered from trigeminal neuralgia and it took about 5 years for him to be properly diagnosed. It was excruciating pain, and there were times I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d have him with me for much longer. Thankfully once diagnosed he was fast tracked through the system, his surgery was a success, and almost 10 years later he hasn\u2019t had one twinge of pain in his face! He\u2019s also pretty proud of the titanium plate in his head.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/gss1n6/my_daughter_suffered_with_one_of_the_worst_pain/fs9dx6b/"}
