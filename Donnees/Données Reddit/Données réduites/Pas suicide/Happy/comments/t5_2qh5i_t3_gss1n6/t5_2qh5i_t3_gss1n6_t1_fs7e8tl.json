My partner injured herself shortly into our relationship in the early 2010s, and has had an up and (mostly) down life experience with her health in general.  It's such a hard experience being family + carer (although we're largely okay now), but I can't imagine seeing your own child go through the hell of chronic pain, especially that which come from trigeminal neuralgia.  I hope she has a steady recovery - I pray that the net positives for your family come in the time they need for all your sakes <3", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/gss1n6/my_daughter_suffered_with_one_of_the_worst_pain/fs7e8tl/"}
