I think more and more young people are getting it.\n\nI encourage everyone to not stress yourselves out. This was my wake up call to eat healthy/exercise/maintain my weight. I already do but x 10 with the pandemic. And sleep! That\u2019s my biggest obstacle and I\u2019m working hard at it. \n\nI am sorry to hear about your mom. I take it she\u2019s had multiple bouts? I have a prescription with 3 refills till 2022 if I have it again for the antivirals. That way I can just get started without needing a doc to see me immediately. I have heard it can recur and I\u2019m honestly terrified about it. \n\nI am generally a pretty fit person, exercise 5-6 days a week and bike to work. Shingles took me down for a solid month. Just starting to exercise again. Not sure what my new normal will be.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/gss1n6/my_daughter_suffered_with_one_of_the_worst_pain/fso523j/"}
