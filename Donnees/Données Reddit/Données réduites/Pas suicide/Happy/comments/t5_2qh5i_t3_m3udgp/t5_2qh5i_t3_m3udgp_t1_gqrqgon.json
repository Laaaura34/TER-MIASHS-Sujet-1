Glad you made it over the hump. I was adopted from Korea and my parents tell me I was very reserved with them Maualuga just observing them. But I would play and sing with my brother. One day my mom was changing my diaper and she got me to laugh and she said I looked at her like I got caught and then got up and used the toilet on my own. I guess I was toilet trained the whole time! Anyhoo, she said it was myself with them after that.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/m3udgp/my_adopted_daughter_called_for_me_for_the_first/gqrqgon/"}
