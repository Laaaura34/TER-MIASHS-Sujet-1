One spell can beat any two of the five other spells and likewise also can be beaten by two of the five. Teams face off one wizard at a time. Each \"wizard\" is given a deck of five cards with those spells and both must lay one card down at the count of three. You could modify it for younger kids and only use 3 spells instead of 5 or you could make it so that the winner must leave their winning card down to give the other player who is behind a chance to catch up. Play best two out of three or three out of five before the deck is given to the next wizard on the team. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cewp4/ever_imagined_400_kids_pretending_to_be_at/c0s34f4/"}
