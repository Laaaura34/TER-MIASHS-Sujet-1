I'll try to find the rules someplace... but it basically comes down to Rugby + Dodgeball + Hide and Seek... while on brooms. Intercollegate Quidditch League is the group. I'm trying to find the rules but the best I can do is a watered down version on ehow http://www.ehow.com/how_2067087_play-muggle-quidditch.html\n\nI can tell you the things we did different:\n\nBeaters could move. Also they didn't use rackets. It was just 2 Dodgeballs for them.\n\nInstead of freezing for 5 seconds when we got hit by a bludger you had to run to your team's goal, run around it once and then you were back in the game.\n\nThe snitch was one guy who went to hide off someplace and when the seekers found him they had to chase him back. He had like a flag football flag on himself. Though we used a sock with a tennis ball.\n\nThe snitch was only worth 50 points I think. It was just impossible to play otherwise...\n\nPeople had to shoot from outside the \"goal box\" and as long as the keeper was on his side of the field he was immune to the bludgers.\n\nOh, and it got a little violent. We played full contact. You could tone that down somehow though and I don't think people would complain.\n\nI think that was about it that is different from the little tutorial. We identified the different positions by headbands. Of course, if you have any questions I'd be glad to answer them...", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cewp4/ever_imagined_400_kids_pretending_to_be_at/c0sa1od/"}
