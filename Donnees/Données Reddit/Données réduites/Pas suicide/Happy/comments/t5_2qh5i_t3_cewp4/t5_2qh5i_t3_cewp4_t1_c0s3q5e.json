One of them was to capture \"The Great Wadego\" or some such thing.  Turns out there was a shirtless counselor in one of the fields running around with a hula-hoop and covered in crisco.  To get the point you had to catch him and force him through the hoop.  It was actually really fun, mostly because we got to see our 5'4\" Ultimate-playing cabin leader dive-tackle the guy and pin him to the ground so we could pull the hoop around him.  She is very competitive so got really intense about it and it ended up being wicked funny.\n\nAdmittedly, tackling a greasy half-naked man might not be the most kid-friendly activity, but if you wanted to \"capture a troll\" you could maybe enlist a particularly tall/strapping counselor, dress him in ratty clothes and smudge dirt/makeup on his face and maybe give him a \"club\" (fun noodle) that the kids have to steal and hit him over the head with.  You didn't say how old the kids are but he could adjust his resistance depending on how big they are.  Little kids love to feel like they are beating an adult at something so they might really like it.\n\nGood luck with your games!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cewp4/ever_imagined_400_kids_pretending_to_be_at/c0s3q5e/"}
