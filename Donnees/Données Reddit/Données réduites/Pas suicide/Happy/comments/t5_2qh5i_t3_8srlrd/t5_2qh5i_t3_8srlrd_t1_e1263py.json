Anyone on here have some good advice? \n\nI smoked for a year from 18-19 then moved across the country and jsut found it easy as so much was going on at once with readjusting/being on and off homeless for a while but, now I have a decent job and I'm definitely blowing $200+/M and I hate it. I quit drinking at 24 due to a peptic ulcer and that was easy, didn't feel like paying money to throw up blood, that made sense. I don't get pissed off about not smoking weed and never had issues with anything else I experimented with while younger. But, I find myself an extremely hateful agitated prick trying to quit smoking the 2nd time around. \n\nI've tried the gum and it helped me cut back from the amount that I was but, it was harsh AF on the throat and made it hard to continue with it. I've been advised by friends to try the patch or the inhaler. And I was in the hospital on Saturday and the Dr. told me, hey if you cut back isn't that good enough? Which surprised me, but, I mean, i guess that's true, but, I'd rather just be done with this disgusting habit already. \n\nREDDIT HELP.
