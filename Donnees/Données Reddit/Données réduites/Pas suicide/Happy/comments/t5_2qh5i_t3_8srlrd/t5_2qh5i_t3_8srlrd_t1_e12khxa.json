She would smoke and I would think \" I've quit this long I'll never get addicted again I'm not that stupid\". Checkmate me, am that stupid. \n\nThe biggest thing for me when I quit was my appetite, I've always been really thin, but I was eating so much sugar and junk food when I quit that I gained a giant stomach, i found it hard to breath and felt so much more unhealthy than I did as a smoker lol, which is retarded i know. \n\nThis time when i quit I'm changing my diet and hitting the gym. The weight flew off me when I started smoking again. It's weird how much you need to fill that gap with something ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8srlrd/the_love_of_my_life_quit_smoking_last_night_help/e12khxa/"}
