My first cigarettes all were stolen out of her packs. My first pack was bought for me by her. The cycle ends with me.\n\nSame here. I still smoke. Mom still smokes. Dad still smokes. My sister still smokes. If I could go back in time I\u2019d slap them silly for ever making it okay for me and my sister to smoke. Teenagers are dumb. They think they know everything, but they don\u2019t. They still need parents to guide them. \n\n\nMajor kudos to you for breaking the cycle. I don\u2019t have kids, but if I ever do I hope I can be strong enough to do what you did. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8srlrd/the_love_of_my_life_quit_smoking_last_night_help/e12ph8b/"}
