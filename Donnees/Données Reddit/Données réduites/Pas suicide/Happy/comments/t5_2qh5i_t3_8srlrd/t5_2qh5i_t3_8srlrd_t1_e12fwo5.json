What an exciting and awesome first step! \n\n\nI just recently quit smoking (11 months now!) with the help of my boyfriend.\n\n\nI'm definitely someone that responds best to a rewards based system, haha. This is what we did.\n\n\nEvery day I didn't smoke, I got a sticker.\nStickers are awesome and it also served as a visual reminder of how far I had come and what I had to be proud of.\n\n\nOnce I had 30 stickers in my \"bank\" (a piece of paper on our fridge lol), I could trade them in for a small prize.\n\n\nIf I had a smoke, he didn't get mad, but I did lose all the stickers in my bank (we drew a black line on the paper) and I had to start over again.\n\n\nThe stickers stayed on the fridge, reminding me that I could do it even when I messed up and had one. \nPlus when I felt like having a smoke, I had to really ponder if it was losing all my banked stickers/hard work.\n\n\nIt might seem juvenile, but it was the only thing that worked about years and years of quitting/smoking/quitting/smoking.\n\n\nEventually we got to a point where I forgot to keep count of the days and I've been smoke free ever since :)\n\nGood luck to your girl!!\n", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8srlrd/the_love_of_my_life_quit_smoking_last_night_help/e12fwo5/"}
