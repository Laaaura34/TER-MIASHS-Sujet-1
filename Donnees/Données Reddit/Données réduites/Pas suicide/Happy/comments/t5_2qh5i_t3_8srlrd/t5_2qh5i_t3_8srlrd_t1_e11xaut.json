Just some tips to help curb the cravings, try to stay away from bars/social situations where others will be smoking or she used to have a cig (for my bf, he would always have one at the bar while drinking). Have gum around when she gets a craving, it actually works to help the brain distract itself from needing one. \n\nAccording to my bf, seeing someone else lighting one would give him cravings, but that went away the longer he went without a cig. He said now he barely even feels it anymore when he sees someone smoking and he really can\u2019t stand the smell! From what I remember that first year was the hardest for him, so make sure you support your gf and remind her why she quit! Good luck to her!!
