I\u2019m on day 546. It\u2019s a tough road and still is sometimes but it\u2019s getting easier with time.  One thing you can help with is be there for her when she\u2019s feeling emotional. When I was angry, i smoked. When I was sad, i smoked. When I was happy, I smoked. I missed smoking at those times because it felt almost like I lost a friend to share those feelings with. So be there for her and listen, or if she doesn\u2019t want to talk, just hold her quietly until she\u2019s ready to say something. Sending you both good vibes!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8srlrd/the_love_of_my_life_quit_smoking_last_night_help/e123e9p/"}
