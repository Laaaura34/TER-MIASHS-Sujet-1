If you go cold turkey you\u2019ll feel like shit for a week and you\u2019ll be done with the physical side of it. Chew gum to keep your mouth busy. Eat a lot of candy; nicotine makes your body release sugar into your bloodstream, so your blood sugar levels will be really low the first week, until your body adjusts, making you feel like shit.\n\nWhen quitting, you have to WANT it. When you try to quit and fail, its because a part of you still wants to smoke. Don\u2019t leave yourself any outs. Convince yourself that you REALLY REALLY want to quit and you want to quit more than whatever physical sensation you are experiencing.\n\nIt\u2019s all mental. If you really want to quit, stop making excuses and fucking do it. Don\u2019t saying i\u2019m \u2018trying\u2019 to quit, just quit.
