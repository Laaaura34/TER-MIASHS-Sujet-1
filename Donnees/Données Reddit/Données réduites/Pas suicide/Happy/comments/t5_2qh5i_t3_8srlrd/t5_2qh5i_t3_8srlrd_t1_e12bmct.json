When i quit i had to replace the habbit with something else. I went cold turkey and picked up exercise and eating better. When i have a craving i just work out for a bit to distract myself. It also boosts the confidence because a month after i quit i didnt get winded so much. Im almost 7 months with no cigarettes and going strong. You can do it to!
