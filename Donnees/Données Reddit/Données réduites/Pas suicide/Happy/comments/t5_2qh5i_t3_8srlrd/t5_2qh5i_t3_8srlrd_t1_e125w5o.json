First time went well and I didn't smoke for four years. Then I tried a cigar for fun, it was nasty. In hindsight, that was what made me \"a smoker\" again, and it took a lot of effort and at least a year to quit again. My best advice? if you smoke again, all your effort will be lost...and also, never \"try\" it again for fun, even if you quit 10 years ago. And for now, you probably really want to smoke, but that'll go away, first for hours, then for days, then for weeks, then there will even be that month that you don't have the urge. Good luck to you fellow redditor, I know you can do it!!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8srlrd/the_love_of_my_life_quit_smoking_last_night_help/e125w5o/"}
