Their comments break the rules of this subreddit.  Quitting addictions is tough and everybody does it a little differently.  When I am trying to change something about myself, I celebrate every small victory.  It helps me.  You do you.  Also, by having this posted there is a level of accountability.  I'm sending positive vibes your way.  Quitting smoking will help you and everyone you encounter.  When you don't smoke, you no longer subject the ones around you to unfiltered smoke.  When you don't smoke, those who look up to you won't be tempted to smoke.  You can do it!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8srlrd/the_love_of_my_life_quit_smoking_last_night_help/e125ngh/"}
