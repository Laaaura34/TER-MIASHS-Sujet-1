I've found that not spending enough time outside really gets me down, so the first thing I try when I'm feeling blue is to get outside, take a walk, listen to some music, and clear my head. When that doesn't work or it's too cold or dark, I take a nice bath. And when that fails, I call one of my sisters or a close friend and tell them I'm low and need help coming back up. They usually know exactly what to do. \n\nThere's also always exercise, meditation, yoga, and brownies, too. :D", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/fjgt0/what_do_you_do_when_your_feeling_overwhelmed/c1gjgsm/"}
