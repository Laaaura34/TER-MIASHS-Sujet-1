But sadly, sharks almost never bites anyone. They usually just mind their own business. Unfortunately.\n\nI didn\u2019t know there were that many different types! I will have to look into them. They are awesome and cute! \n\nYes, but you still have fishes like that. We don\u2019t. There is a lot less color here. We do have the cuckoo wrasse though. I only have a few dives, but that\u2019s probably the most colorful fish I\u2019ve seen here. Or at least the most colorful one of the ones I can name!\n\nBy the way... sharks are awesome! I\u2019ve seen a few of them while diving. Never here though (of course). We have sharks here, but you rarely see them. Where I live, we have a small window in June/July where we can dive with sharks.
