I'm a girl so I've always admired Gwen and Kathleen Hanna. Kill-C and Nico from Star Fucking Hipsters are both rad as well.\n\nI don't know the guys influences super well. They're all really into The Last Shadow Puppets. I showed them a group called Summer Twins yesterday because it seemed like a similar style.\n\nThe band isn't exactly the music style I listen to most, but I think it'll fit my vocal abilities better and it's still just fun to hang out and make music together.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/5rhr2y/i_joined_a_band/dd84386/"}
