I see nothing wrong with offering information to others that helped the person who is offering it. But like I said, what works for one person may not work for another. Does that mean that no one should ever offer advice to anyone? I think we would live in a much crazier world if we had no \"gurus.\" The self-help industry has helped me tremendously. It helped me overcome anxiety, depression, and become financially independent. I didn't blindly follow everything that every guru ever told me. I chose what felt right for me and went from there. If it worked, I used it. If not, I moved on to something else. The people who offer advice should use it themselves, I agree. But in the end, it is your decisions and your decision only as to what you choose to accept and use. The judgement of others has nothing to do with what you do with your life.
