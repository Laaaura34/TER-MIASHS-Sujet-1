You just need to know the risks of your actions.  Like if you wanted to be an actor, you'd have to understand that, statistically, it's unlikely you'll make a living wage.  Then you'd say do I have any special gifts?  Am I unusually talented?  Am exceptionally attractive?  If I don't have those gifts,  am I prepared to be poor all my life?  \n\nIsn't that better than lying to yourself about your chances for success?  Isn't it better to realistically assess your chances and how you'd handle failure, than believing a bunch of slogans about how grit and determination always win out?  \n\nAlso:  I agree, focus on solutions.  That is the definition of being realistic IMO.  Wallowing in your problems and brooding over them is just being negative, and that's pretty much the worst outlook there is.  REALISTICALLY, the best thing you can do is figure out a solution.  Positivity is better but realism is  best.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/27ngax/how_to_stop_negative_thoughts_and_steadily/ci2w5gu/"}
