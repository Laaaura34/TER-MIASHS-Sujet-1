And remember, You\u2019re allowed to count your sobriety however you want! When my cousin made it to 99 days and then relapsed for a day - we picked right back up with sobriety the next day and, one day belated, celebrated 100 days sober!!! Because the *one* day he slipped up DID NOT invalidate the 100 cumulative days he had been working hard to be sober. He still had 100/101 days sober - thats a 99% A!! Just remember that nothing (not even \u201cslipping up,\u201d if it ever happens to you) can invalidate the work you have done to get to this place right here!!
