It's actually [a commercial](http://www.theadclass.com/campaigns/vtm-maria-station-antwerp-en-sound-of-music-dance) for VTM in Belgium, and they got the idea (according to my link) from the [T-Mobile flash mob](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ3d3KigPQM) from months before. T-Mobile's was actually a reaction to the growing popularity of flashmobs put together by non-commercial organizers who were just doing it for the fun of it. The first real flash mobs, [according to wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_mob), were put together by an editor of Harper's Magazine in Manhattan, 6 years prior to these commercial ones.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/iak8f/i_believe_this_is_the_original_flash_dance_i/c228oe0/"}
