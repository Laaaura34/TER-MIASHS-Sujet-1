I never knew he saw me like that or felt that way. He's amazing. He is so supportive and made me really believe I could do this marathon. He always tells me I'm an amazing person. I'm so lucky. We are going to see Book of Mormon on my birthday and I'm just having fun and seeing where it goes. Hopefully we will be in it for the long run. ;) Best of luck to you!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1l1hfw/decided_to_take_the_next_step_with_best_friend_of/cbv4f3q/"}
