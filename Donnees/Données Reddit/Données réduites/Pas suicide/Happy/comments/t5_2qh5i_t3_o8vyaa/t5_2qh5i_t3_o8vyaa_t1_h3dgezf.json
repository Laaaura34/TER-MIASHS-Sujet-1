My step mum nagging me that my husband isn't contributing but honestly it's nice to have him home all the time, especially when I come home really stressed out and he's there for me. I have anxiety and I'm very introverted so after dealing with customers all day is nice to have him home to help me wind down. He's working for my friend right now and it's not too bad. I just wish people would f*** off with telling me that my husband needs to get another job. He makes me feel secure and does an amazing job as a dad and husband, he didn't need another job!\n\nSorry for they vent, I just wish my family respected my husband for what he does to our family more. He takes care of two kids all day and still has energy to make his wife feel better, that's worth more than its weight in gold!\n\nEdit: bad autocorrect", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/o8vyaa/just_paid_off_my_9k_credit_card_balance_i_started/h3dgezf/"}
