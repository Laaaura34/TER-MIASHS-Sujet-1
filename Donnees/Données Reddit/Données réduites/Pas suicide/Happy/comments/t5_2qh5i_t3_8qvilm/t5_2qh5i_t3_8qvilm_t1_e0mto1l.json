Parenting is hard, but it's the ultimate rewarding thing. Its also one of the most sadistic yet satisfying things- to watch the human being who's diapers you've changed succeed in life. I was hoping my message would come across as \"Life is unfair, but it is the most rewarding thing, and parenting is the best job there is.\"\n\nAlso this is me taking the sentiments my grandparents have with my parents and trying to translate it in text. I'm sure my parents feel the same way about me as well, they rightly should since I got accepted to a university outside of the country (they were such good parents that they managed to send me beyond Yale and Harvard :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8qvilm/after_multiple_miscarriages_and_almost_giving_up/e0mto1l/"}
