That is where I posted it, but the suggestion to bring it here wasn't as spiteful. That doesn't mean that there haven't been plenty of spiteful comments made there, though. It's weird in a way. If I posted a picture of a cat or a dog that I'd loved and had died, nobody would say anything negative about it. Share one moment of happiness and try to give people in similar situations hope, though, and people just crap all over you. I've got thick skin, though, so it doesn't bother me. I just don't understand why people feel the need to be so vile.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8qvilm/after_multiple_miscarriages_and_almost_giving_up/e0np7fp/"}
