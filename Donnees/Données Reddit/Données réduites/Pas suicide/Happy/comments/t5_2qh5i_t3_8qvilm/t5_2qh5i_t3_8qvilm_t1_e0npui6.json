After a lot of doctor visits, it was determined that my wife has a disorder called anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) wherein there are tiny little microclots that form in her bloodstream... not enough to do her harm, but enough to prevent the fetus from getting the nutrition it needs to survive. So they put her on blood thinners. Each morning she gets up and sticks a needle into her belly. It pains me to see her having to do this, but it fills me with joy knowing that it hasn't been for nothing. We will keep you and your wife in our thoughts and prayers and I hope that you will one day be able to feel the elation and anticipation that I am feeling now. Don't give up!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8qvilm/after_multiple_miscarriages_and_almost_giving_up/e0npui6/"}
