And i'd think you would also congratulate a friend, who gets a brand new car for Christmas. At this point i am wondering why i am explaining the obvious. Good luck\n\nAdditional: What you are wondering about is called \"politeness\" and \"empathy\". These are things, that have evolved over quite a long time, can seem irrational at first glance, but serve a fundamental purpose - to keep us of our throats. Being ignorant of the needs of others, can make you seem less likeable and therefore less attractive. That can negatively impact your life in ways you can't even imagine. It can make you less desirable to your boss, to women and maybe (one day) to your little family. You should keep an eye on that. It's very helpful to be fairly good at empathy and politeness. Good Day to you.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8qvilm/after_multiple_miscarriages_and_almost_giving_up/e0ollse/"}
