I am a 42 year old male and I've always wanted to have children.  I thought my waiting was over last year when I finally fell in love with a wonderful woman who happened to be 3 years older than me.  Neither of us have children from previous relationships and neither of us have been married before.  I asked her to marry me and she said yes!  WOO HOO!!  But it wasn't long before I found out that she was afraid of having a child at her age due to the possibility of having a down's syndrome baby.  I couldn't change her mind, and we broke up because of it.  It was a hard thing to do, but it was a mutual separation, and we are still great friends who talk every day.  I congratulate you on yours though!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/xy5oa/pregnant_at_40/c5rajhd/"}
