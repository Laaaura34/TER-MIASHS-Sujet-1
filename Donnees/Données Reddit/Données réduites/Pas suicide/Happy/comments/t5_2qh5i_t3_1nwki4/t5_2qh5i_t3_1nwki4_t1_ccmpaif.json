When anyone graduates from that school they get a brick with their name on it. We walked along the brick path until we found each others names, then we walked over to my old dorm. \n\nMy dorm was right above the porch, so we could open the windows and crawl out and sit on top of it. One night almost 6 years ago, he and I did that very thing, and he kissed me for the first time. \n\nSo Saturday as we stood under a crepe myrtle, all alone, looking at the place where so much of our relationship began, he got down on one knee and asked me. \n\nAs I think about it, it was in almost that same spot that he asked me to officially be his girlfriend. \n\nIt feels amazing to be engaged! I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with my best friend! \n\n", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1nwki4/saturday_was_the_happiest_day_of_my_life/ccmpaif/"}
