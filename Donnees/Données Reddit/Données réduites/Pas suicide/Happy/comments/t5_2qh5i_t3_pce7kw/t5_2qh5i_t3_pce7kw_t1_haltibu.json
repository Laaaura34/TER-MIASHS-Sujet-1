I'm not usually this sentimental but this post kinda got me. I'm going through some (mostly) positive changes right now and am square in the middle of \"I'll clap for my own damn self\" territory.   \nI posted my latest shitty DIY in this sub a couple of hours ago and even though I'm proud that I'm putting myself out there, even if it's in small increments like cringe DIY posts on Reddit, and I feel strong these days, it would still be nice to have another human clap for me like your just did for your wife.   \n\n\nYou're a good husband. :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/pce7kw/my_wife_doesnt_have_a_lot_of_faith_in_her_art_i/haltibu/"}
