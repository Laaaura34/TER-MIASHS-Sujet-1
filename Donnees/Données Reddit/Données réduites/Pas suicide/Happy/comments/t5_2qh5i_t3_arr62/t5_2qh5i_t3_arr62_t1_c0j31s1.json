I was taking a course - let's say it was called \"advanced narwhal physiology\". I checked the exam timetable, found the exam called \"advanced narwhal physiology\", wrote it in my diary, planned my studying around it, etc. As it turns out, there were *two* exams called \"advanced narwhal physiology\", one for undergraduates and one for MA students. My actual exam was a week earlier. I ended up only having a couple of days to study, but I am immensely grateful that one of my classmates phone me to check I'd got the right exams. In a very real way, I owe him my degree.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/arr62/frantically_rushing_to_get_my_physics_homework/c0j31s1/"}
