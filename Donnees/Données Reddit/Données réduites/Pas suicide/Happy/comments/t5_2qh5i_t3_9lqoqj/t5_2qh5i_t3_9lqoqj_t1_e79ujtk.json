I don't think every single purchase under the sun has to be thrifted as cheaply as possible. I wear a pair of 200$ work boots. I'm not some dumpster diver who thinks nobody should buy things. But trying to justify hundreds if not thousands on a *bag* is just never gonna happen with me. I don't care if this bag balances her chackbook and waters the ficus, it's just not a purchase that makes any sort of sense to me.
