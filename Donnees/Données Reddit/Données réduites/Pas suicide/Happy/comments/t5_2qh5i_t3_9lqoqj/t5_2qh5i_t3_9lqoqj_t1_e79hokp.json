My $250 LV wallet took me through all 7 years of college, and now 4 years of working in the field. I still regularly get compliments when I take it out. \n\nLet people spend money and be happy. I have a coach belt I bought for $70 (most people scoff at) when I was 14 or 15 (my mom taught me quality over quantity early on) and guess what I have literally not even had to think about for 12-13 years? A belt that actually fits and looks good no matter what. Holes haven't even gotten bigger. Just plain black leather. \n\nThere's reason some of us buy certain things and some of us like a little flair and that is okay. Trying to degrade someone else for having a different taste is not.
