Hence why I said \u201chundreds for a Louis Vuitton bag? LOL.\u201d \n\n If you couldn\u2019t imply that I was making fun of OP for suggesting the bag was only a few hundred then you should learn to read. I was saying hundreds isn\u2019t even a lot for a mid range bag considering op made it sound like $300 was a lot for a handbag. No where did i say the Louis Vuitton bag was a few hundred bucks. Anyways, thanks for telling me what I already obviously knew.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9lqoqj/my_mom_is_one_of_the_hardest_working_individuals/e7b6ge3/"}
