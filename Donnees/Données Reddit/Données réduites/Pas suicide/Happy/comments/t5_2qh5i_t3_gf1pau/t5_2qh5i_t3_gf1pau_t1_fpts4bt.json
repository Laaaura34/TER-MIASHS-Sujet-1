The first week was so bad but I got through it. I have used nicotine mints a few times while drinking since I stopped but I have not came close to vaping, even when around friends that vape. I am not sure how accurate the cost thing on my app is but I know I am saving a good amount. Especially when I was using a Juul, those are so expensive. The app has definitely been a huge help and reaching milestones like 1 week, a month and now 2 months!\n\nAnd congrats to you for quitting and staying strong!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/gf1pau/it_wasnt_easy_but_i_am_so_proud_of_how_far_i_have/fpts4bt/"}
