I'm also 29 and suspect I have ADHD. I relate so much on the lack of early memory, brain fog, forgetfulness, avoiding tasks, I daydream when people talk to me without meaning to... I read a post on here a couple of months ago that sounded exactly like me and everyone was recommending she get tested. I told myself that I was just being silly/lazy/just the way I am, but I think this post has cemented that I should get tested too. You sound so happy and this has been such a burden, you've given me hope so thank you! :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/i5ux7d/i_finally_started_treatment_for_adhd_i_think_this/g0rs9pl/"}
