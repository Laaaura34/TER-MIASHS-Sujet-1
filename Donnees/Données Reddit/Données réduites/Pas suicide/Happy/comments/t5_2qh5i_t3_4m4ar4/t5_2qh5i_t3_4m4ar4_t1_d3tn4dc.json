My dad recently died, my grandfather a few years ago and I'm having a heck of a time dealing with grief.  But I also met a wonderful man who like you has autism and is the sweetest, kindest (to me lol) most wonderful man evah! Plus he moved in with three kitties.  I myself have my share of mental illness due to blah blah and found out yesterday I will need back surgery in the future or else I risk life with a walker by mid 40's.  However I also see the back info as a success because it will elevate this risk which is a major YaY.  My depression is controlled by anti-depressants and I am a candidate for getting tubes tied (can't have children, cannot deal with post-partum depression/ self-aware enough to know I cannot provide the life I want know my child deserves).\n\nSo some times are crappy and other times they are not.  Then one of the cats will run into a wall or face-plant and life's all well.  Thanks for writting that.  \n\nHow has your day gone?", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/4m4ar4/you_should_be_very_happy/d3tn4dc/"}
