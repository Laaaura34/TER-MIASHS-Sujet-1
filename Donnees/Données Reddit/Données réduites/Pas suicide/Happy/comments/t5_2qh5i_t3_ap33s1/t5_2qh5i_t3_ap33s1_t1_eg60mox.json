I ended up too low (I'm 5'6\" and I was 99 pounds) and people were all like \"I wish I was you, needing to gain weight, I could eat all the ice cream I wanted!\" And I was like, you really don't actually want to be in my situation, I'm constantly sick, shut up. But like everyone said it. (I'm good now, btw, started FODMAP diet and like all my symptoms went away.)\n\nHowever on the plus side your illness took you to what sounds like a good weight! I'm glad you feel more comfortable in your skin. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ap33s1/im_hesitant_to_post_this_because_i_lost_this/eg60mox/"}
