To be fair, a widely known quirk of human psychology is that as a person becomes more abstracted from his money\u2014where it be casino tokens or credit cards\u2014the less responsibly he spends it.  Though I doubt debit cards have an appreciable difference in this regard.  Luckily, these new rules will prevent a debit card being used for debt and thus require at least a bit more contemplation before one spends money he doesn't have.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/bcjef/the_card_act_just_made_my_day/c0m3ng8/"}
