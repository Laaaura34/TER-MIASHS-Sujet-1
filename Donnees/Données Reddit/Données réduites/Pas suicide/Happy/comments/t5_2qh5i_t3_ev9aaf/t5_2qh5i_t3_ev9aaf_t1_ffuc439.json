My brother went through something very similar. He struggled with reading comprehension and interacting socially with the other kids. But he did exceptionally well in math. The school didn\u2019t believe there was anything wrong though. We knew he had autism yet the school wouldn\u2019t give him an IEP so we hired a lawyer and eventually the school allowed it. But we felt that he deserved to go to a school that was more accepting so he went to a different public school in the next school district for his 5th grade year. Now he is thriving and even got accepted to a magnet school for math and science. But again, congrats I know how huge these accomplishments are!!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ev9aaf/my_son_got_on_the_honor_roll_for_the_1st_time/ffuc439/"}
