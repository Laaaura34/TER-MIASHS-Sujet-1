My shrink warned me that recovery would be difficult and he was right. I\u2019ve always considered this period of my life a mental marathon.  I found going to survivor support groups actually made me feel worse (even though the people were very nice). Treatment and recovery can take you to very scary, dark places that most regular folks can\u2019t even image. I don\u2019t have any advice, I have been enjoying feeling well enough to be active: digging in my garden and such which is a good feeling. Good luck to you!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ar71qe/im_in_remission_and_i_have_a_hairline_again_well/eglvdsc/"}
