The pain started in my lower back, and spread down my right leg. It felt like a sharp ache at first, but progressed to the most intense stabbing pains every night. Chemo felt like a breeze in comparison, as did the bone marrow biopsy! \n\nOver the six months of hell, docs sent me to all sorts of specialists. I was preliminarily diagnosed with a pulled muscle, then a slipped disk, then sciatica, then arthritis. I was seriously starting to wonder if it was all in my head, and became suicidal from lack of sleep, permanent agony and frustration. \n\nThankfully I was eventually sent for an MRI, which showed that my hip, spine and pelvis were riddled with lymphoma and that the pain was due to the amount of cancer in there pushing out my bones from the inside. Yuck! \n", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ar71qe/im_in_remission_and_i_have_a_hairline_again_well/eglqk27/"}
