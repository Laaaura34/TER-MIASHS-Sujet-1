I\u2019m so sorry it took so long to find your answer and respond properly (though I\u2019m glad you are in remission finally). Maybe I\u2019ve been lucky but when i\u2019ve complained of pain, the first step is some generic bloodwork and an x ray, and the second is an MRI. I can\u2019t believe it took them so long to think, \u201cgee, maybe we should get an imaging test to see if there\u2019s a tangible, anatomical cause of the pain?\u201d I get that MRIs are relatively expensive, but compared to 6 months of irrelevant and gratuitous appointments, tests, and false diagnoses?\n\n(Then again it took me months, years since the onset of symptoms really, to be diagnosed with Hashimoto\u2019s, which thankfully isn\u2019t deadly the way undiagnosed lymphoma is. Point being, I understand doctors are imperfect and far from omniscient... doesn\u2019t make it less frustrating to be caught up in it, though.)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ar71qe/im_in_remission_and_i_have_a_hairline_again_well/eglskv5/"}
