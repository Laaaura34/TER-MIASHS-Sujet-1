In remission now. Spot on with the symptoms I had as well. A couple more from me. \n\nLaying down on my back caused coughing. Dry, deep coughs. Some of my lymph nodes felt like marbles. Almost perfectly round, and hard. Plus almost all my lymph nodes were activating. The easiest ones to feel we\u2019re about my collar bone, under my armpit, under my neck, in my groin. The back pain was the one that made me go to a doctor as well. It was at the point where I couldn\u2019t stand for long periods of time without needing to sit down and rest. Lower back pain specifically. \n\nProud of you for beating it. Welcome to remission world. \n\nAs a side note. My hair grew in completely different.
