The oncology nurses I saw every week were such empathetic and beautiful souls. I can't imagine what you must go through on a daily basis, but want to thank you for all you do.

Wishing you many moments of joy and peace. \ud83e\udd70", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/htr1lf/graduated_suma_cum_laude_beat_the_big_c_and_got_a/fykguut/"}
