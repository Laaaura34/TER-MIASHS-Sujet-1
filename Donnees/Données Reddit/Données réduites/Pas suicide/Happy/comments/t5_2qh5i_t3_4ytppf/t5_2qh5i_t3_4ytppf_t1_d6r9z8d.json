That was a moving story and I'm very happy for you that you've found the glass again. It's strange to think about the sentimental values put on sometimes arbitrary objects, but they still deeply affect us all the same. I have/had a similar attachment to my maternal grandfather's all black (no woodgrain) Atari 2600, he had a stroke and the joystick was perfect for one handed use. I lost it somehow when I was in middle school and have been looking for a new THE Atari but I haven't been able to find one locally. (just buying one on eBay wouldn't have enough significance to replace it, I want to FIND one). Sorry for rambling a little bit, I have been thinking about it a lot recently and your story brought it fresh into my mind.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/4ytppf/looks_like_things_do_come_back_sometimes/d6r9z8d/"}
