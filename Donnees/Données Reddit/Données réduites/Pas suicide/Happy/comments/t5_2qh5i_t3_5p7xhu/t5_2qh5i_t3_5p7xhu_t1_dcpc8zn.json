It's going to be hard, but it's attainable.\n\nUnfortunately being in that environment is going to make it harder for you in the other aspects you mention. The only advice I can give is to aggressively limit the amount of negativity you are exposed to in other areas of your life.  Seek positive friendships, avoid social media that is consistently or even often negative, don't watch cynical or overly dark TV shows and movies, be careful about your video games, and so on.\n\nAre you aware there are resources for people who are subject to abuse? This includes verbal abuse. I would encourage you to make use of them if you can.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/5p7xhu/how_do_i_stay_optimistic_in_a_world_filled_with/dcpc8zn/"}
