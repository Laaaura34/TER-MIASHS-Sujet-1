Especially as I am also working in the themed entertainment industry... and as I kept looking at your picture I realized that the console you are working was my very first design.\n\nPrior to this I had been working on the Shuttle program and transitioning to the Constellation program when it all ended. My wife also decided that this would be the be the time to leave. The next 2 years I physically existed but not much else. Right when I was about to accept the fact I would lose anything remaining in my life, my previous boss who I had not kept in touch with, referred me to his neighbor who worked at an engineering firm developing theme park rides. I got the call and gave it a shot. \n\nFast forward to today, I still carry those dark 2 years with me, but it becomes more distant each day. Primarily due to a relationship with a girl at work who I have been seeing for over 3 years now and has brought light back into my life.\n\nSeeing this post and picture of how genuinely  happy you are to bring others happiness is beautiful and I am blessed I could play a part in your story. I will have to think of your story any time I feel my contribution is of no value in this world. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8hxuph/obsessed_with_theme_parks_my_whole_life_my_dream/dyo7fqk/"}
