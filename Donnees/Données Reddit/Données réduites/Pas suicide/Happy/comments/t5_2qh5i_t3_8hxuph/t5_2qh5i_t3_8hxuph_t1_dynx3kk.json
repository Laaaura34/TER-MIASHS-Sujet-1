Like if there was a button, I wanted to push it. My first job was at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, and spent 3 summers working concessions, going to the park on my free time, etc.\n\nI used to love standing in line and just watching the ride operators go through their checks, and when all was ready \"toot toot... Kachunk\" and away went another train of happy park goers.\n\nNever did the ride operator thing, but sometimes I feel like to think that when I retire, if I ever wanted to do something fun to fill up my free time, i'd take another summer gig as a ride operator.\n\nGreat photo, you really do live up to this subreddits namesake.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8hxuph/obsessed_with_theme_parks_my_whole_life_my_dream/dynx3kk/"}
