You're really making my day and making this accomplishment so much more meaningful to me.\n\nSome backstory, I've worked at Six Flags St. Louis since April of 2013. I ended up working at the front gate and Guest Relations rather than Rides, where I really wanted to work. Well now I work full time in HR, and after talking to some of the Ride Operations department management, they went out of their way to make sure I could get certified and help out down in the park sometimes (for anywhere from 2 to 10 hours a week when they need help). It's so cool to be a part of something that leaves people smiling and laughing, especially families, who can forget about their problems and just enjoy life. I know it sounds sappy, but in this case, sappy translates to happy.    \n    \nSorry for the following shameless plug, but if you live in the St. Louis area or near any other Six Flags park, you can go to www.SixFlagsJobs.com and apply for a position. Before anyone goes all \"Hail Corporate\" on me, I love working in HR because it's so cool to see everyone from age 14 to 80 getting a job and loving it. It's quite rewarding.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8hxuph/obsessed_with_theme_parks_my_whole_life_my_dream/dynbx1c/"}
