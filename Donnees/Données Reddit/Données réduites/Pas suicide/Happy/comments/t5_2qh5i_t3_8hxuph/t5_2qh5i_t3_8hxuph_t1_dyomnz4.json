I\u2019ll always remember my dad laughing during roller coasters, or my sister and I always wanting to win one of the huge toys at the arcade, or how my sister would always make me sit in the seat that got squashed on the scrambler. Passing out from exhaustion on the way home because we were too excited to sleep the night before. And of course, I\u2019ll always remember how epic the Batman ride is, and Mr Freeze, and how my heart would pound as I got closer and closer to the front of the line! How awesome that you help create memories that we hold onto our whole lives. Thank you.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/8hxuph/obsessed_with_theme_parks_my_whole_life_my_dream/dyomnz4/"}
