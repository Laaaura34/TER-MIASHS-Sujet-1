In the past I\u2019ve used As I Am Coconut co-wash, DevaCurl NoPoo, and Mo Know Hair co-wash. \n\nAs I Am made my scalp a bit itchy but was otherwise fine, has a mild scent and is available at many common stores in the US like Target or Rite-Aid. The Mo Knows Hair product works but has a very strong smell - it\u2019s pleasant, but strong. DevaCurl NoPoo is decent and has a mild scent, but I only use it as a backup for when I run out of Aveda, which is definitely the most expensive of any product listed here, but also the most gentle and effective. I think the Aveda scent is lovely and subtle but others find it too strong.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ociugo/coming_out_of_quarantine_happy_and_healthy/h3xala7/"}
