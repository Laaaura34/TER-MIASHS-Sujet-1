Curly hair is NOT the same as straight hair and often needs different products to be healthy and look good. I have wavy hair and use co-wash on my scalp only (not 2-1 shampoo/conditioner, but a conditioning wash) that is a shampoo alternative. It cleans your hair without stripping it completely of oils. Then I use a curl-specific conditioner on the lengths. It's made all the difference for my hair, but everyone has a unique situation going on, so it's good to learn about the different product types and experiment to find out what works best for you!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ociugo/coming_out_of_quarantine_happy_and_healthy/h3v1gtl/"}
