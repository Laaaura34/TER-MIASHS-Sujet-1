Your eyes are like photocopiers, just treat them like that, as if you were taking still images, of everything you see... you\u2019ll find the images later, but it\u2019s all still very much there, your Brain acts as a filter and you can unfilter a lot of information through diligent rememberance practices. Ever have a hard test, think you know the answer? Look up and to the left, and think about what it was you were recalling, when practiced it can be like drinking from a fire hose!!!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/afyn3l/200_days_drugs_free_today_on_my_way_to_my_first/ee2rd0d/"}
