Professors are in their field to teach and/or research.  The ones who enjoy or focus on teaching are among the best teachers out there and, unlike most enthusiastic K-12 teachers, have the time and resources to really give you personal help.\n\nEventually, if you reach out to your professors, you will likely find a serious mentor who can give you incredibly good advice for this part of your life and set you along the path that is best for you.\n\nI had her read this, and she said, \"It's your network.  You start building your network with your professors, and a network is a powerful asset, personal and professional.\"", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/afyn3l/200_days_drugs_free_today_on_my_way_to_my_first/ee89iwb/"}
