As a having experienced it, I can tell you there was nothing my family could do except cut me off and hope for the best. If you've blamed yourself for one second you're wrong. And he more than likely knew you loved him.I knew my family loved me but trouble was I didn't believe I was worthy of it and didn't love myself. But I could only admit it once I had decent amount of time  away from drugs. It's a terrible disease that does not discriminate. I hope you're alright and again my deepest condolences. I love you friend, PM me anytime.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/afyn3l/200_days_drugs_free_today_on_my_way_to_my_first/ee3om7c/"}
