I got over that shit by my early 20s. Now I\u2019m addicted to hippie heroin (ketamine) and hippie crack (nitrous oxide) in my 30s. Once I kick this habit I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll fall into an ether binge. Life is hard shit sometimes. I just got over an opiate dependency from 3 months of surgery and the withdrawals nearly killed me. I fucking love being able to Lead a normal life and do crazy drugs, but at the same time it\u2019s hard to see the end. I was considering a NA meeting, but all those people don\u2019t understand the same drugs that I am into. Not to mention this Jesus 12 step stuff is kind of ridiculous imo. Either way I love life, but am afraid of what the future holds for me at times. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/afyn3l/200_days_drugs_free_today_on_my_way_to_my_first/ee2lwjo/"}
