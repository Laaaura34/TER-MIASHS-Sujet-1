So proud of you!\n\nBy the way, if it gets tough further down the line and you don't know what to do,  or just need to talk with someone, you can PM me. I can't promise I'll talk much or reply fast, or indeed that anything I might say would be of any use to you (and I am not a therapist) but I can listen if you just need to vent to just one internet stranger. \n\nBest of luck!\n", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/afyn3l/200_days_drugs_free_today_on_my_way_to_my_first/ee2qdqu/"}
