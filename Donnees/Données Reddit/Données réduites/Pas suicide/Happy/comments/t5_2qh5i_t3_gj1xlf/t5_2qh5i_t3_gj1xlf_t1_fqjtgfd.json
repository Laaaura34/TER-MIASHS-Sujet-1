My mom took him to his pediatrician who diagnosed it as a STD!! my little brother had never had any sexual contact of any kind and my mom had a private talk with him to make sure. Well the antibiotics that his doc prescribed obviously did no good and it got so bad that he had to have an emergency amputation. He has a prosthetic now but I have always felt so bad for him. His doctor retired shortly after that and my brother didn\u2019t want to file a lawsuit because he didn\u2019t want to testify.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/gj1xlf/yesterday_reddit_saved_my_brothers_balls/fqjtgfd/"}
