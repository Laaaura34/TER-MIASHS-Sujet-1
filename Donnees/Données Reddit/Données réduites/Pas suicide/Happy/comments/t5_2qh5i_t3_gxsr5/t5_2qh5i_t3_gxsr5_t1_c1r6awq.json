That's wonderful!\n\nI had to cut off all contact with my father 14 years ago. He hurt both my mother and step-mother physically. Like your father he was adept at convincing people he was a saint and always the wronged party. He didn't follow me around (he didn't care enough frankly) but he constantly bad-mouthed me to his side of the family. Most of his side of the family still won't talk to me, but I'm willing to pay that price to not have to deal with him.\n\nHe's never even met my husband of ten years, and I'm happy about that!\n\nYou have my every sympathy and a ton of well-wishes. What you're doing is incredibly hard, but so, so very worth it!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/gxsr5/finally_stopped_letting_my_father_control_my_life/c1r6awq/"}
