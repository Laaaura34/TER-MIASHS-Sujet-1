I'm 23 now, but I recognise what you're saying from when I was just starting college.\n\nI feel low whenever I have too much time doing nothing. Summer holidays have always been difficult for that reason, particularly the ones between school, college, and uni because everyone I knew scattered.   \n   I find it helps to give yourself things to do every day, like gong for a walk to explore bits of your area you haven't explored before, out getting a bus to explore somewhere else. Find something that's going on in the evenings that you can join in with. Make a point of noticing the small good things around you. You know you'll be busy when you get to college, or when you find work, but it's a good habit to get into to have something you'll do if you're stuck doing nothing. I'm bad at it, but I always feel better when I remember.\n\nI hope that helps :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/3evjv7/tips_to_staying_happy/ctisbzs/"}
