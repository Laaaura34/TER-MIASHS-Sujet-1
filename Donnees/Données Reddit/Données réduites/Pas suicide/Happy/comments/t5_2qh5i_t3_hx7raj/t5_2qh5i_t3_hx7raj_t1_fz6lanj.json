Postponing was SO emotional and hard at the time. \n\nBut I loved this. It was all about us. Just us. No family or friends to complicate things or put on a show for, no fuss over hair or makeup or flowers. In that moment we were the only two people in the universe saying those vows to each other and it was incredibly special. I will cherish it for the  rest of my life. Then I get to do it AGAIN next year for everyone else! Can\u2019t wait :)\n\nIf you ever need to talk just pm me", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/hx7raj/today_my_fianc\u00e9_and_i_had_a_courthouse_ceremony/fz6lanj/"}
