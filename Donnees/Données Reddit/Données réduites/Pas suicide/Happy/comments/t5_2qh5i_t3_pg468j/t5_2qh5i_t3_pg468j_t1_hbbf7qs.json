Our son didn\u2019t start really smiling till one month, and at first just the corners of his mouth. Then at month 2 after mastering smiling, he\u2019s starting to squeal and make happy noises especially when we talk to him. The happy noises are just so amazing and fill my heart with so much happiness! Congratulations OP!\n\nHello Elijah! Welcome to the world, little guy!
