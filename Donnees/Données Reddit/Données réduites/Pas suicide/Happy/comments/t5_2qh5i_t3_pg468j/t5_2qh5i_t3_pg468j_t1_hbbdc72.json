When you go home you will not want to set him down. Or stop kissing his head. He is the new King of your Home. He will announce his needs with one sound, crying. \n\nHungry, cry. \n\nSad, cry. \n\nDirty diaper, cry. \n\nHappy, not cry.\n\nThankfully, as parents we learn that there are different cries for each of them. But for the first 3-4 weeks (or longer) all it sounds like is crying. Always assume that he is hungry when crying. Then check the diaper. Then give hugs and kisses. In order. Worked well for our two.\n\nMay you live well and be happy.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/pg468j/my_reason_to_be_happy_today_is_my_son_was_born/hbbdc72/"}
