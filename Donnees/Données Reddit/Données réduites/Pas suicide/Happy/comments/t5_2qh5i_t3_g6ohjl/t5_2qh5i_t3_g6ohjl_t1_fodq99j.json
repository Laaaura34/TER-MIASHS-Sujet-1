I feel like I\u2019m in a movie right now. This morning before 6, I jumped out of bed knowing something was wrong. I ran into the bathroom and I saw blood, a lot of blood. It\u2019s not a good sign. \n\nI\u2019m sitting in the ER waiting to get an ultrasound to make sure this is not an ectopic pregnancy, but the amount of blood tells me that this pregnancy is no way viable. It\u2019s really devastating and heartbreaking. \n\nI know the risk going into the process, broke everything down into numbers, and did everything right in my best ability, but nature has its way and even with advanced medical science, no one can prevent the inevitable.\n\nThank you everyone for your good wishes and positive vibe. I truly did feel happy, even just for one night.\n\n[final update]\nIt\u2019s confirmed that this pregnancy is not viable, but my condition is stable. Almost one in four women lose their first pregnancy, It\u2019s devastating but I know there wasn\u2019t much anyone could have done. Thank you all for the support, it helps so much and I will still appreciate my short lived pregnancy happiness.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/g6ohjl/after_struggling_with_infertility_for_six_years/fodq99j/"}
