And remember that interviews that don't lead to getting the job are not rejections of you as a person. I've interviewed really nice, qualified people and not hired them because they just wouldn't be as good a fit as another applicant. (For example, trying to keep a balance of extroverted & introverted people on a team and applicant would have skewed the balance.) I hope you get the job of your dreams very soon! \ud83d\ude42", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/bicpkh/update_went_to_my_first_job_interview_whilst/elzueqm/"}
