Clearly you don't know what it's like to bring a little human into this world after feeling them grow inside of you or your spouse for all those months, only to be told that there's something wrong with them. For OP, this little nugget is the most beautiful sight in the world.  I don't see some*thing* \"mutated\", I see a cute little someone with beautiful big eyes and chubby cheeks that I want to pinch.  I see a face that's not going to put up with the shit that people like you are going to throw at him.\n\nOP, congrats on your little dude. He's awesome.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1g3eec/we_finally_get_to_take_this_little_guy_home_on/cagl69v/"}
