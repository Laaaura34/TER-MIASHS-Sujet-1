They\u2019re both in high school now and are typical teenage boys. They\u2019re a lovely family. I don\u2019t know the context of your worries and I don\u2019t have kids yet but I wanted to let you know there are people who adopt older children and it doesn\u2019t change that they\u2019re family. I am sure it will be a challenge but you\u2019ve wanted this and you\u2019re excited and you\u2019re ready - I am so excited for you! You\u2019ll be amazing parents!!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/fu83fz/we_mailed_our_first_care_package_to_the_little/fmdc9oo/"}
