One day I made an Aldi run between my two jobs and had to put back a bottle of $2 wine because I went over what I could afford and an older woman behind me told the cashier to put it into my cart and just start scanning her items, she'd pay for mine. I asked if she was sure and she told me that she didn't think anyone who worked until their shoes had holes should be denied a glass of wine. I thanked her and used the money to buy new work shoes. I still think about that lady and hope she's doing well because she really helped me at a low point.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/kgfb1j/an_older_couple_just_walked_by_the_store_i_work/ggeqww1/"}
