I'm a parent of a little girl and I've experienced loss (although not nearly as traumatic).  Your story of losing yours made me cry more than I have in a long time.I just want you to know that I'm so happy that you could recover from something like that and find reasons to be happy.  And that your little girl won't be forgotten.  I'll be thinking about her every time I'm frustrated or tired and I'll never take my child for granted.  \n\n\nEdit: Also I want to add that if you ever want to talk about your daughter at any point, I'd love to hear about her.  I know that people in our lives give us a limited time for when it's \"acceptable\" to grieve, and after that it's harder and harder to talk about it if you need to.  I know I'm just an internet stranger, but this topic is close to my heart and I care.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/86t3w7/she_turned_4_years_old_this_week_and_for_having/e5c7bbg/"}
