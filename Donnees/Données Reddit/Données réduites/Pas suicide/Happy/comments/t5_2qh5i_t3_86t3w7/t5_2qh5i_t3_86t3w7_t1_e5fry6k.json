I thrive most days, but in my moments where the sadness comes crashing down, I can feel those around me tense up.  No one wants to face my reality, no one wants to talk about a dead baby, there really aren't any words to make it better and that makes everyone feel uncomfortable. \nThank you for reaching out, it means more than I can even describe. You are so very kind <3", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/86t3w7/she_turned_4_years_old_this_week_and_for_having/e5fry6k/"}
