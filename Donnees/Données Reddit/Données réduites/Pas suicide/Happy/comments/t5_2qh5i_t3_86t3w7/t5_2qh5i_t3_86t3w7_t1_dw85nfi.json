I am so sorry for what you\u2019ve been through, I can\u2019t even imagine the despair and hurt that you must\u2019ve gone through, I\u2019m really sorry. You two are really strong for being able to smile after such tragedy but there is always a silver lining to every dark cloud and it seems like you two have definitely found yours and that\u2019s awesome! Don\u2019t let those smiles ever fade away and cherish them everyday cuz its one of the most important things you know?\n\nI hope and pray you two will always be each other\u2019s pillars that keep you up.
