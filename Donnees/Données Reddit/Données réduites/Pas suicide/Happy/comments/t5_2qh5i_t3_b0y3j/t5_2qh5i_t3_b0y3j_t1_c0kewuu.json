I remember sitting by my grandma C when she was dying of cancer and singing to her. It was really hard to get through that song, but I'm glad I did. Though it is sad to lose someone you love and some of the sadness never goes away, I am thankful to have had them in my life at all and happy to have had good relationships with them.
