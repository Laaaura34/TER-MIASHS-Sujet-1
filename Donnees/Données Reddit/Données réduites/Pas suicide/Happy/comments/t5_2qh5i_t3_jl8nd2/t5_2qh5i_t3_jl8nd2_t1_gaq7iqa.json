Thought I\u2019d be single for the rest of my life. I was content on my own.\n\nAnd then, one day out of the freaking blue, a guy I played D&D with as a kid got in touch with me. He was going to be in town for a convention and wanted to reconnect. So we went out for dinner. \n\nThat was over a year ago. We\u2019ve been together since that night and are engaged. My whole world changed in a single night. \n\nNow every day brings me joy. I love that man more than I ever thought possible and I know he feels the same way. We are soulmates. He told me he knew we were made for each other when I stepped out of the car and said hello. He was right, too!\n\nTLDR: Never say never.
