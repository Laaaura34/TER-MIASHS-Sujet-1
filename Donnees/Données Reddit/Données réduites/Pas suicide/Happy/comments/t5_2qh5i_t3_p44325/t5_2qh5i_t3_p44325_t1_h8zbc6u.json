You can be her friend when she is an adult. As an educator, I see a lot of young moms want to be their child\u2019s best friend-it leads to lack of boundaries and a child that rules the household. Children thrive on structure-be consistent. Please read to your child too. Nursery rhymes, books, interact with her, point out things you see-use language. It makes a huge difference in their development. The brain development from birth to five years is astounding. Don\u2019t waste it by sitting her in front of a device as she grows up.  It sounds like you have a good family system and plans for the future. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/p44325/im_17_with_a_baby_and_i_have_to_say_i_am_so/h8zbc6u/"}
