I spent 2 yrs finding ways to make changes and feel better about myself. Some days I wallowed, some days I went out with my friends, and other days I spent with my family. My roommate jokes that I\u2019m a professional napper because I was always hiding in my room sleeping or watching Netflix on my computer. I met my fianc\u00e9 3yrs ago and I wasn\u2019t convinced he was actually interested in me for several months. It was hard to let him in. And it was hard to recover. But I\u2019m also a stronger person because of what I went through. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7h7tvi/struggled_for_years_with_depression_and/dqpl3lv/"}
