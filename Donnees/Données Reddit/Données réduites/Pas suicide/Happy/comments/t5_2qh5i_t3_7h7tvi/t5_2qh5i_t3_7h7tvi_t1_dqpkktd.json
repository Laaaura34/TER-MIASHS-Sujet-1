I call myself the \u201cfinder of all things\u201d since I find all of my fianc\u00e9\u2019s stuff within 2min of him losing it. He took me to this park saying his little brother had lost his wallet at a bonfire the night before. We \u201chad to find it\u201d that day because it was supposed to rain the next day and he had a lot of cash in it. Silly, I know but I believed him. We get up to this bridge and get towards the middle and he stops me. He said \u201cyou\u2019re my best friend. You\u2019re amazing and I can\u2019t imagine a life without you.\u201d Then he gets down on one knee and proposes. Little did I know, his brother (professional photographer) was hiding on the far side of the bridge and snapped the photos :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7h7tvi/struggled_for_years_with_depression_and/dqpkktd/"}
