Working in a hospital brings me close to human death almost daily. However, I believe we should be comfortable talking about it as it helps with our own personal philosophy and attitudes towards life. My connection with death has made me deeply thankful for the people in my life, and as I see with you it has made you profoundly thankful for the sustenance these animals provide for you. Thanks for the long answer, I sincerely wish you all the best.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/iywdeo/oma_seemed_like_she_was_having_pregnancy/g6ibnbr/"}
