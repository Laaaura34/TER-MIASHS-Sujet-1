It reminded me of the first year my husband and I were married. We were so broke, and when we could scrape together enough spare change, literally coins, to spend $5 on wine, we\u2019d trek through the ice and snow to the liquor store and get this one bottle of Centine that we thought was SO good and underpriced. That wine tasted better than any bottle of champagne I can afford to splurge for today. And it\u2019s not lol.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about that. Not snacks, but connection. Safety. Caring. Sharing whatever we have. Doesn\u2019t matter what it is, but unfortunately in our society, the more we have, it seems the less we want to share.\n\nMeanwhile, every abuser and cheater and misogynist in the world knows that we *want* jewelry and cars and expensive vacations and APOLOGIES. But you know what we *deserve*? A relationship that doesn\u2019t require constant apologies. That\u2019s what we\u2019re appreciating here.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/py9gg1/i_dont_have_much_but_today_i_made_enough_to_buy/hewxmzy/"}
