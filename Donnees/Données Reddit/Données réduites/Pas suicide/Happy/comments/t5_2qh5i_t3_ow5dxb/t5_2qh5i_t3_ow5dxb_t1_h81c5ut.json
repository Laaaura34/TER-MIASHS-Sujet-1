You're 17 and you already have things figured out, you're happy and somebody wants to be with you. I'm 25, there's a big difference. The fact that I haven't figured anything out at this age or found anyone who wasn't repulsed by the idea of being with me tells me at this point I never will. It's too late, I am an ugly, worthless person inside and out and nothing is going to change that. Have fun, don't ever take for granted what you have now because there are rare people out there like me that this stuff is off limits to. I know that the DM thing is just to make yourself look good in these comments so I'm not going to message and be ignored again, sorry", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ow5dxb/ive_been_dating_a_guy_for_a_whole_month_ive_only/h81c5ut/"}
