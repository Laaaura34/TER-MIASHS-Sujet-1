You definitely spoke to my current situation perfectly.  I\u2019ve been working on getting sober for over a year now with many, many failures in-between.\n\nI used to drink almost everyday, and slowly I\u2019ve built up tolerance to 2 days in a row, to 3, 4, etc. Last month I finally made it a full 30 days.  The hardest part for me is not self-sabotaging once I hit a decent milestone.  There\u2019s a lot of trauma that I haven\u2019t fully healed from, so when I get in a toxic mindset, all I want to do is self-destruct. \n\nCurrently I\u2019m on Day 10.  I\u2019m struggling with the idea of NEVER drinking again.  Like even when I was \u201cbad\u201d, my rock bottom is very high-functioning.   I know I need to quit drinking though, because it makes my mental health plummet.  I\u2019m looking forward to someday getting to experience all the benefits you mentioned. \n\nThanks for being someone I can look towards for inspiration.  A year seems so far away at this point.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cysbca/18_months_sober_from_alcohol_and_cocaine_today_i/eywu3tz/"}
