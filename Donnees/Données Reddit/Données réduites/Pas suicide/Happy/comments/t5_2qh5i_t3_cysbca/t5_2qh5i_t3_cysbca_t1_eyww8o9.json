Cleaning my house, working out, doing yard work, projects, working on goals I have, and DOING THINGS FOR OTHER PEOPLE haha I love helping people now, it\u2019s the best. They feel good, I feel good, we all feel good haha and as far as relationships go... they\u2019re more real than they\u2019ve ever been. People trust me and can count on me now. My words have weight with people now, and that feels really fucking good because when I was an alcoholic I was completely unreliable and full of bullshit 99.9% of the time. As far as romantic relationships go... this is the first time in my life I get to be picky about who I want to be with. I used to just cling onto whoever would put up with my shit. Now I know my worth and I\u2019m waiting on someone special to share good times with. Hope that helps!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cysbca/18_months_sober_from_alcohol_and_cocaine_today_i/eyww8o9/"}
