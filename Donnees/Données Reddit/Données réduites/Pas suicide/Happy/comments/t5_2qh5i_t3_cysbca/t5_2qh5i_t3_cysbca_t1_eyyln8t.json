I\u2019m blown away by all the love. Thank you so sooo much. All this kindness really means a lot to me (and a lot of the sarcastic jabs were hilarious too). I\u2019m slowly but surely writing everyone back that has reached out about getting sober. Feel free to hit me up if you wanna know how I quit. I love talking about the psychology surrounding drugs and alcohol and I would love to help anyone who is thinking about quitting. I\u2019m not an expert but I\u2019ve tried and failed so many times at this sobriety thing that I\u2019ve gained a lot of knowledge over the years. Aka I won\u2019t just give you cheap cliche advice. Thanks again everyone.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cysbca/18_months_sober_from_alcohol_and_cocaine_today_i/eyyln8t/"}
