It used to be really hard for me on Friday and Saturday nights. It was almost like there was a force trying to pull me out of the house and go get drunk. Then, when you make the decision to stay in, you start to feel sorry for yourself and you get depressed. It sucks. \n\nAll I can tell you is that it gets easier and easier with time. This is gonna sound cliche but I can honestly say that it\u2019s soooooo much better waking up early, happy, and healthy (and not hungover) on a Saturday morning and enjoying life now. I\u2019d take my early mornings over a drunk night any day of the week. \n\nI\u2019ll be straight up with you, the first 12 months sucks. It sucks bad. That\u2019s why most people don\u2019t make it through the first year. But if you can just bite the bullet for the first 12 months, it pays off ten fold. Your heart and mind will start to fill up with a peace and serenity you\u2019ve never felt before and your life begins to be \u2018joyful\u2019 rather than just \u2018pleasurable\u2019. I wish the best for you, I really do. Feel free to dm me if you\u2019d like to know more. Good luck!!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cysbca/18_months_sober_from_alcohol_and_cocaine_today_i/eyvxxyv/"}
