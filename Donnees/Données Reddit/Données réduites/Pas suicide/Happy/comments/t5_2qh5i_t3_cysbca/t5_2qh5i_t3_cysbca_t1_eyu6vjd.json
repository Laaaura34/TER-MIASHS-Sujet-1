It\u2019s the most important thing you can do in your life. Then I made the commitment to make short term sacrifices that would benefit me in the long run (if you think about it, drugs are a short term pleasure that sacrifice the long run. So I made it a rule to do the opposite of that. Think about saving money for example, it\u2019s a sacrifice in the short term but benefits you over the long run. And finally once I had some sober time under my belt, I made the commitment to live by goals that I\u2019ve set for myself. I\u2019m always moving forward now and aiming upward. My life is filled with more meaning and purpose than I ever imagined. Whether you decide to keep using drugs or you decide to quit, both roads are hard. Life is hard. But making a commitment to pull yourself out of the hell you\u2019ve created turns you into a resilient person. And resilience through the game of life feels really fucking good. Best of luck to you.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cysbca/18_months_sober_from_alcohol_and_cocaine_today_i/eyu6vjd/"}
