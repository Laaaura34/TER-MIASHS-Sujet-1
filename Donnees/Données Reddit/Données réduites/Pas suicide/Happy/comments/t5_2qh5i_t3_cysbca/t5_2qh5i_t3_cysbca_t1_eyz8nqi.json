I it\u2019s not what you wanna hear right now but the first 6 months are uncomfortable, boring, lackluster, bland, and overall you\u2019ll just kinda feel like shit. In addition to those fun things, you\u2019ll also have bouts of depression, loneliness, anger, frustration, and you\u2019ll feel sorry for yourself a lot. You\u2019ll feel left out, like everyone on earth is having a great time except for you. AND if you\u2019re doing it right, you\u2019ll feel a deep and present guilt about how shitty you\u2019ve treated everyone in your life up until this point. It sucks. But you can do it. \n\nI will make you one very big promise: you\u2019re discipline through this tough time will be rewarded. Things will start to get better. You\u2019ll slowly start to feel better. Good coincidences may start to happen that you weren\u2019t expecting (don\u2019t rule out the possibility that these coincidences may be coming from something spiritual that wants you to succeed). Set some goals and work on them when you feel up to it. Do as much as you possibly can for other people (start with family members) it\u2019ll make you happy and it\u2019ll make the people you help out happy too. Make it a rule to do something nice for someone you love every day. It\u2019s a great thing to do and a good way to fill up time you\u2019d otherwise spend feeling sorry for yourself. Slowly slowly slowly but surely things will get better and one day you\u2019ll realize that you have new peace inside that you\u2019ve never felt before. That peace will continue to grow and turn into joy. And that joy will foster itself into a deep contentment. \n\nIt all starts with discipline. It\u2019s a sacrifice, and sacrifices are hard. You\u2019ll see later that it\u2019s the pain in life that makes you grow, and you\u2019ll realize that\u2019s a beautiful thing. I wish you the best of luck. You can do this! You owe it to yourself and the people around you! You\u2019re life can become better than you can even imagine. I wish you peace and sobriety my friend.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cysbca/18_months_sober_from_alcohol_and_cocaine_today_i/eyz8nqi/"}
