When I met my wife she was a party girl whereas I had stopped drinking altogether.  I fully believed it wouldn't work out because I didn't want to drink and party on the weekends but I thought that's what she liked to do.  \n\nI didn't compromise and start going out with her on weekends, instead staying true to myself and told her I didn't drink and instead spent my weekends outside, camping/fishing/hiking/adventuring etc.  As it turned out she actually didn't want to be partying but was doing it because that's what everyone did - she actually wanted to be doing those things I was doing but she had no one to do them with.  Now married with a couple of kids.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/cysbca/18_months_sober_from_alcohol_and_cocaine_today_i/eyurno0/"}
