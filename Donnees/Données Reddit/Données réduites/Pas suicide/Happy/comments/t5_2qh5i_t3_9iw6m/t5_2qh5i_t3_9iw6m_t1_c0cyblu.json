Animal-based therapy can be so useful and restorative for people who have never had good models of personal responsibility or caretaking.  Puppies cry when they're hungry, show affection regardless of socioeconomic status, and live so in the moment -- they teach responsibility and discipline.\n\nThese programs are important to rehab the dogs, sure, but definitely the people.  Especially when they're being promoted to act as service dogs -- those dogs are amazing animals and their disabled owners are unbelievably grateful.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9iw6m/puppies_behind_bars_innovative_program_pairs/c0cyblu/"}
