My eye doctors always test and check to see if it\u2019s impairing my vision which it\u2019s not, even though I do wear contacts (unrelated). Most just call it a birthmark. All throughout elementary school kids would tease me about it and one substitute teacher freaked out yelling, \u201cYour eye is bleeding!\u201d which it very much was not! Maybe it\u2019s a result of my father\u2019s brown eyes mixing with my mother\u2019s green eyes? Mine are listed as hazel on my drivers license. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that\u2019s not a lot of helpful information, just all I could think of to describe it. :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/afsrva/today_i_turned_30_and_had_the_best_birthday/ee60r7c/"}
