My first host family seems really nice and personable but I've heard plenty of stories from returning exchange students who had absent parents, siblings who saw them as competition, and just poor attitudes in general. But then again, I believe that's because Indonesia has a direct exchange policy, that is if your kid is going abroad then you are a host family. So not all of them may be up for it really. Best of luck with your new son or daughter, the experience will be great for all of you.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1j73ou/got_to_video_chat_with_our_soontobe_exchange/cbbzl6p/"}
