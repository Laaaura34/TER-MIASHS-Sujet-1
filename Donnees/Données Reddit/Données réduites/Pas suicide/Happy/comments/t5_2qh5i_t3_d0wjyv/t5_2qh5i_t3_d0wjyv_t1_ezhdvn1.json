I have some advice learned from two babies. 1. Be kind to yourself, never stand when you can sit, never sit when you can lie and never stay awake when you can sleep. 2. When they are crying for no reason, generally being fussy and you feel yourself getting annoyed ( sleep deprivation is no joke!), don't be scared to put her down somewhere safe and just step away for five minutes. It's truly amazing for much they pick up from you and taking a few minutes out will help you both calm down.\nThese are two pointers I wish I knew when I first had my two so I hope I don't offend by offering them to you. Best of luck to your lovely family.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/d0wjyv/after_two_miscarriages_fertility_doctors_and/ezhdvn1/"}
