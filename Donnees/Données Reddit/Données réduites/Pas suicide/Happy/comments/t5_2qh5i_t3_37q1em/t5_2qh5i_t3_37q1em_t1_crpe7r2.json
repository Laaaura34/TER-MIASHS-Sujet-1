You used to be able to get them for not too much money at places like WalMart. I keep all my important things in there that either can't be replaced or would be a nightmare to replace like my birth cirtificate, car title, SSN card, etc. That way even in the event of a natural disaster, my stuff is safe. I think everyone should have this however I do **not** think that you should let anyone else know how to open it - even a family member or spouse. I liked the idea of taking a few hundred dollars when I had some spare cash and starting an engagement ring fund in my fire-proof safe. \n\nI never in a million years would have thought my girlfriend at the time, who I wanted to marry, would have gone through my closet and opened that to steal the money I was saving to buy her a ring. I also never would have thought that she would have seen me enter my PIN while buying groceries and steal my debit card while I was sleeping to steal money from my account. Live and learn I suppose and it's kind of fucked up that it still affects how I treat all people including SOs to this day. Even if I married the love of my life tomorrow, shared finances are never a thing that will be in my future and I will never feel open to trust someone in my home or with my most personal belongings/secrets/emotions again.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/37q1em/today_after_years_of_skimping_and_saving_i/crpe7r2/"}
