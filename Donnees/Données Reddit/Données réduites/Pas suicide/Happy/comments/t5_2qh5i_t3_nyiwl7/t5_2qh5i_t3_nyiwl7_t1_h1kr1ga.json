My dog gets distracted easily so doesn't stick to the path and I have to work hard to get the dog back on track. This means I might miss things that are on the path but the bonus is that I also might see things that others don't. Eventually we get to the same destination however it took me longer and I had to put in more effort to get there. \n\nSometimes I explain it as the stereotypical ADHD child running around (the hyperactive type) is happening inside my head. \n\nGood on you for getting your diagnosis and for getting your room looking so fabulous!\n\nIs that a cat bed I spy?", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/nyiwl7/i_was_diagnosed_with_adhd_this_week_and_started/h1kr1ga/"}
