Someone like a foreman in a auto repair shop. You maintain the list of tasks he needs to complete. You check them off. You give him the next task. You  will be amazed at how much he can accomplish. \n\nRealize that he is going to flit around like a bird. Use that to your/his advantage. I may be walking past the pool during a task and notice the water color isn't quite right.  The pool is on my list of tasks. So when I get done getting the pool chemistry right my wife may have to remind me of the task I was on prior to getting distracted. If the chicken I chase is not on the list of tasks; my wife will let me know this so I can change my focus back to the task at hand. But I know that the distraction  is being put on the list (by my wife)  so I can put it out of my mind (unlikely) or let the thought of it keep my mind occupied while I take care of the task at hand. Don't expect him to make or maintain a list. That just won't work. \n\nI am a mechanic by trade. It's a great profession for various levels of ADHD. There is always something different to do and things to learn. Plus one can make buckets of money doing it.  Not sure if your husband is in a field that takes advantage of his condition but that is important.  \n\nHope this helps\n\nJohn", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/nyiwl7/i_was_diagnosed_with_adhd_this_week_and_started/h1nog2y/"}
