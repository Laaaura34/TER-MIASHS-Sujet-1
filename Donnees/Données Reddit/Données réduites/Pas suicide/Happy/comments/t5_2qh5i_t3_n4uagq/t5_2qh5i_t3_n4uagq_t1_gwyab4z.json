Rant, you don\u2019t have to read. ADHD does not go \u201caway\u201d when we grow up.   I think! The book is called \u201cliving with adhd\u201d about adults who are finally treated.  Advice:  never ever look back at what you could have been, when you find out in the next 5-6 years how capable you are.  No changing the past.  You will still get depressed and have \u201cthoughts,\u201d but you will be able to walk to the kitchen and not forget why you went there, or finish cleaning an entire area before moving in.  Life will only get better, but you are still you inside, good and bad, so focus on healing yourself and forgiving yourself.  You are not dumb, you are the smartest ever!  DM me if you ever need to talk.  We are a lot alike.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n4uagq/i_just_took_adhd_medication_after_23_years_of/gwyab4z/"}
