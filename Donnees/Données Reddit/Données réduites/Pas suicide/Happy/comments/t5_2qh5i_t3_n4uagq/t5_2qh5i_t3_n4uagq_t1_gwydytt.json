So happy for you!! I said this in an earlier comment, but I've heard some doctors can even prescribe you a \"trial run\" of just a couple weeks worth of ADHD meds, without having to give you a formal diagnosis. (Not sure if this is true everywhere). I've heard in some areas the \"official\" adhd test is expensive, which is why some doctors do a trial run, and then if the meds help, you can sort of get an unofficial diagnosis from that. I hope everything goes well!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n4uagq/i_just_took_adhd_medication_after_23_years_of/gwydytt/"}
