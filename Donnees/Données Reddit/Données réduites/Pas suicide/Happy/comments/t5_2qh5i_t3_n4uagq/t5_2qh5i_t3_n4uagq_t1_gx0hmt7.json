I finally made it through all the hoops set up by the last doc for her to come back with \"inconclusive\". Everyone's comments about their experiences resonates with me so much. But it's like I can't describe these problems properly to convince a doc to agree to test me.  I'm truly believing the real test is if you can keep up and make it through to the end, then you're not adhd by evidence of you sticking it through.  Not that like this is so miserable and it's just that important to me that it's the one thing I try to make myself follow through.  But after 5 attempts I'm kinda despondent.  4 false starts and 1 not a no but not a yes.  What the hell do I need to do to get them to believe me.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n4uagq/i_just_took_adhd_medication_after_23_years_of/gx0hmt7/"}
