I hope it goes well!\n\nI didnt mention this in the original post, but I've actually had the medication for a couple months now. I have been warily glancing at it on my desk out of the corner of my eye every day, too terrified of taking. Idk really what I was afraid of. I guess I was either scared either 1) it wouldnt work, and I'd be left in the dark feeling hopeless, or 2) it would make me feel worse?\n\nIn hindsight, I should've just tried it sooner lol. It truly is amazing going from being incapable to get work done on monday, and then getting all my work done in a few hours, easily and HAPPILY on tuesday. Is this what it feels like to be normal?? Absolutely wild. I feel amazing.\n\nI totally understand your fear. But I'm happy my post came at such a good time!! You deserve to feel better. And always remember, if you dont get the answers you want the first try, *keep trying*. I had many doctors tell me \"sorry, I dont know whats wrong and I cant help you\" before I got to this point. Always fight for yourself. I have very recently learned that life can, in fact, get better.\n\nAgain, good luck!! And thank you :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n4uagq/i_just_took_adhd_medication_after_23_years_of/gwz7yl0/"}
