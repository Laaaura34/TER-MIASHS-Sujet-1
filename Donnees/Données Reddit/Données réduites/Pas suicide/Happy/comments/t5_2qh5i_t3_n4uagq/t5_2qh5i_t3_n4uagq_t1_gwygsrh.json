I made it through my younger years of school alright, but by the time I hit college, I started to completely crumble. (Apparently, they say that's a normal series of events for women with ADHD). I had a few college friends (who I'm no longer friends with) that liked to pick on me for being stupid. It was hard.\n\nAnd to reply to your comment of \"If this is the way the rest of the world thinks, it's no wonder I've been a shit show.\" Quite literally, I had almost that *exact* same thought this morning. Is it really this easy for everyone else?? No wonder I've been struggling so bad. For the first time ever, it felt like I could blame my failures on something besides myself and my own stupidity. \n\nYou are smart too. We *are* smart!\n\nAs someone who knows how hard it is, I am SO proud of you for making it to where you are today. And thank you so much for your reply. I just recently started using reddit but I have already had so many wonderful, heart-filling conversations with strangers. Today was a good day.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n4uagq/i_just_took_adhd_medication_after_23_years_of/gwygsrh/"}
