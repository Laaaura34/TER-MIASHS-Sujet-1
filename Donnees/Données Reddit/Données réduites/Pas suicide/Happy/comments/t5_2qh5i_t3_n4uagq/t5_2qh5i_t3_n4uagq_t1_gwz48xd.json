I\u2019m almost scared of what I\u2019m going to discover.\n\nPeople can live their lives differently than i have been? Wtf??!! Sleep ok, watch Netflix without subtitles, remember things without calendars, keep a train of thought?? No problem doing basic errands? Keep my fucking hands and legs still? It sounds surreal. \n\nIdk. Fuck I\u2019m kind of scared. In a good way. And so happy for you my friend too. The timing of this post shook me tbh LOL. I didn\u2019t even want to comment but felt i had to. That is awesome.\n\n\ud83c\udf89Congratulations\ud83c\udf89", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n4uagq/i_just_took_adhd_medication_after_23_years_of/gwz48xd/"}
