And thanks for the book recommendation. Maybe now that I have these meds I'll actually be able to make it through a book haha.\n\nYeah, it is sad to think about how much easier things could have been earlier in my life. But honestly, I'm SO grateful to finally have a light at the end of the tunnel, I'm not ever looking back. I'm young and I somehow landed a good job after college. I'm so ready to finally live my life the way I always wanted. Thank you again!!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n4uagq/i_just_took_adhd_medication_after_23_years_of/gwyhchu/"}
