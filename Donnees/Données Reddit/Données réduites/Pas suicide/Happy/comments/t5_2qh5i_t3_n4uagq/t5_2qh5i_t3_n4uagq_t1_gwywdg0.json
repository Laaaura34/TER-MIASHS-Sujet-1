As a kid, you may not have been able to notice your own mental struggles, but you did notice the side effects of the meds (and of course you'd notice other kids picking on you, which sucks). \n\nI bet I would've hated them as a kid too. But after struggling through it as an adult for YEARS, taking them is like a breath of fresh air. Maybe consider trying again? Its up to you of course. But if there's a chance you'll get better, I say give it a shot! You deserve to feel better. I wish you all the best!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n4uagq/i_just_took_adhd_medication_after_23_years_of/gwywdg0/"}
