Apprarently, teaching Pre-k is one of the top 10 jobs for people with ADHD because we are adept at switching directions in thinking, while on the fly.\n\nBeen doing that for 20 years!\n\nBut now, I know I'm smart.  I played pool on a league and would make sure I took my second med dose later on so I could get through matches and make choices about shots instead of get stuck, not be able to choose, and have massive anxiety.\n\nADHD in women is SEVERELY  underdiagnosed, so from one woman to another, KUDOS! \ud83d\ude01 You are on your way to figuring out your med levels, tolerance, and new routines with this newfound information.  Cheers to a new lens in your vision of life! \ud83c\udf7b\n\nIf you ever need support or someone to listen to you, pm me.  I understand and we all need to support one another!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n4uagq/i_just_took_adhd_medication_after_23_years_of/gwyirpu/"}
