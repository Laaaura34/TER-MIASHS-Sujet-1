Good for you!\n\nOne thought... In addition to your new med, you might also think about setting aside time like 20-30 mins a day just before bedtime to do a little guided meditation with Headspace or one you find on YouTube.\n\nMeditation helps the brain slow down by focusing on one thing, allowing it to exclude other random thoughts.  It allows the brain to rest a bit. \n\nNow that your meds are working, you might be able to help train your mind to slow down and focus more.  With the meds working, this might be the right time to try that. \n\nIf you do, just give it some time.  The benefits don't happen instantly. \n\nI'm very happy you've found something to help enhance your life!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/n4uagq/i_just_took_adhd_medication_after_23_years_of/gx0bngj/"}
