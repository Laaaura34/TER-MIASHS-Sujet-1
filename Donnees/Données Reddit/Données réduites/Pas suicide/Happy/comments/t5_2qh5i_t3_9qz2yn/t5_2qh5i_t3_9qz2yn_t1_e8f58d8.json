Congrats! I'm happy for you. I recently got help my self, i'm also 30. I started therapy at 28. I'm going through the same journey as you. I'm really happy you decided to post this because I've had the same thoughts about children and thought very negatively of marriage. I hope I can get to where you are at some point. Thanks!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9qz2yn/welcomed_our_first_kid_into_the_world_2_days_ago/e8f58d8/"}
