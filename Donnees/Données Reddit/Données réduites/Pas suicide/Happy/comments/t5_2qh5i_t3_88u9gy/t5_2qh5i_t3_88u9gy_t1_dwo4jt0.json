My wife and I tried for 3 years and finally decided to do IVF, and we are pregnant! Some things I wish I would've known... \n1) It is a LONG and emotional road. This will test your marriage. Make sure you are checking in on your wife. She is going to be going through a lot of hormonal, physical, and emotional changes.\n2) IVF is expensive (at least in the US)! and it is only the beginning step of having that baby. The clinic will charge you for every little thing beside the actual procedure (blood draws, tests, embryo/egg/sperm storage, etc) it adds up fast, and most clinics do not offer in house payments. Pay in full or talk to a high interest loan company... Ouch.\n3) ask questions! My wife and I lost our first child because we didn't do enough due diligence... Long story short we were so overwhelmed with the process we just nodded, smiled, and said, \"Yes, doctor.\" when the miscarriage could've been prevented.\n4) Kinda goes along with checking on your wife... But if the reason you can't have kids is because of your wife, she is going to feel like she is \"broken.\" reassure her that if she is broken, you are broken because you are going through this massive tribulation together...\nAfter all is said and done, and the emotional wreck my wife and I have been for years, we are scared, but SOOO excited.\n\nIf you have any questions at all I would love to talk with you more. I would love to use my experiences to help others in anyway I can. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/88u9gy/after_trying_for_years_we_finally_got_to_meet_our/dwo4jt0/"}
