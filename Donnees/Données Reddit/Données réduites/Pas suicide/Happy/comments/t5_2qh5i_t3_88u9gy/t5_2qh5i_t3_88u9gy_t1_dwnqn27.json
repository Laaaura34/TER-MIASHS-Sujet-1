Don't be discouraged if you don't matter to the baby for the first 6 months.  It happens.  Mommy and baby just spent a long time as one, so it can take a while to get on that level.  My first was worse about it than the second.  Your primary job is to make sure mommy is well taken care of because she is going to be worrying about the baby full time. \n\nHave fun, though. Craziest ride of your life.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/88u9gy/after_trying_for_years_we_finally_got_to_meet_our/dwnqn27/"}
