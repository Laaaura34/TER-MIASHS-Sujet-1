Med school was tough but this was beyond limits. Supporting a person who blames herself for the pain and suffering we were going through, although I assured her that I knew it wasn\u2019t her fault, since we started dating she came clean and told me about it, and told me that it was OK if I didn\u2019t want to stick around. \n\nWe stayed, we fought and we conquered and 2 weeks ago we took our firstborn (now 7) to get his lip stitched because of an accident.\n\nAnd this is a lesson: you fought for them, gave it all you had for them. Don\u2019t neglect them but don\u2019t smother them. Kids will be kids and they can take a lot. They are not as helpless as they seem and they are not as fragile as they seem. LET THEM BE KIDS!!!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/88u9gy/after_trying_for_years_we_finally_got_to_meet_our/dwnvmmc/"}
