We applied for a foster care license, invested in improving our home to pass certification, took classes for a year, went through background checks and then scheduled our interview for the foster to adopt program in our County. We weren\u2019t able to have a child placed in our home because my wife became pregnant in the later stages of completing the program (final interview with a social worker). It was an extremely difficult decision to pause the foster-to-adopt program but financially and emotionally, we only have bandwidth for one child at a time. At the end of the day, we are happy. I hope that you can say the same. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/88u9gy/after_trying_for_years_we_finally_got_to_meet_our/dwoasp5/"}
