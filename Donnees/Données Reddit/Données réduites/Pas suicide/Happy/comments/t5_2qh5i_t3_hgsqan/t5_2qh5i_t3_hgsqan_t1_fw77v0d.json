Like the time he threw a fit so bad outside of Pelican\u2019s Snoballs because I wouldn\u2019t let him play in the very busy parking lot. We were with friends, but we had to leave early. And yes, there are times when it would be great to be able to take off for the week or even a weekend and go on a trip with my wife without having to figure out care for him.\n\nThere\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with choosing not to have kids, but for me, I always knew I wanted to be a dad. That was the path I chose, and I love it. When I\u2019m working in the yard and I get out my shovel, he has to get out the little spade that he calls \u201chis\u201d shovel to help me dig. If I spit, he spits. He wants to do whatever I\u2019m doing. He\u2019s my little shadow.
