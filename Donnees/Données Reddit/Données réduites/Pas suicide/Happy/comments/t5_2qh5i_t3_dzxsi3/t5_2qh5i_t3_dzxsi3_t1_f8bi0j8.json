I am sure you have gotten a ton of advice about babies but I will give mine.\n\nAll that really matters is the first week with the new baby.  The problem is that it is new and you will worry about everything.  You will get little to no sleep.  You will be barely functional.  After a week the baby will not change, you will.  You will not freak out over every cry the baby makes and just be able to change diapers, feed, etc.\n\nSo for the first week you want lots of prepared food for yourself that you can just heat up and eat at any hour of the day or night.  Only have people over who will help - do not have guests who will just take up your time and energy.  And if you have helpers come over - have them take the baby.  You will feel better if you can shower, do some cleaning, and just do something besides sit and hold the baby.\n\nAnd take lots of pictures and videos.  The best pictures and videos are the ones of normal life, not special events.  The stuffed animal they love, the park they play in, the things that make up their life.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/dzxsi3/im_back_to_work_today_and_im_rested_happy_and/f8bi0j8/"}
