Multiple times girls have looked at me and treated me like I was a baby, because, well, I'm the \"aww\" type and not the handsome type. I watch the girl I love forget about me more and more and hang with other guys, and if I was to talk to her anyways what chance do I have? My life hasn't exactly been good and she's the only thing I'm living for. I'm lost.\n\nI'm happy for you though, man!
