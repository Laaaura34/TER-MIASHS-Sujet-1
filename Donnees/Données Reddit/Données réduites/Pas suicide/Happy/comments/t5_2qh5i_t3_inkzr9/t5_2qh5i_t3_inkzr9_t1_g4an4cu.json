I remember my grandfather threatening\nto rub dog shit on my fingers if I didn\u2019t stop chewing my nails when I was\n about 6. Didn\u2019t phase me. Still struggle with it. My advice, keep your\nnails trimmed super short, do it every few days, get the edges and \ncorners. It is a great feeling to not have bleeding cuticles and horrible\nlooking nails. Also covid has me being very careful!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/inkzr9/after_30_years_of_nail_biting_to_the_nub_this_is/g4an4cu/"}
