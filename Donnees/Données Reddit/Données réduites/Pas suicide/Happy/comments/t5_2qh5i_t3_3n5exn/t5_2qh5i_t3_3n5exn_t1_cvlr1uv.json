Go for it, make a video, even if you think it sucks, go for it. After posting my first YouTube video, I became a completely different person the moment I hit publish video. When you put yourself out there for the world to see you, you become more raw and transparent, and your heart is clearly calling you in that direction. Look forward to seeing your videos, much love and blessings :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/3n5exn/overcoming_my_fears_in_life_makes_me_a_happier/cvlr1uv/"}
