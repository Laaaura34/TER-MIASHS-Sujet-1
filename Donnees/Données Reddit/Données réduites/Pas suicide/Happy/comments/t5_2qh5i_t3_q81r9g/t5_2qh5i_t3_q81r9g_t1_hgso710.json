But it didn\u2019t always come with blood, it was just a LOT of pain. This started October 2009. Went to the ER twice and they said UTI or constipation. Fast forward to the week of January 28th, 2010. I am 14, in 8th grade. I am in so much pain I\u2019m blacking out pieces of the day, I can\u2019t sit on a chair, and I become incontinent (lost control of my bowels). My parents bring me to the clinic, and I\u2019m barely able to walk. The doctors there say it\u2019s appendicitis and send me to the hospital. \n\nThere I lay in a bed waiting for surgery, still in pain even through the meds. Finally they put me on the operating table and my last memory is them using the sheet to lift me and me crying out in agony. \n\nWell, they started laparoscopic surgery, but when they got in there they saw it was actually ovarian torsion from a massive cyst. Since it had been a day or two since it twisted, I was in danger of septic shock and the tissue was dead. My ovary was the size of a small football. (I can post pics if anyone is interested). And so they had to remove it. \n\nMy first memory after surgery was them telling me what happened, saying they hadn\u2019t seen this in someone so young, and that my fertility was likely dramatically reduced. And the only chance I had to save my other ovary was to go on birth control immediately. So I did, for 7 years. No periods. Nothing. But then I decided to try without. My cycle evened right out, and here I am. Perfectly healthy little bean, conceived naturally!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/q81r9g/after_being_told_since_i_was_14_11_years_that_id/hgso710/"}
