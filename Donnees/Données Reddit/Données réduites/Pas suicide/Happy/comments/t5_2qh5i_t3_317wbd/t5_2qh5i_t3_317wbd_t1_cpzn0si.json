I was like DFUG?! Am I going to do with this? I am a grown man. So I tossed it into the back cane of my ranger and left it there. \n\nOne day I got two flats out in the middle of BFE.\n\nNo cars coming, and it was getting dark. Looking for my emergency bag, I found the razor scooter.\n\nWhy not?!\n\nI rode that bitch 3 miles to the next gas station. Fucking greatest thing ever! \n\nAbout 4 years ago my truck was totaled and the razor was beyond salvageable.
