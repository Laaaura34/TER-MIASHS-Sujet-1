Welcome to a country that cherishes the right of the individual to forge their own life, as long as that life conforms with the majority view. Welcome to a country that has a holiday where kids dress up as dead things while parents worry about things that will make them deader (like apples with razorblades).  Welcome to a country that ensures you have every opportunity for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as long as you can afford it. Welcome to a country that encourages you to keep your nose in your own business as long as I don\u2019t have to. Welcome to a country where \u201cnot in my backyard\u201d is measured in acres of land, not hectares as we don\u2019t want fucking metric in our lives (that is for NASA, the Army and drug dealers thank your very much). Welcome to a country where people can occasionally be great despite their better natures. Welcome to our home.
