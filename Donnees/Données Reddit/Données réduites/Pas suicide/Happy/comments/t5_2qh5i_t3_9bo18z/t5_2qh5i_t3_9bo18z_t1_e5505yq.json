I have mixed feelings about big cities, but I grew up in about as rural a Southern town as you can find.  But I love the Northeast because I'm a big fan of Winter.  And the Northeast has a big blizzard at least once or twice a year.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend taking lots of trips all over the place once you're here and get financially stable enough to do so.  So many people don't realize just how big this country is and there is *SO MUCH* to see.  ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9bo18z/i_became_an_american_citizen_in_june_and_my/e5505yq/"}
