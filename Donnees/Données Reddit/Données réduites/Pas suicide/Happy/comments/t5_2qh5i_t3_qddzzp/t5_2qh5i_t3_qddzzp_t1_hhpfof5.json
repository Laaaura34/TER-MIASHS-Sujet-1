The two terms are distinct and should not be used interchangeably. It can be helpful to think of sex as a biological characteristic and gender as a social construct. Sex refers to a set of biological attributes in humans and animals. Sex is mainly associated with physical and physiological features including chromosomes, gene expression, hormone level and function, and reproductive and sexual anatomy.\n\nSex is often categorized as females and males, but there are variations of sex characteristics called intersex. The term \u2018intersex\u2019 is used as an umbrella term for individuals born with natural variations in biological or physiological characteristics (including sexual anatomy, reproductive organs and/or chromosomal patterns) that do not fit traditional definitions of male or female[1]. Infants are generally assigned the sex of male or female at birth based on the appearance of their external anatomy/genitalia.\n\n\nhttps://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/gender-and-health", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/qddzzp/19_trans_girl_from_norway_just_got_my_legal_name/hhpfof5/"}
