It's hard to see it where you are right now, but what I'm hearing is progress... You've bumped into a barrier you weren't totally aware of, and that's useful new information.\nDon't beat yourself up, don't judge yourself harshly and don't feel guilty. You have the right intent, you're a good person and you're heading in the right direction! Plus, those emotions are why we lean into that bit of escapism!\nYeah, reducing to a couple of drinks sounds like a smart thing to experiment with! I'm on board, count me the fuck in! I didn't do too well tonight myself, but I did get an early night which meant I didn't find myself wallowing too much in those emotions that creep in when it's late and I'm tired, so I'll take that as a win.\nOne foot in front of the other!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/pdi3t4/stopped_drinking_and_started_working_on_coping/havwyh6/"}
