If the woman already likes OP, she probably sees this song as really cool and romantic. If she's just interested in being friends, she probably sees it as sweet but her opinion won't change.  \n\nWe don't know anything about their relationship, but complaining about the \"friend zone\" is for guys who can't accept that women have free will and agency. They choose the partners, they decide whether they like you as friends of as something more. They're independent human beings. Respect a woman's choice in the matter.
