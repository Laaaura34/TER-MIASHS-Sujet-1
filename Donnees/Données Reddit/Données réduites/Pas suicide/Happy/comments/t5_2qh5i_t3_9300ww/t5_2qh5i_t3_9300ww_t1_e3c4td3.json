You cannot have kids born being addicted to heroin, starved, beaten, and forgotten throughout their life, and then say that\u2019s the \u201cresponsible\u201d thing to do. \n\nAnd you know, children who come from that situation often DON\u2019T thank god they\u2019re alive. They prey for death. They are confused fucked up children who are abused mentally, physically, and sexually. You do not get to decide that they are better off being anywhere. \n\nYou do not get to say that society encourages aborting when I had to have an armed guard escort into PP for an exam. \n\nYou do NOT get to speak about these things like you know every woman who\u2019s had to abort or every child born into a broken home. Don\u2019t. You. Fucking. Dare. \n\nAnd OP, I\u2019m so sorry for having this nasty discussion on your beautiful post. You daughter is a gorgeous child and I wish her the absolute best in life.
