You're assuming alot. \n\nLets be clear. Not all societies are equal. Some are better. Those that decide for other people that they're better off dead in that moment, is a society that is lesser. A addict that came ba k from addiction might not agree with you, so dont be so sure. Just because someone craves death doesn't mean that, that's what's best for them. Most post-suicidal people on this specific subreddit would probably agree with me. They are able to keep their chins up and love life. If they were aborted... they couldn't do that. \n\nAnd yes the progressive culture would agree with you. It seems that that's where we are headed. So thats good that the present culture we live in care for the unborn children!\n\nAnd I am sorry, also, for having this emotionally charged conversation, OPs but I think you would agree with me. I feel obligated to stand up for the poor unborn children of the world. I love them and dont believe they deserve their fate.
