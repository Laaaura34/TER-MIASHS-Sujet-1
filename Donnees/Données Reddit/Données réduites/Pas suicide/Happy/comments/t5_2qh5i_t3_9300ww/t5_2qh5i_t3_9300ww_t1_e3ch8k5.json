A bruise or two are nothing compared to the positives that are gained. I, on the other hand, would definitely advise to quit that relationship. I would say that all the positives in fact *do not* cancel out the negatives, by far.\n\nLife is arguably a much, much worse deal than that, where there\u2019s continuous work to be done to evade pain (eating, sleeping, protecting you body, needing social relationships, etc.), and whenever you fail to do so, you are punished. And it\u2019s surprisingly common to veer off that path, by choice or just bad luck.\n\nSo. I agree with you that parents are responsible for everything positive in their child\u2019s life. But being responsible for all the negatives would be reason enough not make a life. Those two can\u2019t be deducted, as my analogy shows. And remember, a child isn\u2019t waiting someone to be born. The *only* reason a child is ever born, is because of benefits to the parents, be it just sexual pleasure or fulfillment a sense of purpose.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9300ww/this_sweet_girl_is_4_months_today_she_was_a/e3ch8k5/"}
