I'm kinda at a low right now remembering my mom.  This reminded me of how much love there is in the world yet to still be shared. I had a big sad post typed out where I just wanted to tell you to appreciate her and the time you get.  How short the time is.  Then I remembered that my mom would want me to help you guys celebrate.  So I deleted that and tried to think of something more positive.  She's adorable, I wish you guys the best of everything.\n\n \nIt'll sound weird, but if you ever need help, I'm here.\n\n\nsorry, I'm not the best at uplifting/positive.
