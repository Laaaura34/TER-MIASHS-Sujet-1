(Basically anything with a good friend, one\u2019s who you can trust your every word to not betray you.). It\u2019s so easy for you to let people in but they have the opportunity to hurt you. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll see this but iffu ever just wanna say hi and that\u2019s it I\u2019ll say it back. Always.
