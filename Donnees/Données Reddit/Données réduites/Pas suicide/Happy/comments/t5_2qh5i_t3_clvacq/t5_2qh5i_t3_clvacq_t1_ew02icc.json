However, the stress of the anesthesia made her heart freak. She had an ablation two years ago because of afib and because of the stress it went back into afib and her pulse skyrocketed to 180 and her blood pressure tanked. So as of right now, we are in the SICU. The surgeon said that because her heart rate is abnormal, the kidney is getting a little angry. The good news is, her blood pressure evened out on its own, so right now it\u2019s just a waiting game. The next 12 hours are crucial. My plan is to stay the night with her. I will update as I get them.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/clvacq/my_mom_and_i_are_currently_in_slc_because_she/ew02icc/"}
