The last test I took I got a 70 and was depressed about it at first but then was like I\u2019ll do better next time. Then I took the second one and got upset because I was sure I\u2019d failed and got a higher score than my last test which made me happy. But yeah Good for u \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/q1fygu/just_passed_an_exam_i_thought_for_sure_i_had/hffcmf1/"}
