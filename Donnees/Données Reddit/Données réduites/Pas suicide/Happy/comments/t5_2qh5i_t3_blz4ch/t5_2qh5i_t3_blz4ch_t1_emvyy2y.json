She felt the same way. We became so close as friends and we both told each other nothing would ever happen between us. But you can\u2019t really control your heart, as I\u2019m sure you know. And as for the anxiety thing, I\u2019m not the one who\u2019s diagnosed with it, that\u2019s on her end. But from what she told me, she was just scared to tell me how she felt because she thought it would\u2019ve scared me away, but that\u2019s really how anyone feels about that. But basically, I just texted her and I told her that basically I had feelings for her and that I wanted more, and she said she felt the same way, and it\u2019s been excellent ever since. Honestly, I never ever expected us to get together, but I\u2019m damn glad we did. Forgive me and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but if you brought up the anxiety part I assume you\u2019re diagnosed, but if not my apologies. It\u2019s a difficult situation to be in no matter what. But my best advice to give you is that sometimes you just really have to try your luck. Be confident, everybody likes confidence. It worked for me, and I have no doubt it\u2019ll work for you too :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/blz4ch/a_while_back_her_and_i_were_just_chit_chatting/emvyy2y/"}
