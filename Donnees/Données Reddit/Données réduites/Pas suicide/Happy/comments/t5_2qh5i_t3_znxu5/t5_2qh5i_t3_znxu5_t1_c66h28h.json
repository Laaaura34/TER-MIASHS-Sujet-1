At present, beer brewers can have their product go from grain to a customers mouth in less than three weeks.  This allows them to recoup their investment faster, and spend less on what basically amounts to warehouse space.  I've even heard, though I've not had it substantiated, that the Budweiser people have this process down to two weeks.\n\nIt's just easier to do the math and get funding for beer brewing because of the one-time nature of major purchases, and the quick profit on the product.\n\nI'm hoping to make my profits not by having a quick turn-around time, but rather by making the best product I can.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/znxu5/i_started_a_meadery/c66h28h/"}
