I personally know your journey.....clean for over 11 years! It is absolutely possible to do this. Don\u2019t listen to anyone who tries to belittle your success. People on the internet...and in life....can be jerks but they\u2019ve got their own issues. Every day, you make a choice. Keep choosing life! \n\nAnd.....a side note about your hair....it\u2019s beautiful and so are you. Everyone in the world has a different concept of what they find attractive, just like different types of art or music. Value yourself for who you are: a unique creation of your HP. Things happen for a reason and you are an inspiration! \ud83d\ude0a", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7rfy33/drug_addict_for_8_years_went_to_jail_in_2015_and/dsx3tcc/"}
