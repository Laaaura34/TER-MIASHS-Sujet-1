Another thing- there definitely is trying to stay sober, not just \u201cdoing\u201d or \u201cnot doing.\u201d  Every day is a different struggle and you\u2019re presented with new challenges constantly.  Relying on your personal strength is what gets you into the mess of relapse- to truly succeed and get pst your addiction you have to recognize the fact that you\u2019re not able to completely control yourself around drugs and that you\u2019ll need help for the rest of your life.  If you don\u2019t know shit about addiction, why even open your mouth?  You just sound like an asshole.  Aristotle once said something along the lines of \u201cthe wise man speaks because he has something to say, the fool speaks because he has to say something,\u201d and I think that\u2019s some shit you should try to keep in your mind.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7rfy33/drug_addict_for_8_years_went_to_jail_in_2015_and/dswsrj8/"}
