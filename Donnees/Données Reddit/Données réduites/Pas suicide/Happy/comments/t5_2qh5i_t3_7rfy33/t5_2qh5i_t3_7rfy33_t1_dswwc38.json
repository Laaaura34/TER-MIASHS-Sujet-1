I started at the age of 12, until I was 24 years old.\n\n At the age of 24 I had to go to jail for 4 months, from that day on I am drug free. For over 5 years now. Have a wonderful son and a wonderful wife, very good job and again a very good relationship with my family.\n\n Everything is possible, you just have to be determined. Well done, I know how you feel :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7rfy33/drug_addict_for_8_years_went_to_jail_in_2015_and/dswwc38/"}
