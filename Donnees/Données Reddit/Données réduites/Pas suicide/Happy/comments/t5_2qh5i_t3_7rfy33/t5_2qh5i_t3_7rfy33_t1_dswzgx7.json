When I worked at Wendy's ten years ago we could have the whole machine cleaned and sanitized inside and out and be ready to go again in 20-30 minutes flat lol You just removed the inside parts, washed them, then flushed through a couple big bucket of hot water before doing a final flush with a sanitizer packet. The longest time contributer to the machine being out was waiting for the fresh mix to be cold enough. The only time the ice cream machine was ever out was if it was having a technical problem (very rare) or if the store was near close and the employees closed it a little early to get the cleaning out of the way (not so rare)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7rfy33/drug_addict_for_8_years_went_to_jail_in_2015_and/dswzgx7/"}
