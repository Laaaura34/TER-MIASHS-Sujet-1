Less than once a week. But depending on your choices it can be fine. I wouldn\u2019t eat a double quarter pounder with cheese ever. Let alone regularly. But grilled chicken once a week no harm done. Even every other day wouldn\u2019t hurt. Low fat high protein. Decent sand which. \n\nIt\u2019s a rarity if I even eat out. My only point is just because it\u2019s from McDonald\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad. They have great options it\u2019s up to the individual to choose the right stuff. Also I just hate when people get all upset over mechanically separated chicken or BLBT(pink slime). It\u2019s a great way for us to use the whole animal and not waste the animal proteins. It may sound gross initially but it\u2019s really just a way to get all the meat out of the animal. It\u2019s really a conservation effort. I am all for limiting waste.
