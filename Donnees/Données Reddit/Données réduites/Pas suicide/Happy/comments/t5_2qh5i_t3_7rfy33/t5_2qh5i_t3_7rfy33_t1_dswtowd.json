I'm battling the battle of my life rite now with drug addiction. Like you said, I can't hold an job no longer then a few months because I get strung out and weird. I've been to jail the mental hospitals. All that. I've been clean a few weeks , I don't even wanna smoke weed. I'm scared to fail. I got a new job that makes me work out and be on my feet alot. I hope I can make it like you. Your story made me feel not so alone. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7rfy33/drug_addict_for_8_years_went_to_jail_in_2015_and/dswtowd/"}
