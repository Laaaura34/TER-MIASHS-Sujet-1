After I graduate from Level 3 I can go for OTM (Operations Technical Manager) training. This training is basically the ins and outs of every piece of technology across the board inside of a McDonald\u2019s store. From Point of Sales systems, down to the camera\u2019s outside and the Automatic Beverage Server. It covers it all.\n\nHowever, Hamburger University also provides training for Department Managers, which there are generally three departments in each store, and GM\u2019s. The departments are Guest Services, People (internal employees), and Grill. There is online training for each department but if your store really likes you, you can go to training in chicago as well. GM courses follow the same pattern.\n\nEver sense I watched a YouTube video when I was a little kid (like 13, im 26 now) I always wanted to go! It\u2019s been a dream and if I keep this up Im going! :p", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7rfy33/drug_addict_for_8_years_went_to_jail_in_2015_and/dswo495/"}
