My brother is in a real bad way and has been an addict for about 10 years. At one point it was meth and heroine. But I think it\u2019s mostly pills recently. I\u2019ve never been addicted to anything despite trying a lot of drugs so I really can\u2019t relate to help him. He\u2019s done rehab like 4 times, been to jail, can\u2019t hold a job, and I really have no idea how to help him.
