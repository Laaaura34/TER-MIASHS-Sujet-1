You\u2019re twisting my words to win your twisted little game, and I don\u2019t want to play a part in that shit.  In 12 step programs, SMART recovery, and treatment centers, finding a reason to stay clean and going to meetings of some sort is made clear to be incredibly important.  It\u2019s his job to put the foot work in, and if you don\u2019t do that, you\u2019re gonna end up going back out soooon.  It\u2019s when you listen to those thoughts that tell you \u201cman you can totally smoke weed some day\u201d or \u201cbro you can limit yourself to weed just once a week\u201d then a week later you\u2019re out there ripping lines popping pills daily.  It\u2019s incredibly sad to watch people go back out, and if OP doesn\u2019t adequately put the work in, he\u2019s first gonna lose his will that he needs to stay clean, then he\u2019ll lose his sobriety.  So yeah, he has control over his actions, he just needs to make sure he doesn\u2019t lose control by listening to that shitty voice in the back of his head.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7rfy33/drug_addict_for_8_years_went_to_jail_in_2015_and/dsx6btw/"}
