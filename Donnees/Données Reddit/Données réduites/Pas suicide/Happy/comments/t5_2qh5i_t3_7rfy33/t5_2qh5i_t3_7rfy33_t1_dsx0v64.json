But most people's definition this is trying, but you don't end something in a state of trying, you end in a state of either have or have not done it.\n\nI think Yoda is trying to instill the mindset of a successful person. If you think\"I will try this\" then when you fail you are done with trying and have to try again, possibly needed to remotivate yourself. However, if you think \"I will do this\", then even when you fail, you haven't yet finished your original task.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7rfy33/drug_addict_for_8_years_went_to_jail_in_2015_and/dsx0v64/"}
