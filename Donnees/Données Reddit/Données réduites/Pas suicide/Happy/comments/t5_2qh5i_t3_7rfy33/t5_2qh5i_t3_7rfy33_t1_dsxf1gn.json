You\u2019ve made it to manager in such a short time? That says quite a bit about you! Way to go! My old boss\u2019s wife managed a McDonalds and she loved it. It was her first job, at 16, and she never left. Once their kids are done with college and out on their own, they\u2019re planning to buy a franchise. \n\nCongratulations on your sobriety. I say this with encouragement and not to be Debbie Downer, but please stick with your program, hopefully NA (it really does work as long as you go to meetings and disconnect with your addict friends). My ex boyfriend was an ex heroin user, and he managed to get clean and stay clean the rest of his life, which was another 8 years (he passed away but it had nothing to do with drugs). He hung out with friends from NA who knew his struggle, and they went to Starbucks together and had game nights and went to movies-they were good people and he loved them. Even when he was sure he had kicked the addiction, he never stopped going to meetings. He had a roommate though who got his one year chip and thought he\u2019d kicked it, and he was off the wagon soon after he quit NA. So, this should be a lifelong lifestyle change, but it doesn\u2019t have to be a drag. \n\nAnd 4 months is awesome. Pretty soon it\u2019ll be a year! And hard work is the perfect distraction and way to make your life full. I\u2019m rooting for you. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7rfy33/drug_addict_for_8_years_went_to_jail_in_2015_and/dsxf1gn/"}
