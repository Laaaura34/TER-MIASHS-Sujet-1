You earn my full respect.\n\nI always say, respect (career wise) doesn't depend on where you sit today (CEO vs a manager for example), respect comes from the path you have done, from your departure to your arrival, to be where you are. \n\nI'll respect more someone coming from a fragile ethnical origin, in a racist country, who went to shitty school with shitty people and shitty professors, with analphabet parents, and then started with a shitty job and succeeded to climb to team leader in a competitive company, even as a middle manager...\n\n... than a CEO of a Dow Jones Company, who was born in a rich and already (business wise) known family, who attended the best schools, and then best universities and then was dumped as a CEO.\n\nNot saying I wouldn't respect the CEO, because that is still very impressive, but the travel done by the first one was much longer, bigger, and perilous, and for that reason, should I have to chose who to upvote, I'd upvote that guy :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/7rfy33/drug_addict_for_8_years_went_to_jail_in_2015_and/dswy2ec/"}
