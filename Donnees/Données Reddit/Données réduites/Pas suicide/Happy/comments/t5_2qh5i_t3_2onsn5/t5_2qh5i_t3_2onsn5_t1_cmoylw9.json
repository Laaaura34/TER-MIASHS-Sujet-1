Everything we learn is like a building block that forms a tower- Jenga is a perfect example. Sometimes you can continue building the tower with pieces missing or forget about certain parts (take away a block) and as long as the foundation is solid, you can continue. However when there are too many blocks missing, there is no way to continue building the tower because it will continue falling over. \n\nIn order to get to where you want to be, you have to go back and find the steps you missed so that the vision of what is being taught to you can become vivid rather than vague. This is a great first step to reaching whatever goal you want to reach. If you can now add/subtract in your head, move on to multiply and divide. You will slowly realize that things that never made sense before are actually quite clear when the previous step is mastered!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/2onsn5/i_subtracted_double_digit_numbers_in_my_head/cmoylw9/"}
