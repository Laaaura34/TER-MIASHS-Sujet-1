I did something similar last year. Lost 60 pounds in 6 months, but have since regained 30 over the following 6 months. At my most fit, I tried to be mindful about understanding that I had surpassed what was sustainable for long term lifestyle, but I was still able to keep it up for months. I was healthy but the devotion wouldn\u2019t last, and part of me knew that. Ultimately, I\u2019m still in the process of finding a sustainable balance. My most fit period wasn\u2019t sustainable, but I don\u2019t regret striving for it. That being said, as mindful as I was, I do think I\u2019ve walked away with more anxiety about my current body than I had with my original body pre-weight-loss, which was 30 lbs heavier than I am now (60 lbs heavier than my most fit).", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/pfwitx/after_a_rough_point_in_my_life_i_decided_to_get/hb7w55r/"}
