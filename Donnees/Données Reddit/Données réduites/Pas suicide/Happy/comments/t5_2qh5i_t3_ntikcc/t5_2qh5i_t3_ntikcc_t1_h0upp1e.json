I am so happy for you, being in love is a wonderful thing!!\n\nNow, if it doesn\u2019t last it does not mean anything is wrong with you. There are so many people in this world that can make you a little happy, but only a few that will be your match for the rest of your life. Every experience you have in love helps you to find that partner. So, keep her as your girlfriend as long as you have more moments like this than not. But, if it changes, just know there are others who will make you feel like this again. \n\nThis mama is rooting for a wonderful relationship for you both!
