Love finds you, not the other way around, often. I found my boyfriend when he wasn't even looking for a girl. A year and a half later, we're still happy for that coincidence \u263a\ufe0f\n\nI'm thrilled you got to experience this, finally, and I wish you both all the best! A word of advice to the inexperienced, if you will?: Be honest. Talk. If anything is on your mind or \"going wrong\", try to bring it up. If anyone can work things out, it's you and your partner.\n\nBest wishes!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/ntikcc/i_just_kissed_for_the_first_time_at_age_21/h0u0eoh/"}
