She was raised Jehovah's Witness because her grandmother was, even though her own mother doesn't even really go by it. She's told me before that she feels so conflicted and guilty because it's been damn near beaten into her over the years, to the point it makes her very upset. Along with some other just straight up sad relationship issues she has with her grandmother (who mostly raised her), she's 27 and doesn't have her license or a car she can even practice with in order to get it, and she's basically been her Gma's attendant the whole time. My husband and I are moving into a newer, bigger house here soon along with our other roommates, and guess what? She's gonna be roommate numero 6, cause neither of us is having that shit anymore. She also told me once she moves in she wants to participate in holiday decorating this year, which is always a grand affair at our house. :) ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/96b263/i_was_raised_in_a_religion_that_is_pretty_damn/e400850/"}
