They don't celebrate birthdays because the only two birthday celebrations mentioned in the Bible had executions performed at the party, and they don't celebrate holidays because most of them are either secular, or have their roots in paganism.  Before I get down voted this is just the  attempt at logic that they apply.  I think those are both mental gymnastics and love holidays and birthdays.\n ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/96b263/i_was_raised_in_a_religion_that_is_pretty_damn/e40b3q5/"}
