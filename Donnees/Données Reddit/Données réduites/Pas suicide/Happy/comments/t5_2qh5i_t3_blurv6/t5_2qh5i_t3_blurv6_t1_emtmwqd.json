There are many studies that show that people who do IF without restricting calories will either lose weight or stay the same weight. \n\nHowever, the better you eat, the better chance of you losing that weight. As long as you\u2019re going about 1600-2000 calories (2500 if you\u2019re much more active) you should be losing weight on IF. \n\nIf calorie restriction is a worry, just do OMAD (One meal a day). That diet is very easy and never has to worry about calorie restriction, since it\u2019s just one meal lol. \n\nAgain, the better that you care for your body, the better the results. Exercising - even if it\u2019s just light walking - will make you lose more weight. Limiting fast food / eating out will make you lose more weight. Fasting for longer periods will make you lose more weight.\n\n**EDIT- I don\u2019t think I answered your question. You can eat throughout the entire food window.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/blurv6/for_my_birthday_i_worked_hard_and_gave_myself_the/emtmwqd/"}
