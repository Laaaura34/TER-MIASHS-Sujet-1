People do it anywhere from a week to the most I\u2019ve seen being 58 days. It\u2019s the most effective way to lose weight fast without killing your body. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot more to it though. This diet allows tea, black coffee, and bone broth. But, it also requires you to take mineral, vitamins, and sometimes electrolyte pills to make sure you\u2019re getting your vital nutrients. \n\nThis diet is especially critical if you want to reverse diabetes, if you have it.\n\nAgain, educating yourself about how to healthily fast is important. The wiki on r/fasting is a great accurate resource! \n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/blurv6/for_my_birthday_i_worked_hard_and_gave_myself_the/emt0flx/"}
