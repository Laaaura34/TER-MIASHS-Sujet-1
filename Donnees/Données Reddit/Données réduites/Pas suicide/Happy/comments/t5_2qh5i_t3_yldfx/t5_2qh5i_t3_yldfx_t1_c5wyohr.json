I've been through some pretty serious depression in my life, but I decided to surround myself with happy people and \"fake it\" and that worked for me. I'm not saying all people with serious depression issues choose to be unhappy, but to a certain extent, you have control over it. If you wake up and dread the day before you and think negative thoughts, you are probably going to self-fulfill your bad day. On the other hand, if you wake up telling yourself, \"this is going to be a great day. I'm going to make this a great day\" and make a real effort to be happy, you're much more likely to actually be happy! I would think that others subscribed to r/happy would agree, but apparently not. positive psychology, yo. ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/yldfx/three_reasons_never_to_be_unhappy/c5wyohr/"}
