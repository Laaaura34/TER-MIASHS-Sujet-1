You may have to fake happiness, but it'll come on its own after a while.\n\n2) Things are always changing. If today was the worst day of your life, then you've gotten through it, and you're a stronger person because of it. Things will not stay the same, and if they get worse, you'll be able to handle it better.\n\n3) Things are usually not as bad as they seem. I don't mean in the sense that people are starving in Africa, or whatever. Just that, if that girl didn't show up to the date, fuck it, she's a flake, and you're better off not dating that kind of woman.\n\nI dunno, just my thoughts. I find that works a lot better than \"I'm alive.\"", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/yldfx/three_reasons_never_to_be_unhappy/c5ws0y6/"}
