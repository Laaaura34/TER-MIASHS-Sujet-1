I just turned 18 a few months ago and I've been starting to go clubbing (I'm from Australia) and I actually dream of situations like this. \n\nI made this throwaway to kind of share my girl crush type thing too. I get those same feelings about this girl that went to my highschool. We're really close friends so I don't think I would ever cross her mind in terms of anything romantic, but I've had a crush on her for around 3 years now. There's something about just being with her that makes me only care when she's coming to certain clubs, or if she's coming to the picnic. When ever I'm at a club I just find myself asking what could make any of the girls there better than her, trying to justify dropping my romantic feelings for her even momentarily, but I don't. I think I will tell her soon and I hope that it can go well, and if it doesn't, at least then I might be able to use rejection to get over her and try to meet new people like you have :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1csn0y/for_the_first_time_ever_i_am_really_crushing_on_a/c9k4b4a/"}
