From what you say, it seems easy to understand. It might be the force of habit that prevents them from seeing the change in you. When we say we know somebody that usually means that we have a clear conception or idea of that person, but it is often the clarity and force of that idea or conception that prevents us from taking in new information, so we don't see the signs of how the person is behaving now. The friends we recently meet tend to me more accurate judges of who we are now than those who have known us forever because more recent friends are judging us according to what we are doing now. So it might not only be people on Reddit who understand you, perhaps people in real life who meet you now will find it easy to understand you. So there is hope for finding understanding in those in real life. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9p0gwf/nobody_irl_seems_to_understand_so_im_going_to/e7ydp9o/"}
