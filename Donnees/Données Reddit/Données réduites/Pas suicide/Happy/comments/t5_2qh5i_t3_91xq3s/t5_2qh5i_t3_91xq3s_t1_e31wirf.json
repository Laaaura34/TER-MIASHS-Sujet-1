Set alarms in your phone to remind me in 9 months so I can get a list of ideas and areas together\n\nSomeone asked if I could post of a picture of us which I will be happy to do this weekend while we are on vacation, I will post it to my profile as I\u2019m just happy to be engaged and don\u2019t require the internet points\n\nAnd as for posting 10 minutes before the proposal, I have a couple different pictures of everything, because what future wife dosent want pictures of her proposal, amirite?\n\nSorry if I\u2019m missing anything/anybody, I didn\u2019t expect the amount of love and kind words that we have revived and I will do my best to respond to everyone and answer everything!\n\nThank you so much!", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/91xq3s/10_minutes_from_now_ill_pop_the_question_wish_me/e31wirf/"}
