I kept in touch with one who introduced me to all the others and now we regularly go out to do fun things like escape rooms and such. I got that advice from my dad and other places on Reddit too before I left high school and followed it, and it was the best thing I ever did. I actually don't have many friends in university yet.\n\nThanks a lot by the way :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/5v5i9a/my_friends_are_celebrating_my_birthday_with_me/ddztk3o/"}
