It's so exciting getting your first home! My partner and myself spent four happy years in ours before moving into our new one just before Christmas.\nMy advice is - enjoy it. Make it a home. Make it personal.\nDoes it need much work done to it?\nOur first home needed full renovation and it was the first time either of us had lived with anyone but our parents, the first few days I was a bit unsettled, but that feeling soon passes when you are making it your own.\nBuy only what you need to begin with, and Pinterest is a godsend when it comes to ideas and hacks! I have a whole board dedicated to decor and home hacks (because addiction.)\n\n:) ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/abkon1/i_did_a_very_adult_thing_yesterday_to_end_2018/ed1e122/"}
