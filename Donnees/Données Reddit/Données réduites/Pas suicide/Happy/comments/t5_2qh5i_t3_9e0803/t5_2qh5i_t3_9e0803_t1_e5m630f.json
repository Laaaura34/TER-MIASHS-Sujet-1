It reminds me of my long term boyfriend. I was in college and we had a huge snow storm during finals week. At this point im running on 3 days of hardly any sleep and freezing. I came over to his house really late by this time its probably like 12am and i didnt eat dinner yet because i was so busy. I was so tired that i collapsed in his bed and didn't even care if i ate dinner or not. I mummbled that i was hungry but too tired to cook anything. He gets up and leaves for a bit and I'm too tired i kinda just fall asleep. He comes back and wakes me up and gives me a massive bowl of hot ravioli smothered in cheese with some bread and dipping sauce. I teared up i was so happy. \n\nLove feels like a warm bowl of pasta. (In your case a plate of hotwings) ", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/9e0803/chicken_wings_are_the_secret_to_a_happy_marriage/e5m630f/"}
