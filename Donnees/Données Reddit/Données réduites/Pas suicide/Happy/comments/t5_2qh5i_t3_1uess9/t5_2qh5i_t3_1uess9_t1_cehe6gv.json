Someone suggested /r/personalfinance but another nice thing you can do too is donate to those in need. People that you know are struggling but do not know of your wealth. Surprise them with something every now and then. Set some money aside each year for this. A little goes a long way for someone in need PLUS it will make you feel awesome :)", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1uess9/my_job_pays_much_more_than_i_thought/cehe6gv/"}
