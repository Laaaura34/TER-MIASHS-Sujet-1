You have found easy money for now.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Don't expect it to last.  At some point they'll realize your job can be fulfilled much less expensively.  Until then, prepare for the inevitable so that circumstance doesn't catch you flatfooted and bitter.  Don't say you weren't warned.\n\nIn the meantime, yes, do be happy.  And remember that you'll be happy when this job is gone too.  Why will you be happy then?  That is up to you.", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1uess9/my_job_pays_much_more_than_i_thought/cehqgvf/"}
