I almost feel guilty, but it's not like I asked for this, they just offered it, so, carpe diem.\n\nThey aren't paying for what you're doing now, but what you'll be doing in the future when you have some experience. Make that a reality.\n\n----\n\nCongratulations! Can I take this moment to talk about charity? Just considering your salary and bonus, you're earning more than 99.9% of the world's population, and earn 74 times more than the median person. To you $3,000 is fun, to another person it can mean life or death.\n\nThat's why I, like [many other software engineers](http://www.jefftk.com/giving), give significant portions of our income to charity. Using [scientific evidence](http://givewell.org) shows some charities are way better than others at helping people, and that's why I give to certain charities and causes which aren't always the most well-known.\n\nIt's easiest to start giving as soon as you start earning as you won't get used to some luxuries that come with a high income. [You literally won't know what you're missing.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill)\n\nIf you do go down this route don't assume your equity will pay off and be sure to save 15%+ of your salary at a minimum like /r/personalfinance says. Also be aware that [for every $100 you donate, you can receive as much as $28 back through your tax return](http://givingwhatwecan.org/how-to-give/tax-deductibility/US).\n\nFeel free to ask any questions.\n\nhttp://givingwhatwecan.org/", "permalink": "/r/happy/comments/1uess9/my_job_pays_much_more_than_i_thought/cehw5gx/"}
