How to say this.. I such a place... I don't want to be that guy.\n\nVCs and statistics are against you. VCs make money by: 10x return of investments (happens 1/3 of the time). This is the scenario you're hoping will happen. Also, they recoup their loss when it only goes 1x (1/3 of the time). They do it through preference liquidation. The other 1/3 is the case where everybody loses.\n\nThe thing is, you don't get to recoup **anything** when liquidation preferences apply. Liquidation preferences means they get back any dime they invested before anyone else gets something.\n\nYes, you can earn an additional 220k$/year, but only 1/3 of the time. The other 2/3 you get nothing.\n\nI wish you all the best, and that your company will do more than 10x. But please do not make plans that include you getting any money.
