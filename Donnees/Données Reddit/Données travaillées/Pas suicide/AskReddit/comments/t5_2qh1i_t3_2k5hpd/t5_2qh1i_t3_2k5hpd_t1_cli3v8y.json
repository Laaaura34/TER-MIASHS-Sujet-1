In the mind of a suicidal person, things seem like rock bottom & irreparable. During the times I was suicidal, the one thing that stopped me was the thought of hurting those that loved me, i.e. my family and friends. It might be best to just tell the person how much you love them and how much they mean to you. Just as important, listen to them. If they keep all of their thoughts to themselves for too long, that's what causes more damage to their mind and soul.\n\nsitting next to them & showing unconditional love can mean the difference between life and death.\n\ngood luck friend.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2k5hpd/seriouswhat_would_be_the_best_way_to_talk_someone/cli3v8y/"}
