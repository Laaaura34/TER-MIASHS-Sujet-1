I don't really like to talk about it. But i guess since it's the internet I'll give you a summary of it. Basically I was really depressed, I thought about it all the time with no real intentions of ever comitting. I came across some really good friends that showed me what life should feel like. I had become so used to feeling lonely all the time, it had become like home to me. But they helped me out of it slowly, not by taljing me out of it, in fact they didn't even know until I told them later on when I was feeling better again. You can't just talk someone out of it, because you're not doing them any good sending them back to a sad life. You have to improve their life so they remember that it's one worth living", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2k5hpd/seriouswhat_would_be_the_best_way_to_talk_someone/cli3nis/"}
