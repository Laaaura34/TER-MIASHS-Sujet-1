I was at university and I jumped off a bridge, into water. It was a long way down.\n\nI thought that would kill me but what I thought about was how deep I was going and how cold and dark it was.\n\nThen I got back to the surface and was initially a bit shocked, then I realised no one cared. I just swam a bit then got to the side. I did have a point where I thought \u2018fuck, I can\u2019t actually get out\u2019. There was so much sea weed it was disgusting.\n\nMy ribs hurt a lot. When I was walking home I leaned over and about a litre of water sploosjed out of my sinuses. \n\nI don\u2019t think I lost consciousness but when I woke up the next day I did feel different. Just like, I could kill myself at any time no big deal.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/b75gpg/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/ejq3r5o/"}
