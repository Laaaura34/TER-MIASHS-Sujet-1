I was seriously dehydrated so i called my best friend over to take me to the hospital.\n\nLater i found out they tried to wake me at 6am but i would just ramble \"i cant\" and go back to sleep deeply.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/b75gpg/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/ejq3c3u/"}
