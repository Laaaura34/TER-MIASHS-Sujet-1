I was a missionary and met this amazing person that I knew who struggled with severe depression, probably the worst that I had ever seen. He committed suicide, and in that moment it felt like an out of body experience for me. I saw how his family was completely destroyed by his passing. We visited his grandma everyday because she was devastated since she practically raised the boy. His brother and mother lost weight. I was torn up as well. It was strange to be in that situation after considering doing the same thing for a long time. Please, don't do it. Please hold on, I know it can be SO HARD. Its SO hard sometimes and you don't know if you can hold out much longer, but you can. Love those you care for as much as you can. If you can't hold on for you, hold on for those that you will hurt unimaginably for taking your own life. That's a pain that never goes away, its a wound that never heals. I know, I've felt it and I've seen it. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/b75gpg/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/ejpk0hz/"}
