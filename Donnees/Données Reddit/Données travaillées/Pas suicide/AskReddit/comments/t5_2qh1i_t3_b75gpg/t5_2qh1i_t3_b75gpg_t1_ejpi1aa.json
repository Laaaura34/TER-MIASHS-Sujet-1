I wasn't frustrated like others have said, although I understand why they would've felt that way. Quite on the contrary, my first thought was \"the worst has passed then\".\n\nAfter a very long depression, after that last day in which the pain was so overwhelming I actually felt like I was being physically hurt by the weight of it all, after losing myself to my unconsciousness, being able to think clearly again was a relief bigger than I thought possible.\n\nI'm of the idea that my life ended there and a new opportunity had been given to me. That's not to say that the road to recovery was easy, it was a bitch, but I think coming back gave me the courage to work on getting better.\n\nNow I've been six months antidepressants-free, and thoroughly enjoying my new life.\n\nThank your for asking, kind stranger.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/b75gpg/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/ejpi1aa/"}
