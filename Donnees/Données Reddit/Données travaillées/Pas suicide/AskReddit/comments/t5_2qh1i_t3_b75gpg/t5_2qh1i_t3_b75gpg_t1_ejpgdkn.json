I was pissed. Pisssssssed. Seeing a doctor asking me if I knew where I was and I did. At a hospital. Honestly I'm just fucking mad. I had to be on a machine to make me breathe and when I woke up i had bruises all down my arms and legs and one of the nurses told me they tried waking me, but I fought like hella fury and had to be put out. I don't even remembering waking up. I was just fucking conscious and there. There was a burn patient in the same room as me, burnt his body 70 percent trying to die. His sister came everyday and made him walk, and talk and function. Honestly the only time I slept was when that man was snoring.\n\nI remember what it was like to be 'asleep' that long. To die. Peaceful. Dark. Just.. a pure peace I've never forgotten. I saw no light. No omg my life is flashing before my eyes. Just. Peace.\n\nAnd that's why I'm fucking pissed but also confused because I'd like to believe something.. kept me here for a reason.\n \nHavnt figured it out yet. I wish you all well, and good luck. I need it too lmao\n\nWe all have a purpose even if we don't know. You're all loved, just be calm. Watch movies, listen to music, play games and pets dogs and cats. Make yourself happy the best of your ability.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/b75gpg/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/ejpgdkn/"}
