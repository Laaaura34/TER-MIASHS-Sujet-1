On February 1,2019 my ex fiance's mother did walk in front of a train and killed herself. I just found this out a few days ago and my head and heart have been a wreck. I too have tried committing suicide by pills and cutting when I was younger and the thoughts have crept into my head again this past winter. After hearing about my ex's mom those thoughts are long gone. I look at my family and could never put them through that kind of pain. The person who kills themselves ends their suffering but causes great pain to those who knew them. Honestly suicide is an extremely selfish act. Everyday is a new day and everyday you get the chance to start your life all over again. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/b75gpg/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/ejpv7ca/"}
