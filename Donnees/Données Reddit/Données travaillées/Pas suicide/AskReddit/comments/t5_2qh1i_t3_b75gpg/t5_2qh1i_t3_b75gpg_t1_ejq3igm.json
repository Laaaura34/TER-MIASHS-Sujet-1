I\u2019m lucky those thoughts never escaped me, but for almost 2 years the only way I could accomplish anything was the thought that if I failed, then at least I had a way out. And the only other thought I had was, if I end it my parents will be miserable, and I\u2019d rather be miserable than make people I love so dearly so miserable.  Im so sorry you went through that but I\u2019m happy you survived, and I hope you\u2019re doing better these days.
