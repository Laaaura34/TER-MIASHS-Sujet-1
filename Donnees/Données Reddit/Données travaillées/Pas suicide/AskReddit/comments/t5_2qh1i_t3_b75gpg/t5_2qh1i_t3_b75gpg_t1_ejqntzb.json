I stared at the glass and my hand for about 30m, then thought I wanted to go back to the happy days so I wolfed it all down. I think I was only able to take them because at that moment I thought I'd be fine. I go to bed. Lo and behold, wake up the next morning with mum telling me to wake up for lunch, getting up and immediately collapsing on the floor. Everyone panics, I say I tripped and go to sit down at my computer, turn on a Skype call with my gaming buddies and they asked if something was wrong, because I sounded a bit slurred. I just said \"yah I took a lot of pills and whiskey and even that didn't help\". Confessed to my mom a few days later, she breaks down and I found a therapist. Tbh, when I sat down all I thought was \"guess I'm still around then\" and went back to my depression. That was 4 years ago, 5 in November.
