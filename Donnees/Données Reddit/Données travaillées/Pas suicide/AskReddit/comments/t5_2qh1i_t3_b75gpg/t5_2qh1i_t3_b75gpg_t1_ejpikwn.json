It sucks, I know, I\u2019ve been a walking hollow tree for the better part of the past 10 years. But there are good moments, we just don\u2019t remember them in this state of mind. They seem distant, but I promise there were good moments. And there will be more, and those small moments mean the world. Take it as a chance to see something others can\u2019t. Maybe to help others in need. Do you realize why suicide survivors are still here? It\u2019s because they realized something deeper about the impulsivity of their action, the stupidity of it, they could\u2019ve tried again and succeeded. But that moment of tunnel vision has passed, and now they see something else. They\u2019re still depressed, sure. But alive. After all, what fun is it being normal anyway.
