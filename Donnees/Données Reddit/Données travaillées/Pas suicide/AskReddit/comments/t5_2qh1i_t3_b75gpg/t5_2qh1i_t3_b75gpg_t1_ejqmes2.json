Honestly. Part of me told myself that if I was truly regretful for all the pain I caused my family then a granduer punishment would be to live this miserable life as long as possible. My family was abusive addicts and it is interesting that child logic. I heard stories of when my parents were better people, and all that seemed to change when I was born. There was video of my older brother as a child and none of me. I figured I was the reason my parents did drugs and fought all the time. I was abused in different ways by my parents and my older brother. I eventually got out of all of that. Then got wonderful PTSD(post traumatic stress disorder) therapy. Changed my life and my understand of my parents minds. \n\nFor years I felt I was the cause of everyone's misery.  Even now it still flickers, visiting a friend in California.  He got sick a few days after I arrived,  must be my fault, I am more bound to help him as much as possible. The mind is fucked up places sometimes.  Get therapy if you can't understand what is going on in there. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/b75gpg/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/ejqmes2/"}
