I\u2019ve been struggling for a while. I\u2019ve been sick for five years and suicide is always in the back of my mind. As an option. However I lost someone I loved dearly to suicide and I know what it does to the family left behind. My family has never truly recovered and it was 16 years ago. That\u2019s what keeps me here more than anything. I\u2019m not angry at him for what he did though. I think of my chronic pain and how It is always there, and I think of him suffering mentally that way. Always suffering. I don\u2019t want that for him.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/pi3u0i/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_is_your_story/hbqc7bx/"}
