Life was so hard and although I adore my child I always dreamed of having the opportunity to have another shot of motherhood, do it as a loving couple and share the joy. I also possibly selfishly wanted to experience what it was like to have a child who wasn\u2019t always sick and have the pleasure of seeing a little one thrive.\nIt had been so painful watching my firstborn struggle, it always will be. I wish I could take away all of the pain and suffering he\u2019s experienced, watch him thrive, maybe grow up, make mistakes, have fun, fall in and out of love, have a job. It\u2019s like grief I guess. I adore him.\nMe and my husband had always discussed having children, it was my dream. My husband got cold feet after we married, he\u2019s an anxious person who worries about finances, we were not as secure as he wanted. He wouldn\u2019t commit to having a baby, it caused so many arguments as I felt I\u2019d been lied to. He married me and then reneged on our dream.\nI\u2019ve always had thoughts of suicidal ideation but felt I\u2019d never go through with anything because of my boy. It became too much, I couldn\u2019t cope, I felt my life was just work and caring, no fun or new life.\nI took several packets of my sons medications. I hoped to go to sleep as they\u2019d be better without me.\nI woke up in my own workplace in ITU 3 days later, I\u2019m well know where I work. The shame and disappointment was horrendous. There were some alcohol rub and syringes on my table and I contemplated accessing one of my ports and injecting myself with alcohol rub as I didn\u2019t want to deal with the aftermath.\nMy family were round my bed when I woke, I felt horrible for the pain I caused.\nThe following weeks I was angry I had failed and embarrassed. I went back to work and I still to this day wonder if any of the people I encountered regularly may have looked after me or know what happened. It\u2019s been rough, it\u2019s a stigma for me.\nThe story is not all bad though, me and hubby had counselling. We agreed to try, my baby is two, he\u2019s healthy, thriving, his big brother adores him and he is my baby\u2019s hero. Daddy adores baby, my life was worth something after all. I\u2019m so glad I made it here.\nStay strong.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/pi3u0i/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_is_your_story/hc8dz26/"}
