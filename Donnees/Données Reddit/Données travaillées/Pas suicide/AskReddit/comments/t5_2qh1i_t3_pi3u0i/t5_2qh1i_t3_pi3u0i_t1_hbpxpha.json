I\u2019m not sure. My depression was really bad at the time so after I failed I tried a few more times and honestly it didn\u2019t get better until I started taking meds that worked and I finally started getting closure against my abuser, so really time and medication and fighting for what I believed in helped. I\u2019ve heard that people who attempted regretted right after, but that wasn\u2019t true for me. It took me years to stop being suicidal and regret my attempts. I\u2019m sorry this probably doesn\u2019t help but the truth for me at least is that the urge didn\u2019t go away until I made some pretty big changes in my life. I hope this helps, sorry it\u2019s kinda depressing", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/pi3u0i/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_is_your_story/hbpxpha/"}
