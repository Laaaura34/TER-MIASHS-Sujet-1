I\u2019ve been suicidal as well. I\u2019ve been sick for the last five years. Are used to be a super active person and now I\u2019m bedridden 90% of the time. And have been for almost 3 years. I try to stay in the moment. I try not to look back to what I lost or look forward to what I might lose. Anytime those thoughts start to spin in my head I focus on the moment at hand and ask myself where are my feet right now? I refocus myself on the present. Because even if I am in extreme pain at that moment, I know that moment will pass.
