First one I was 13 and the best way to describe it was desperation. Just so much emotional pain that no one could see and the fam just called it me being dramatic.  2nd time I was in ICU for few days so lots of it is a blur. In overcoming and living through all of that I don't take happiness for granted. Each day I decide that I am here for a reason and I value my life. There is so much support out there and it is possible to live through and lead a happy, good life.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2znizy/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_could_you/cpknssz/"}
