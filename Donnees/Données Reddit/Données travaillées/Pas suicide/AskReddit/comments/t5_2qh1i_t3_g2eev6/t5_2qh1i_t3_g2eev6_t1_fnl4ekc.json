At the time I thought that had done everything possible to make it as easy as possible on my family, I had decluttered a lot of stuff, I wrote out my will and funeral wishes, put down my passwords to my different accounts that would need to be closed. My significant other found my will before I could go through with it and figured out what I was planning. I told him that I was trying to make it as easy on him and my friends/family as possible, he told me that all that stuff I did, it didn't matter. That the only thing that would ever make it easier was just staying alive. So that's what I did, I didn't do it for myself at the time but now a year later I'm glad I'm still kicking. \n\nTLDR: If you need help reach out, cause staying staying alive is the biggest thing you can do to help your loved ones.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/g2eev6/survivors_or_suicide_loss_of_reddit_what_could/fnl4ekc/"}
