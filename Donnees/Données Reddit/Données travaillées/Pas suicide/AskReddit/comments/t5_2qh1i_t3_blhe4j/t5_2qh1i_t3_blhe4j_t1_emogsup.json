She didn't bring me to this world or sacrificed so many things bringing me up, just to see me give up like that. \nThe same thought keeps me going today. And also that I'm a parent.\nI need to keep reminding myself that nothing is permanent, and especially not how I'm feeling today. I have to remind myself of where I was emotionally few years ago, and how far I've come.
