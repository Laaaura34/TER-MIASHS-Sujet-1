I don't agree with this guy's opinion of people who commit/try to commit suicide but I recognise they have a deeply personal connection with this issue and there is a level of validity to how *they* feel. As someone who has considered suicide, the people I would hurt like this are a key consideration. I'm lucky I've never got to total breaking point because the idea that I could hurt someone I love as much as this person has been hurt, beyond the control of my own mind, is heart breaking. Have sympathy with this poster's perspective even if you don't agree.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/blhe4j/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_how_did_you/emq31jt/"}
