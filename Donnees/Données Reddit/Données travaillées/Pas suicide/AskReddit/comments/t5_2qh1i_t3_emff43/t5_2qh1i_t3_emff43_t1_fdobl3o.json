I tried to and nearly was successful in 2008. My mother kicked me out with 10 days notice while I was in community college with no income. I was going to be homeless. I was afraid and out of options. \n\nI was homeless until 2013. It was both the best and worst time of my life, but I grew a lot. I found myself. I learned to love and trust myself. I figured out what's important to me, and I found my passions. \n\nNow, my life is better than I ever imagined it could be. I'm stable, functional, and proud. I have a future. I have the things that I need. I have a supportive friend network, and two dogs that are fucking amazing. \n\nIt got worse before it got here, but my life is in a better place than I could have imagined it being prior to my attempt.
