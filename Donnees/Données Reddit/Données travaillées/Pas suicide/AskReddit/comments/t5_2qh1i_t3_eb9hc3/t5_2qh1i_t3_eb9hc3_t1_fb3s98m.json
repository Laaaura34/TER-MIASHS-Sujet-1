But I had forgotten to turn down my notifications. I got a couple notifs for messages and I ignored them, but eventually I got a call. Checked the ID and it was a close friend.\n\nA general rule I have is \"don't call me because I wont answer for anyone. If its life or death, call twice.\" So I let it ring until it stopped, and I waited a few seconds. Sure enough, she called a second time. \n\nShe was having a really rough night, her dad had just OD'd and she needed someone to talk to. I stayed in that call for 5 hours comforting her. What really got through to me is the fact that she came to me for help first. The fact that someone needed me in their life was enough to keep me going.\n\nShe doesnt know that she stopped me from killing myself, and we stopped talking a couple years back. But I still see it as the reason for hanging on, because even if it's only one person, someone might need me.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/eb9hc3/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_how_did_you/fb3s98m/"}
