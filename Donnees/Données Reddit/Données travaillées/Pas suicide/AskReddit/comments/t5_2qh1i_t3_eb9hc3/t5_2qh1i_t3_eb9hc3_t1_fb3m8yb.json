I loaded up on way more pills for the next attempt when my English teacher freshman year read a little deeper into the daily journals I was writing for her class. She reported it to the school and my parents who took me to my doctor to reevaluate my antidepressants. I was determined a danger to myself and those around my and when to a psych facility for adolescents for almost 2 weeks. While in there my whole direct family knew why except my younger brother who wasn't allowed to see me while I was in there. He asked my mom if he could bring me cookies (he couldn't because of the rules) and my heart broke. It made me realize how hard life would be on him if I was gone and I flipped a switch. When I got home I flushed the pills I was going to take. Few years later my little brother was in the same situation and the only thing that kept him going was me being able to relate my past to him. Had I succeeded all those years ago he wouldn't have had me to help him through his own struggles now. I love that kid so much and I just want to see him succeed in life.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/eb9hc3/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_how_did_you/fb3m8yb/"}
