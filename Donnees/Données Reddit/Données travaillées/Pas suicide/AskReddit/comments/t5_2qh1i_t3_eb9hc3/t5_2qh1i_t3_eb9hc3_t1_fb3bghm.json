My friend had went missing the night before so we were all a little spooked. I went onto the group chat and my other friend told me what happened. One of my best friends had killed themselves the previous night. Nothing has ever hurt that bad, not my birthmother dying, not my grandfather dying, but knowing how we had just laughed together the week before and played the cello and all of those memories. We\u2019re just sophomores in high school, they should\u2019ve died old. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t, The pain, to see the group just break down into nothing and cry.
