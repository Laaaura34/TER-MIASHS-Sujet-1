I got yelled at when my stepdad found the empty bottle and I got scared out of trying again until I was 13. It was just as unsuccessful, I don't remember what I took (maybe aspirin?) but I took more pills and then put a bunch of whiskey in a cup of hot chocolate and went to bed. I woke up the next day and didn't end up trying again but I let it slip at some point in high school that I didn't feel safe going home anymore, so they called DCFS and DCFS didn't do anything except order my parents to send me to therapy. I went to group therapy predominantly in a partial-hospitalization program for 6hrs 3 days a week, with one day for an individual session and a few months later another day a week for family therapy. I ended up just moving out when I was 16 and everything got so much better I stopped going to therapy. I still get some bad days, but I haven't cut or attempted suicide since I moved out and I have some mindfulness skills to help too.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/ahg9py/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_happend_to_you/eeeihwg/"}
