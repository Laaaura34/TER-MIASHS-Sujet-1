I was on the ground in my room, still conscious but very out of it (pills). I managed to say something to her, I don\u2019t remember what, but she didn\u2019t notice what a state I was in and she left me to go to bed for the night. When I woke up the next morning, I didn\u2019t tell anyone. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell anyone until after my 4th attempt, at which point I got professional help. She never suspected anything. I went to a psych ward, and have been in and out of treatment ever since. 7 suicide attempts total (some pills, some cutting) and 6 years of treatment and while the thoughts still go through my mind, I\u2019d never do that again.
