About a year ago I tried killling myself by overdose and drowning in the bathtub. My mom knew about my depression and busted into the bathroom at the perfect moment. At the time I was super pissed. I couldn\u2019t belive she would do that because I wanted to be gone. She took me to the hospital and they took me to a mental institution, I stayed for two weeks, it was a strict schedule, at 8am we had school where we worked on a  chi lol work from our schools that they would send in, it was about 3 hours long and they also had computers and activities in case we didn\u2019t have anything to work on, we would go back to our rooms with our nurses (every kid was assigned a babysitter nurse) for 15 minutes and then we would go to the cafeteria and eat. You would be able to talk to the other patients and stuff. After that we had group for an hour, then we had 30 minutes in our room again for solitary time. We would have free time in the commons after that. Then we would go for another hour of group, then dinner, then solitary time, you get the point. I hated it a lot at first but I made relationships with the staff and honestly they really helped me. Of course they will tie you to the bed if your a danger to others at the time I was there that happened the girl was hitting people and the nurses", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/fcbrdp/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_is_the_worst/fja7974/"}
