There\u2019s not really anything I can say that will help. When I was at my worst, people would tell me I have so much to be grateful for, so many people love me, I\u2019m smart, I have so much potential, there\u2019s so much to live for, others will miss me if I go, I just have to live one day at a time, it gets better. But they failed to recognize the absolute torture that was going on. I couldn\u2019t bear to just live one more day. Not even one more hour. Every second was unbearable. I fought this demon for years, and the year leading up to my attempt, I did everything I could to \u201cfix\u201d myself. But nothing worked. Not meds, not therapy, not changing jobs/apartments. But I\u2019m glad I survived because it helped me to have the courage to do what I couldn\u2019t do before. That was come out as transgender and start medically transitioning. I still suffer from depression, but it\u2019s like a 3/10 now where it was a 10/10 before. Every day just the worst thing ever. I\u2019m actually living now. It\u2019s pretty great. And I know there are people that don\u2019t have something like transitioning that will help \u201ccure\u201d their depression, which is why I know it can be so hard knowing what to do and how to help. It seems hopeless and like it will never get better. I can\u2019t tell anyone it\u2019s going to get better because I don\u2019t know their life or the future. All I can do is tell them not to go through with it and to try and find some glimmer of hope. It\u2019s easier said than done...", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/m62l31/suicide_attempt_survivors_of_reddit_what_message/gsmkusa/"}
