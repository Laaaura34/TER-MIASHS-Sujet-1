I stopped eating after day 3, I wasn\u2019t going to allow them to force me to live. I don\u2019t know why I was discharged, or what they thought they accomplished. No meds combinations worked or changed my mind. I\u2019m also not sure why I stopped trying either. Things got worse after I left and the whole paperwork of it all fucked over my entire career path past and future(I was jobless at the time). Suicidal ideation just kicks stuff around in my head periodically, it\u2019s something that just doesn\u2019t go away for me even though it\u2019s been years.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/m62l31/suicide_attempt_survivors_of_reddit_what_message/gr3jsmk/"}
