I had just finished my freshman year of college and absolutely hated being stuck at home for summer break. I\u2019m depressed, anxious, and autistic. My parents are emotionally abusive and so is my older brother, toward me and my younger sibling. I got tired of sleeping all day and watching YouTube and doing chores, rinse and repeat, for over a month. All of my friends were two hours away by my college. I felt like there was nothing left for me to do with my life and that I only bothered other people.\n\nI downed a bunch of pills and vodka while watching youtube and crying that I\u2019ll never get to meet the person I was watching. I felt like an unproductive waste of space. I didn\u2019t want to waste my parents\u2019 money taking care of me, or my partner\u2019s energy helping feel better when I\u2019m upset, etc.\n\nSo the last thing going through my mind was AmazingPhil\u2019s diss track. I still can\u2019t watch that video without crying.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/axygio/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was/ehx34v1/"}
