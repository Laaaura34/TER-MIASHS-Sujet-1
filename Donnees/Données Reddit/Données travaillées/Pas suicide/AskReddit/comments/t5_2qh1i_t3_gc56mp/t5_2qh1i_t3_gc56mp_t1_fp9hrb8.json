Plus not being able to talk or move while listening to all my family and friends be told I most likely won\u2019t wake up hurt. It really hurts to watch your family and friends grieve your death. I can\u2019t even put that pain into words. Definitely an eye opening experience for me, and one I\u2019m glad that happened (even if it did happen in such a tragic fashion)", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/gc56mp/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was/fp9hrb8/"}
