I didn\u2019t recognize my own emotions at the time, refused to deal with them and just didn\u2019t accept help. At this point if people ask, I try to share just on the off chance someone seeing it has those feelings or thoughts. It\u2019s not even that I was failing at it, you just never really... get trained in that stuff? I just want to let people know there is love and support even when the world comes crashing down. It hurts to ask for it but sometimes that\u2019s what it takes to make it through the day!", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/gc56mp/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was/fpaqbgk/"}
