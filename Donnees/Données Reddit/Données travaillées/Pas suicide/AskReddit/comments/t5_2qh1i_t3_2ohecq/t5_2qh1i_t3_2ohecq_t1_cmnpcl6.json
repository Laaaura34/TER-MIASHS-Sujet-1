I'm done suffering through life, I'm done dealing with other people's shit, I'm done dealing with my own shit. I have no desire to continue. This will never get better. I'm 26, it's all downhill in my life from here. I don't want this anymore. How do I do it? Don't want my brother to have to clean up splatter and don't want the noise so my gun is out of the question...what pills do I have? Oh, who's messaging me...what does he want...no I don't want to fucking talk about my day, JFC why do you care...how many fucking people do I have to explain this shit to? OMG fine, I won't kill myself tonight, but damn you people are fucking awful at saving the suicidal....\n\nAnd from there it spiraled upwards out of the suicidal pit. It became a matter of saving myself from other people's stupidity and incompetence.
