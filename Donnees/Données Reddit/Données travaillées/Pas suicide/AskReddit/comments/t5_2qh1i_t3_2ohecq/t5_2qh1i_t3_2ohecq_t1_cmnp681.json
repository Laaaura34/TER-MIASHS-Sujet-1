If anyone were able to handle it, they wouldn't kill themselves instead of choosing suicide. Life is shit most of the time for many, many people and not having to participate in it anymore is a better outlook than the alternative for many of those people.\n\nBesides: All the people in this thread who survived suicide will have their views on suicide influenced by that fact. People who stuck around after all found something that kept them from trying it again - so of course they're going to paint a rather positive picture.\n\nWe'll never hear of those people who killed themselves and were glad about it.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2ohecq/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_the_last/cmnp681/"}
