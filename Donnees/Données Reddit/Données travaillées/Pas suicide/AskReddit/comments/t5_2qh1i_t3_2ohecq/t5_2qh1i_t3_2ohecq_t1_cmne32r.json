There was a kind of half-assed snow like you get in between seasons, and the ground was muddy where it wasn't scabbed frozen. I don't know all that went into that thought, I knew I didn't want to fall in the mud, I knew that if I didn't die it'd be because I did something wrong, fucked another thing up, and that I'd have to live with the shame of failure, but not, at least, of having been a coward. I know now that suicide is cowardly. But at age fifteen, it seemed like the most noble thing to do, seeing the trajectory of my life (which of course I couldn't see where it led) and that I could maybe spare more resources from being wasted on me than already had been. Anyway there's no reason to bother with the accumulation of things that brought me to the middle of the Cleveland metroparks in a button-down shirt, and dress-shoes caked with mud as I sat on a branch and thought penultimately of what a shame it'd be to get this nice outfit all messed with earth. Smirking at the vanity of that idea, I slipped the rope around my neck, \"Don't fuck it up,\" and dropped right into a shallow brown puddle. The knot I tied to the branch came undone. Even though I thought I'd be upset at the failure, I really ended up laughing, first because of the anticlimax, but also because the end of the rope that had been knotted to the tree, lying before me, half in mud half in snow, reminded me of a flaccid penis.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2ohecq/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_the_last/cmne32r/"}
