Josh isn't old enough to remember me anyway.\" I'm starting to choke up a bit. I had just bought my girlfriend a promise ring, but I didn't think I deserved her. I smiled right before I put on the noose. \n\n\nJosh is my little brother. But after all of that happened, my little brother kept close to me. Our older brother left us some years ago and hasn't contacted us in years. He always asks why our brother left, and if it was his fault. \n\n\nAfter everything, I realized my brother would think that my death would have been his fault. Our mother is an ice queen. I didn't think she cared, but she constantly checked on me, and I caught her crying after the fact. Losing two children would have destroyed her. My stepdad freaked. I got the help I needed, found out I have bipolar disorder. Wasn't allowed more than a bit of medication for a while, just to avoid overdosing. \n\n\nI was pissed that my doctor didn't trust me, but I understand now. I've made a hell of a lot of progress. While the amount of pills I have right now (about three hundred or so) would probably kill me, I'm at the point where I'm pretty happy with how my life is. My family loves me, my girlfriend stuck by me, the big nerd. It still gets tough sometimes, but I've been through a hell of a lot. That wasn't my first attempt, but it woke me up. \n\n\nI've made a hell of a lot of progress since February. My doctor trusts me, which means a lot, he's a hell of a guy. Really happy to have him being the one to rely on when shit gets tough. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2ohecq/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_the_last/cmnkva6/"}
