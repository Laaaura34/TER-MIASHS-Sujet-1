You're just assuming that everybody needs to hear that and that you're doing the right thing \u2013 and you might be right with it.\n\nI can only speak for myself. I don't see suicide the same way that many other people see it. Life doesn't always get better. Not every life can be saved. Not every life has to be saved. Sometimes living is more painful and negative than a quick and painless death. And the thought of suicide is soothing. It's a way out when everything else fails and that thought has a very positive effect on me. \n\nIt lets me sleep when I'm restless. It lets me relax when I'm afraid of the future. It doesn't mean that I'm going to do it. I'm not suicidal. But there *is* a positive side in knowing that it is an option, an alternative to a long unhappy life.\n\nHaving written all of this I know that it probably doesn't do anything for you to help you cope with the horrible way your cousin has chosen to end his life.
