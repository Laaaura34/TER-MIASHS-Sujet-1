I'm sick of all this shit and I just don't want to deal with it.  There's too much going on, and in the grand scheme of things, this doesn't matter much.  I'd rather be known as a good kid that lived a rough, but somewhat okay life than risk going on and fucking myself and everyone else over.\n\nWhen I actually nearly died in the hospital: Why is it so cold?  Why can't I stop shaking?  Why does this tube hurt so much?  Why are they trying so hard to save me?\n\nThings are a lot better now, but I had some really rough things to handle as a child that I finally understood the gravity of years later.  That, coupled with months of endless sickness, shit grades because of said sickness, and more family problems can really mess with your mind.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2ohecq/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_the_last/cmni1s3/"}
