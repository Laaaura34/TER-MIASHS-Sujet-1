I'd only ever taken two and two was enough to get me fucked up. So I thought maybe something terrible MIGHT happen if I took six, and it was like \"well I guess we'll see what happens\"... because I wanted to die, but not enough to take the whole bottle, it was all just fucking weird. Obviously I wasn't in a great state of mind.\n\nThe next thing I can remember is waking up on my couch with some finger monitor clipped onto my pointer finger, a paramedic staring at me, and several people in my living room. I still don't know who the fuck all those people were or how they got here, I only have two neighbors.\n\nAt some point my mom had come home and I told her what she did and she called 911, but I don't actually remember that, because well ambien.\n\nHilariously, I looked it up later and 60mg isn't even KIND of close to enough to be fatal. Even if I'd swallowed the whole bottle it might not have killed me. In fact with all the shit I was taking at the time, I managed to pick the least lethal option. \n\nAt the time it made sense though, because of how strongly those pills would affect me at just 20mg.\n\nAnyhoo, my life isn't particularly better or particularly worse now, but I didn't make any effort to try again. Remembering how scared my mom was leaving me alone for months after it happened, that's a good motivator sometimes.
