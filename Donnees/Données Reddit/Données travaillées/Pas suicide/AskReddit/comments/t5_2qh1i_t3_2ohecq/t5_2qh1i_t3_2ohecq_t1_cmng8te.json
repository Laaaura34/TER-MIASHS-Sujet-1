To answer OP's question, the one thing I was thinking as I stopped off of that ledge was: \"Fuck, it's cold.\" There was a cold breeze blowing off of the sea that day. It wasn't November-cold, it was FREEZING. It was ice cold, and I could feel that full-body cold everywhere, like the grave. Looking back, that cold gives me shivers, but it didn't bother me then.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2ohecq/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_the_last/cmng8te/"}
