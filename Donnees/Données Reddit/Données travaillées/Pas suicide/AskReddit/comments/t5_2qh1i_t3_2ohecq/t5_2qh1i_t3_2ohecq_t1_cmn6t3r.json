On the one hand, a few of the major stress factors are gone, but most remain and in addition to new ones. \n\nOn the other hand, my outlook has changed drastically. I don't put up with bullshit anymore. I openly recognize and embrace my shortcomings and failures rather than worrying about how they will make others perceive me. I strive to be better every single day. For me, and not for a anyone else, ever again. So when shit happens--as it inevitably does-- rather than freaking out about it I instead begin making plans to do something about it. Something my dad said to me many years ago is starting to become applicable everywhere in my life: \"it's not enough to be sorry; you must do something to make it right.\" He was talking about fucking up and actually doing something about it rather than saying sorry, but it can also mean that rather than just having an emotional response to a problem, you instead take action to improve the situation.\n\nMy life is much better now, even though I have more and greater stresses on me. I often look back and wonder how I got so torn up over little shit like that, but I remember that I was a product of my upbringing.\n\nWe all end up being shaped by our experiences.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2ohecq/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_the_last/cmn6t3r/"}
