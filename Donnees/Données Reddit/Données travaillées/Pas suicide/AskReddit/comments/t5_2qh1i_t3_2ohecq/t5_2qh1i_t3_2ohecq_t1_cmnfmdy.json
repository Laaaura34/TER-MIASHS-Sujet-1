So I don't really belong in this thread.\n\nI had my first panic attack in the back of some friends car; I was absolutely sure I was suffocating on the fluid in my lungs from a bronchitis. \n\nI had them stop, fell onto the sidewalk and reached the late stages of the attack-- very close to fainting, my fingers and toes cold and cramped, my tongue swelling to the point I couldn't talk, and at first I prayed and thought \"mommy!\" and then, abruptly, I took it back: said, \"I'm not praying for forgiveness. If there is a God, this is what I am and I've done what I've done.\"\n\nThen I started thinking of that poem, the one mentioned in Interstellar-- I didn't know the whole thing, just the last line: Do not go gentle into that good night, rage against the dying of the light.\"\n\nI repeated it, over and over, in my head, grunting, slapping my cold fingers to the ground while my friends thought I was having a seizure, repeating \"rage, rage, RAGE\" until the ambulance arrived and the tech got out, sat me up and just said \"Breathe.\"\n\nAnd then I did.\n\nAnd I was better.\n\nBut the lasting point, to me, was the knowledge that I was faced with what I thought was death and I fought for every last second.\n\nI will not go gentle into that good night.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2ohecq/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_the_last/cmnfmdy/"}
