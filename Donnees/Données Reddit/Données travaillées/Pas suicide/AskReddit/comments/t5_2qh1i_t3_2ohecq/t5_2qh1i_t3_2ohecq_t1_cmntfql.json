Maybe I shouldn't be saying this but the way to kill yourself with pills is to get some that fuck with your basic functions like breathing or heart. Taking a bunch of digoxin (which screws up the electrical signals to your heart) will fuck you up REAL fast. Not so fast but a great high would be a handful of Oxycontin that would stop you from breathing. Also, drinking a liter of Vodka and a handful of Valium is a great backup plan. Again, stops you breathing.\n\nBut ya, if ya want to go out real painful and with a lot of trouble, making it a real pain in the ass, take a bottle of Tylenol, flush your liver down the toilet. I wouldn't recommend it though.\n\nSuicide is a serious subject, duh, so I feel a bit uncomfortable sharing the above. People that do it are usually, from what I understand, in considerable pain, psychologically or physically, for a long period of time.\n\nBTW, one of the things about depression, when people typically think of suicide, is that thinking straight is very tough for some depressed people. Suicide may seem like a good solution when depressed, but once those people are not depressed they can think much better and see that suicide should have been like maybe 25th on their list of things to try before offing themselves.\n\nI've also seen people screw up their suicide attempts. One young woman tried to kill herself by crashing her car into a concrete abutment and ended up just crippling herself ending up as a paraplegic in a wheelchair.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2ohecq/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_the_last/cmntfql/"}
