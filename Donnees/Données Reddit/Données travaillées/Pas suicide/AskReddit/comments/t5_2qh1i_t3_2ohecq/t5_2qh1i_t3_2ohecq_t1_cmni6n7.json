I had taken off my shirt and tied the sleeves around my neck really fucking tight until I couldn't breathe and passed out. I was really fucked up in high school. My dad was a mentally abuse drunk, our house was about to be foreclosed on, my brother's health was getting worse, and I had no friends. It scares me even today to think about it, that I didn't want someone to find me. I just literally wanted to disappear from everyone's lives without them knowing. I wanted to just be gone. Luckily someone came into the bathroom not too long afterwards after I passed out. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2ohecq/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_the_last/cmni6n7/"}
