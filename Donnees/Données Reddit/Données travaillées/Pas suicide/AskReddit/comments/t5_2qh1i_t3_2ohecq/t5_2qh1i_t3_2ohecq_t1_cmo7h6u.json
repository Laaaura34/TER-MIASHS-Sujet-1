I stopped taking it when I realizd that although I was having no anxiety while I was on it, I wasn't having any fun either. It kind of turned me into an emotionless zombie. I'm pretty sure I was on a high dose. I just dealt with panic attacks from then on. 8 years later I still get anxiety and occasionally a panic attack but I prefer this to that.
