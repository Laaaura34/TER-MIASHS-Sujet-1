The thought of my mother reminded me that her mother had drowned when my mum was young, and I just couldn't go through with it. I couldn't make my mum deal with that again. I suddenly felt like my grandmother was there with me and I saw her face really clearly in my mind even though I've never met her or seen a good picture of her. That was enough to change my mind from \"nothing is stopping me this time\" to \"There is no way I can do this to my mum\". \n\nI found out several years later that my grandmother had committed suicide by drowning herself.
