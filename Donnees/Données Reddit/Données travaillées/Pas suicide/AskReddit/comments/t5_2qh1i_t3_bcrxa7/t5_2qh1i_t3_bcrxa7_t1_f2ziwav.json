I think you may have missed the point of what I was trying to say though- I\u2019m not talking about holding onto someone and being selfish and not letting them go. I was simply talking about my own experience with depression. It\u2019s not a \u201cone solution for all\u201d by any means. But in my experience, a situation is not forever. \nI imagine living with childhood trauma and schizophrenia is a MUCH different experience to the one I lived with. \nRegardless though, as hard as it is to keep fighting, I do hope that there\u2019s a light at the end of this dark tunnel for you.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/bcrxa7/serious_suicide_attempt_survivors_of_reddit_what/f2ziwav/"}
