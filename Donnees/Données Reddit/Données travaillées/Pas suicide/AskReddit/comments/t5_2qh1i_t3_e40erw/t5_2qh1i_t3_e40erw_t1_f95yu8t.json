I actually have long term damage from both attempts. For SOME reason I'm still alive, against all odds. \n\nI would tell those struggling to find the little things that make you happy. I actually started a list and have almost 200 things on it. Something as simple as toe beans or getting a package. Little by little you will start seeing the good. And trust me, I've lived through a lot of tough situations. \nI would encourage those struggling to please get help and you are not alone. SOMEONE cares. After my second attempt I had a random girl at school tell me how much she missed me. I never knew her name but we had a class across the hall from one another and I would often make small talk with her after class.
