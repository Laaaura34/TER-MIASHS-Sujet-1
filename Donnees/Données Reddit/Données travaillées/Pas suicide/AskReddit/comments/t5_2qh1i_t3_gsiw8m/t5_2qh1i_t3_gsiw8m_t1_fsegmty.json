Later that night the thoughts came back so i checked myself into hospital for the second time in my life.\n\nI was 17 both times, I cant remember what happened the first time but they were within 6 months of eachother. I was later told that I was in the middle of a mental breakdown, somehow i managed to get staight on my own with no help. \n\nIm still depressed but im 20 now and in a better place both physically and somewhat mentally, got away from all the toxic people in my life earlier this year and im trying to live myself a little bit at a time.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/gsiw8m/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/fsegmty/"}
