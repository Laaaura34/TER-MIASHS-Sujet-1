I woke up in the ICU feeling like fucking shit. That\u2019s what 3 bars of Xanax, a handful of valium, a week\u2019s worth of my antipsychotic medication, a week\u2019s worth of thyroid medication for my Graves\u2019 disease, half a bottle of nausea medication, half a bottle of Tylenol, and somewhere between 3 and 5 shots of tequila will do to you.
