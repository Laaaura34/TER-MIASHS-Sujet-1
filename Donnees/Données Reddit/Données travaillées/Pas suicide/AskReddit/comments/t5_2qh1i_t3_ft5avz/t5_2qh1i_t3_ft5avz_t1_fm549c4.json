I tried twice when i was 14 because i was being bullied at school and home, by swallowing a whole box of pills. 16 and 17  i was in an abusive relationship and was going to jump from the roof of my house at the time and 19 when my life was falling apart i had just started my knife collection and was going to stab myself in the neck. I was lucky enough to have someone who helped me through it that last time, and i believe that's why i'm still here. I used to cut my wrists a lot, so much so that i once ended up in a bathtub thinking i would die. I never went to hospitals for help, but i did go to therapists. I wound up on a mix of 10+ medications a day but a few years down the line i quit cold turkey and worked on it myself. I still get thoughts and tendencies, and sometimes they're so bad i have to tell my SO not to let me be alone, but it's a lot harder to get to that state now and i don't think (or i hope) i won't actually pull it off, because my life is finally getting a lot better.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/ft5avz/suicideattempt_survivors_of_reddit_what_triggered/fm549c4/"}
