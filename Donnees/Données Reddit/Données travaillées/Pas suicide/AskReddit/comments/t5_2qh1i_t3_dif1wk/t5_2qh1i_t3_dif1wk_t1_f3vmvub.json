I couldn't deal with leaving my family thinking I'd killed myself, so I drank, I smoked, I did drugs.  But it had to look like an accidental overdose, or some kind of accident.  I kept pushing my limit, but could never cross over that final line.  I eventually shattered my mind enough that I couldn't access the drugs anymore, and I had to have a long think about whether I wanted it badly enough to destroy my parents....  well, I'm here today, so you know what I decided.  The gradual nature of my \"attempt\" makes it hard to pinpoint a single thing that makes me glad to be alive, but laughter.  Real, lose control of your voice and nearly piss yourself laughter.  That makes everything seem just a little more worth it.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/dif1wk/suicide_attempt_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_the/f3vmvub/"}
