How lonely he'd be. How he'd come into my room and lick my face, trying to wake me up like he usually did. I didn't feel bad for my parents, or whatever human would find me. I only felt bad for my Lab, who would come running to my bedroom and jump on me to wake me up. I thought of him laying there with his head on me like he always did when he slept, just waiting for me to wake up.\n\nSo I threw up the 40 Vicodin I took and checked myself into the psych ward. My dog saved my life and didn't even know it.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/1yrorq/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_were_your/cfnana1/"}
