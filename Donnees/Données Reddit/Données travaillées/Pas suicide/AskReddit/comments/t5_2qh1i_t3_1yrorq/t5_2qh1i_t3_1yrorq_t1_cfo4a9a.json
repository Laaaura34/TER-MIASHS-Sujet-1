He's my little baby, even though he weighs 120 pounds. He follows me everywhere, he sits by the door from the time I leave for work until I get home, and only moves if he has to go outside and pee, then returns to his post at the door, he cuddles with me, he sits in the bathroom with me while I take baths. But the best part is when we go on walks, he doesn't need a leash because he stays right beside me the whole time. He doesn't even chase squirrels. He's the best :)", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/1yrorq/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_were_your/cfo4a9a/"}
