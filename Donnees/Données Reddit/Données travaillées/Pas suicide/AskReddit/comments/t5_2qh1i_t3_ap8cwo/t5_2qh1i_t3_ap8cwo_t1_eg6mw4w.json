That got me through the days and weeks after. I leaned on friends and my parents to keep me occupied and to cry with me on the bad days. I relapsed a few times, almost attempting it again and self harming. But I stopped trying to fight through the depression alone. I look back now and it's like I was a different person back then. I still have bad days, sometimes bad weeks, but it hurts far less than how it did back then. When I feel myself slipping, I immediately turn to the supportive people around me, especially my best friend, and we make time to just vent and cry. When I look around at the people that value me and focus on the things that I value, it gives me the motivation to keep going. I love trees and plants and I tell myself that there won't be trees and plants when I'm dead. It's a struggle but it's become less consuming and more of just an annoying and frustrating obstacle.
