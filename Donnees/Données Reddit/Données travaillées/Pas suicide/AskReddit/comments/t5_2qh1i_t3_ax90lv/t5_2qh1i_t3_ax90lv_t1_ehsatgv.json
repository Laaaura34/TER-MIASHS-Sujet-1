My dad. \n\nI was about 16. I tried to OD one day, and he came home from work early. He found me in the bathroom and had a whole Moment\u2122. Once he found out what I took and how much, he drove me to the hospital, praying the whole time. Obviously, I made it and got the help I needed.\n\nMy dad has never once judged me for it, his only comment about it was that he was sorry that I felt so lonely that I thought no one would understand. He talked to me about his suicidal tendencies as a teen, and how important it is to know that you're more than those thoughts and to get help.\n\nHe's really sick now (in the late stages of heart failure, too weak for a transplant), and this is something I think about often. I love that man and I'm thankful every day that he came home early. He's taught me a lot over the years, but this one literally saved my life.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/ax90lv/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_saved_you/ehsatgv/"}
