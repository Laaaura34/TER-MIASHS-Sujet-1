Plus I had alcoholic parents that mentally abused me. My mother was just...horrible. \n\nAnyway, within the last three years I went through my ex husband cheating on me, my mother stealing a lot of money/items from me, family drama, being hormonal from pregnancy and then after having the baby having severe postpartum depression. I went to my doctor several times crying, telling her I wanted to die and she tried me on a couple meds and then just takes me off everything. I've been on antidepressants since I was 16/17. It definitely didn't help. I would wake up crying and couldn't take care of my baby. I never felt that low. I felt pathetic that I couldn't be normal and couldn't care for my child. I wanted it to be over. I felt that my baby would be better off not knowing me. So on several occasions I would just be in the living room and just dart in the kitchen to the knives. My SO never left me alone and never let it happen. \n\nBut I got into a new doctor and I'm not 100% better. Still going through to find the right meds. Trial and error. And sorry, I know it sounds so pathetic! But that's kind of the TL;DR of it.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2dpvdz/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_are_your/cjrwtpn/"}
