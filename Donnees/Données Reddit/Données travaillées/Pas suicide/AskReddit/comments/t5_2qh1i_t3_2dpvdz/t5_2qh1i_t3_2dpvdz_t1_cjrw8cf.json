Once when I was pretty young, 12 or 13, and all I had was a bottle of vitamin D pills, because I didn't go outside due to my depression. But damn if I wasn't going to try to off myself by consuming too much vitamin D. Didn't work. I just got really tired and had a little nap.\n\nThen a while later, around 15 or 16, I tried to slit my wrists in the shower. I had already cut myself before so it wasn't the blood or anything that got to me. But, I couldn't get deep enough with your standard razor (which is all I used to cut before). I ended up getting really frustrated and throwing the razor at the wall, promptly slipped on spilled shampoo, had a tumble, and sprained my ankle. Hobbled out of the shower embarrassed.\n\nThe last time was when I turned 18 (a year ago). I actually tried getting someone to help me this time. It was my then boyfriend, and he was pretty much the worst person, so he agreed \"to end my suffering\". He put a pillow over my head and leaned on it with the force of a thousand dandelions. I laid there contemplating why this fool was given a penis, and just kind of pushed him off and went for soup. \n\nIt was cream of broccoli. Pretty good stuff.
