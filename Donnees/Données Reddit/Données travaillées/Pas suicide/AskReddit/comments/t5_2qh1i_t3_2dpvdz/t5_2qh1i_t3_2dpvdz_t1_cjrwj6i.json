I've told people before where I am now because of my suicide attempts.. The long story short is I met my girlfriend in a psychiatric hospital, STILL in a children's home, I have virtually no contact with my parents and brothers and sister, Live 5 hours from my home (Somerset, UK). People says it gets better - Oh yeah, it does. But it's only gotten worse for me now since I went to hospital.\n\nDon't ever try to kill yourself - It fucks you up, puts you on lists and labels. I don't know about over the pond but in the UK, the NHS has incredibly poor funding for Childrens Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS)...They have no idea what to do, but fair play to them because nobody really knows what to do when someone is feeling suicidal.\n\nIf anyone DOES want to hear my incredibly long story, ask me for it, I didn't want to type it out again just for nobody to hear it.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2dpvdz/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_are_your/cjrwj6i/"}
