But I actually moved across the country to be with him, and his family took advantage of me by way of not working and having me pay for food and things. I got a job I hated so I could support people I barely knew. \n\nAnd him helping me was actually *his suggestion*. We talked about it and he agreed it should be him to do it. I decided it would be easier than trying to do it myself (i.e. my failed attempts before) and his main reasoning was to \"end my suffering\" because I was depressed and did not want to support his family anymore. \n\nIt wasn't to ensure he actually didn't hurt me, because he attempted to lay across the pillow with his full weight on it. He just didn't weigh much and his strength left ~~something~~ everything to be desired.\n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2dpvdz/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_are_your/cjrye1w/"}
