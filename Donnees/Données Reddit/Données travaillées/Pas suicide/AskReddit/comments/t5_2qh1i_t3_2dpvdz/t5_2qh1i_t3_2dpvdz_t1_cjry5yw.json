I was slipping in and out of consciousness until I woke up in a panic because I could no longer swallow my spit and it was suffocating me. I ended up drinking the water I'd used for cleaning watercolour brushes that was sitting on my desk (which made me VIOLENTLY ill soon after) I remember it was around 3am and I spent till sunrise sitting on the floor by my toilet slowly sipping water and trying desperately not to puke it back up.\n\nThen there was the time I had horrible insomnia and couldn't sleep for a week, took a walk to clear my head, passed out, got helped to the subway by people who just assumed I was drunk \n\nThe rest are mostly just anecdotal, not really full fledged attempts... \n-slit my wrists as a way to cope, freaked out when I couldn't stop the bleeding and assumed it was the end\n\n- passed out in a full bathtub after chain smoking a pack of cigarettes, somehow had the forethought to pull the drain so I just woke up the next morning very sore\n\n-spent months of highschool with my toes to the edge of the subway platform just waiting for a push, finally thought I'd worked up the nerve and the train I'm on runs over a classmate that apparently had similar thoughts, rode my bike the rest of the year \n\nSorry about the formatting, I'm on my phone and it's been a weird night/morning ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/2dpvdz/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_are_your/cjry5yw/"}
