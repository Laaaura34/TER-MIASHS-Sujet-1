The only nurse to check on me laughed as he asked, 'you're not trying to hurt yourself, are you?' when he walked in as I was digging through a drawer. I was. I found those weird popsicle sticks and broke them in half and tried to sharpen them and cut my wrists with that. It didn't work.\n\nI spent the next (?) hours delusional in a hospital bed, sobbing. When my parents finally came back I was so, so happy to see them. It took me weeks to actually acknowledge the severity of what I did. I still have a big gap in my memory. The only reason I survived was because I had posted some nonsensical 'goodbye' on my blog and my best friend at the time called the police from another country. \n\nThough I still struggle severely with mental illness, I don't want to die. I'm so thankful for life. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y60k6/"}
