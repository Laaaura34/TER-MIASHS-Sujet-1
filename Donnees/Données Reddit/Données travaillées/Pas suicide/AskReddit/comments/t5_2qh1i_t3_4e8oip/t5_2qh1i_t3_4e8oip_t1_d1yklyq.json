I've been in a few behavioral health facilities. I got my doc to put me back on lexapro at the begining of the year, but after a little less than a month, I knew it just wasn't working anymore. I caught myself and admitted myself into a facility knowing I may tank. \nI asked them, pleaded, for them to help me change to a different medicine. I've been on it before and I knew it wasn't doing what it had for me, doing what I needed. The next appointment they gave me to switch medicine was over a month away. Very frustrating. \nEvery stay I've had, though, has only been a few days. They always release me rather immediately. The last time I met one of the therapists in a group session, she mistook me for a student intern.\nMy family only supports when they are able to take the reigns. They don't agree I should be taking any medicine. They've also argued with much of the feedback I've received from the psychiatrists and doctors.\nIt's hard. I can understand at least part of your experiences. The best support I've ever gotten has been from those who have dealt with or still do experience the same things. It's much easier to confide in friends like that and work through things. \n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yklyq/"}
