What I didn't think through was the fact my body was going to reject them, and I started vomiting uncontrollably. I got really scared; I worried I wasn't going to die, but something bad was going to happen and I would have to live with it. So I went to the hospital, had to have activated charcoal put in my stomach via feeding tube(?) and then a day or two later I woke up. I spent a few days after that in the hospital because they were monitoring me for serotonin syndrome and I also had to wait to talk to a social worker because I was under 18 at the time. That whole experience is a bit of a blur and I honestly don't really think about it anymore and nobody besides my family who was around at the time know.\n\nWhat I do know is that the most painful part of the whole experience was seeing how it affected my family. Because of that alone I would never try it again, but I would be lying if I said I'm glad I was unsuccessful.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y4ta0/"}
