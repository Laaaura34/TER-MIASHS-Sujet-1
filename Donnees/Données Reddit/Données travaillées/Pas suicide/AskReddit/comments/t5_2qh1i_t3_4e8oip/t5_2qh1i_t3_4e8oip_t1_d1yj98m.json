I try to hide my depression from one of my closest friends because that is how he reacts to it and I feel fucking terrible when he does, because I get why he has this approach to it, but sometimes I just want to talk to somebody close to me about the dumb shit that goes on and the stuff I'm scared about. It doesn't feel like my friends know me well enough to help and I'm too worried about getting shut down (even if they are trying to help) with stuff like this or upsetting them to ask.\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yj98m/"}
