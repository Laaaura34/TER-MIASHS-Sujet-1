I help families build a game plan for their finances and the most important thing is to have enough insurance  coverage to cover funeral costs , debt and if you choose , to leave them enough to last em an certain amount of time.. And most policies have a limit of 2 years before your family can get benefits from suicide deaths..if you do it before then your family doesn't receive a cent. Hopefully you never try again.. But if you do keep that in mind cause family comes first.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ybdxx/"}
