Often used in conjunction with growth hormones, fragments of growth hormones and other peptides, it allows for massive amounts of growth.\n\nThe basically principle is that it cuts your blood sugar (carbs) so you keep ingesting nutrients and your body will use them much faster and more efficiently than someone normal / low insulin. It can be used throughout the day to keep your body want more and more food (again, carbs, but you intake protein and fats with it too) and you'll see yourself blow up pretty good. \n\nEdit: I've read Australia uses it a lot because steroids are a little harder to come by there but not exactly sure. I live in the US, specifically IL, and we can buy type R insulin without a prescription. $24.99 for 1000iu at Wal-Mart.
