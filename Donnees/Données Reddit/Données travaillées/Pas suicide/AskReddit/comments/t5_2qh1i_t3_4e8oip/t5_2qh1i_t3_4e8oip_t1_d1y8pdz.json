Shit like \"it's never worth it\" or worthless platitudes like \"killing yourself is never the right option\". \n\nThere's a lot of good answers here, so I don't think I'd be able to add anything of worth to OP's question, but I guess I'll say that those who have have not suffered through suicidal depression have no clue what it's like. No point of reference that could possibly compare. Like trying to comprehend what a billion of something truly means. I'll tell you, I came out through the other side after years of agony, but no matter how good my life gets, no matter what happens to me, it will never be worth it.\n\nIt was torture. A torture I couldn't escape, and I thought would go on until I died. A torture where I didn't even have the sanctity of my own mind to protect me. My brain was the torturer. In the end, most people have that, they at least have their mind as the one last place of refuge. I didn't even have that. \n\nNo amount of good that comes into my life, no amount of joy will ever be worth what I went through. If I was pulled back in time, and I knew I had to go through it again, I'd kill myself in a heartbeat. As of right now, I'm content, satisfied, with just not being in agony every waking moment.
