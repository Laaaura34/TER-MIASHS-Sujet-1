I never was at the point where I was going to do it.  I thought about it, I wanted to, so many times.  There was one time which I describe as the worst moments of my life, I had reached my lowest point and before I did anything I met two important people. My best friend and my girlfriend.  I owe my girlfriend my life, she truly saved me.  The bullying passed and all I became happier then ever before.  To all the people thinking about suicide, find someone, a friend. Talk to them, it passes.  Even if you think it will never get better, it does.  I'm now starting my own company to try to combat bullying and I never imagined my life could be this great!
