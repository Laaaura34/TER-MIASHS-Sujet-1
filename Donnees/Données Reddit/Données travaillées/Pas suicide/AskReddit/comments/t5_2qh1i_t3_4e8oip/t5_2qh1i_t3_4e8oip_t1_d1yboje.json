I was homeless for a spell and it really helped to get me back on my feet.  It was also comforting to know that even though I had zero cash, I could at least count on being able to have decent food.\n\nIt takes a while to go through the process, though.  In the meantime, there are probably resources nearby that can help with food in the short term, like pantries, churches, Salvation Army, etc.  It's humiliating (at least it was for me), but it's better than eating nothing.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yboje/"}
