If I could think of one thing someone could do to help me, it would be to make me help someone else. Drag me along to a volunteer event or walk me through signing up to donate to something. This might be my own opinion, but my depression stems from a feeling of utter uselessness to the world. I think helping someone who needs more help than I do would make a world of difference. Perspective is important, and tilting the camera outwards might help your friend like it would help me.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yetdt/"}
