That's another phrase I hold to the highest: \"I'm proud of you\". \n\nIn my line of work, I've learned the power that phrase holds. It changes lives.\n\nI am proud of myself. And I'm proud of you. We have found similar healing in different situations, but battling equally powerful demons.\n\nIf I could meet you in real life, I'd consider you a great friend. Your post has helped many, including some who didn't realize they needed it.\n\nI'm happy you are out there in the world. I'm happy I've made you proud with my accomplishments. I'm happy you gave me the chance to say things I need to say. I really can't express how important you are in the world, just by being who you are. You're a beautiful person. That beauty makes me okay.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7z6h/"}
