I had the means to and I set a date. What I like to consider a miracle occurred. I had been severely depressed and cut off contact with a lot of my friends to \"soften the blow\", so to speak. Out of nowhere one of those friends contacted me on Facebook, and I still remember what he said to me: \"Hey. I feel that we should talk sometime. I feel concerned with you and I just want to check in on you. If you need help with anything, I'll be open to talk.\" Let's just say that the way I ended our friendship had been harsh, so I kind of wondered why he was suddenly reaching out to me. I decided fuck it, you only live once (and that I only had a few hours left to live at that point), and ended up messaging him back. We talked on Skype for several hours. I made no mention of the suicide and probably acted pretty normal, but I suspect he knew something was going on (based on his message).\n\nNow, I needed that to preface what my first thought was after I ended the Skype call: \"Oh my God. I can't kill myself tonight. He'll have to live with that forever.\"\n\nI decided to postpone the date. That date has come and gone, and I'm still here.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8qxr/"}
