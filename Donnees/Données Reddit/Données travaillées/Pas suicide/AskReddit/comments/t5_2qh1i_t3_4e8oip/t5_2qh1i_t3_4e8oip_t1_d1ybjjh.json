We will live and die and the universe will be none the wiser and it will not mourn us. BUT this changes nothing from our perspective. We DO mean something to those around us and those that interact with us. We DO affect change, no matter how small and the universe is forever different simply because we exist. We are all members of the human race, and though perspectives range on every topic imaginable we have a heart at the very depths of humanity that beats as one. When you hurt, I hurt. \n\nAt some level I feel your pain, as you feel mine. I empathize with you as a human being on a level that extends beyond the physical, beyond the emotional. You are important to me, and the fact that I interact with you now over doing literally anything else on earth is testament to that. The fact that for even a brief flash our lives intertwine on some level is remarkable, considering I have no idea who you are, what you do, or where you are from. \n\nDo not be disillusioned in the sea of humanity on earth. You are important and you are worth more than you give yourself credit for. Your potential merely requires the right key to unlock. You will succeed, and humanity will revel with you in your success and weep for your passing.
