If you are feeling like you are not coping, please know that there are resources out there available to you.\nThere are crisis services worldwide that are trained to provide support. These centres are designed to give temporary relief from feelings that are overwhelming you and while they are unlikely to fix any underlying problems, can help you get through a tough hour/night/week.\nOtherwise, if you feel like you may be suffering from a mental illness or your thoughts/feelings are making it hard to cope, I strongly recommend trying to find an appropriate professional in your area. Just as you would see a doctor when you are sick, you deserve to take care of your mental health.\nStay safe people.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ycgw4/"}
