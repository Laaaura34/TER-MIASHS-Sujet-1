Common events like riding home from church would have me looking wistfully at the door handle, thinking how easy it would be to slip out onto the highway.  \n\nI only acted on it after a situation went from physically abusive to emotionally ridiculous (I was 18, and my much larger brother unexpectedly turned and started wailing on me, pinning me down, repeatedly punching me in the face. The part that really hurt was my mom walked down after hearing me screaming, saw puddles of blood, and didn't stand up for me. Even though my brother had his own place a couple hours away, he stayed at home, just watching T.V. with the family like it was a normal evening.) \n\nBack to the topic, I felt so overwhelmed that I created a concoction that obviously failed. \n\nI never told them. I decided to pack my things and move in with my boyfriend (who was a piece of shit). We lived together for almost a year before I could no longer stand his drug dealing, and inability to pay rent. I moved back home where I was treated like the prodigal son, because to the outside world I had simply shacked up with my loser boyfriend. \n\nI've never told anyone the full story. Kind of embarrassing. Kind of an \"impostor syndrom\" thing going on. \n\nI'm married with two kids, and I haven't had a suicidal thought in about five years. I guess because I've been busy doing life. \n\nAnyway, thanks for the prompt... I guess a psych would probably tell me this is emotionally healing? \n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ye6dv/"}
