Just thought we may have had similar issues. For me figuring out why was huge. It took me years to figure out and it wasn't to any event or person in my life. \n\nFor me it was about letting go of the idea of happiness, and just being content with my life the way it was.

Ofcourse I had to hit rock bottom for that to happen (substance abuse, stealing, pushing everyone away).\n\nIt wasn't until I had nothing left that I realised that I didn't really want anything out of life. So I may aswell just start living it the way I wanted, Which is to basically do as little as possible.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y5pj0/"}
