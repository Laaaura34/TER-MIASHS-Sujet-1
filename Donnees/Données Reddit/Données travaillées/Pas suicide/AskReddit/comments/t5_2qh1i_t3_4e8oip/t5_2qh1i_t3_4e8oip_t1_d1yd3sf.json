I fucked that up too. Jesus, look at the bandages, I'll never be able to live a normal life. Fuck. Next time I'll get it right\"\n\nThen I met a guy in the psych ward who shot himself in the head and still survived. He couldn't really talk or walk, but they let him play a guitar and he was pretty great. I met another guy who slit his wrists because he found his child dead under the Christmas tree, electrocuted by the lights. Those two really put things into perspective. It's 9 years later and my life still isn't where I want it, but I now have a wife and 15 month old son that I love.
