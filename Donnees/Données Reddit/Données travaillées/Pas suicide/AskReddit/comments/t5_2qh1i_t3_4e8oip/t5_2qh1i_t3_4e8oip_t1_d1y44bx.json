And most mentally ill people either won't want to change, don't see a problem or, in my case at the time, think that change is even possible. Like I explained in another comment, I don't know what it is that worked for me, I just kind of felt it in the hospital. Since I've realized I had a problem, I've gotten in the right meds, opened up to my family, and started exercising more. But I just needed that initial push, and I honestly don't know what it was, but things have been wonderful since I got out and I hope I can be a resource for those who need it like I did back then.
