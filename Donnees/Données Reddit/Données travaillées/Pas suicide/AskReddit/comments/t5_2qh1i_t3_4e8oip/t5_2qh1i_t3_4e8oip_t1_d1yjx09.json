It's not ok, but I can't fix her either. All I can do is love her and have boundaries. \nAbove all, I don't have to make the mistakes she did or the ones done to her. I can break that chain. Your wife can as well.\n\nBoundaries are HARD, but accepting and learning has made a relationship with my mom possible. It's very flawed and sporadic, but it's there when I can handle her and I'm at peace with the distance when I can't. \n\n**edit** also yes, if your daughter ever sees the bad or is in danger of being affected GET. OUT. \nI have ZERO happy memories from living with my parents when I was young and they were trying to work it out. I have even worse stories of the verbal and emotional abuse from my ex stepfather when my mom was trying to make things work with him.  \n\nChildren are so susceptible. (seriously. that book is amazing.) I wish my parents had never been married and my mother should have left my stepdad long before she did. Those are not things you forget.
