Mother told me twice to kill myself and that if she could go back, she wouldnt have married my dad nor had any kids. So I found a rope in my dads tool shed, went into the woods, and tried to hang myself from a tree. The rope was old, so it snapped from rubbing on the bark. When I hit the ground I heard laughter, which at the time I thought was the gods (I was Graecan) laughing at my failures and denying me my escape; ive since realized that it was my own hatred of myself and my inner demons, and am now a 20 yr old reformed Christian, with a beautiful girlfriend I am planning on proposing to soon.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ymyo1/"}
