I've always wondered if he instantly regretted it or not, especially since I know he probably had a few moments before he lost consciousness [Details (trigger warning)](/s \"He hung himself from a tree and basically strangled himself since it wasn't a snap-your-neck hanging; then taken off of life support after there was no brain activity detected after being in the hospital a few days\"). It sounds like almost everybody here regretted it immediately and that confirmation has hit me hard today. This may be the first time that I've gone past being \"teary-eyed\" at a Reddit post and arrived at full-on tears. Thankfully, I'm working from home today and I can let it out. I think my sadness comes from wishing he would've reached out to me, and wishing he knew I would've done anything for him.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yh8n9/"}
