I had been getting bullied for years and I didn't really care or think of it much till recently and it got to me so much that I couldn't take it. If you saw what I had posted earlier I said I had drank to try and kill my self but it didn't work, so I did the same thing but tried lean and other drugs with it. As it had hit me before I was even dead I felt dead, but I finally had passed out. I woke up the next day maybe at 7-8 in the evening, my parents and brother had been gone the whole weekend and I woke up and just started vomiting everywhere. After that I still felt off, and sick almost but nothing of the night before and it scared the shit out of me. It made me realize that I could get through it and I just need to tough it out. \n\nI'm glad I'm here today.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yk134/"}
