There was some evidence when he died that he'd changed his mind in the last few seconds. At the viewing, people commented on the scrapes on his nose from falling on his face, presumably trying to reach the telephone he'd knocked off a table nearby. \n\nI've been suicidal maybe twice, depressed since he died (I'll be 40 next month). I don't remember \"before\" well, but my mom said recently that my personality changed pretty significantly. Reading these comments is comforting somehow. Not sure what else to say.
