It's a constant worry that she'll end it, but I think the best thing to do is not to tell them what to do. Just try to comfort them if they need it, but also give them all the love they could want without having to mention it. \n\nThis same friend was recently sexually assaulted again and the last thing she wants to do is talk about it. So what do I do? I don't talk about it. Instead, I'll share funny videos with her, leave my line open to talk and just try my darndest to make her laugh even if she's a continent away. Through all of that, I also tell her frequently how much I love her both in passing and in those serious and intimate moments. When I was struggling with my own assault, I knew that that validation that I was loved meant so much more to me than being told \"it gets better.\" By and large, anyone not a victim won't know how it feels to go through that, and on top of it, it is humiliating to be victimized. Just show them all the love you feel for them and then some. It isn't easy, we're all super busy, but the smallest gestures of comfort and affection go the farthest. It's like that psychologist Mazlow wrote in his hierarchy of needs, we need love, safety, and belonging to live a fulfilled life.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ycgie/"}
