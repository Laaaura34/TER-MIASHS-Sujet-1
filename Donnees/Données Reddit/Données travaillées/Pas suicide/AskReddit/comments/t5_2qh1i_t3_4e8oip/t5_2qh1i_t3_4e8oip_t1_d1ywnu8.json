My first thought was \"damn, I didn't take enough.\" My depression is entirely brain chemistry, I have a loving family, great friends and nothing truly traumatic, but it's almost worse because of it. Most people who survive suicide feel better, they realise that all their problems are fixable and life can move in. Mine isn't. There is a part of my brain, now and forever, telling me that I need to die. It tells me that life isn't worth living and even if it was, I don't deserve to live it. It's been six years since I tried, and I still think it every single day. It will never stop.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ywnu8/"}
