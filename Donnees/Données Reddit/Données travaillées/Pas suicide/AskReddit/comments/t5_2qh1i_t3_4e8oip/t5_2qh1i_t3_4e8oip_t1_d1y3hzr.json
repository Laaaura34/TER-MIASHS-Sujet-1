All I remember from the first part after it is wanting things to go back to the way they used to be before all the bullshit in my life started, wishing it had worked, and just wanting to sleep for a very long time until everything was okay. \nI was 18 and in an a relationship that that was abusive in every way possible except physically. I have no doubts that it would have turned physical if I hadn't left. And I only left after he raped me. That was over 5 years ago. Things have gotten better but you don't forget or leave behind something like that. Most days are fine but there are some I just can't handle certain things. Nights are the worst. I've had multiple exes tell me I have nightmares far more often than I remember. My dog helps me out with that now though, she's learned to wake me up if I'm having a really bad one.
