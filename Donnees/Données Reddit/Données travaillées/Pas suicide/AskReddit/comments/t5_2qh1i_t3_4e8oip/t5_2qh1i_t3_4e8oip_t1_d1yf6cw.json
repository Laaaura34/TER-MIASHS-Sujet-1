I don't know why, but that knife could pierce my skin. I threw the knife down on the ground crying because I realized what had occurred. It's like I knew it wasn't answer but I still thought it would solve all my problems. It was life changing. My dad won't convince himself I tried to do. But it's who I am and what has defined me. I'm me. Please, if there's no one out there to talk to, talk to me. It isn't worth it at all. \n\nI'm so happy I'm alive today and I actually run my own clothing company dedicated to self health and positive self esteem. Shameless plug to it, but www.happyoutfitters.net\n\nI'm trying to create a more national recognition. Suicide and depression needs to be talked about more. I don't want anyone to ever be there, no one needs to take their own life. The world is beautiful and there's just so much to see and so much to experience.
