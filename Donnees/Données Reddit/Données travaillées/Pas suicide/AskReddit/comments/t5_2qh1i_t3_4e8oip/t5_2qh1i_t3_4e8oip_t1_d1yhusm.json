I've done a lot of drugs, but nothing feels stranger than ODing on benadryl. The idea of quantum suicide is what really kept me from trying again. If there's always a version of myself that survives the attempt, and that's the one I experience every time, then there really is no point in trying to kill myself. I'm gonna die when I die and there's nothing I can do to make it happen any faster. Except smoke cigarettes and do as many drugs as possible. After this attempt, that's exactly what I did. \nThen I tried LSD and life was pretty cool again. For a while. \n\nI've been fighting the urge to kill myself for over a decade and I'm pretty sure I always will. Even when things are nice it always feels like things would be easier to just be dead. \n\nI hope you all find happiness, or at least a way to cope. Making everything a joke helps me cope. I'll keep fighting the good fight, whether I want to or not. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yhusm/"}
