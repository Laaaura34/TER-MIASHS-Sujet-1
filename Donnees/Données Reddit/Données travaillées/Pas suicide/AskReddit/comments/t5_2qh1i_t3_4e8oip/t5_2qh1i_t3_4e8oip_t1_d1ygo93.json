And the need to breathe. I was exhaling the contents of my stomach at the time. The pure primal panic took hold and I was just spewing tablets everywhere. Then I passed out for a bit, then I woke up covered in puke. \n\nThen I crawled back into the house ( I went to the shed to do the deed) and crawled into bed. No one really seemed to notice anything had happened, my house mates just thought I was sick and I was FUCKING sick for about 4 days. At first I wondered if I was still going to die because it felt that bad, and then as I got better I just decided that taking a cocktail of all the pharmaceuticals you can find is a stupid way to try and off yourself so I put the decision off until I could find a better way. \n\nAnd then I never did. \n\nIf my house mates every suspected anything they never said or did anything about it.
