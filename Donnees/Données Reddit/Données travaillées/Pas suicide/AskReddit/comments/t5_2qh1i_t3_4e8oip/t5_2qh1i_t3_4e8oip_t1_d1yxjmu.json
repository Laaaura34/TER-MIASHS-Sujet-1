I've posted a small part of my story in RBN, but my dad actually threatened \"to bash my head into the f***ing wall\" when I tried to OD at 15.  I got no mental health treatment or even basic medical treatment after taking a full bottle (about 30 pills) of Tylenol w/ codeine.  \n\nI backed out when I could actually feel (what I thought was) my body shutting down and got scared.  \n\nIncidentally, I tried a year later and was in a daze/stupor for about two weeks.  This time around I told my parents that I just took several bottles of pills because I was trying to get high.  They bought my story (despite my not having a drug problem...) and left me alone.  I kept trying through these two weeks (more pills, hanging but the belt broke).  I'm not sure what made me stop or calm me down.  No medical treatment here, either (I have no clue how I'm alive), but no threats to bash my head in.\n\n\nHave you ever talked to your dad since that happened?  I tried asking my mom myself, and I just got some really baffling responses, including *but you don't understand.  After we sent you back to bed* (despite me being unable to throw up the pills and having them still in my system), *we* **cried**.\n\n\nSome people have no business having children.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yxjmu/"}
