Compared to hanging, drowning, jumping, slashing, or impaling, OD'ing sounds like a better option in that regard.  And it's easier to do and access than other (relatively) quick painless methods like a gun to the head.\n\nThat and the elaborate plans are probably due to a desire for their death to be a last effort for anyone who happens to find their body to care or recognize them.  Some may want to look presentable for that.\n\nOf course though the final moments can still be extremely painful with anything that potentially fucks up your biological chemistry.  Especially if you live through it.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7od4/"}
