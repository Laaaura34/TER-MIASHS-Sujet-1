Not ADHD. ADHD medicines generally are not interchangeable for the meds that could actually help, but my doctor was a quack and diagnosed me with a ton of weird disorders to explain the side effects of my mismedication.\n\nEventually he got sued for bogus diagnosis of minors and he shredded all of his papers.
