He had a regular who was an alcoholic veteran who would call in after drinking excessively. Typical burned out medic response would be to shove him in the truck and ship him up to the hospital, everyone rolling their eyes at the inconvenience. Boyfriend went out of his way to talk to him and listen to his story. They smoked a couple cigarettes together before they got in the ambulance. The patient died in a house fire last year, boyfriend was heartbroken. He went to the scene the day after and ran into the patient's girlfriend who said he remembered him for treating him respectfully and spoke about him sometimes. He was probably one of few if any people who treated him like a real person, and that's powerful that the patient knew that before he died. I've never been prouder.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ygm0g/"}
