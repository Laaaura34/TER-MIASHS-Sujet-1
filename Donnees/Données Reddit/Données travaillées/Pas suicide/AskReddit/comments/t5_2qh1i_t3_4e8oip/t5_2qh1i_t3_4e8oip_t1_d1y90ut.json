I took 40 or so pills (and I threw up some of them an hour later or so because my friend convinced me to)\n\nI remember waking up and thinking along the lines of faking sick so I didn't have to go to work experience for the day, but my mum came in to wake me up and saw all the pill packets and my \"I'm sorry\" note and called an ambulance.\n\nOn the way the paramedics tried to keep me awake, but I just ignored them and went back to sleep. In fact I spent most of the day and a half hospital stay asleep. The only times I did wake up was when my dad visited with muffins, and overnight where I constantly had to get out of bed to pee.\n\nIn some ways I'm glad I didn't die that day because I went on to meet some amazing people and have some really unique experiences.\n\nThis event shaped me for the better I believe though, I got the help I needed, I got my diagnoses of Aspergers, depression and anxiety which helped me to realise why it was so hard for me to relate to people.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y90ut/"}
