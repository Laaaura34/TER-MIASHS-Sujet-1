I was parked in a lot near this beatiful park I'd grown up next to at like 3 AM. My mom was concerned about me, sent a neighbor to look for me, and they just happened to see my vehicle while driving around the neighborhood. \n\nThe worst part is having everyone around you know, and be ultra sensitive and weird, like you haven't already gone over the edge and anything they say will tip you that way. Plus,  the nurses get all angry at you at the hospital. \n\nI won't say I regret it, or that things ultimately get better, because I don't know if they do.
