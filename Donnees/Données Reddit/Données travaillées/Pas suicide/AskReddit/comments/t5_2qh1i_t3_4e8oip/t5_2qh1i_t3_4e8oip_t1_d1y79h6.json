The rope I had tried to use was way too weak. My dad had always said I was no good at tying knots. I guess he was right. I sat down and looked at my shoes for about 15 minutes. \n\nIt was so surreal, building the last God only knows how many months of depression into one conscionable action that would decide my fate, and to fail that action created quite a cognitive dissonance in my life. It wasn't the end of my depression and it wasn't the end of my suicidal thoughts but it was a significant roadblock to them taking over my life\n\nI had rope burn around my neck for a few days and I had hit my shoulder when I had fallen so immediately after I had put the rope and stool away, cleaned up what little there was to, I sat down at my table and just kinda stated into space, not really thinking of anything but thinking of everything simultaneously. \n\nIt was weird and I'll never forget the exhilaration of actually being alive after that. I've felt depression, and thought suicidal thoughts since but that memory, the rope burn, the stool and the weird way the sun had shone on the wall in my kitchen after I had tried came back to me and each time I tried a different way to fight it. \nIf I've learned one thing since its that you can fight it, but it's hard. I nearly lost but you can fight it. You just have to try.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y79h6/"}
