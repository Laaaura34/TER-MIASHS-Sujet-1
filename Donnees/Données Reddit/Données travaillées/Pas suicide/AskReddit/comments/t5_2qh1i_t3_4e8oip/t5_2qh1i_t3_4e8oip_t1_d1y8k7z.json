Disappointment and more sadness. Then sensational euphoria. Almost like an explosion of sensory information. Came to in an ambulance. I was unconscious  hanging with a rope around my neck for 7 minutes, my mom walked in early from work and found me. She called 911, got recesitated 3 minutes later since an ambulance was down the street for an epileptic man. Disappointment was the biggest feeling and then what I can describe as an adrenaline rush almost. Like the blood just came back to my brain in a wave. I'm still fighting depression to this day even with drugs and therapy. I can't say I'm happy, more so that I don't want to leave my family destroyed and sad now, something I understand better now. If I didn't have family or friends, I'd be gone. If anythings worth suffering for, it's so my family and friends  stay strong. I'm glad other people who survived don't feel like I do, it's just not my reality. Good luck to you other survivors, I wish you a better life.
