I overestimated the height of the tree. She brought me to the hospital and wasn't mad at all actually. My mom never knew what happened. I just told her I had fallen off the tree accidentally. I was 14, which was 2 years ago. My 16th birthday is in the first week of May and I still hate myself with every passing day.
