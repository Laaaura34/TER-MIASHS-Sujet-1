No one ever checked in on me, only complained about the smell when I came out of my room to go to the hospital. I was told to stop being a whiny bitch about everything when I told her what I did and to knock it off. She then left to go visit her pedophile husband in jail because that's what you do when your grandkid tries to kill themselves.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y4tk4/"}
