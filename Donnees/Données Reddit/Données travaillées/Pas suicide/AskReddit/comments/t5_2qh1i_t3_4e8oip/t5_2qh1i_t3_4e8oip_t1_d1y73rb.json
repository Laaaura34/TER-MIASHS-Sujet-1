I bled a lot. So much, that I was unconscious when my father found me. I vaguely remember him wrapping it and taking me to the hospital. I remember feeling mostly shame. Not only was I a failure to my father, but also to myself. Such loss and grief pushed me to that point. So much, that I felt as though ending it all was a viable solution.
