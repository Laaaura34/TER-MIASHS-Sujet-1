I've always wanted to talk to a person with a hard life that drives them to the edge. Im going to college very soon and my school life has brought me over to a couple of different roads. Some are less traveled and others are being blazed as we speak. I'm looking to pursue either a career in psychology or medicine. I only wish to talk to you ( or anyone who is on hard times) so I can decide whether or not I would like to help people going through such things. If you choose to message me, I hope you find some resolve that you will help another person decide what they will do with their life. Regardless, I will be helping people with either mental pain or with physical.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yeel8/"}
