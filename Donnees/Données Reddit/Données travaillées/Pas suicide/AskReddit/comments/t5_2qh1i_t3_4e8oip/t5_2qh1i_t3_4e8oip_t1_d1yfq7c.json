I was in a panic when I got the call from the school and immediately started calling therapists and hospitals. I was frantic to get her help...\n\nThis was 4 years ago and although she is doing better (but not better) she still says, \"You were terrible to me when I was suffering. I came home from school and you were talking to doctors about having me put in a hospital. You should have done something.\"\n\nWhen I ask what that something should have been, she gets mad and says we were/are terrible parents. \"You should have known what to do.\" \n\nBut we didn't. My only thought was to get her some place safe where she couldn't hurt herself. \n\nIt still bothers me that she feels we aren't loving and supportive, yet, in therapy, when we bring it up, she can't articulate what that looks like.\n\nI grew up in a very non-emotional, dysfunctional house. We weren't affectionate at all. It would likely get you hit or mocked, to show any emotion or vulnerability.  \n\nI tried to do what I thought was best. I tried to get her help. To me, that was loving and supportive.\n\nI know it's perspective, but as one who went thru this, what could we have done better/differently.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yfq7c/"}
