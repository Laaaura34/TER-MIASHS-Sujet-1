I have so many people wanting something from me, sometimes I look for ways to get time alone to be with myself and do what I like best, meditate. Alone :) Many years ago what I most desired was to have friends and family who wanted me and who loved to share themselves with me. When I got it, was I happy? Never fully happy :) But it's good that every one of us should get what we want, to see experientially if it can make us truly happy. If you want to bond with people, the key word is \"give\". Not material things, but thoughts and time. Get in groups and give them your most precious commodity, your kind attention. In this shitty world, truly there is no getting without giving :) <3", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y91aq/"}
