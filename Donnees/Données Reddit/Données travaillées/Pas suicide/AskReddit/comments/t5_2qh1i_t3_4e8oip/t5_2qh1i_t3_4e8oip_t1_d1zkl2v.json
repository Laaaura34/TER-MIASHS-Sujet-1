I was out for a fun with a friend and we saw a gentleman lying  under some trees. There is always an assumption that it will be a drunk person but we checked it out anyway and he had fastened a cord around his neck and was clearly asphyxiating. His lips were blue, eyes bulging, was twitching, he had clearly been crying and was in a bad way. I tried to remove the cord while my friend phoned an ambulance but it was digging deep into his neck so I cut it off with a penknife. As he came to he started fighting me, he really didn't want the cord taking off. His first thought was that he wanted to be left alone to die. When he slowly started to come around properly he tried to get up and run away but couldn't stand and I had to gently restrain him (he was so weak a hand on the shoulder was enough). \n\nI kept talking to him while we waited for help to arrive and when he finally filly regained consciousness he was ashamed and embarrassed at what he had done and kept apologising profusely for letting us see him this way. For me the most depressing part came afterwards, he was whizzed away in an ambulance and we never founs out how he was or what happened to him.\n\nIt was the day after Father's Day so that may have had something to do with his suicide attempt but I don't think we will ever know. I am just glad we were running along a deserted bit of the river at the time or he would have died without a doubt.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1zkl2v/"}
