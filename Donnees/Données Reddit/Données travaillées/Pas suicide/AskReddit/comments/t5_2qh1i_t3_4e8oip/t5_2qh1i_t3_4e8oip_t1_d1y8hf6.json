Not because of my failed attempt. Not because of my depression but from the sheer pain I felt from my injuries. I had tubes all over my body and I remember trying to pull out the tubes because I thought that would end all the pain I was in. As a result of that the Nurses had to tie my hands to the side of my bed. \n\nI ended up with a calcaneum fracture, a broken lower jaw, half my nose was torn off and pneumonia which worsened into pneumothorax. I had 13 bags of blood transfused into me during my stay in the hospital too. \n\nI don't know if it was the pain or whatever but after I was discharged 3 months later I actually got happier. I think it was because in the hospital I managed to say everything I held inside to my parents and cry all the tears I held back throughout the years. I wouldn't say I'm okay now because I don't think that feeling will ever go away. But I can say that I'm happy with my life now. I know it's not the answer most people expect and it's definitely not a good way to turn your life around but I just wanted to share.
