I was five or six and was in first grade or preschool, and I always talked about wanting to die. Eventually I took out a knife. In my mind, I was going to put my head on the table and cut my neck like a guillotine.\n\nI have no recollection what happened next. Some time in the next few years, my mom said \"I thought you were really going to do it,\" and that's pretty much all I remember about it. \n\nI still think about killing myself every day.
