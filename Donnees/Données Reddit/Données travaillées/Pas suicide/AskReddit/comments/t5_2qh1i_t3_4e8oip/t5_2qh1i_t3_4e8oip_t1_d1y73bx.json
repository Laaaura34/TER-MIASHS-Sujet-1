My attempt was very similar to the OP, took a bunch of my sleeping pills, only vaguely remember the ambulance and my boyfriend looking and sounding terrified. \n\nWe only stayed together a few months longer. After we broke up I was so upset and furious with him for \"knocking me while I was down.\"  However, years later, I feel so grateful to him for staying as long as he did. I completely understand what you're saying about being afraid and not trusting her (me). I traumatized him. And he actually handled it with such grace for a young guy (we were only 20). He needed to take care of himself, no matter how much it would upset me in the moment. Honestly I don't think I would've gotten better if I was still with him for a long time after, leaning on him. I always wish I could call him up and thank him for everything he did and for being as mature as he was. \n\nSorry for the rambling. It's interesting seeing my situation, from different perspectives, and from totally different people in the world. We all have our shit.
