I had to take a year off which made me feel stupid. This should be my last semester but I have two more because if it. The break didn't even help, it wasn't until I was in the semester that I broke down again this semester that things truly fell into place. I'm glad Halloween decorating was a good step for you, and I'm glad you feel the same way about not isolating. It's a weird cycle; you're sad so you don't want to be around people, but not being around people who love you makes you feel sadder, so you isolate more. I did that for months. And it's not even that I wanted to die, per se, I just didn't want to be alive. But death was the only way I could achieve that. I'm so glad my friend called the police when I said goodbye and I'm so glad I still have most of my friends sticking by me. I've moved on; I'm doing well in school, I have a new girlfriend who is extremely supportive, and my family regularly tells me how proud they are that I'm doing so much better. I'm glad you're in the same boat. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ymdb2/"}
