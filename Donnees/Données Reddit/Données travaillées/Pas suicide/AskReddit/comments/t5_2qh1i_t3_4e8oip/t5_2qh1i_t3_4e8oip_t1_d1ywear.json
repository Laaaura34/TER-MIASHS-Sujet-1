Both brothers, my mother, myself, my stepdaughter twice in the past year and a half.. my best friend on a regular basis... etc, so this was very personal for me to read, I read responses for probably an hour.\n\nI just read someone else's response to their suicide attempt, and I hope it will be as profound for you, as it has been for me:\n\n\"You have your heart, and your lungs, your liver, your pancreas, your teeth, you have entire generations, populations of bacteria colonies residing inside of various parts of you, eyes, lips, skin cells, blood cells, down to a microscopic level there are all these various living components that all serve whatever function they are intended to. The sole purpose of all of these is to keep me alive.\nEvery second of every minute of every day, all of these various little bits and pieces of myself collaborate to keep me alive. Millions, billions of cells, hundreds of organs or appendages, all of them working for a single purpose, and there's just one single part of myself that wants me to stop living. It's ludicrous to think that for all the parts of me working actively to keep me alive, I should only ever listen to the one part of myself that wants me dead, even if it happens to be one of the few parts of myself that has a voice to express preference.\"", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ywear/"}
