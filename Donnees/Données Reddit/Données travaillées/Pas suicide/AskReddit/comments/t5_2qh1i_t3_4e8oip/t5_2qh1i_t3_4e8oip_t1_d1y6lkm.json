I put \"issues\" not because they aren't issues but to not incite that a person with mental problems is a problem themself. I don't know how to describe my thought properly but it wasn't to lessen that mental problems are an issue. \n\nAnd I never said that mental issues can be solved perfectly without medication. It's just my own experience that they can. I didn't say not to use medication. Inciting it is one thing but then it's left up to the reader to make their own judgement. I'll never tell someone to \"do\" or \"not do\" something. Although when we don't fully understand something I'm going to question what is considered the best practice. Shouldn't we all do that; question the \"best practice\" when the situation said best practice is affecting is not fully understand? If we don't fully understand that then it's possible there is a better practice.\nBy the way what is considered \"real help\"?", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6lkm/"}
