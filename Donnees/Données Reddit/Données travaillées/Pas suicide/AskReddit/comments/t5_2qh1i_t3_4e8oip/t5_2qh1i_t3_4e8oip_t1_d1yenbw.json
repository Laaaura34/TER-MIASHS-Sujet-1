It tells us that we are not worthy of being loved, but then going beyond it, that we are not worthy of life. But if you go deep enough, beneath the layers, no matter how clouded our hearts have become there is in all of us a light that finds a way to shine even a single ray through. We have to find that ray of light and follow it back to its source, experiencing and knowing our true inherent Beauty. Out of this emerges a deep sense of value, value that is not dependent on anything external to us, such as social approval or wealth. And out of knowing your inherent value emerges a deep sense of meaning and purpose. Our experience of the world is a reflection of our experience of ourselves, of our internal reality. So when you experience beauty in the world you are experiencing the beauty in your own heart. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yenbw/"}
