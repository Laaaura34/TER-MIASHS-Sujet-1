Eventually I figured my way out of it. I wasn't completely conscious that the death wish had gone away until I had this episode.\n\nI get this reoccurring pain in my leg which I have always called the \"blood clot.\" I have no idea if it was/is a blood clot. Death wishes make you have zero desire to go to the doctor for potentially fatal issues. One night the pain woke me up and I was rubbing my leg. Then it felt like something had dislodged. The pain went away, and then it felt like some lump was slowly making its way up my leg... into my abdomen... getting close to my heart. I started to get woozy. It was difficult to move. And I believed with the whole of my being that I was about to die from a blood clot. I truly, completely, thought I was going to die.\n\nInstead of being *relieved* that I was going to finally fucking die, I was *pissed off* about everything I would be missing. I don't want to lose any time with my partner. I don't want to miss out on having children. I want to experience anything that could possibly come my way.\n\nThis was the very first time I felt I'd regret losing my future.\n\nI realized then I was no longer suicidal. I no longer had a wish to die.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ydk2k/"}
