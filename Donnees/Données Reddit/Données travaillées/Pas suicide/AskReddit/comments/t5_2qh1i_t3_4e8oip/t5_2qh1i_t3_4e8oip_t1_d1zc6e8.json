I OD'd on celexa, trazodone and topomax. I woke up in the ambulance with blood ALL OVER ME, shivering and crying. The emergency worker told me they found me in the campus parking lot passed out. I didn't remember calling 911 at all, I only remembered taking the pills and laying in bed. At that time I still wasn't sure if I was going to make it, because I was going in and out of consciousness.\n\nAfter a few hours in the ER and realizing that I was going survive, the first thing I thought of was how upset my Mom was going to be, and how I was going to explain this to her. This had been my third suicide attempt in two months. I was so angry at myself for wanting to die but not being able to go through with it. \n\nNow a few years later I deeply regret doing those things to myself, and hurting my family so much. My brother and sister have a rough relationship with me. I love my family, and I'm learning to love myself every day <3", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1zc6e8/"}
