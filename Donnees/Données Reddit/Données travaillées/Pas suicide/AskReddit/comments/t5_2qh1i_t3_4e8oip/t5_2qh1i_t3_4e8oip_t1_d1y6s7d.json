Those months seemed like years, and I felt nothing but loneliness. There came a point when I didn't think she'd come out of her coma and I was like, \"fuck all of this.\" Now, the pills caused so much pain as they tore up my insides; I have an allergy to that medication (like the medical version of severe nut allergy) so my body went into massive shock, rejected everything and made me pay for it for weeks.\n \n \nThe pain was so intense. It was the first thing I had felt in so long, and it was a major wakeup call. Life hurts. ***Life*** hurts; death is just nothing, no feeling or desire, or anything at all. I wanted to feel so badly, and the pain was enough to make it seem real again. \n \n*sorry for mobile formatting\n \n \nEdit: allergy clarification", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6s7d/"}
