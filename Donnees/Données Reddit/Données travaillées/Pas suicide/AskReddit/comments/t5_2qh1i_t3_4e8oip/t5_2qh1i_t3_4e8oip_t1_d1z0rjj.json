(nobody checked on me because i used to have really long bubblebaths...) came to in cold water and mustered up enough strength to try and act normal. somehow managed to get dressed, attempted dinner with my family, but my legs felt like they were made of cement. i started having heart palpitations, struggled to even open my mouth...etc. finally came clean to my mother and it was horrific. we went to the hospital where she wouldn't even look at me, ended up spending a hellish night there. after talking to a few psychs they let me go home (thankfully!) i remember my family wanting nothing to do with me for months after that.\n\ni'm in my early twenties now and doing much better. i still have intrusive thoughts and my bipolar has gotten worse but i'm much more in control these days.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1z0rjj/"}
