I really do, its not for someone like myself to say much at all, you make a good argument against this and I respect that.\n\nI wouldn't say shaming however in this, my wording hasn't been fantastic. And I agree, in the way I've written this it hasn't come across that I acknowledge the breadth of these experiences, the particular situations and angles that are part of peoples lives, I can completely understand you there.\n\nPerhaps I'm not the person to say half of this, perhaps this perhaps that, I could go on. My feeling is I'd rather say something in the first place than not at all.\n\nSelfish is a strong word, and I can get if that doesn't feel right, perhaps I've sounded like I've made a sweeping statement, and I get not everyone's experiences are the same.\n\nWhat I mean by all this is one should just consider, even briefly the repercussions and ripples of their actions, this is a general rule of life, and should be dismissed or excused, otherwise such actions may not have a positive effect on other and make things worse (you kinda get what I mean by this?).\n\nThanks for sharing your thoughts by the way, I appreciate it.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1zf5sy/"}
