For years I hoped that my situation would improve so I could make some sort of life but it hasn't. I know that some people with depression have a partner/spouse/kids and the depression merely sours everything. For them perhaps that comment would be true. \n\nI don't have, nor will I ever have those things. If I don't kill myself I'm very confident that what's in store for the remainder of my life is more of the same of what I have now. So no, I honestly don't have a lot to live for. In fact the only thing is to spare the suffering of others. Sparing my parents that pain is about as far as I can go.
