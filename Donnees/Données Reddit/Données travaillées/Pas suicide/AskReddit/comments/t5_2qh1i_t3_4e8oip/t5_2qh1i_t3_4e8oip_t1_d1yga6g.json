There are a lot of grants on technological innovations for social change (and social enterprises). Just need to lock in that golden idea, prepare a business plan and draft a proposal. The world needs changemakers like you. Life is tough... shoulder on and find your bliss! I hope I'm not coming off as patronizing. What helps me is I think of myself as the driver of my life--everything's under my control--everyone else is just a passenger (including the requisite assholes). I pass shitty places, but drive through beautiful scenery sometimes. As long as I'm on the way to where I want to go, I'm okay.
