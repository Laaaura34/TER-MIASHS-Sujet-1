The moment I realized what I had tried to do, it dawned on me.\nMy pain would stop, but so would everything else.\n\nI would miss so many things if I had ended it on that day. I wouldn't ever again walk in a calm summer evening, a slight chill breeze in the air. I wouldn't ever sit on a balcony and watch the light clouds roll through the skies at night. I wouldn't ever know true love, the feeling of being held by someone, early in the morning, just listening to each other breathe. I wouldn't ever be able to see my friends and share our laughter, our tears, our aspirations, our late night talks, ever again. I would miss so many amazing stories being told. I would miss seeing so many places. Experiences. \n\nSo I just broke down and cried for a solid couple of hours. I carried on the next day.\n\nI still experience depression. But I have never felt low enough again to get to that place. Because no matter how low I feel, I make myself remember: there is so much more beauty in the world. We are what we choose to be and what we do. We can form the experiences we want.\n\nI have had so many wonderful things happen to me since then and I hope everyone who feels this way realizes there is so much they can contribute, that they can do whatever they want. There is so much beauty out there. I promise, there is so much out there waiting for you. It eventually gets better. It's not an easy road. But it's so much better to take that road than not at all.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y5lzg/"}
