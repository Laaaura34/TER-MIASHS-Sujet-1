It just made me dizzy and made my throat hurt.\n\nMy first thought was how pathetic I was for not even being able to kill myself. I was on my bed so I just went to sleep straight after and started planning and researching a better way to do it with what little means I had. \n\nI've only really tried once after that and my sister caught me before I could do any real damage the second time. That time I was just kinda thinking about how I was surprised everyone reacted to my goodbye message. I figured no one would care or weren't close enough to care, but even people I hardly spoke to showed concern.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y845u/"}
