But apparently the pills slowed my heart beating or blood loss and the water in the tub got cold which helped to keep me from bleeding out before my dad found me.  I woke up in a hospital and my first thought was \"I'm dead and this must be hell\", but then when I knew I had lived I kept thinking about how I couldn't even off myself right.  I had inpatient  therapy and all that after which helped change my attitude. That was 15 years ago.
