I remember when I was young and the first taco bell opened near me. It was amazing. You could get so many tacos and you didn't even have to fry them yourself! Some things even came with queso sauce. \n\nTaco bell may not be the best thing in the universe, but it's most certainly an experience. I hope you stick around to walk in to one and be bewildered by the massive menu and order something. Pick something fried and unnatural if possible, like a Gordita.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8tu6/"}
