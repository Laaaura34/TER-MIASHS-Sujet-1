The way I was hung was correct. Something undid my rope nice and slowly, in mid air as if it was mimicking the movements a human would make holding it, then I felt something lift me and gently place me on the ground. Been a stern believer in my fate from 90% to 200% from what I saw as I hung there blacking it. I luckily never succeeded. Started the process of a new life afterwards. Even when times are extremely tough, I plow through.
