First thought was GODDAMNIT I FAIL AT EVERYTHING. I tried ripping out my IV, my catheter (I'm female), and everything attached. I was unconscious for 3 days. Took 100+ klonopins plus a half a bottle of Tylenol. After that first thought, I passed out again and woke up in the psych ward. I was on a hold for 3 days.\n\nI want to try again. I'm just scared of 1) it not working again and 2) seeing the faces of my family AGAIN after failing. \n\nSo, I won't try. I'm just fucking miserable.
