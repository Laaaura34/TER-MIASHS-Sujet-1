These are from someone I knew. They tried 3 times, the 3rd was successful.\n\nHe had aome kind of mental illness,not depression. I don't think anyway. He heard voices in his head that told him to do it.\n\nI was young at the time, me and my Dad were basically lodgers in this guys house.\n\nMy Dad saved him the first 2 times, by pure luck. I was there for the second one, he had tried to hang himself. Once he woke up, he told us that the voices were angry that he didn't get it right.\n\nI was too young to understand at the time, but now I realise how awful it must be. The first thing you hear after waking up is scolding from your own head, insults you can't block out.\n\nI don't have too many details, sonce my father dose not like to talk about it.\n\nIn his life, he was a great guy. Amazing sense of humor, great at cooking and really nice in general. He had 2 children that he left behind.\n\nI don't know why he didn't seek help, I don't know many things on this topic.\n\nBut for anyone feeling like suicide, look for help. Even if you don't want it, do it for your loved ones, your freinds. Even your pets. Somone always loves you, but it can just be hidden.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yel3f/"}
