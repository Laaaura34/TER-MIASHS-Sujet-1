Shes been trying for 5 months. We did so much to try to help her.. But it still feels like we did nothing. She succeeded and we couldn't save her. Really this is the first time I have to deal with such a huge emotional guilt, and I have no idea how to do it. I don't want to kill myself at all, but I feel broken and I don't know what to do.
