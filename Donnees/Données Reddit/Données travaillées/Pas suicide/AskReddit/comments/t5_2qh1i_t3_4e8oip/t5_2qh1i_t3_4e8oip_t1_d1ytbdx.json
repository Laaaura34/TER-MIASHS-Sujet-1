I took A LOT. So i was lying in this field in my neighborhood that cars usually parked in (it was a local Church's property) and i remember feeling so heavy i couldn't hold myself up anymore. Two of my friends from the neighborhood stumbled upon me and noticed i was *really bad.* After realizing i hadn't done enough to kill myself, i was distraught but also really hungry. Hunger is a common side affect with the prescription anxiety reliever that i took. my friend said to me (and these are the only two sentences i remember from the incident, as i blacked out) \"Anon, you are my friend but if you don't sit up i'm gonna have to call an ambulance.\" I retorted \"Just let it run it's course!\" \n\n\nHowever like i said, it wasn't enough to effectively kill me, just black me out and make me feel incredibly heavy as well as extremely painful all over my body. It was so uncomfortable, i was immobile. That day i overdosed but did not die.\n\n\nIf anyone is having feelings of sadness or otherwise, please consider seeing a mental health professional. I hope everyone the best.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ytbdx/"}
