I will keep you in mind when things feel hopeless. I know there is no miracle cure (boy, wouldn't that be nice), but I'll keep liking for solutions instead of staying in the pity pit. My mom wrote a quote on a note card on the fridge that I would read every day. I can't remember it word for word, but it basically said: It's easy to feel down and stay in the bad feelings, but it takes real strength to climb up that mountain, and then you'll be at the top. Something like that... I know my mom tried to lol herself when she was younger. There are really a lot of reasons I shouldn't be here. But I am. I will find my reason, and I'll keep climbing even though I will lose my footing from time to time.\n\nYour comment about your kids being amazing and frustrating made me giggle. Thank you for your input. I'll save it for when things seem really bleak, because it will happen again, but I won't stop trying. Hug your kids for me. All the love. Thank you again. I should probably get back to work.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yir4c/"}
