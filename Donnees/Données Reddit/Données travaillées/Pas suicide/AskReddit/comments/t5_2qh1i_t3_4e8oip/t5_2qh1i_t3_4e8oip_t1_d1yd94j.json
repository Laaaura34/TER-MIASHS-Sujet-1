My friend found me and drove me to the hospital; whilst I can look back at that friend now as someone who saved my life, I can't ever forgive him that he told my father. My father only has me in his life so you can imagine the damage that left him - even to this date (two years later) he is walking on egg shells around me in case I go down that path again. \n\nI think about suicide quite often unfortunately but the only things that are holding me back is my dad - If I succeed then he is left alone completely shattered, but if I fail again... That is the worst feeling in the world, to know that people so close to you know your deepest darkest secret and that they will never forget. Even when I can pretend to forget, my father cannot. I have ruined our relationship forever. For that feeling, sometimes I wish I succeeded. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yd94j/"}
