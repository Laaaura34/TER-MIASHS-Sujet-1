I get it, it sounds hollow and untrue, but it isn't. Love isn't always the thing that happens to two people who meet and form a bond. Sometimes we feel love for things that we don't really know at all, or things that aren't human. I love certain songs. That's real. I love the spring. I love the ocean. And I love people. And whether you think it hollow or shallow or whatever else, I love you too. No I don't know you, but I know that being human is a shared experience. I know that everyone knows what it is to feel pain, or happiness, or to want something, or all those other things that I've felt at some point in my life and you likely have too. I can love you for that, and I can care if you live or die. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9zda/"}
