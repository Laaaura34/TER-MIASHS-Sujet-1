Second time I was 19. Just lost my fun, had no real hobbies beside handball & school was college was so easy that it felt like nothing to achieve the grades. Some late night I didnt go to sleep but took the car & went like 190km/h on highway. Turned the sWheel & thats where my memories stopped. Later in hospital they told me that they somehow managed to get me out of that wreck with like no injuries (only broken arm). I managed to state that 1 as \"too less sleeping\". \n\nMy 1st try was with 16. Nearly dropped out of school cause I wasnt interested in anything there. Too easy, doc's tested me & said im one of the top 0.09% most intelligent people tested by this test. Layd back & nothing was worth any effort. One morning on my way to school I stopped by some bridge which is like 8m high (some over a street). It took me like 10-20 minutes before I took a seat on the edge. Some seconds later I tried to push myself away while feeling something holding me from the back. Some stranger watched me all the time & kept me on this bridge. She promised me that she'll never tell anyone as long as I dont try it again...", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d20nkm8/"}
