It's a sleeping pill so obviously it'll knock you out, but it's not going to kill you. It's a commonly prescribed sleeping aid for depressed people for this reason, really hard to OD on. Case in point the LD50 (dosage at which there is a 50% chance of dying) in rats is 600mg per kg. For a 180lb adult male that works out to about 48,000 mg which would be 4,800 10mg pills. And that's just to have a 50% shot of dying. \n\nOf course those are rats, and I've also found reports of 2,000 mg being fatal but who knows. In general though your average prescription will be 30 pills of 10mg each and 300mg will not kill you.
