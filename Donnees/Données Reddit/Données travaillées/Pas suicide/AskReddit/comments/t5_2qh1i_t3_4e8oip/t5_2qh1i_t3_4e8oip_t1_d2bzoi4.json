As long as I can keep a roof over my head and food in the fridge, I'd like to be enjoying life! I don't want to spend the rest of my life working 9-5. I know it's not as bad as working evenings, weekends and holidays- not by a long shot! But I still value my time immensely. I always imagine I'm going to die sometime soon, and I want to make the biggest difference I possibly can. Even if it meant living under a bridge. I honestly just want to be a light in peoples lives.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d2bzoi4/"}
