It's possible to get help, try medication and not have success.\n\nI gotta say I think medication is going about it the wrong way. Depression is not just a medical issue, it is also a mindset. Mindsets are like habits, extremely hard to break but they can be broken. Nobody was really saying it's easy but neither is it impossible. Although if a person think it is impossible then it will be impossible for them. \n\nAlso I see others mention things like chemical imbalances but hasn't it been proven before that our brain, through it's own thoughts, can cause a lot of issues in our bodies? In this case it would be an issue of \"what came first, the chicken or the egg\". In this case it would be the chemical imbalance, the negative thoughts, or both at the same time. All that would show to me is that things like depression could be fixed like one would break the habit. But I won't deny that is extremely hard. Breaking habits, even mental habits, would be like breaking an addiction. We should all know how hard it can be to break an addiction.
