I was alone and had nobody around to check on me so I wasn't hoping/expecting on anyone finding me in time. But I still felt so surprised that I had finally taken that (what I thought was) last step. I ended up in a clinic for a few weeks and tried again while there and did actually decide to try again. That time I was very certain I wanted to end it. The medication they put me on really impaired my judgement. After the second try in the clinic I ended up giving up and decided to revisit the idea when I got out and was alone. That was a few years ago and I'm still here. I still frequently have the thoughts and can get into a deep depression where I map out my steps and plan it out to be sure it looks accidental for insurance purposes. It takes a few days and I snap out of it, and haven't sincerely tried since. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yp253/"}
