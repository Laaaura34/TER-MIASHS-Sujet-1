When I woke up I was confused and my first thought was: \"my poor mom, I hope she knows this wasn't her fault\"\n\nI then spent years trying to convince her that I'm sane enough to want to live, and that it's not her fault. \n\nI asked my friend when I got out: \"there is no God, there is no heaven or hell..why then, do you continue? Knowing we're all walking dirt, how do you not just kill yourself?\"\n\nHe said he has faith, not in God, but in humans. We keep surviving things, and he wants to be around to help others if we are faced with a catastrophic emergency. Since then I've adopted his faith, and even found God.\n\nI understand this is reddit and is strongly atheist, and I get why...but I have a reason to not kill myself now, and that's a very fragile thing. I will joke along with people, I'm not an uppity spiritual person, but fundamentally without faith in humanity and my relationship with God I feel like going back to those dark places..
