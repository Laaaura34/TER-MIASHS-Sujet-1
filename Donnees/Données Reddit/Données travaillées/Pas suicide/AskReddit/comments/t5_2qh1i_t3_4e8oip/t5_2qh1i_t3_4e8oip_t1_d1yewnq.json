Btw I'm also a high functioning sociopath which I only doscovered later in life. The gun misfired at the when I was a teenager so i decided wtf I'll keep going and see what happens. Of course this experience can't be related to anyone else as its my own - and btw fuck you :) I still plan on ending my life with a bullet to the brain but  going to wait until I have no other choice medically before I off myself. I'm enjoying what life has to offer until it's counter productive for me to live. I'm apathetic to continue until I reach the point I can't survive on my one but know exactly how my life will end. You owe nothing to the world or your family if you want to go out on your own terms more power to you. I have no qualms about how things will end or fears about what most people are afraid of.
