I decided to go through with it when I was sitting in my dad's office. There was nothing around, so I stabbed myself in the wrists with a pencil, thinking it would pierce the vein and allow me to bleed out. One thing that stood out to me is that it didn't hurt at all. Now if I even try to prick my wrist with a blunt pen it hurts, but when I had totally lost all my will to live, it didn't at all. Once I realized I was unsuccessful, I began to feel even more useless since I couldn't even kill myself properly. This would lead to two years of crippling depression in which I came close to killing myself two other times.
