Went to my shed and grabbed my dads thickest rope looked for ways to hang all over the house until I finally settled on the ceiling fan structure in my room. Probably looped the rope around 4 times until there was just enough to fit my head/neck inside. I stood on the chair watching cars drive by though the window and with a blank moment I just slowly tipped the chair out of reach. It hurt like hell. I thought maybe I was doing it wrong, But then again my body just wanted to relax and take the pain. I kept repeating to myself its supposed to hurt  I don't know how long I initially hung there until I decided I didn't want to do it anymore. I ended up scratching the rope so badly my nails chipped off at the base and everything went blurry, not black i just couldn't see or hear. Just like that I woke up in the hospital strapped to the bed and unable to speak. The look on my baby brothers face seeing me strapped up with the same bloody shirt and neck is what haunts me (and keeps me alive today). No one should have to explain to him what I tried to do.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yi38b/"}
