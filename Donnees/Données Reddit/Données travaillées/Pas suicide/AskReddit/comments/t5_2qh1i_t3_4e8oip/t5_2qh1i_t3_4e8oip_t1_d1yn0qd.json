What am I supposed to say?  No, Renee, you need to put a Win .270 cartridge in that gun, a .22 will not work - but you already knew that, didn't you, because it's 1/3 the diameter?  \n\nI'd recommend not being presumptuous in the future, but you're probably afflicted with the same inflated sense that your emotional ideals still hold any value in situations you don't understand.  But, maybe you'll find yourself in a situation someday where people actively reject help and adopt destructive personalities just because they want everyone around them to suffer more. \n\nIn fact, I hope you do.  I'm sick of how oblivious people are to this shit.\n\nThen this cesspool of a fucking website downvotes me bc they think mental illness is some teenage heartbreak. \n\nMaybe you will see someone punch out a window and slit their wrists with the glass pieces someday.\n\nEnjoy.
