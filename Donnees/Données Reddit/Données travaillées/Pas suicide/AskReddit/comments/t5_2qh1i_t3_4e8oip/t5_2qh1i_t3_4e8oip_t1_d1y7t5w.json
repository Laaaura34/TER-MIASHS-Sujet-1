I had been a self injurer for years, punishing myself for not living up to my own expectations. This particular night I went out drinking with my roommates during college. We got back to the house and I was so steaming mad at myself I decided I deserved to die during the car ride home. Went in my room, got my box cutter and started slashing myself. I never cut deep enough to hit an artery so I gave up. That was lowest I've ever felt in my life.\n\nI hope this doesn't get buried because self injury is horribly misunderstood. Many think its a cry for attention and I feel sometimes people use it as such. In reality you could care less about what others were thinking. You hate yourself so much that you feel the need to be punished. You punish yourself and feel a feeling of satisfaction that you are setting things right and you completely deserve it. Down the road you get hooked on the feeling of the pain and its almost like drug.\n\n\n\nEdit: I'm kinda shocked redditors are viewing the story of my suicide attempt as controversial. I am truly at a loss for words. I mean people are sharing extremely intimate secrets of their lives here. To downvote anyone other than someone trying to make a joke here is just brutal.\n\nI commend the courage of others who have shared their stories. I was shivering when typing my because I had to essentially relive it again in all its shame.
