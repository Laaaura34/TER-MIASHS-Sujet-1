Make sure to visit /r/dpdr. Had if for years without knowing what it was... it was surreal... lol. \n\nBut it CAN be overcome - I don't really have it anymore. What helped my was to remove all stress from my life, dealing with my problems, slowly change my life to how I actually felt like living. And relax, relax, relax. Go for a walk every day, get outside. Go to bed early. Eat well. Don't overthink things. Forgive, don't be angry. Being happy really helps, even though it can be impossible to even remember how to be happy. Sunshine helps. Hobbies helps. Relax and breath every time you feel bad. Focus on what is right and real and not on what isn't, even though it might be bad. Take control of your life and aim for happiness, a good social life, friends or family. \n\nHope it gets better for all of you suffering this out there, it can be harrowing. It will get so much better once you get back in control, find balance in your life, breathe deeply and relax. \n\nIf you have any question don't hesitate to PM me.  \n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yddy2/"}
