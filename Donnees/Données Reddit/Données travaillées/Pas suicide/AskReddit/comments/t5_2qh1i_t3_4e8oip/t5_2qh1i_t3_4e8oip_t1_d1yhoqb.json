After struggling with depression and letting negativity overwhelm me, trying drug after drug without success, I finally tried using ketamine therapy. While it was expensive, It has been a god send. I'm not yet where I want to be, but we all know it's a lengthy process, however I have had miraculous results. Not enough people know about it, and I wanted to share it with you. After the first month or so of treatment, my overwhelming negativity just...stopped. It was like the wind in the sails of that obsessive negativity just died out, and I am now left with a void in my thinking that I have gradually started to fill with positive things. If you have the opportunity, please seek it out. You can PM me for any questions. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yhoqb/"}
