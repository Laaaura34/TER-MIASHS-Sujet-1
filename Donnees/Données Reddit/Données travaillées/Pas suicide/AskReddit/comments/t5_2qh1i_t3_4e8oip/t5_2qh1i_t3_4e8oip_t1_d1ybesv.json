Dad should have been supportive.  I had the police called on me when I was suicidial once by a family member who said I would rather you be embarassed than dead.\n\nI lived in a high rise and i heard the sirens and looked out the window and saw about five cop cars and then an ambulance pull up. I thought fuck, don't tell me they have come for me, but having talked to the family member in a very despondent way, i guessed it was highly likely they were coming because of me.\n\nI had been crying and teary when I spoke to the family member, but the tears had gone and i am a good bullshit artist so when the coppers knocked on the door, I opened it with a big smile and surprise (as if I hadn't seen them arrive) and said wow, what's going on and then when they said people were worried i was suicidal, I said I am so sorry but I think someone is hoaxing you. I am perfectly fine and because I played the part well they said OK and left. Didn't even come in - maybe 30 seconds at the door.\n\nPeople contemplating suicide can be deceptive trying to get away with it or just because to me it was so shameful and embarassing I lied i think it would be better police procedure to insist on staying for about 10 minutes to have a conversation to be sure and to tell the person there is no shame to feel suicidal and that they should not feel embarassed to maybe make them open up and tell the truth\n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ybesv/"}
