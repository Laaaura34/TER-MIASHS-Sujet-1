I'm so isolated. Everyone thinks I'm weird. I don't understand people, sometimes I feel like people just tolerate me and want me to go away. \n\nIt's dealing with all that that makes me worry that I'll go for a 16th attempt, but I hope not. :/", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8b0n/"}
