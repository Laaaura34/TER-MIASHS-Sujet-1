Jumping was the worst best thing I've ever done.\n\nI remember hitting the ground and immediately my vision turned off. The rocks under my back were really jagged but I remember just lying there, blinded, the sun attempting to break through to my vision. The birds were all around me, chirping and singing. It was unreal, scary, beautiful. Despite where I though I was headed, nature continued on around me. \n\nAll of that mysterious feeling left when I groggily remember hearing my dad say, \"Oh my god!\" When he found me. I've never heard somebody so scared, and it was all because of me.\n\nThis was 2 years ago. I have completely changed since then. Ive never valued life more.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yjh9l/"}
