I dont understand the pandering to children today that allows them to fail. If you can't handle \"the paper\" how are you going to handle work when you have a deadline that pays your salary that pays your rent. I'm sorry but I totally disagree with blaming \"societies pressures\". Unwrap the bubble wrap on today's kids and teach them young that life is hard, but hard work well be rewarded. I have 2 young kids btw before you guys attack me on not knowing anything.  Also be a parent,not a friend. I will never ever fault my child for trying and failing, but I will never reward them to failing because of not trying.
