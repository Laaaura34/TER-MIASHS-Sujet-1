Also I had a huge headache. I'd taken about two handfuls of Tylenol pm and as I laid in bed I could feel things shutting down. Especially my heartbeat, that was the most surreal thing. Feeling it beating so slowly, and feeling as if I was in a dreamlike state. I shut my eyes and waited to die, and when it never happened I woke up and went on with the day business as usual. I tried two more times before giving up on the whole idea. Had a mental breakdown which I couldn't hide from my parents so they helped me get the help I obviously needed. These days things are better and I'm not suicidal anymore. I still suffer from anxiety but I've learned how to manage it.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yd314/"}
