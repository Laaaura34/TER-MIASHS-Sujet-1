I was in the ICU connected to a few IV's, a heart monitor, and a catheter (and probably other things, but I don't remember much). I remember my sisters concerned face above me, and I remember the room's TV in the corner. I wasn't aware that I was in the hospital, or that I'd tried to kill myself. All that I could think of was the stupid television. \n\nSee, I had a television about the same size. A 50\" Samsung. But this TV was a Sharp. I couldn't figure out why someone would break into my place, steal my Samsung TV, and replace it with a slightly shittier TV. I spent 2 days trying to figure it out. \n\nAnyways, apparently I did nothing but say \"I'm sorry\" for 3 days, so I guess I was sorry that I tried to kill myself.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y603q/"}
