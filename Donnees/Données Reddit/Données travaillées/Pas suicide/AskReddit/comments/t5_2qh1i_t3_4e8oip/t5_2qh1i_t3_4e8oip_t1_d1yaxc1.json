I had the rope all tied off, a chair set up, everything. I got into the chair, put the rope around my throat, pulled it tight.. Then my younger brother walked in.\nHe started crying his eyes out, pleading for me to get down, yelling at me in confusion, asking why, what was the matter, etc, etc.\n\nIt was then I realized, what would the damage be to my siblings, my parents, other family, friends. It would kill them (figuratively), if not send my brother or sister down the same path, and I couldn't let that happen. \nI then changed my life, my thoughts towards things, my actions, everything.
