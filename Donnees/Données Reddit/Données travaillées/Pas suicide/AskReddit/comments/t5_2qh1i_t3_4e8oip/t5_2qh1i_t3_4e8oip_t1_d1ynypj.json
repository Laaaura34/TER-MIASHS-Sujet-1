He got a gun from a friend, a .22 handgun. He snuck out in the middle of the night and pulled the trigger, shot himself in the temple.\nWe got the news at 7 am that he had shot himself, and that they took him to the icu an hour away. He was still alive, but the doctors knew he wouldn't make it. So we went to be with my friend and his family and to say goodbye to his brother. I will never forget what I saw. \n\nHis head was wrapped with gauze. His left eye was swollen and slightly hanging out of his head, and his right eye was open, glancing around from time to time. He was breathing, but he wasn't conscious, and his breaths were very very rough, and at times he would shake violently. His family would hold his hand, and he would grip it back. Even though he couldn't move on his own, talk, or speak, you could tell he was still there, suffering. \n\nHe went on this way for almost 48 hours, his family there by his side the whole time watching him suffer.\n\nIt may not be right, but I remember thinking that he had already made up his mind that he wanted to die, and that if he would've used a larger caliber gun, his suffering may not have happened at all.\n\nI can still see the images from that day that I saw him in the hospital.
