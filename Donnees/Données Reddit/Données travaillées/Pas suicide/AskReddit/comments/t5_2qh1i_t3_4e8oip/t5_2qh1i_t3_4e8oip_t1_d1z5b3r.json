He attempted, but did not fully commit. I can't imagine what he must have felt when he came back to consciousness. The whole family bawling in the hospital room. He and I both battle BCD and we both have suicidal thoughts. The thought of losing my brother still brings me to tears. I know you must have felt horrible when you found out they knew, but there are so many people who are so thankful you didn't leave. I'm thankful both you and my brother are still here. Stay strong. Remember that you are loved. No matter how alone you feel, we are fighting our demons together. I love you. <3 You're a great person. Always remind yourself of that. Take care. <3", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1z5b3r/"}
