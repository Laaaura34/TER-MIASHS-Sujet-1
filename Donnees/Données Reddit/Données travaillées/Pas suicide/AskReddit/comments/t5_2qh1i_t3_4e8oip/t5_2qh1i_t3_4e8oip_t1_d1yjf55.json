Waking in the hospital, I was only a sliver of myself.  My thoughts did not concern depression, guilt, or relief at surviving.  All of this was beyond me.  What were they then?\n\nPieces of hallucinations and remnants of near-death.  The texture of turf, and a children's plastic table illuminated by stage lighting.  The smells of incense, the feel of jet lag, and the taste of my wedding cake.  A mute man slicing pineapple and how difficult it is to stay above the water.  Lots and lots of nothingness.  Confusion as if you were an adult looking through a child's brain or a rock gaining awareness.\n\nIt took several days to even faintly understand why I was in the hospital, and more than a week before I realized the person who sat beside the bed was making sure I didn't try again.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yjf55/"}
