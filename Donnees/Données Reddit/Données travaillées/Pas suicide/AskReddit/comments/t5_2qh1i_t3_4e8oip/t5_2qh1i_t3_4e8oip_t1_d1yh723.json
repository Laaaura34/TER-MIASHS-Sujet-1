Obviously, it is a legal construct in our society, so I'm not denying it exists, but I don't think it's necessary. I suppose it's nice from a \"everyone had a party to celebrate that we love each other\" point of view, and people have certain expectations of what it means to be someone's \"girlfriend\" versus their \"fianc\u00e9e\" versus their \"wife.\" But functionally, what's the difference? My boyfriend already has my health care proxy and we've lived together for a few years. We don't have shared bank accounts, but there are married people who don't either. From my point of view, the only thing getting married would do for us is make my health insurance more expensive (exchange plan only accounts for my income) in exchange for slightly different tax brackets. I'm definitely up for hearing some discussion on why it's more awesome though.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yh723/"}
