Avoided antidepressants. Went to bed, woke up 4 hrs later and I knew I failed, was in a lot of pain, throwing up, dizzy and loss of balance. Texted them never mind.\n\nWent to class, throwing up semi often but never in an actual class. I had a very metallic taste from flagyl, so I couldn't eat or drink, and if I did it'd be thrown up in an hour anyways. Talked to my professors via email about missing an exam since I realized I wanted to live and was given another chance (my first OD was in 2014 but with much less medicine). I remember talking magnesium citrate hoping it'd flush out the stuff and I'd be okay, tried brushing my teeth for the taste and threw it all up instantly. Breathing hurt, abdominal region was in a lot of pain (I already had abdominal pain, just worse). Went to ER, got a bunch of tests and I didn't mention ODing to anyone. They gave me IV zofran so I'd stop puking, and provided me with fluids and after 20 hours I got to eat real food. \n\nNever told anyone until now what actually happened, I had a bunch of the symptoms prior because of something else, so the OD just made it a bit worse. I also apparently killed the h. pylori infection I had since I'm now negative for it, but I'm still here somehow, so I've been trying to make something out of it.
