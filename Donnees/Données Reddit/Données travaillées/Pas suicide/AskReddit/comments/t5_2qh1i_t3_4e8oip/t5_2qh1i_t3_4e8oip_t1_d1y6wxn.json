They are both addictions, but they are very different.  Every person taking opiates for a period of time will develop physical addiction, and, with that, tolerance.  Not everyone will develop psychological addiction, although the longer you take it, the more likely it is to develop.\n\nAnyway, my point is, there's no need to stigmatize and tiptoe around the word \"addiction.\"  Also, simply enjoying a medication's other effects (in the case of opiates, euphoria) also doesn't make you \"like an addict.\"  Everyone enjoys euphoria.  That's what it is.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6wxn/"}
