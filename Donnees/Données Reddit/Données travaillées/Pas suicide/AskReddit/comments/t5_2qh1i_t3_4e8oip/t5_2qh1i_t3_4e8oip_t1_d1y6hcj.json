I understand your depression is lifelong. what helped me, and I'm not saying this is a cure, but what helped me was realizing what my death would do to those I care about. my girlfriend would lose it and my dog would miss me immensely. that's all, that's all I had. 2 people and I lost it and put the gun down.\n\nPM me if you're ever feeling suicidal, I won't try and tell you it's wrong, if we exhale your final words I want to be sure they're happy and calming for you.\n\n/r/suicidewatch", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6hcj/"}
