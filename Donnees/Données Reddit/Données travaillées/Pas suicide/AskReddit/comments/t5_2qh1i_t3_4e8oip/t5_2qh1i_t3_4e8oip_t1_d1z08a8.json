I had tried to hang myself and the rope snapped. I wish I could say I had existential thoughts about my family or some such... But I was so panicked and in so much pain that I was trying to tear the rope off my neck for minutes after it had already gone. \n\nI had almost no control at that point, my body's survival instincts had taken over. Once I could breathe again the rest of the pain hit: my legs from where I'd fallen; my neck was bleeding from where my weight had worn through the skin; the blood vessels in my eyes had burst; I was a total mess. \n\nI sat against a tree and sobbed for goodness knows how long. I called my mother because I was terrified I would try again and I didn't want to because it hurt so damn much. Even years later I'm still terrified that I'll try again.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1z08a8/"}
