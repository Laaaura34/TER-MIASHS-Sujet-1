When the grief felt like it was never going to end and it was ruining my life I made a choice.  I chose to not let it ruin my life. I envisioned my best case scenario of grief.  My vision was one full of fond remembrances,  traditions  to honor my loved ones,  tattoos,  and a good  cry every so often. So that is what I strive for,  but most days I'm just pursuing happiness and doing my best.  \n\nI'm so very sorry for your loss.  I send Internet hugs your way and a wish for your heart to be healed. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yib61/"}
