That was eight years ago.\n\nI tried to kill myself as well, and got damn close. I was flat for five minutes. Can't say exactly what changed in me, but something did.\n\nLife is what you make of it. You can choose to be down, and you can choose to be up. That's control. When you have that sense of control, you're on the right path. Many people don't have that, or they lose it along the way. Early childhood trauma and abuse (yep, I've had my share) make that sense of control more fleeting for some.\n\nIt's honestly even more complex than that, but I'm trying to keep this message light.\n\nI just wanted to comment, and let you know that you're not alone. I'm sure you know that, too, but sometimes it's nice to hear.\n\nAlso, if you want to shoot the shit about anything, feel free - I'm always down for that.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y68un/"}
