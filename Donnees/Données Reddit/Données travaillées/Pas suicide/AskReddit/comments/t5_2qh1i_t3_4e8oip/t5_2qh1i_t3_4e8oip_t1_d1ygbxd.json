His son came in just in time, wrestled him until the paramedics arrived. The guy admitted it to me, I gave him my cell number and said call anytime day or night. He said if he had a gun, there's a good chance he'd try again, but he's trying to keep himself away from it. He's got a therapist, his wife and son are watching out for him, and some friends check in on him every day. PTSD and back pain are not a great combination.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ygbxd/"}
