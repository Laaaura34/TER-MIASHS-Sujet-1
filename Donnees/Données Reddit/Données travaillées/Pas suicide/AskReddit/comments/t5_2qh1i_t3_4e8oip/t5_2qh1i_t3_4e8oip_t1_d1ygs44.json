She screamed for my dad, but I'm the one who came running. I'll never forget the tone of her voice when she screamed. I revived her since I'm the only one that knew CPR/first aid besides my mom, and I kept her alive until the paramedics came. My mom stayed with her until she woke up, but I had to go to work. She said the first thing she did was start to cry, and my aunts first words were \"(twoheartedgal) is really mad at me isn't she\". I guess she remembered that I was the one who saved her, and felt ashamed. I made sure she knew I loved her no matter what. We've always been close and I just wanted her to be okay and happy. She's much happier now, full of love, but it was a scary and dark time for a while.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ygs44/"}
