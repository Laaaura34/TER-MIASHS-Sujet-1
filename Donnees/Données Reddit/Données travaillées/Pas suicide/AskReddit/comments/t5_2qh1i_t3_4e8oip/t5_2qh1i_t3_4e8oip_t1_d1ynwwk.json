My first thought? \n\n\"This place again.\" \n\nThat was 3 years ago when emotionally my life was in a freefall. There was just so much going on and I was only operating with 3 hrs of sleep for going on 5 days straight along with constantly changing medications by my doctor to find the right concotion for me. It just was a bad situation. My wife had left after being hospitalized herself, my parents took my kids, the army was...well...the army, and I was just...alone.\n\nGlad to say things are a lot better now and I know now, no matter how hard things get...or how bad it is...or even how much easier life would be for me if I just didn't exist...it gets better. My wife and I reconciled after an affair she was having...kids came back. It turns out my dad was manipulating the both of us...and when we started communicating with each other things changed. We have been great ever since. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ynwwk/"}
