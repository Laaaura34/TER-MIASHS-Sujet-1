I always always terrified and afraid. I had so many panic attacks. If she didn't answer her phone after 5 minutes I'd assume the worst. I didn't trust her any more. Instead of getting help, she pretended it wasn't an attempt, and that she had accidentally taken too many pills. She was in denial, and it terrified me.\n\nThere were a lot of other things wrong with our relationship, but I think that was the point where it really went south.
