I just find it really problematic that you can't actually be honest about that with almost anyone. Like you need to know that you are either 100% anonymous or that the person you're talking to can be trusted fully and won't try to do some kind of bs like get you involuntarily committed.\n\nBecause if you say this shit to anyone it can have consequences that you just can't dig yourself out of and our legal system is not very helpful in this issue. Like you can't really sue for wrongful commitment even though it's very similar to just incarceration, except there isn't even proper due process. It's a bit like talking about bombs in an airport: it can so quickly become a clusterfuck that you can't unfuck yourself from without serious expenditure of time, resources and will.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yq67e/"}
