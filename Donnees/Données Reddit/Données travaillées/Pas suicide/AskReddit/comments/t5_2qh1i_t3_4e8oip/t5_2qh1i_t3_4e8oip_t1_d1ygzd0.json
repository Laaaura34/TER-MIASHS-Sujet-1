So after I realized what happened I just thought \"is it really that bad?\" Then I took a shower and wiped all the shit off.\n\nIt's funny because I take that for granted a lot, but that gun should not have jammed. It was using .38 special rounds which is why, but it still is not very common.\n\nNowadays I'm never depressed and I'm pretty much the opposite of who I was 5 years ago.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ygzd0/"}
