Once after I was molested when I was a kid; I drank some bleach and my father found me on the floor and took me to the hospital. I thought I didn't drink enough so try something else. Second time was via me taking a bunch of pills. I passed out and woke up with my gut feeling horrific. Third time was after I moved back home for a little bit. I had a gun and decided that would be the most effective way to do it, so loaded it and pulled the trigger. Gun had jammed. My sister came home and I didn't want to do it with her there so I put it away. Eventually got rid of it. It's seven years later and I still think about suicide frequently. Its not all the time any more, though. Each time I've just hated myself more for failing to do even that. Anyways, I have a kid now and can't worry about that. There's always tomorrow, right?", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y5vn6/"}
