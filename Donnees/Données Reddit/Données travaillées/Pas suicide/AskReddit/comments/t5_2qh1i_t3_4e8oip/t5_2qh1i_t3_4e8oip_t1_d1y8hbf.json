That's how I found her laying on the floor at 9am in her little apartment. She had cancer and was a heroine addict for 30yrs. I've thought of ending my life before, but the thought of leaving that as my mark on earth and hurting people I know, it's not worth it! I'd rather photoshopbattles, roastme, play video games and make dank ass memes. I'm praying for anyone suffering of depression or drugs, you're not alone and I love you! *Hugs, tears were dropped during the making of this comment!", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8hbf/"}
