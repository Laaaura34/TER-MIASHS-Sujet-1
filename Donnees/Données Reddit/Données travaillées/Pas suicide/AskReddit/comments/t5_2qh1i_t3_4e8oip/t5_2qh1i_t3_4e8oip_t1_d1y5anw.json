Do you remember being a kid and ever thinking that you're happy or unhappy or those being your default state? doubt it.\nI had a rough patch for a while and among other things where I told myself a lot of \"mind over matter\" and thinking that \"this is just a phase, I've felt times that were better than this\". I knew that I had a negative thought spiral that I would regularly get into so I learned to notice it and stop it by not thinking about it.. doing work instead.\nA lot of days was like the comedian who said \" I wake up and the world gets darker\" and it was until one time one evening I told myself stop thinking about negative things and think about smth positive instead.  So I did, I thought about a girl who loves me. ( we aren't dating or anything) I thought about her smiling. Slept like a baby after that and I knew I could beat it.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y5anw/"}
