I sat on that ledge for three hours, when I finally went back in to the waiting arms of the first responders and they sat me down to bandage my shredded arm was, \"fuck, I'm gonna be \"that kid\" from now on. Second thought was \"fuck, I was supposed to go duck hunting on Saturday, now I won't get to own a gun\" it's funny. I don't remember very much of when I was on the ledge. Just a view like picture memories, no dialogues. I remember thinking that I had a hell of a view, and a voice inside yelling jump. I get a weird feeling every time I drive past that dorm, but I always get proud that I went back to school. Don't feel like that kid now though, also I fuckin love all my Guns.
