I had been interrupted during my attempt and resisted cops/EMTs for a while.  After getting some stitches I spent a couple weeks in an inpatient clinic while they monitored me.  I basically just slept the first two or three days.  Anyways, I suppose I accepted that I wasn't going to succeed after I heard one of the EMTs tell a cop that they could stop the bleeding after I passed out.  All I could think of at that point was how silly I was being.\n\nThe second time I tried to choke myself with 550 cord.  I blacked out, but came to with a massive bloody nose.  I was in full survival mode trying to get the cord off.  I was really surprised at how desperately I was fighting to live.\n\nI haven't had any serious suicidal thoughts since, but I still do flirt with the idea.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ybiff/"}
