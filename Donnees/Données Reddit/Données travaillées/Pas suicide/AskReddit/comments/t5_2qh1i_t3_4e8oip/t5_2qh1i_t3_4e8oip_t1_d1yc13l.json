There are an overwhelming amount of comments, but each one has been really sincere and lovely. They're all personal and from the heart, and it really means a lot to me. I'm trying to reply to each but I'm on my mobile for now, so for now I'm mostly just reading. I still see them all though. This made me smile a lot so thank you.
