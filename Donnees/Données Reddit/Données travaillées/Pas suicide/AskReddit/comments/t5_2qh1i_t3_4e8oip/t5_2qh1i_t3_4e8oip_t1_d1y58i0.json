Story is as follows:\n\nMy plan was to take a bunch of my parent's old hydrocodones and drink Southern Comfort until I passed out. Call it cowardice or whatever you will, but as young and as dumb as I was I started drinking before I took the pills. About half way down the bottle I choked down 8 tabs and chugged as much as I could.\n\nTo make a long story short, I blacked out and at some point barfed up the pills. Woke up slumped against a wall at 4:30 am on Sunday, February 21, 2010.\n\nTo this day I live my life as if I were supposed to already be dead. To me each day is a gift, and I choose to take each gift as an earnest sign that I have something to do on this Earth. I do not consider myself to be the same person that chose to take his life that Saturday night. When my eyes opened to the black basement of my house I knew that I had changed.\n\nThat said. You must pay attention to those around you whom you hold dear. If you suspect someone is contemplating suicide do not leave them in the dark. And please, if you are considering suicide, do not attempt. I cannot stress this enough. I beg of you to please seek help.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y58i0/"}
