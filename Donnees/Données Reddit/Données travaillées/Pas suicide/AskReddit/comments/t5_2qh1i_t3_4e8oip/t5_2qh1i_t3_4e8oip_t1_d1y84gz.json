Every breakfast growing up my mom made plantains. I can imagine her right now, slicing and frying them. The sound, the smell. I loved them. I can picture her now, leaving them with beans and coffee on my desk for when I woke up. A small cup of strawberries. It was such an act of love. \n\nI was in a bad marriage. I was so lonely. I was so stuck. He was out of town for a week and I left my dogs at a shelter for the week. I was ready. After so much vomit I remember smelling my neighbors cooking. Plantains sucked in Texas so it had been years since I had them. The small was so triggering I just balled up and wanted my mom but I didn't want her know how sad I was. I moved back to LA and asked for a divorce. She made me plantains the morning I woke up in her guest bed.
