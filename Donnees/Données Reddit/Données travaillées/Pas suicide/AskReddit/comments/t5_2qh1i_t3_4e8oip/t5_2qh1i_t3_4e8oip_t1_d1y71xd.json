I attempted Inert Gas Asphyxiation but the system i used had an old gas mask with a hole in it. The small bottle of Argon wasn't enough to finish the job and the gas mask had a hole in it letting oxygen in. Had one hell of a headache afterwards. Went to see a therapist and i'm on pills now. I can't wait to die still, but i'm not suicidal anymore, which is nice I guess.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y71xd/"}
