I just thought \"well, that was a fun time. Maybe there are things I could live for\". Took down the noose and went back to bed. It's only been on the up and up from there, thankfully.\n\nEdit: fuck, this brings back a lot of memories. I thought I'd add a little more. I had everything laid out (note that left my PC to my best friend, my magic the gathering stuff to a friend who was in to the game, whatever cash I had at the time to a local homeless charity, asking my parents/whoever found me to move on swiftly from what happened, etc) and I just sort of decided to not do it. It's all surreal and the memories from the 2 or so years I was suicidal a lot of the time are just sort of a blur (this was nearly 2 years ago when I sort of came out of it), so I don't remember much else from the time. I've gotten more involved in volunteer work and stuff which helps a lot. My honest advice is to go get help. I was helped out a lot by free counseling/therapy sessions thanks to nationalised healthcare in the UK, but if you don't have the luxury of universal healthcare/money for therapy then there are a million and one ways to get out of it. If anyone's needing some help or advice feel free to PM me.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y74h5/"}
