I see someone who relates a personal story of tragedy, and I can imagine how that feels. Op stated he was glad he survived, and because I can identify with other human beings in pain, I am too. \n\nIt's not a difficult concept to grasp. There's nothing hollow about it.  My day is better knowing that someone else experienced that and learned to value his or her life a little more for it. There isn't any fanfare, no one's making grandiose claims or dramatizing the ordeal. \n\nJust a simple \"I'm glad you still exist\". \n\nIt's the most basic and sincere thing one random human can say to another random human when they realize, through coincidence and indirectly via texts posts on the internet, that another human being exists and survived some shit.\n\nI think it sounds like you're carrying a lot more of your own baggage into that scenario than will fit.
