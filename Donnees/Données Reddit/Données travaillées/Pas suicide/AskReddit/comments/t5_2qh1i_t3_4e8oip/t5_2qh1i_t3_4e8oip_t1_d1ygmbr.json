Self-harmed a bunch and then downed a few bottles of pills with liquor.\n\nTurns out my shitty suicide research saved my life; the two drugs I had taken the most of nullified each others' effects on my heart. Only lasting effects from the whole episode are the burn scars still faintly visible on my arm.\n\nProfessor was cool as fuck and gave me extra time on the paper. Got help from mental health people soon after and life has for the most part been marginally better since.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ygmbr/"}
