Sorry to hear you had to deal with the ambulance and I'm very surprised I came to when I did. Being T1D is already a struggle in and of itself but having to also deal with crippling depression is another world.\n\nLately, I've been to a psychiatrist and a therapist \u2013 both who have been helping in their own ways. The psychiatrist found something wrong  in my blood work that no doctor has ever said to me and it gave me hope because he was pretty confident this medication would help.\n\nI've been on the meds for about 2 weeks now and.. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to feel. According to my family and friends, I have been more positive. I have noticed I haven't been as sad or suicidal for a while but I'm at such a loss of how I'm *supposed* to feel because I have been without genuine feelings (unless extreme) for so long.\n\nI know you didn't ask nor probably want to hear an update but it feels nice to let others know that the medication seems to be doing something. iIt's a slow start but it's progress to a brighter future.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d2153gx/"}
