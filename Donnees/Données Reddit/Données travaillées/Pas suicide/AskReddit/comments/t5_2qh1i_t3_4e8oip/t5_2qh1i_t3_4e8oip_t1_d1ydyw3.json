I was equally surprised.\n\nA lot of people in that situation probably feel they were 'saved for a reason'... I used to, not so sure any more, but I'm fairly certain I wouldn't try it again anyhow (except in extreme extenuating circumstances).\n\nIt brought a ton of perspective.  You still face all the same unresolved conflicts, but now you know as much as is humanly possible how low it's possible to go.  Suddenly, losing everything and everyone and becoming homeless might not seem like such a big deal.
