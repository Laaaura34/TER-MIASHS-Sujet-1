My first reaction to waking up after taking a bunch of pills was pretty much the same as yours, except I was \"oh shitting\" at the fact that my attempt failed and I was in my moms bed. I was horrified that I would have to face my whole family in my whole house after just trying to kill myself.\n\nOn a sidenote, I was apparently \"asleep\" for about 4 days and it never occurred to my family that they should have taken me to a hospital or something, looking back at that mess. Apparently my mom just waited for me to wake up so she could take me to a hospital, and she knew I took meds.\n\nI'm not blaming her for anything at all, don't get me wrong. I just think it's weird that they didn't take me to a hospital or anything, and just left me passed out in a bed for almost a week.\n\nThey don't know it was a suicide attempt, by the way. They think that because I was 10, I was just like a toddler and I took pills that I should not have taken and didn't know any better. Maybe because I was 10 and that was a really young age to attempt a suicide?", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y65zn/"}
