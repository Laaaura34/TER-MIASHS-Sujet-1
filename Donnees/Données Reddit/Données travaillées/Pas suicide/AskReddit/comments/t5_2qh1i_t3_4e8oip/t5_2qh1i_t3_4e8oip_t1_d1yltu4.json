Sedation for any other reason is the same as using restraints. Mucho illegal. You can't just shoot someone up with drugs on a ward. \n\nEdit. Though you do still get the old-school nurses that are liberal with the haloperidol on the wards... mainly on night shifts. You'd get in trouble for that if the higher ups found out these days!", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yltu4/"}
