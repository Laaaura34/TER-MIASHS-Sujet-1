Certainly some notice but I've had my best friends tell me that they never noticed until I told them and they are people that I share everything with so I think they'd tell me. Mine aren't really bad so that may be part of it. Besides, I don't really care if you're right but your comment may bother some who don't want anyone to ever notice. I think it would've been better left unsaid. \n\nEdit-my comment sounds a little critical. I opened it up for conversation with the way I worded my original statement so I retract the criticism.
