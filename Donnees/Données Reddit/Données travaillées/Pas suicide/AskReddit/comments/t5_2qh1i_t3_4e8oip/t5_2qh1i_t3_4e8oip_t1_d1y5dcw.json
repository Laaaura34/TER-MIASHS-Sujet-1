As a mother, I cannot even begin to imagine the fear and anguish and desperation your mother felt in that moment and the unbelievable sense of relief they had when they pulled you back in. Hug them a little tighter the next time you see them, because I'm sure those images and feelings will never leave their memory. They love you with everything they have, so just hug them tighter. \n\nI really do hope you are doing better now and are in a good place :)", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y5dcw/"}
