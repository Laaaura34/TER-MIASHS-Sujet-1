The thought of ending things still cross my mind but I can fight it back. Multiple discs in my back have failed and pain is something I know all too well.  I'm 30 and my doctors are the same way.  Been on high doses of pain meds for 8 years now.  And most doctors agree that fusing 5 levels in my back is a bad idea due to my age.  I have dealt with the stigma of being an addict for years, yet have not once abused my medications in any way.  I would say find a specialist that will listen to you, and be open to their ideas for pain control, but don't be afraid to speak your own opinions.  I did research and asked to be switched from percocets, to a time released opana (oxymorphone) with ir oxymorphone.  It changed my life.  Life and the pain have improved.  I still hurt but it's just enough under control that I don't feel like my world is caving in. If you ever need to vent man I'll listen.
