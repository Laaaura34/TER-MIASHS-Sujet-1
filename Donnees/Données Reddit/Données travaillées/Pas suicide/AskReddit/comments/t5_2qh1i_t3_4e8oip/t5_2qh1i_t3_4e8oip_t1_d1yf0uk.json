Well at least no one knows about my many past attempts.\n\nMy first attempt was with a rope, but the rope broke.\nMy last attempt was with a revolver that didn't fire until I tried to check it over to find out why.\n\nI have given up on trying.  I have tried, pills, ropes, jumping from heights, drowning, and lastly a gun.  Never once have I ended up in a hospital from my attempts nor does anyone know more than a injury from climbing or such.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yf0uk/"}
