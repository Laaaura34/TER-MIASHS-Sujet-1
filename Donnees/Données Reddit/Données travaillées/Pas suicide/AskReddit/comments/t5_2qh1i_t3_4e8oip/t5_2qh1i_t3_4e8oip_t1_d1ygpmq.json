(I went the correct direction and everything) I was just numb. I tried to hide it from my parents by wearing a black hoodie but that didn't work. My mom (who is an RN) saw it, wrapped it up and rushed me to the E.R...They patched me up and the next day I woke up in the psych ward. My first thought was \"fuck that hurt, gotta do it again?!\" I was kept in the ward for 1 week. They gave me Haldol which basically turned me into a zombie, after a week of taking the med, I started to have a terrible reaction where I couldn't control some of muscles and all I could think was \"I'm not willing to try this again, fail , and end up in another institution. \" still struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts every day, 10 years later. Having a family helps, but it's still tough. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ygpmq/"}
