He's attempted it a few times in his life, the first time when he was 5. He tried to hang himself a couple years ago when my dad passed away suddenly. The most recent time, he admitted it to my mom but swore her to secrecy and doesn't know that I know. He's 32 now and I don't know how to help him. He refuses counseling and keeps suicide like a final recourse in his back pocket. No matter how well things are going, all it takes is some hopelessness and being overwhelmed by life and it's not the type of thing I'm educated to handle. I don't know what to do for him and I don't want to lose my brother. What can I say to him? How do I trick him into looking on the bright side? Severe depression runs in my family. My grandmother survived the Holocaust and lived to be 93, but wanted to die every day for the last 10 years of her life and talked about it constantly. Suicide and ending everything has been a theme in my family my whole life, including from my dad, until he passed from complications due to cancer. I don't know how to help us move past the negativity. It scares me. I love my family. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yf8jh/"}
