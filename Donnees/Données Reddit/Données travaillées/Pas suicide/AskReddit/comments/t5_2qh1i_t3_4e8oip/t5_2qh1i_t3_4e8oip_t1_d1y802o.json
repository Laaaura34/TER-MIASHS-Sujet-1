My first response was to pull it out since I thought I was choking on it. I quickly found out that I was restrained with very limited mobility, so I tried to sit up. My forehead was also tied down, so I arched my neck and back until the restraint slipped. Then I bent myself double and pulled the tube out slowly.\n\nI'd been catatonic fit about a day and a half. The lights were on (body) but nobody was home.\n\nI'd been extraordinarily violent while catatonic, and extremely harmful to myself. I still have scars where I ripped the IV out of my right arm. My parents thought I'd become a vegetable... I can't imagine the stress it put on them.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y802o/"}
