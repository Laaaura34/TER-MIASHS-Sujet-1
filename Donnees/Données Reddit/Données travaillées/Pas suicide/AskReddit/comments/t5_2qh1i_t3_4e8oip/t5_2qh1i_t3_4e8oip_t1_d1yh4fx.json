My dad and my sister made it about them whereas all I could say to my mum was \"I'm so sorry Mum. You really must've been in a bad place to try and come to that conclusion\". She said I was the only family member that thought of her rather than them self. Not that she was doing it for attention but she'd convinced herself the world would be better off without her and she wouldn't feel what she was feeling internally anymore. I don't know how you could have any response other than the one I had. I know some people experience misdirected anger that someone tried to leave them so suddenly but I just felt such sadness for her suffering. The making it about themselves stuff was a big shock. It wasn't fair for them to put that guilt on her.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yh4fx/"}
