Who found me? I hope it wasn't my parents. They would be devastated. Wait. I'm not at the hospital. Why is my room so clean. WHERE THE FUCK ARE MY RAZERS?? Damn my neck hurts like a bitch. How did I end up in my bed? Shit it's 10am I missed school! My mom is going to kill me. Why the fuck could I not just be left alone to die?\n\n\n\nI hung myself. My brother said he heard something and came to check on me. (I used to tell my brother all about sports med classes so he knows how to check vitals) so he cut the rope, I was passed out but had a strong heart beat and he didn't notice anything wrong with my breathing. So he picked me up and put me in bed. He said I woke up shortly after but he told me to go to sleep. \"I'll tell mom you feel like shit and you should stay home from school\"\n\nThe reason he didn't take me to the hospital was because we both know that my mom doesn't know how to deal with these things. She makes these things worse. It's not her fault. But she does. He knew I was okay and breathing and I was semi conscious. (Not smart but I thank him for it)\n\nMe and my brother have always \"hated\" each other. We fight a lot and we both find each other annoying. But after that. It's never been the same. We have gotten so close since then. We just took a vacation to Vegas. We hang out a lot. I love him.\n\nRemember guys. People that are suicidal, they just need someone that is there for them. Someone they trust. Don't be the person to run and tell everyone that they are suicidal.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6we1/"}
