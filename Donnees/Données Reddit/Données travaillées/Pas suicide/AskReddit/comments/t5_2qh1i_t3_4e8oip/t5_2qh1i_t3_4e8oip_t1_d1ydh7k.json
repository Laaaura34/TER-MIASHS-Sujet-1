He immediately just knew, and freaked out, we pretty much ran straight to the car, I drove I don't even know how fast to his house, and she was there on the bathroom floor. I wasn't close with her because I just have problems getting close to people, and especially in a family situation. I sat down with her and I just hugged her, I wanted her to just feel me care, instead of hearing useless words. \n\nWhen we went to the hospital and they asked her why she did it, she told them she didn't know. She just seemed shocked by the whole thing. \n\nHis family has a history of mental illness, and she definitely was suffering from some form of it, and I hope she has gotten help, but I was a total cunt in the relationship and we don't stay in touch at all. \n\nShe was just going through some intense drama with her friends, and for whatever reason, two bottles of pills was a quick answer to a hard question.
