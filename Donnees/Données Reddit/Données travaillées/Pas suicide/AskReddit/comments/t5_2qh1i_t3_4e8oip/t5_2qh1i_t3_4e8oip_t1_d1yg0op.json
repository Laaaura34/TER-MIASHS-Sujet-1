I am not going to touch the selfishness portion of this like others, because you know the truth. You know you can feel better again. That thought, that hope,  that understanding.....that is what gets you through these low points.  I know you are in a dark spot right now, but it will pass.  As practical advice, consider switching out the meds.  Finding the right medicine is trial and error , but sometime what worked in the past will no longer work, what works for 6 months won't work on the 7th.  Fuck, just saw the post saying you cut yourself.  Please please please don't hurt yourself anymore. Please don't wait for others to notice, take it upon yourself to find something that works for you. You know what you need to do.  Please do it.  As I am reading your posts....you are so far ahead of this depression.  You have all the tools and knowledge you need to pull yourself up, and it won't be easy, but its there and I have faith in you.  Surviving is not enough, you have to fight.  Please fight.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yg0op/"}
