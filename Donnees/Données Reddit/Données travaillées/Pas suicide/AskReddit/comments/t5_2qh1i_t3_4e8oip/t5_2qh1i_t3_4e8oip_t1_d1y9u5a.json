I was intubated so I had this big hard tube down my throat and one in my nose and I remember just wanting to make them go away. I could feel the ventilator pushing air in and out, it was horrible. Then they sedated me a bit more and I was out for the next day or so until I was stable enough to wake up properly. All in all, a very uncomfortable and painful experience, 0/10 would not recommend.
