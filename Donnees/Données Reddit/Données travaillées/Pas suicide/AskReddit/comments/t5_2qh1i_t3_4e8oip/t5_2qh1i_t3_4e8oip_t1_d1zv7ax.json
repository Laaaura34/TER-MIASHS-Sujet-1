I'd be very careful about trying to make people on a suicide thread feel anything. I'm not trying to make people do anything. I'm speaking the truth. That's all I can & should do. People can accept it or reject it. As for you, I'd stop insisting you know more about a subject than me or anyone else. As for me, it wasn't my parent that committed suicide. I just had a front row seat to another family's total destruction. All because someone was in $20,000 worth of debt & didn't see a way out. The most ridiculous of reasons, if you ask me. But I didn't tell anyone that. I just observed. I haven't shamed anyone for that type of decision. But I certainly will not endorse it. Unless you live alone on an island, when you kill yourself, you destroy other peoples lives. That's a truth. Not an opinion. Not debatable. If you don't think so, it doesn't make you right.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1zv7ax/"}
