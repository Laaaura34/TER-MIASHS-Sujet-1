Yes your parents situation was exactly my circumstance. I ended up dragging her down. We were together for 13 years, 10 married. I didn't even consider this outcome as a possibility. Sadly, despite my pledge to get better, she still left. \nIt's not just that she has stopped supporting me in every way a wonderful partner normally would. Now she is actively critical of me. \n\nI saw a psychologist for a while but it was of limited help. I also do hypnotherapy and see a personal trainer three times a week. Of everything I have done, the physical exercise has had the biggest impact. \nIt's ok, things are fine, at a level where I can get through each day. I don't see how they will ever get better though. I just know that the best days are already behind me.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1zdgah/"}
