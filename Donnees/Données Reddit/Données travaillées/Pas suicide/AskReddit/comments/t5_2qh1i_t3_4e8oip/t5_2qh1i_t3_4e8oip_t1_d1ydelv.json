They don't care about whatever duty they have towards society, except if said duty contributes to making life unbearable to them.\n\nIf society doesn't want people to *waste* their money, why don't they invest the very little it takes to provide universal healthcare and mental healthcare to everyone, so people have less reasons to want to die? Why don't they provide assistance to trauma survivors so they don't get ridden with PTSD? Why don't they provide adequate care to chronically ill people (who form a slice of the population amongst the most likely to commit suicide, despite all the inspiration porn crap of the world)? Why? Wouldn't the cost of mental healthcare be much lower than that $241,000 loss you are talking about?", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ydelv/"}
