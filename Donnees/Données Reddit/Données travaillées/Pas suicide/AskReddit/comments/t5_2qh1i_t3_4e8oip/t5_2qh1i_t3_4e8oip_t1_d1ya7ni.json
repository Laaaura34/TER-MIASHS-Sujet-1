I laid there as I heard the paramedics pound on the door, eventually break the glass and let themselves in. They eventually found me and took me to the ambulance.\n\nAt the hospital I felt like I failed, sure, but maybe now I would get the help I needed. It took a while for any family member to show up, and it was my uncle and cousin, they said my grandma (who raised me) fell leaving the other hospital my grandpa was in when she heard about me and tried to run, she broke her cheek bone and had to get stitches. They didn't say much, didn't seem very concerned and eventually left to go check on my grandma.\n\nEventually my grandma showed me, by now I had drank my 4 bottles of charcoal and puked several times. She of course was upset but only made me feel worse by saying she cracked her face trying to get to me, I still blame myself. She left within half an hour, had to go check on grandpa because he didn't know what was going on, so I was alone again.\n\nAnd I was alone for several hours, waiting to be transferred to the hospital with the psych ward. Being alone and still feeling like the least priority didn't make me feel better. What did was the nurse who kept checking on me. He brought me a portable dvd player and some movies to keep me busy, he checked on me a bunch and said he'd been where I was, and that really helped.\n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ya7ni/"}
