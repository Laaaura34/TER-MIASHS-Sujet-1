I jumped too early and they missed by inches.  I thought, \"Aw, dammit!\"  I think I was in 2nd grade.\n\nThe next time I was in 4th grade and I tried to drown myself in a pool.  A stranger pulled me out before I blacked out from holding my breath and my first thought was also my first words, \"Fuck you!\".\n\nBoth time I guess my first thought was an angry thought that expressed my anger towards being so shit at life I couldn't even kill myself, and anger towards the people around me who just couldn't let it happen.\n\nThe last time was in college and I tried to OD on acetaminophen but ended up throwing the pills up.  This was right after my sister had tried to cut her wrists and I was having an incredibly hard time working through the trauma of being the one who found her in the bathroom all bloody.  My first thought was, \"Not doing it that way again.\" because it fucking sucked.\n\nI haven't told anyone in my family or group of friends about that last one, and I probably won't.  Not because I'm done trying to kill myself, but because I finally found a good way to do it and it's kind of comforting knowing I have a good way out if I ever really can't go on anymore.  It's kinda peaceful thinking about it.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6mw8/"}
