I used some rope I found in my dad's toolbox and tied it to the closet door handle, and looped it over the top of the door. I remember going black, then waking up to my younger brother slapping my face, screaming with tears and snot running down his face. My first thought was, \"of all people to fuck this up for me.\" They took me to the hospital, and while my parents beat my ass after i got out and said next time i try that shit i better die or they will do it for me, my brother was destroyed. Seeing how badly it fucked him up, and seeing how i couldn't just ditch him and leave him to our parents, made me realize i need to stay to protect him and my lil sis. I've healed my heart since then, and I'll always owe my life to him.
