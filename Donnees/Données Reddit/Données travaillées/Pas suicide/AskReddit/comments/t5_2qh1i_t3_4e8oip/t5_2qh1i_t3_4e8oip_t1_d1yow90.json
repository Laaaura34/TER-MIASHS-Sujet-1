I'd try to do a few hundred. It would be easy- I've got the insulin right here. It wouldn't be a messy death. Hell I might even fool my family into thinking it was an accident, unless an autopsy showed the extremely high level of insulin was too much to be accidental.\n\nBut, the feeling of going low is so horrible that I would probably panic and try to guzzle soda to live. No matter how much I want to die, I think that primal feeling of \"oh fuck you're low, eat before you die!\" would take over. I don't think I could lie there and let myself pass out. And the thought of desperately trying to reverse what I'd done for a half hour, but not succeeding and ultimately dying in panic, sounds horrible\n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yow90/"}
