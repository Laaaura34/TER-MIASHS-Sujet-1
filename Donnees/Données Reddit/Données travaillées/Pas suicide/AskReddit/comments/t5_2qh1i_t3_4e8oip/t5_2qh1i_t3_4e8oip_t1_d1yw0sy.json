She got better, then worse, then better.\n\nThat was when I was 14. I'm 23 now, married to a man who would give me the world on a silver platter, and the most amazing kid I could ever dream of. I've had friends successfully end their lives in the years since then. If you're feeling hopeless or thinking of going that route, please just stop to consider that life DOES get better. I will spare you all of the \"suicide is a long term solution to a short term problem\" shit because that's already been said here, and it is true. Just know that although I don't know you, I love you and I will always root for you. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yw0sy/"}
