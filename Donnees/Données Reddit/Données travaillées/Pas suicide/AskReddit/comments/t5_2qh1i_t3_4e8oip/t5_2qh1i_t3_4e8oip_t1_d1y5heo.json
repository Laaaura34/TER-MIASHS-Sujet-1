Realistically, now that I'm older and not (as much of) an idiot, I realize that the only part of Plan B that might have even been remotely effective at killing a human is that it was to be done in a garage with a running car. God, what a stupid plan.\n\nThankfully, my confidence that Plan B would work made me reckless about keeping my damn mouth shut, and I told a couple of friends about it. They talked to me for hours and eventually convinced me to *not* kill myself. Instead, I just acted like an emo little shit for the next...geez, six months? Eight? Something like that. I nearly married the girl that helped bring me out of it.\n\nSomebody else in here was talking about what they'd say to that version of themselves. Pretty sure I'd start with \"Listen, asshole.\" I'm not going to unilaterally say anything about people who attempt suicide, but in *my* case, a severe dose of \"You're 17 and you don't know shit about shit\" perspective was in order.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y5heo/"}
