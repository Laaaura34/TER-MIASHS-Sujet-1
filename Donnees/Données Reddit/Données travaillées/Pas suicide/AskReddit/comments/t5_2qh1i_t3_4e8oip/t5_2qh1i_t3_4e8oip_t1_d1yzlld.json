I also didn't really want to die, it was just a pathetic attempt at attention seeking that I wanted to take to the maximum. \n\nAnd no, I don't want any reminder of that, especially in the form of  painted scar. I still have a bald spot on my head from the gunshot burn that I habitually touch whenever I'm thinking \u2013 like LeChiffre.\n\nI blame my parents for not disciplining me enough by showing me that living in a million dollar house in Connecticut, while having enough food on the table and anything I ever wanted is more than what the majority of the world even dreams about. They raised a coward.\n\nI feel really bad for the kids growing up in these stereotypical white, upper-class families where the mother sits on prozac and xanax, while the father treats his family like a chore \u2013\u00a0reserving fridays for his wife, saturdays for his kids and sundays for his friends. I wish I could have been disciplined, that my father would have slapped me instead of listening to my mom throw fits about how that was unacceptable punishment even when I deserved it. Because my parents tried to handle all our internal issues like a session of marriage counseling, instead of clearly affirming dominance, I was able to become such an egotistical clusterfuck. \n\nThat was almost 15 years ago. I'm doing well. \n ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yzlld/"}
