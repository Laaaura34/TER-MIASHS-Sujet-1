I had a rough childhood. Me and my little brother were witnesses to my father's crimes when we were in elementary school and then he was sent to prison. We were placed in my paternal grandparents care and were told by some family member that my mom stood up in court and said she didn't want us. I thought I was unwanted and unloved. When I was 12 the pain got to bad. I just wanted it to stop hurting. I put the knife to my wrist and all I could see was my little brother's face. Even if no one else loved me, he did. I couldn't leave him alone thinking I didn't love him enough to fight for him. I put the knife down and never picked it up again. Since then I learned that the stuff about my mom was a lie. She wanted us and fought to get us. My paternal aunt started helping raise us and in so many ways is my mom. My paternal grandmother died 2 years later and I'm glad I got that time with her. My paternal grandfather was abusive, but he didn't do it with malicious intentions. He raised us the way he was raised. He never hit us, because he wanted to hurt us. He was scared for us. We'd seen to much of my father's violence and he didn't want us to be like my father. Thanks to my brother's and my love for each other I learned how much love I really had and still have in my life.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yfhoc/"}
