Stayed that way for the next 5 hours while they tried to find a bed for me in any psych ward that would take me. When I had to go to the bathroom, they would remove my shackles temporarily and a female security guard would go with me into the bathroom.  \n  \nThe staff were really nice to me though. They brought me my phone and even charged it for me. The people riding in the ambulance with me talked to me the whole ride over to the psych ward. When we got there, the ambulance driver even let me smoke a cigarette in the parking lot before we went in, while still strapped to the  stretcher. They made me feel a lot better than I would have otherwise. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6oiz/"}
