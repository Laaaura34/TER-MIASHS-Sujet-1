I had tried talk therapy and \"trying to be positive\" and more. I had planned to hang myself in my garage or to pull my older car in the garage, start it, and wait. Even though I thought she was better off without me, I decided to give antidepressants a shot to try to be a better person for my daughter. I gave myself six months and at that time there was no doubt in my mind about going through with it. Six months came and went and by that time my suicidal thoughts were pretty much gone. It's amazing how sometimes medication or other factors (I had also been unemployed and unable to find a job and found one in that period) can change a person's outlook.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yeepv/"}
