I drank a liter of vodka, looked up the lethal dose of benadryl, took that, took a bunch of xanax, percoset, and ambien all mixed together.\nI heard my name being called from the shadows of my room. That night I kept hearing people call my name from different spots around the room. I had never had an experience like this, and was really scared/freaked out. I was hoping the cocktail of pills and alcohol would kill me and here I am being scared out of my mind. So I laid there, not being able to move for what felt like days, hearing people calling my name and talking to me. Also, I was extremely thirsty because of the bottles of benadryl I took. It was not a pleasant experience.\nSince then, I got help, started a medication, and had a lot of therapy/counseling.  For the longest time, I thought it was simply normal to think about killing yourself most days. It was something that would float around my head. Since I got help, I haven't had these thoughts for quite a while. \nIf there is anyone who is having a tough time, please feel free to message me! Letting things out is one of the most important things you can do.\n\nEdit: I found out the reason I didn't die that night is because I am a super processor for several pain killers and different pills.
