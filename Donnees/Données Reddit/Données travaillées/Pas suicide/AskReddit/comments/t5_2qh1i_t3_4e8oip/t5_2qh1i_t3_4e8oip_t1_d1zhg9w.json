I felt alot of physical pain, nausea,  but nothing emotional. A day or two later I kind of woke up, and my thought then was \"I can't let my family find out\". \n\nTurns out not telling them was the best thing I could have done for myself at the time. When they did find out years later, they belittled my depression as \"attention seeking\" and \"just a phase of teenage drama\", but I was in a better place mentally to handle their words.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1zhg9w/"}
