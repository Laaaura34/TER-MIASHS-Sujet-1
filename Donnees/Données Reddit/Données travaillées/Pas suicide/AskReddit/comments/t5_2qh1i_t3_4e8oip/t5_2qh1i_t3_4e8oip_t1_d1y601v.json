I used a dressing gown rope which ultimately broke.\n\nWhen I regained consciousness I didn't know where I was and my lamp light was very bright. I had drool running down my chin. When I got up it took me a minute or so to realise what had happened. I guess I was in shock as I sort of just put on a movie and went about the rest of my night like nothing happened.\n\nIt was during my psychologist appointment the next day the reality came crashing down on me and I broke down and was sent to the psychiatric ward\n\nFor a while I was so angry that I didn't succeed and sometimes I still am. I'm alot better now although I still battle with suicidal thoughts and severe depression. When I feel another bout coming on I choose little things to hang onto like the next episode of a tv show I like to come out or realising I need to read a book series.\n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y601v/"}
