I moved out shortly before I turned 16, I have a reasonable relationship with both my parents now and I'm quite defensive of each (they've been divorced since I was a small child). But at the same time, I remember the fights I used to have with my mum, aged 12-15 until I moved out and I remember we both agreed that it would be for the best that I did. But I wonder now - about the maturity of her decision, I know how I felt, but I can't ever know her thoughts, I know I hurt hurt her, I know she hurt me.\n\nBut I can't reconcile my love for her now, with the idea of a mother that let their child go out on their own (encouraged and aided it, in fact) at ~16. \n\nAs a result of living amongst peers since that age, I made a lot of fucking bad decisions, essentially fucked my life up. I can only wonder what I would have become had I stayed at home, in school, etc.\n\nI dunno where I'm going with this. Aside that it's difficult to reconcile objective and subjective reality when it comes to your parents. I know I love both of mine now. But I can't help but question past decisions. And to this day my mum says things like 'remember what you were like as a teenager?' (I'm in my early 30's now).
