Your situation is just as important as mine. As is anyone's. It's not a competition. It's that very need for comparison that makes getting help so hard in the first place.\n\nI've come to believe that abusers thrive on the doubt of their victims, on the idea that their abuse somehow \"doesn't count\" compared to other \"more extreme\" examples. I rationalized that shit for years, with a helping hand from dear old mom. \"You can't call the cops on me, they'll just laugh at you.\" \"They deal with REAL abuse victims who have bruises and cigarette burns\"... The truth is, it's all abuse all the way down, regardless of whether someone has it subjectively worse than you or not.\n\nThat realization that you were right, that it wasn't in your head, that this simply isn't acceptable by anyones standards... You're right, it's such a liberating and profound feeling. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8yl0/"}
