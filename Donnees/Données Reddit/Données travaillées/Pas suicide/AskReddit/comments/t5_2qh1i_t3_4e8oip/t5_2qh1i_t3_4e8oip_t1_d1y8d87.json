I'm not sure I was conscious enough yet, all I remember is realizing how warm my chest felt before I put my cold fingers to my favorite T shirt to feel the blood. It made my shirt feel like wet velvet. I had just fallen 12 feet and the blood from my head had ran down most of my body, pooling around me in a ravine that I thought was deeper than it was before I jumped. My first thought was \"Fuck, what is this shit?\". Once I realized it was blood I was pissed about my shirt being ruined. Then I started to feel how cold I was and began to freak out. \n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8d87/"}
