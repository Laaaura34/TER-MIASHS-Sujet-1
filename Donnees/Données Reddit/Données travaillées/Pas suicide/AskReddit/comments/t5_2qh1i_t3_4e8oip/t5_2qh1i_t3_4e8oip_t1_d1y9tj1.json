I had found two random pills at my house (both of my parents take anti psychotics) and I thought it would be strong enough to kill me, so after lunch one day I sat on the Oval and took both of them and just lied there smoking until I passed out and then woke up to the sound of the bell and got up and walked home. My first thought was \"shit, I have to go home\". I felt a bit groggy but I just slept for like 14 hours and I was fine. The second attempt was about two years later and I tried it by cutting as deep as I could on my wrist in the bath, I couldn't get the guts to cut deep enough so I just kept cutting and cutting all over my arms and legs until I passed out. Woke up still in the bath and thought \"fuck I hope no one noticed I passed out\". No one did and it had been a couple of hours, I think I may have taken some sleeping pills as well so I wouldn't feel the pain as bad. Bad times.
