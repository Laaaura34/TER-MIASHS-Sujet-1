That's a pretty daunting number.\n\nBut that's just abstract. You can't comprehend what that means in reality.

We're all insignificant in the grand scheme of things, but the grand scheme of things is a scale that doesn't have much importance to anybody individually.\n\nWe're all significant to somebody.
