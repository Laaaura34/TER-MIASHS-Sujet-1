I got to the unit, started pulling things out to put my car in and shut the door, I thought it would be the easiest way to die, if researched it and they said you just feel asleep and never woke up.  My friend asked what I was doing and I knew I'd been caught after I got half the stuff out. \n\nHe took me home, put me to bed (after I fought him for about an hour) and sat in my living room until my husband got home. They then discussed what needed to happen after that point because I couldn't be left alone. I was burning myself and they both knew I would try again. \n\nI remember waking up the next morning, my friend still on the couch and my husband right next to me and thinking, \"Fuck. I can't get out to do this.\" They both took me to the psych clinic that day. It was then that I thought how pissed my Mom was going to be to have a daughter in the psych ward and how disappointed she would be I ruined the family name. I made my husband call her and my Dad. \n\nI got my diagnosis there and they started medications. I had one more time that I really considered killing myself, that I was going to go attempt to crash my car into something, anything. I checked myself back into the ward, before I could try. My Mom was supportive the first time but the second time she implied I was doing it for attention.
