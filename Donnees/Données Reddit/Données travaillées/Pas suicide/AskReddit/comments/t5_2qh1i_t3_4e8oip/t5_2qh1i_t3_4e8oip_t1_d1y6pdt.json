I just felt extremely pissed off and unbearably sad. Almost like that feeling after you've been hysterically crying for hours, but there's no tears anymore and your throat and eyes are really dry and all you want to do is sleep. After I calmed down a little, I remember thinking, \"I wish nobody would've tried to save me. They didn't even do it for me, they did it to make themselves look good.\" \n Basically, II didn't think anyone actually wanted me to stay alive for the sake of actually living. They wanted to save me so they would look like a hero, which if you knew my situation is still probably true. I haven't attempted suicide in 3 years, but in all honesty I still strongly believe this.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6pdt/"}
