That was my last attempt...shortly after that I moved out of state and eventually halfway across the country to be away from my folks. I'm a lot better and we even have a better relationship because I only talk to them a few times a year and it's a phone call. I still struggle with depression but it hasn't gotten to that point in a little over ten years now.
