If I knew they'd stick me full of needles in the hospital, I never would have done it!\" \n\nI've always been horrendously terrified of needles. I'd ripped the IV off multiple times so they had to keep replacing it in different spots. \nI'm cringing at the memory.\n\nBut I remember finding it funny. Funny how I had just tried to kill myself but I woke up wishing I hadn't because... needles. It made me realize that I didn't actually want to die, but my brain and my illness led me to do so.\n\nMental illness is something I wish more people would understand. We want to die because some of our minds are too loud and we want peace and quiet just once. Or forever. What our brain makes us believe is that we are trapped and that we'll never escape this 'noise'. But things eventually do quiet down, it just requires patience, time, and ultimately, willpower. \n\nI just want to say that I'm proud of myself for surviving and sticking it out. I'm also proud of all the survivors on this post. Everywhere, even. Life is beautiful, it just takes time for some to see it.
