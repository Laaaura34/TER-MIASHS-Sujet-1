I'm sure it's not easy always being that support to the kids you encounter, but always keep in mind the many lives you're impacting. \n\nI had one teacher in middle school that always had my back and was watching out for me. She was my sixth grade teacher, but I went and visited her almost every school day through seventh and eighth grade as well because I felt so comfortable in my relationship with her. I'm facebook friends with her today, and still view her as a great mentor.\n\nIf I had had a teacher like her during my high school experience, I doubt I would have found myself in the rough place that I had. I lost my single adult support moving into high school, and while my friends wanted to be there for me, they didn't have enough life experience themselves to be what I needed. If there had been just ONE adult that reached out to me, I believe I would have been okay. \n\nKeep doing what you're doing. It takes one adult to change a child's world.
