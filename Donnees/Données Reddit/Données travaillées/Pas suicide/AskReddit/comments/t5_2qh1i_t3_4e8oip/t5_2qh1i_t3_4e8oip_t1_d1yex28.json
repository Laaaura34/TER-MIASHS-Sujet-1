Honestly if you are at the point where you have attempted suicide it is in your best interest to get away from school for a while and get help, not try to juggle a course load and mental health issues.\n\nA lot of people might try to stick it out still in school for a bunch of reasons, the school should step in at that point and make sure the right thing happens, often that is getting the student away from school.\n\nYes, it covers the schools ass, but it is the right thing to do in a large portion of the population where it is considered.  Just because it takes responsibility off the school doesn't mean it is bad for those involved.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yex28/"}
