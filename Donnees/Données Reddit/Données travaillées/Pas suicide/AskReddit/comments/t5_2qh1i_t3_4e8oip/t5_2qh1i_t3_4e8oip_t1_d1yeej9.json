As i was approaching the platform at about 50km/h he dropped his school bag and dove out in front of me . I hit emergency brake straight away and put 2 carriages over the top of him but by some insane fluke of luck or not depending how you look at it he landed right between both rails and straight away he came crawling out covered in grease like nothing happened ... Was intense ! He was screaming lifes not worth living . I just want to die . Just kill me .... he lived to fight another day and still had all of his limbs ... No idea what became of him but he was only about 12 or 13 years old ... Was in school uniform and all ... shocking thing to experience ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yeej9/"}
