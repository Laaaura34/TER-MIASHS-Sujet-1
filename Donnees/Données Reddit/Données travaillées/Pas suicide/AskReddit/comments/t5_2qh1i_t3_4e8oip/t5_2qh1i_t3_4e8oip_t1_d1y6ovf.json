I've experienced depression but never to the point of serious suicidal ideation, and there's a gulf between \"everything sucks\" and \"everything will always suck, forever\" that I have to admit I will probably never wrap my head around. So I don't even try to apply my logic to it. I just think, yeah, that sucks, and I'm not going to tell you \"it gets better\" or whatever. But you have to know that I'm going to do whatever I can to keep you alive because it matters a whole lot to me. And even if I can't promise you that things are going to be GREAT, I can promise you that they can be slightly, marginally better than they are right now. We can go buy your favorite candy, we can plan a little road trip to look forward to, we can just lie around and do nothing instead of washing the dishes tonight. I don't know how much difference it makes on the worst days, but he's doing okay now.\n\nWe also read a lot about clinical trials. I really do think we are close to major advancements in mental health treatment. Whether it's ketamine or electromagnetic stimulation or something we haven't even heard of yet-- we live in an age of extraordinary human achievement, and untreatable depression may not be untreatable forever.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6ovf/"}
