I'm 16, and I tried last year and the year before, both around september/october. I took every pill I could find, including tons of benadryl so I could pass out and never wake up. I sat in my bed, and started crying because I was so afraid... I told my parents and they took me to the ER and everything. I had to stay at the hospital for a couple of days. Those days were incredibly painful, not just because of the after effects of the pills metabolizing in my body. The next time I tried, I cut my legs fairly deep, and took even more pills than I had before. A year had passed since last time, and this time I took a whole bottle of Ibuprofen, sleeping pills, and every pill I could possibly find (again). I barely remember what even happened, except for when my parents were trying to put my limp body in the car, and police, and an ambulance. It's all kind of vague still. I woke up in the ER again, and then after that they put me in a psych ward for a week. It was torture in there. The worst feelings I've ever felt in my life were in a locked room, alone, in a corner, crying... I don't even like to think about it. Now I'm here, on tons of antidepressants, and always being watched. Haven't finished a year of school in two years, and now I'm trying to get my shit together, and figure out why I'm on this earth, and what I should do.
