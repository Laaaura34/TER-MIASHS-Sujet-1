We were together for a few months at the beginning but he was still missing his ex at the time. He called me one night, saying he had a knife and he'll kill himself if I didn't call call his ex. Instead I called the police. They found him in the bush, bleeding and they took him to hospital. He was in the mental ward overnight, but he talked his way out. He admitted later on to me that he wasn't ready to leave. Months later, he said that he had burned himself and had his arm wrapped up in bandages. I saw his arms later. They weren't burns. His arms have so many scars, they are like tattoo sleeves. But when you love someone, you learn to look past the scars. You learn to see them for who they really are, and people look at him all the time like he's crazy because of his arms. But he's brave and pretends not to notice the judgemental stares. He tried again and he said to me that the pain after cutting his wrists was the worst pain he's ever felt. It was so bad he never wanted to try it again, at least not that way. We aren't together any more but people like him need a guardian angel to look over them and to take away their pain, mental or physical. For the people who feel such a deep level of sorrow and pain seem to also love and feel the universe in an equally profound way. We need more people like that to stay in this world. I hope he forever does. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yczjb/"}
