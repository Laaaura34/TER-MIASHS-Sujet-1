We actually had a long tumultuous history after the break up, I didn't even mature much until years later. We've been out of contact for about 4 years and I've come leaps and bounds since then. I guess my fear was that he'd think \"oh god she's stirring up drama again\" if I send him a FB message or something. A letter is a great idea because it comes across more sincere and doesn't feel like it expects a reply.
