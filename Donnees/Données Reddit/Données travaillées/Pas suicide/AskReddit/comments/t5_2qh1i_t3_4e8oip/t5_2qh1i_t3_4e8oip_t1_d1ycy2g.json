I was really pissed at the time, felt like my trust had been betrayed or some stupid shit like that. I lost a good bit of my motor functions for a bit and was close to blacking out by the time my mom busted through the door. I had to be carried around everywhere at the hospital and they made me drink charcoal, i couldn't do it on my own so the nurse had to bottle feed it to me like i was a child. I don't remember much about it, but i remember feeling embarrassed about the whole ordeal. \n\nI think the first thought that i had is still the kind of thinking that keeps me going now. \"whatever, i guess i'll live then.\" I guess after realizing that i hadn't succeeded i just thought, that's it, it just wasn't meant to be. Really threw a lot of people off, including my therapist. I went from having really intense suicidal ideations to just kind of being okay with living. Shit happens i guess.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ycy2g/"}
