But for the most part, I decided to abort my attempt. I tried with pills, but about 15 minutes afterwards I couldn't stop thinking about my family members. I have no problem with death, but I have an older family and I was too worried to be able to go through with it. If my family was younger/healthier I probably would have gone through with it, but while I have no problems taking my own life I won't take anyone with me. My mom has had health issues her whole life, and my grandparents on my father's side are very old (grampie's going to be 100 next month). \n\nSo, the first thought I had was of my family I guess. I never went to the hospital or doctor but I felt like crap for the first few days recovering from it. I didn't necessarily feel regret, more like just regret at it not being a good time for it. I've had a few episodes since then (it was almost 8 years ago) but haven't really tried again. Still depressed but not as severely. Although if I could go peacefully without inflicting too much pain I would probably do so.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yqrlr/"}
