I was always a model student in the AP class. I've gotten several interest letters from various prestigious colleges. The fact that a suspension was issued to me rocked my world. This would prevent me from getting into college. No one would want someone who was suspended. That night, I snuck into my father's office and found his glock. I stared at it for a good 10 minutes, then loaded it and put it up to my head. I couldn't physically pull the trigger. This doesn't quantify as \"surviving\" but I wanted to share.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yifvz/"}
