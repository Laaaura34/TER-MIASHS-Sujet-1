My friends know my real account.\n___\n\nI've been secretly depressed and have deep anxiety. I take seroquel and zoloft daily. I fake enthusiasm so well that no one around me realizes that I'm actually kind of dead inside. I put up a good smiling face for my family and friends and then crash and burn when I'm alone, anxiety so strong it feels like I'd die any second. My first attempt, I used my old belt around my neck and tied it around my neck. I tied the other end on my bed frame and I tightened and pulled hard till my vision was blacking out. The metal buckle broke and I lived. I felt nothing. No joy, no regret, no happiness. It was life as usual. I don't think I'll try again, I just get tired of smiling for everyone else while I'm breaking down inside. It's hard. My life is an act. Everything I do is a act. My life is fake. I'm putting on a happy person's shoes, hoping one day they'd belong to me. I'm still waiting for that day.\n\nTL;DR: \"Oh well\" thought", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8fqu/"}
