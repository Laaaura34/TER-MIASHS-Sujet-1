You have the \"you\" brain, which is struggling to be heard, and the \"depression\" brain, which is telling you a lot of falsehoods all while trying to keep the \"you\" brain quiet so you can't hear it. \n\nWhen I get really, really down, I tell myself, \"These aren't my thoughts. These are the thoughts of my \"depression\" brain, and they aren't true.\" \n\nThat's also when I realize that I need to reach out for help.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ydj4v/"}
