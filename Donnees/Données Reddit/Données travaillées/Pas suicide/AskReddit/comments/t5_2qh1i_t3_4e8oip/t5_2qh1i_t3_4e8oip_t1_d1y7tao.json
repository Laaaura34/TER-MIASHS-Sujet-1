I just wanted it to be fast.\n\nMy actual attempt kinda came out of the blue, there was nothing in particular that triggered it right then, one evening I just felt that I had had enough and couldn't take it anymore. I was in a pretty deep depression at the time and had recently had to drop out of my education because of it.\n\nThis happened in beginning of 2011 and the rest of that year is just one big blur to me now. It wasn't untill around the end of the year when some of my friends came to visit and saw my apartment piled up with old pizza boxes and other trash, they gave me a push to seek some help and regain some control over my life.\n\nI spend 2012 slowly getting better, I even got back to my education and finished the next year. I will probably have to take some meds for the rest of my life, but that is a small price to pay, to avoid falling into a hole like that ever again.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7tao/"}
