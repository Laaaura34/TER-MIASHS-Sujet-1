Personally I've never been in your or any similar situation, but sometimes I feel down a lot. I've also learned to see things this way, to see love and joy in every little thing we see and do - that fresh breeze, that tasty wet bite from the apple, how strangers are helping each other over the net. When I tell friends or people about how I can enjoy those little things and how they instantly push me back up into happy mode, they usually don't understand me. But I think you and you who reads this do. Thanks.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7tci/"}
