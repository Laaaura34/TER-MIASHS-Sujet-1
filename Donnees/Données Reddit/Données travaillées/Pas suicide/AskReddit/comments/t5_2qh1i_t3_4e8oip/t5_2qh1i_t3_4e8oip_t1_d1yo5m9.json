I am from the US with the screwed up system.  It's stupid and ridiculous, but the troops are protecting us and for some reason our government sees the military budget as more important to prevent terrorist attacks that are always barraging us. Healthcare is VERY expensive here, and even if that person is insured it can easily cost thousands of dollars.
