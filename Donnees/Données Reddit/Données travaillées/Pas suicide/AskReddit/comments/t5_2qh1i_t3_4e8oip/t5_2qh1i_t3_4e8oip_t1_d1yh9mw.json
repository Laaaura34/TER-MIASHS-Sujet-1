I tried overdosing meds at 16: my parents were out of town and I was just looking for a way to do it that had the least chances to leave me paralyzed if it didn't go as planned, so I went for my mother's hypertension medication. I swallowed a box, some sleeping pills and vodka, and went to sleep. \n\nI first woke up a few hours later because my dogs were barking, and realized I had pisssed my bed. At that point I just thought \"it didn't work yet\", and downed another box of pills with vodka before going back to sleep. I didn't allow myself to think much about it, I just wanted it to be over.\n\nThen, in the morning, I woke up again. That's when I realized I wasn't going to die though I felt tingly and weird. The first thought I remember I had is \"shit, I need to call my mother and tell her now\"... The days that followed were the worst of my life", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yh9mw/"}
