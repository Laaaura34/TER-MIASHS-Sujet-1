I have some shitty medical issues that mean I'm in horrible pain almost every minute of the day. I wasn't suicidal, but I didn't want to live like that any more. \n\nSo I downloaded an app called Mood Tools. They have a section called \"Safety Plan\" and part of the safety plan is \"reasons to live.\" even during times I couldn't add anything to the list, I could read it. And I could remember. Tiramisu, coffee, tea, music, cats, books. So many things! As silly as it sounds, one of the things that spoke to me the most was books. \n\nBeing essentially bedridden, reading is one of the few things I can do. So it was one of the biggest things on my list. \n\nI really recommend that app for anyone having problems.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y96gi/"}
