I really did not plan on waking up. I had taken a LOT of pills. The police found me later in the day and took me to the hospital. I was screaming at everyone and being non-cooperative and they sent someone into the room with a needle. I prayed that I was going to be euthanized. It was only a sedative. I was later evaluated, put on meds, etc. \n\nAfter that day, nothing felt real. Emotions, conversations, hobbies, special interests... it all felt so empty. My psyche had finally decided to end itself but was unsuccessful. I really never felt normal after that. I'm here now, though, 2 years later. Call it a miracle. I just hope I can learn to be a friend again.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ytzxl/"}
