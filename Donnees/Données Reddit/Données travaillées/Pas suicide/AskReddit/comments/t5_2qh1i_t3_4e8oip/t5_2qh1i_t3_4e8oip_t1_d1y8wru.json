The lecture was about emotions, and so at the beginning of class the professors posted a survey to the 1500 or 2000 or so students tuning in to the lecture. It basically went through a few concepts or things (stuff like snakes, clowns, failure, ebola, death, etc.) and asked on a scale of 1-5 (1 no fear; 5 extreme fear) how fearful you were of it. About 30% of the class chose 4 or 5 regarding death, and about 70% chose a 4 or 5 regarding failure. Then again, the sample population was University students, so that should give a little bit of insight as to our priorities.
