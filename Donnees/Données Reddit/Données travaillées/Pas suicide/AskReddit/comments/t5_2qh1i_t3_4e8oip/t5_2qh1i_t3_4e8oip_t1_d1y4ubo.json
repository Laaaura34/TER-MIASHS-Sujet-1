I got out of a car on the freeway after taking a bunch of pills.  The next thing I remember was saying to a receptionist \"Why?  Do I LOOK like I'm on something?\"  and then seeing my reflection in the mirror and seeing half my face was black.  I didn't know what was going on but that was before being bandaged - I had road rash from my face all the way down to my leg as I had been briefly dragged by the car after being caught on the belt.\n\nThen they kept me so doped up for about a week that I was too fucked up to finish the job.
