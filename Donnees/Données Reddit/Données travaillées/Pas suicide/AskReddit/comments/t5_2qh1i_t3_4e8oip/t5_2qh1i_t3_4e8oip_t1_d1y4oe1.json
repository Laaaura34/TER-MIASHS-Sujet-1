I don't really remember the immediate aftermath very well. I sort of remember being taken to the hospital and wondering what the big deal was, but I think that might be a false memory.\n\nThe first memory I'm confident of is sitting on a hospital bed in the ER being told that I could either be willingly admitted the the juvenile psychiatric ward, or I could waste hours of everyone's time and be marched up there by an armed police officer. I'm pretty sure all I felt at the time was frustration, mostly about how big a deal everyone was making about it.\n\nI'm better now. I can't honestly say I'm a functional human being, but after ten years or so I've grown up quite a bit.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y4oe1/"}
