My first thought upon waking up was, \"Oh my god, someone actually cared enough to save me.\". I'm sorry that this isn't really long or talking about things in depth, but I honestly don't remember much about the incident. I think I vomited a lot, though? I was about... 14 or 15, I think? Maybe 13? It wasn't a spur of the moment thing, it wasn't teenage angst or whatever a lot of people might call it. It was true depression, which I had suffered from since about age 10 or so, and I still have to deal with it practically every moment of my life.
