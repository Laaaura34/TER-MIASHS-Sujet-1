I still wanted to die, just not in a hospital in a traumatic atmosphere. I had taken paracetamol (too many to count) and had fallen unconscious after vomiting all over myself. My heart rate was dangerously low and my respiration was not ideal.\n\n\nAfter I came to consciousness, I accepted all treatment just so I could get out. Now I float round everyday, waiting for the ideal time to try again. \n\nEDIT - thank you for all the support. Regarding the situations leading up to my attempt, I came to the sudden realization that I am one in six billion, an insignificant speck in the grand scheme of things. This is an overwhelming concept and I'm still trying to confront this problem. I am not sure if I can handle another 60 years of insignificance.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y2qd4/"}
