It's done and over with, and nothing you do is going to change it. What you DO have some measure of control over is the present and the future, so it only makes sense to concentrate on that. I sometimes think that I wouldn't change anything (except losing the love of my life) because I'm happy with myself today. But if you do feel like you just can't do it anymore then there's no reason to throw everything away... Get on suboxone or methadone and stay on it until you feel strong enough to try again. It beats going back to dope, since we both know where that leads. Good luck. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1znrmc/"}
