Attempt was because of hidden  penis syndrome, coupled with the worst case of balanitis xerotica obliterans my uroligist has ever seen.\n\nI still  think of other ways to get it done, i mean. I need surgery  that my urologist cant perform because i have a large pubis mons (pelvis, in short). \n\nFirst thought  after i realized i wasnt successful?  I should have got an automatic. I cant drive a stick shift while drunk. \n\nSeen my primary care doctor. Got anti depression medications and while its not as bad as it used to be, I'm on a bit of a time limit. I have until the end of this year to somehow lose enough  weight that my pubis mons fat goes away, or they might have to do a penectomy. \n\nI refuse to live that life. So I'm scrambling looking for a doctor who will do liposuction  in just that area, then i can get penile reconstruction done... but its not looking promising.\n\nHalp? Lol. You can read more about this problem in my past comments. Apologies now for misspelling or grammar.
