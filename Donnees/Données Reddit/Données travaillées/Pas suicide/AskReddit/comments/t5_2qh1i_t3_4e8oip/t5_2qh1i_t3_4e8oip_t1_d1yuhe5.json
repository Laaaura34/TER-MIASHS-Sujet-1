My first attempt I put a loaded gun from my stepdads closet in my mouth and my friend called and asked if I wanted to go bowling, made me realize I didn't want to die. Or so I thought. On my second attempt I tried to OD. I was 17. I remember waking up, and like many others have said, I was shackled to a hospital bed. I was just confused everything was so bright at first I thought I was in the afterlife. I was so disoriented but eventually came to and saw my parents standing there. All I could do was cry and tell them I was sorry over and over again till I fell back asleep. \n\nIf you ever feel so depressed you want to end your life, reach out. As cliche as it sounds just tell someone, get any help you can. It's not worth putting your family through the pain and torment they will feel, whether you do end your own life or not, they think they have failed you as parents. My dad still believes himself to be a terrible father and he wasn't, but he blames himself still. \n\nDeath isn't worth escaping your troubles. As shit as it gets sometimes you have to believe that there is something good around the corner. I recently (22 now) thought about ending my life again about a year ago. I was house sitting for my grandparents and decided to get a bunch of friends together for one last hurrah. They brought more people and I ended up meeting my girlfriend and she's the greatest thing to ever happen to me. \n\nThere is always something good in the world to keep on fighting for.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yuhe5/"}
