That shit destroys the relationship, the idea of her dying by my side being her wish just broke my heart. And i had saved her literally many times before that and everything was suppose to be getting allright again, those days were behind us.. Then it happened again, i just had to go. It wasn't fair towards me, i do not feel selfish of leaving her after that; i was already feeling paranoid, there was a chance of double homicide in the air. If she wanted to die, i was not going to be apart of it nor join it in anyway. I don't know if she is still alive, i can't know anything about her, not a slightest detail cause i go crazy...", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ybrxc/"}
