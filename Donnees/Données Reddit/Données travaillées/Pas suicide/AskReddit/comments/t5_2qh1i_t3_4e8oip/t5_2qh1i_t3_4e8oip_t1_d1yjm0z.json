Broke free of my restraints 4 times, took 5 men twice my size to hold me down, I ripped my IV out 5 times, and my catheter once :( glad I don't remember that. Continually pulled the monitors off myself while in ICU. I'm so grateful the nurses and doctors put up with my shot because I was crazy for a solid 8 hours or a little more. Acid is a hell of a drug and you shouldn't try to be brave with it. Hopefully a much more sober life awaits me in the future.
