I took aprox 500 pills to try and end myself. The pills consisted of my antidepressants, allergy meds and a few other prescription i was on at the time. after taking them i fell asleep and then mid way through the night woke up and threw up some of the pills and then fell right back to sleep. After waking up again in the morning I though about why I was still alive as well as how shity I felt as the pills I took make me very  nauseous.  a few interesting notes after I went to the hospital they didn't have room for me so I had to wait over 24 hours after I had taken the meds before I got admitted to the emergency room and then had to drink charcoal which is single handedly the worst thing I have ever had to consume. I ever ended up going to the emergency room and then left and came back because the wait was so long.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8ynk/"}
