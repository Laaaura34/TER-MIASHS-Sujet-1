This is an overwhelming concept and I'm still trying to confront this problem. I am not sure if I can handle another 60 years of insignificance.\n\nBeing insignificant as far as the universe is concerned doesn't mean that your life can't have meaning. I think that too many people try to make a grand impact on the world without ever trying to simply make themselves happy. You have to live for *you*, not for other people, not for the world, not for the universe. We all have such a short time, but a huge capacity for happiness. My life will only have been an insignificant waste if I choose not to pursue that happiness. One day I will die and some people will mourn and then I will be forgotten. But *right now*, in the moment, I can do something that makes me smile, I can choose to feel the gratification of bettering myself, I can feel pleasant things, and *that* is more important than anything. It's what makes life wonderful, even if it is fleeting. It's totally okay to be insignificant in the grand scheme of things, but you don't have to live an insignificant life....just make it meaningful to *you*. Enjoy your time here! :) ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yepl4/"}
