My head...\"\n\nI tried suffocating myself with a plastic bag when I was younger but my reflexes kicked in and I bit a hole in the bag, letting enough air in to keep me alive.\nI still passed out. Woke up a bit later with a massive headache and a swollen neck (apparently, choking half-to-death can cause some serious strain on your neck, who knew?).\nLater that day, my parents asked about my neck, messed up voice, and bloodshot eyes. I actually told them I tried smoking week and hated it. It was easier than admitting I tried to end it all.\n\nNever told them the truth.\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y4wej/"}
