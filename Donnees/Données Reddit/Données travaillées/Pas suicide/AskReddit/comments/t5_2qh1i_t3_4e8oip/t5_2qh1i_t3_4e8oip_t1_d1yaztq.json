Write it in a note and hand it to him on your first visit if you have to. It will make the therapy worthwhile.\n\nAlso, a great way to feel less insignificant is to volunteer. If you want to feel like you're making an immediate difference and you like animals, volunteer to be an animal companion at a shelter. You walk the dogs, pet the cats...whatever. It helps socialize the animals to give them a better life AND a better chance of getting adopted into a forever home. You end up helping each other!", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yaztq/"}
