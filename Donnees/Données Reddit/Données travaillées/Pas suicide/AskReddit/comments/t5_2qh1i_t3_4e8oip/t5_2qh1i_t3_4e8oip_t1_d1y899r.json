I let myself down easy and knocked the chair i was standing on over and just relaxed.  I passed out pretty quickly.  It was over.  I had a bad drug problem and this was my alternative to jail and rehab. \n\nRight after I knocked out the chair I was standing on from under me, or shortly thereafter, the railing collapsed and I fell free to the floor.  Blood continued to pump into my brain and I suffered no permanent effects physically. \n\nI woke up to my mother and brother standing over me shaking me.  I guess my mom found I still had a pulse and they were just trying to revive me.  I Just felt embarrassed for everyone, mostly myself. \n\nI went out and got as high as I could afford that night.  A week later I had a DUI accident where I fell asleep at the wheel on heroin and cocaine.  Detox in jail and then a really nice rehab in Utah were paid for by my family and I stayed there a year.  I'll be 4 years clean in November.\n\nI am still agnostic but if God is real he makes shitty garage door railings on purpose.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y899r/"}
