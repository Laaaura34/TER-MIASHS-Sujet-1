Obviously didn't work either time (unless I'm a ghost or this IS hell). My first thought upon waking both times was \"Why can't I just die already?!\" Followed by \"I can't hear anything, work is going to be a nightmare\" (side effect of the meds I took was thinned blood, and if your blood is below a certain consistency, apparently you won't be able to hear until it thickens back up, who knew).\n\nHaven't attempted since, but not because I don't want to. I think about it literally everyday. In fact my first thought every morning when my alarm goes off is \"I wish I was dead\". You know how when you have a craving for a certain food, you can almost taste it? I can almost feel the gun barrel in my mouth and my finger on the trigger.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yx2jd/"}
