He fell asleep, I wanted to forever. I remember nothing clearly after the ambien. But as soon as I came to, I have weird memory flashes. The boyfriend being in the drivers side of my car... The glaring lights of the first response. \nHe tried to get me in the car, but my breathing slowed dramatically. He had to call 911. He saved my life.\nThose flashes haunt me, as I'm sure they do him. For me, those memories force me to understand the pain and fear and panic he experienced. \n\nEDIT: This was quite recent and I've had to drop from school and as a result have been crazy looking for work. I've actually been head hunted. Had an extremely promising interview today. I know it may not come through but just seeing that I'm of that much value to be sought out is amazing.\n\nEDIT: I got the job!
