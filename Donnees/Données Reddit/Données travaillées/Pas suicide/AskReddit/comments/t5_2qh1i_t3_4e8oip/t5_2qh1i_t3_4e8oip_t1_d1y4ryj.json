All the \"helpful\"(not helpful) commenter was doing was just saying. \"You can solve the problem,\" it just feels so useless. Yeah ok it's easy for you to say, but you've never even encountered the problem, you don't know anything about it. And imagine if the math problem somehow would only let certain people solve it. You are *sure* you have the impossible trait, then someone says \"you can do it,\" it just seems so pointless, it's not helpful. It doesn't make me feel better, it just makes you feel like everyone else can do it but you. Why am I so bad at math, im a failure ect.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y4ryj/"}
