To meet someone special, to travel the world with this person, and to start a family with them. It all hinges on that special someone, a relationship with them. I'm 24 and have 0 relationship experience. And I mean 0. I've been on 3 first dates in my life, all of which went terribly and I have no idea why. I've tried online dating for 4 years to no avail.  \n\nI'm overweight, unattractive and boring. I know no one wants any of those traits in a perspective \"mate\", therefore I know that I'll never achieve my first goal and thus never achieve my other two.  \n\nSome would say I should change my goals, but I have 0 interest in anything else. My only real hobby is gaming, and I tried to go to school to create them but dropped out when I realized it would take up a vast majority of my time (80-100 hour work weeks aren't uncommon in the gaming industry). So right now I'm pursuing a career in accounting, but I'm currently unemployed with no prospects in sight.  \n\nSo let's just say because I have 0 interest in any achievable goal in life, I know that my life will inevitably be boring and uneventful until either I take my own life, or it is taken from me.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ym3zh/"}
