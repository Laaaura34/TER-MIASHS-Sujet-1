The gun went off right next to my right ear and it was pitch black at night where I was so ultimately I thought I was dead. I remember thinking that the afterlife felt the same but just more empty. And then the ringing in my ears creeped into my conscious and made me realize that I was alive and dumb/selfish for trying.
