Shit.\"\n\nI remember getting up in the morning and it just *hurt*. Everything hurt, buy mostly inside. It didn't hurt enough, though, so I rubbed every wound with salt. I mean, literally, I had covered myself in them, from the back of my shoulders to the tops of my feet. The room was freezing and I rubbed everything with salt and got dressed. \n\nI remember going down and having breakfast, and it was spring but wet and cold, and absolutely nothing had changed. Nothing. I hadn't, the world hadn't. It was like I'd never done anything at all. \n\nPutting on my heavy backpack was agony, I remember my shoulders cracked open again. Then I went to school and after that to weekend camp. After camp, on Sunday, my friends forced me to the A&E, and they admitted me to the children's ward. \n\nI was admitted Sunday evening and by Wednesday noon they'd decided I was already getting the care and support I needed. 45 minutes of therapy every 14 days and Prozac. \n\nI'm very, very bitter about that. It wasn't enough. I'd been doing 45 minutes for years and Prozac for months. \n\nI left. I left everything behind before I turned off age. I wasn't meant to do that, but I had a safe spot and was in it when my world exploded some months later and I staid. \n\nAlmost fifteen years later, I'm doing good. Well, I've had one recent bout of depression that has left me on sick leave, but I've not self-harmed and I've not needed hospitalisation. Besides, one bout in 15 years? I can do this. It's nothing, compared to where I've been. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1z0e5b/"}
