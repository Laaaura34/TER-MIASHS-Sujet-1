I in a daze must have vomited in a corner of my room and when I woke up I was like \"I don't want to clean that up.\" and kinda Just stuck to cutting. A lit of fucked up shit had happened to me in the past year so it seemed the best idea at the time.  \n\nBut IDK I just started doing my own shit and not worrying about other people. And going to raves in the city and getting my own nontown friends. \n\nThe last time, I remember I drank a shit load of Jack Daniels and hoped it would be enough to Kill me in my sleep. But I didn't. \n\nI think my initial thought was,  \"I guess maybe I should try to get help then.\" \n\nAt that time I had a pretty good alcohol problem going on and nothing seemed to be working, I made meetings,  I saw a therapist but nothing was fixing that deep down I just wanted to die and alcohol wasn't solving that feeling anymore. \n\nI still deep down wish I were dead. I'm 32, I'm overweight, and unemployed. I could hide and say,  \"but I'm a stay at home mother \" but thats a lie,  I don't want to be a stay at home mother so I'm definitely unemployed. \n\nWhat keeps me not doing it is I'd like to not be remembered as a huge fat ass.  So I've got to lose some weight. And maybe, getting my masters might help with that inescapable feeling that I'm m a failure. \n\nTho,  I remember this from that movie about David Foster Wallace that I've been infected by this American idea that somehow some grand gesture will cure me. \n\nBut I don't have a plan, and I'm pretty stable for now so it's all good.
