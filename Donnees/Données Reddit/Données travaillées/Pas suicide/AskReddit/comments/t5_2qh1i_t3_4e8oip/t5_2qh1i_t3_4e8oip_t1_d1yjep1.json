It really helped me stabilize but the lexapro was annoying to come off of. \n\nI highly recommend it. It will most likely kill your sex drive while on it, but it comes back. It helped me get over a few rough months of learning what people meant when they said they literally couldn't get out of bed. \n\nStill on the concerta for my ADD, but it also has the perk of helping me stay stable and it's the best thing that has mentally happened to be since finally seeking therapy. \n\nIf a drug is not working for you ADVOCATE for yourself! I started on Adderall and hated it so my doctor let me switch. The Lexapro dose had to be adjusted twice. Communication is key. \n\nAlso, it does take at least 4 weeks to feel changes. Those four weeks are LONG and you can feel a bit hopeless or gypped, but I'm so glad I stuck it out.
