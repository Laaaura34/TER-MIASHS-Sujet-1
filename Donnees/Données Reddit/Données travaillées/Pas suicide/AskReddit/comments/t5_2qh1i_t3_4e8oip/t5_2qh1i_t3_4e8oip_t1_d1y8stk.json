Or like how lazy people resent healthy people. People without self knowledge will perceive self improvement the same as calling them a coward. Because they are cowardly.\n\nThis is especially sensitive regarding family. People have lifelong narratives about their family. Toxic parents have many strategies to keep their children mentally tied to them. To challenge this narrative by denouncing your own parents is to show them that they can do the same. \n\nA small part of them considers the possibility, and is immediately attacked by the other parts to dominate and quell those \"treasonous\" thoughts -- because to seriously consider cutting ties with ones own parents leads to a huge lack in security. So much drama and heartache that can simply be avoided by going along to get along. \n\nAnd to justify their cowardice, these people then project all that terror and horribleness onto you instead, because you suggested such an ugly thing. Parents are awesome! How dare you challenge that?", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8stk/"}
