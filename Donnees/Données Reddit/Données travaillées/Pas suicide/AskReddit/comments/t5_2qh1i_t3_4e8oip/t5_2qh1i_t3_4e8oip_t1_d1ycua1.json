The only people who really helped, are the people who subtly tells me that they are around  if i needed them, and occasionally asked me how i was. \n\nI feel that some people offer help because it make themselves feel better for being 'good', instead of offering help because they care about you.\n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ycua1/"}
