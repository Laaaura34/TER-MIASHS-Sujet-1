Coughing black. I'd tried to light a charcoal fire in my class B RV trailer with no plumbing or electricity that I was behind on rent on and wanted to just die in my sleep from CO poisoning. My gambling addiction got me to a point where I was going to become homeless and eventually jobless and I was going to die on the streets anyway. I knew no one would check on me except the landlady or sheriff who would come to throw me out after a few more days. \n\nI called 911 to Baker Act myself. You'd think my coughing would be a clue that I needed help. The operator told me that I couldn't Baker Act myself, someone had to call and report me, and that my attempt had to meet some threshold of severity before they would send help.\n\nI learned that help was for others and not for me. That attempt was over 2 years ago and I still have the cough. I will probably have it forever.\n\nThat wasn't the most recent time, but it was the time that affected me the most.\n\nObjectively, my life is better now, but subjectively, I'm still one crisis (or pseudo-crisis) away from making another attempt. I'm weary of feeling this way, and I don't seek help anymore because I don't feel any better when I seek help; I'm just poorer and guilt-ridden because everyone I've gone to has been bootstrappy and loaded with phrases like \"you have to want to feel better for us to help.\" They literally want me to just say \"hooray i'm happy and completely cured everything is ok with the world\" and then they tick it off on their success column.\n\nOne day it will be over and I will be at peace.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ymwl1/"}
