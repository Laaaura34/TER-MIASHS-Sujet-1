They don't see things the same way. They value your life *so much* because they love you and care about you. They like having you around even if you can't see why. You're so special to them and important to them and it hurts them to think of a world without you in it. I understand when someone chooses to end their life, I've felt that pain, but I understand the pain of someone taking themselves away as well. It's hard not to get angry at them not seeing... Just try, when things are bad, seeing yourself like they see you. I think that might be the best version of ourselves.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ybs5k/"}
