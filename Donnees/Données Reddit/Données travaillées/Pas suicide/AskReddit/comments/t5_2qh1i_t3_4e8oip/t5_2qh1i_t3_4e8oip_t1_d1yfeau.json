I really enjoy listening to him talk about it from time to time, he will kind of mention how he's doing in the intro, or discuss it with guests sometimes. I am not in that situation, but it's great hearing someone do a thing that is so hard, and be better for it. \n\nBest wishes.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yfeau/"}
