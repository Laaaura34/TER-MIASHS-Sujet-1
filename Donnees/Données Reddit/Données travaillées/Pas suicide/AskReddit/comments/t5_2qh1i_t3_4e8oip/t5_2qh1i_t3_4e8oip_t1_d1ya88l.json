Two things that helped me: the song Blue Wind from Spring Awakening (a song about suicide and things to live for), and the bible verse \"you are fearfully and wonderfully made.\"\n\nI know I'm a simpering weepy stereotype, but I went to the hospital and got reacquainted with Jesus. Religion is a safe hobby that involves a lot of singing and meditation. \n\nThe opiate of the masses is better for my health than actual opiates.
