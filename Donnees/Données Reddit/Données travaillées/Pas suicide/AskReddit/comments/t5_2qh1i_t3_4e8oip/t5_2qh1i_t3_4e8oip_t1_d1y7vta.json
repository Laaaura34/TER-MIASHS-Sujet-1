Granted, most policies have an exclusion for 2 or 3 years after inception, and they can also try to not pay if you fail to disclose a history of mental illness, but outside of those things there isn't anything inherent in the act of suicide which makes it any different than any other way of dying in the eyes of life insurance companies. The actuarial tables take into account the statistical risk of suicide when a policy is issued, just like the risk of dying in a car wreck, of heart disease, etc.\n\nBecause of the widespread belief that insurance policies won't pay out, some percentage of would-be beneficiaries never even look into making a claim if a loved one takes their own life", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7vta/"}
