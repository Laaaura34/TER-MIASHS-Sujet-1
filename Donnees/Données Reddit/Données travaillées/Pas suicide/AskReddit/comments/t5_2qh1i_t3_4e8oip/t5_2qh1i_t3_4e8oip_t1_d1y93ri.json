A lot of my family work as nurses or counselours and i asked my mother about it and if the nurses would mock/judge me if i ever ended up in hospital cause of a failed suicide attempt. She just said that if any nurse/doctor was caught mocking/judging any person who just tried to commit suicide they would get fired on the spot. You are not the first person in this thread that mention horrible nurses and it makes me so mad. Its there job to help u and atleast show some compassion.
