So I did exactly that and then I put the rifle up under my chin because that was easiest way I found to have it. I had the gun loaded and the firing pin ready. \n\nJust as I went to pull the trigger, I had decided I wasn't going to go through with it and so I went to move my finger away from the trigger but instead actually accidentally pulled the trigger and I was sure that was the end of it.\n\nAnyway lucky for me somehow the bullet got jammed in the barrel because when I loaded it, it managed to go in on a weird angle. Anyway so that's why I'm here still and things are getting a little bit better as they go. Although I especially feel like a douche for making an attempt on my life on the day after Christmas, let alone doing it at all.\n\nAnyway still here so hurray.\n\nTL:DR - Loaded gun, realised I didn't want to do it, accidentally pulled trigger and luckily the bullet jammed in barrel.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yeajd/"}
