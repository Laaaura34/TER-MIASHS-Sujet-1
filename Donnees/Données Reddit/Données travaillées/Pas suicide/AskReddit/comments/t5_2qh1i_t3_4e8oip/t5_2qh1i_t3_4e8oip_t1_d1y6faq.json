On a very desparate day, i watched a video on how to make noose and that night i set it up to just stop me about 1m (?) above the floor. I pushed away all other furniture just so i wont be able to reach them and survive, steped on the back of a chair put the noose on and kicked the chair.\nI immediatly felt some sort of blackness (did i pass out?), severe pain around my neck and above all, i felt my feet touching the ground! Turns out climbing rope can strech out like a motherfucker. It was the only rope at the house and i didnt even think that this might happen.\nI came to, and for a blink of an eye i thought \"fuck yes i am alive!\" I looked around and reached for the desk by extending my leg, fortunatly i did reach it and pulled it towards me. There were scissors on it. I cut the rope and went straight to a mirror, i had a huge round burnmark around my neck, (went away after a year) and some hair pulled out.\nI remember how fucking scared i was and how fucking relieved i was to be alive!\n\nThat was about 3 years ago and i m still glad i didnt die. On very intense awful moments i will fantasize that i have to-will do it, but i KNOW that i will not.\n\nPlease nobody do this.
