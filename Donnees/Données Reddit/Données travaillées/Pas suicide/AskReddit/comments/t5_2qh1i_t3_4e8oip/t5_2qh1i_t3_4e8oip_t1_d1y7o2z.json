Nothing major.\n\nMaybe 4 months ago, a guy, 28, was brought in after a failed suicide attempt. Overdose. \n\nNothing we haven't seen before. He had 2 of his closest friends (no family! He made that part very, very clear) there. After a few hours of talking, he mentioned his regrets of his \"moment of madness\" and how \"his thoughts were so much clearer now\" that pills weren't an option anymore. His friends took over where the police left off; supervising him.\n\n14 hours, and a lot of pleasant sounding words later, one of his friends let him go to the bathroom, unsupervised...\n\n3 Minutes later, the door is busted open; he's hanging by his laces (it's not a prison, just a hospital) with his face turning purple.\n\nI've never shit myself so bad. Thankfully, we managed to resus him in time and he was okay. He was passed on for a psyche assessment not long after that.\n\nI haven't seen nor heard from him again. And I genuinely don't know if that's a good thing, or a bad thing.\n\n\n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7o2z/"}
