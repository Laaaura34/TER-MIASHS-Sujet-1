They said they were really worried and my mom rushed me to the hospital once I woke up, but how important was it really that they knew I took a lot of pills but just left me in a bed? What if I had actually died, you know? I have a lot of questions now but at the time I was only 10 so I didn't really think about it.\n\nMy mom never really believes me when I'm ill. When I fell and broke my wrist, she put frozen vegetables on it and went to church. It was only when my grandma came and saw my wrist that she told my mom to take me to a hospital.\n\nFun times.\n\nI love my family but it's a highly dysfunctional family and people have been telling me for years to get a job and move out so I can get away from them due to all the crap, but I'm still a teen so it's hard.
