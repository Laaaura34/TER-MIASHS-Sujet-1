I have been thinking about suicide often lately, usually every day. I just can't shake the thought of it. But I also don't really know how to do it - no high buildings in my area, not an easy access to guns, not a huge amount of pills availabe. I am really scared of being in pain during or after it - if I survive. \n\nSo I probably will have to live with this for a while...\n\nI wanted to write something at /depression or another sub, but I just don't have the energy to do so.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ya0j9/"}
