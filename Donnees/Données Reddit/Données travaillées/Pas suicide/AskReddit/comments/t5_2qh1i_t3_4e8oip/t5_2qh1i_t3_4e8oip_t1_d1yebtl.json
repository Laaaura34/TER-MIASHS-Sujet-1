I was borderline depressed. I felt that I was a waste of space. I didn't bring anyone happiness. I made my partner unhappy (or so I thought. It was a toxic relationship), my parents, my siblings. I didn't want to exist. I took pills. They weren't enough. I remember still being upset, but there was the slight relief that I was OK. No one knew except my partner at the time. Nothing compared to these other stories. But I wanted to say that there is always something better. As clich\u00e9d as it sounds, it WILL get better.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yebtl/"}
