I am a very logical thinker so I can't really understand what he's going through. I feel like all the right pieces are in place but it's just not *clicking*. He's talked to several people, one of which even went through almost an identical situation and could identify with him. After talking to her, he was in a good state of mind for about 12 hours .. but eventually all the good thoughts fade away and he's just left in anguish. To me, it feels like he's just picking at a scab instead of letting it heal but it may not be as conscious of an action as that.\n\nI'll check out /r/suicidewatch to see if I can find some help, thanks for the advice and availability.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ygig9/"}
