Getting pissed off about it brought me out of the state of mind that night. Turns out my dad had removed the firing pin when he inherited the gun. A couple of years later I overdosed my self with 100 units of my fast acting insulin and a bottle of southern comfort.  Woke up in the hospital and was amazed that it didn't work.  I started smoking figuring that would eventually kill me.  Although I am not suicidal anymore I still smoke, knowing it will kill me, so maybe I am suicidal to some small degree?", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y4tkm/"}
