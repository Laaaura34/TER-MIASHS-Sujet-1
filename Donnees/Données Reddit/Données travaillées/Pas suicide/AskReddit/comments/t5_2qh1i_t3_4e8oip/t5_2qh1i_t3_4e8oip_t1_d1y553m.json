I can remember deciding to use my insulin to go. Figured that passing out and dying of a seizure due to hypoglycemia would be a quick and easy way to go.\n\nSo I give myself the biggest dose that I could at one time, 60 units of fast acting insulin (it usually takes care of around 600g of carbs) and instantly regret it, so I run to the corner store across the street and get like 4 liters of sodas, and assorted chocolate bars, and dial for a Chinese delivery that arrived about 20 mins later. I got an odd look from the delivery guy as I start eating the chow mein right in front of him.\n\n The entire episode lasted an hour before my blood sugars start to level out. I've never had to fight for my life before that, and it was pretty terrifying. But I totally have a new appreciation for food now, because it literally saved my life.\n\n I cried for a while, prayed. As far as what my first thoughts were after I injected myself was probably \"omygod, what have I done!\" And just ran out of my house. \n\nEdit: some words and punctuation\nEdit: thank you everyone for your gold support and love! I really appreciate all of your kind words. It may be a bit hard or embarrassing to talk about it, but if you ever need anything, or want to talk, please PM me.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y553m/"}
