Medication helped me focus a bit and I could attend some lectures but I wasn't feeling myself. My brain felt foggy, nothing interested me besides WoW and I had no idea what I should do. Thankfully after 7-8 years I developed anxiety which got to the point that I had to take several long breaks everyday just to get through the day.\n\nNow I know you don't want to exercise but you might change your mind like I did. I didn't run to cure my depression but to ease my anxiety. Luckily it helped me with both. I thought lifting weights was stupid and shallow so I didn't want to do it. Yet I changed my mind after maybe 6 months of starting to jog. Now I actually like it more than running.\n\nExercise probably will not feel comfortable before you become used to it. This might take a month or more. What helped me in the beginning was a friend that wanted to climb and he needed a partner to do it with. This gave me enough energy to experiment with other forms of exercises like jogging and biking. In hindsight this might have been the most important thing to help me to start liking exercising.\n\nThis post might not make you exercise but remind you that things can get better. A friend might help you like it helped me to start doing things I previously didn't like but gradually grew to love.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9e3o/"}
