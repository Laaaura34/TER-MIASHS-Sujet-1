But when I regained consciousness, I regretted not succeed. After that (it's been 4 or 5 years), I started planning another attempt, but then I got a boyfriend as the last chance to life. He was the only reason to keep alive for the 4 and half years we stayed together, not even my family was reason enough. Now the only reason I don't kill myself is that it would give too much trouble for the people that would find me. While I don't craft some crazy machine that would evaporate my body painlessly, I am treating with meds and cbt. I am trying, but the thought of keep living is exhausting. I don't watch news anymore, the only news source I use is the onion, I am trying to do lists to follow weekly, eating health, exercising, etc etc. But still, I resent the ex-bf. If I didn't date him, I would kill myself while I still didn't care about the others. I hope someday I will thank him for it. But for now, I can't stop thinking that being dead would be better ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y5vn4/"}
