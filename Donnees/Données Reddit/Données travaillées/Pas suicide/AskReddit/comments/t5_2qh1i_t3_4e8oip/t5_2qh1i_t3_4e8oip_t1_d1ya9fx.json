College can be stressful, especially when you've fallen behind (which many students do during depression). It's not that they don't want you at their school, it's that their school may not be a good environment for you, and the priority needs to be on getting well. \n\nI'll also add that most schools I've encountered go out of their way to accommodate students who are struggling with all sorts of problems, including mental health problems. At my school, a friend's was provided with therapy, project extensions and accommodations, and all sorts of help. It wasn't until she had skipped a week or two of classes (automatic fail in some cases) and missed several therapy appointments that they recommended she leave school for the rest of the semester and reenroll in a couple of months when she was doing better. \n\nShe was pissed about the whole situation, but it ended up being really good for her.
