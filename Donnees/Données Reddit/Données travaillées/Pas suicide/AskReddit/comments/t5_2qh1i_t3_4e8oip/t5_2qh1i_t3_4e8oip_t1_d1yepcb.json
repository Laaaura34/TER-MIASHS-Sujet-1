Every time I saw him he asked how I was feeling. I was just getting wise so he kept upping the dosage. Flash forward about two weeks to me lying in my kitchen floor with a box cutter next to me with 1/2 of my \"total volume\" running out when my wife and the 3yo came home. She wasn't supposed to be there. She had left to go shopping and shouldn't have been back for hours. After a brief hospital stay with competent doctors it turns out I'm bipolar type 1 with ice and anxiety disorder. Also, I was on twice the max dosage of the wrong drug that caused my psychotic break. I'm way better now due to the right people and a better understanding of the conditions I have to live in.
