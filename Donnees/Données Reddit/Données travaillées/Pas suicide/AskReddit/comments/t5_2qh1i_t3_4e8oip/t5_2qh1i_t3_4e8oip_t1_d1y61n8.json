Eventually, when I got my memory back, it was explained to me what happened, and I was reminded of why I did what I did. My first thought was, \"I can't believe I'm still here\". I was extremely disappointed. I attempted 2 more times in the following months but was much less close to being successful since I was under close watch. I wish it was easier...I wish I would just get cancer and die already", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y61n8/"}
