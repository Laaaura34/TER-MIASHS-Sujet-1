I was in a real dark place and drank myself to blackout every night for three months. Sometimes I would hope that in my drunken state, I would take my life. There was numerous times that I woke up to messages from friends saying they were worried about me because I was in a state of madness and was cursing allowed, yelling about how fucked up my head was and that I was going to kill myself.\n\nOne night I had enough. There was a few events that took place that day that pushed a bit further than before. From what I remember I had 5 jager bombs, and a pitcher of beer. I was with two coworkers playing pool and thankfully they looked after me, even though I was being selfish and making a scene. \n\nI woke up the next morning face down in a pile of vomit in my bed. My head felt like someone took a barbed wire bat to my head. I looked at my phone to see I was three hours late to work and had several missed calls and texts from coworkers.\n\nLong story short, I had a mental breakdown with my parents about my behavior and the twisted thoughts that plagued my mind. I was checked into the hospital and was placed in the mental ward for suicide watch and to monitor my alcohol level. I had my blood drawn every four hours and had my vitals tested every two hours.\n\nI have recently came to appreciate life. I still struggle with ptsd and depression, but with the help of marijuana I'm able to get some sleep without being plagued my nightmares.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y5kfq/"}
