There's nothing in us that forces us to wage war. \nWe just allow those in power to do whatever they want without consequences.\n\nIf we stop that, we could stop war. Still, I believe there's nothing wrong with having a military for self defence- especially when you also train the people who wish to be trained in it- like Switzerland but without mandatory military training. \n\nIf every country focused on self defence first, war would quickly end because when the civilians are armed and trained, a military occupation of an area becomes a hell of a lot more difficult. \n\nIf you say ''part of humanity'' nothing is ever going to change for the better, so please stop promoting this world view, as it comes of ignorance of any reality other than the one we choose to live in now- not any objective truth.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ycf02/"}
