I had more than half a bottle of vodka left in my stash. (750ml) I wanted to know if I could finish it. But I wanted to die. 14 shots (Between 1 and 1.5oz) of vodka in about 3-4 hours I dont quite remember. But i do remember passing out. I woke up an hour later and vomitted. After looking at different calculators i mightve been .3-.4 I shouldve died. But i didnt. To this day i dont know how i didnt die. Maybe I was pouring a little less than the shot glass? Who knows.\n\nIm 20yo male. 120lbs. wasnt drinking any water.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7103/"}
