He's a big strong guy and was not restrained (just kinda belted to the bed thing) and just lost it/panicked and started to pull everything out try to get himself out of there. Pretty dangerous for everyone involved and not really great with two fractured vertebras, broken ribs and whatever else he had. They had to stop the ambulance and the driver had to come and help hold him down. \n\n\nHe now has a pretty bad needle phobia that he didn't have before, he's had stitches and done root-fillings without anaesthesia because he can't take shots. \n\n\nMaybe if he had been restrained they could have just given him something to calm him down immediately and everything would have been a little less dramatic.
