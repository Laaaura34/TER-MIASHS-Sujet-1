I detoxed from multiple substances during my time there, so it was almost a blessing to be kept so long.  \n  \nAs for the experience itself.. it was interesting. It was the lowest income psychiatric ward in my city, so there was a LOT of diversity. My unit was known as the \"detox unit\" where they sent people to detox from drugs/alcohol if those people also had a mental disorder.  \n  \nThen there were just the ones who attempted suicide, but weren't drug addicts. I actually made a few friends there and still contact them on Facebook years later. I saw lots of outbursts, people attacking staff, and one of the girls in my room had a strange sexual obsession with me and I had to switch rooms. Even then, she followed me to my next room and tried to move in there permanently. She had been there for months, not sure why but I'm pretty sure she was paranoid schizophrenic.  \n  \nOverall it wasn't terrible. I had a few panic attacks mainly because I was trapped there and it would hit me all of a sudden and I'd just lose my shit. It was definitely entertaining and it also helped me a lot. Got my meds sorted out finally and got off drugs. (Not for good that time, but hey)  \n  \nI have 15 months clean and sober now, thank god. I was in a dark dark place back then. Also sorry for the novel.\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1zk5jo/"}
