Parents, generally speaking, hit their children with the purpose of disciplining them.  This is not necessarily an abusive behavior.  Hitting or spanking your child is not the same as beating your child up or causing them physical damage.  It is a parent's responsibility to discipline his or her child but it is not a husband's responsibility to discipline his wife.  At least not in Western society.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1z10k7/"}
