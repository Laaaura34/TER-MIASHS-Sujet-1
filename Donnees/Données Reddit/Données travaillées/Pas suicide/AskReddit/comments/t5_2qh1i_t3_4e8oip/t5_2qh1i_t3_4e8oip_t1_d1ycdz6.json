I remember feeling really angry at myself, and disappointed, and like all that effort hadn't been worth it. I was also really concerned about my relationship with my mom, and whether it would ever be repaired.\n\nHappy to say, ten years on, that my relationship with my mom is excellent. I can't say, however, that I don't wish I had succeeded. Even though my life is better than it was, my brain has lingered in a \"thoughts but no plan\" state this whole time. A therapist once called me a suicide opportunist, and it felt like the most real characterization of my mental state I'd ever heard. Her feeling was that my \"no plan\" was really that I would eventually seize an opportunity (bridge, etc), very spontaneously and with literally no warning. \n\nI don't know. Things are better and I am the same. Thank you everyone, for sharing your stories. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ycdz6/"}
