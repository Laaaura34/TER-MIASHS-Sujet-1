But during my conscious moments I journaled to myself - the thoughts were coherent and complete, but the words were broken, with words starting late or ending early, as if I lost consciousness mid-sentence.\n\nIn those scribbles, my first thoughts were wondering what happened and how I'd survived.  The next thoughts were of terrible, paralyzing fear.\n\nI attempted for a very specific reason - based on the information I had at the time, terrible events in my future were a certainty, and I made a rational decision that dying would be more merciful than living through them.  Thankfully, my information was wrong, and I survived to learn as such.\n\nTo this day, however, none of us know how I survived.
