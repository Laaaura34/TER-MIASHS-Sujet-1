I tend to believe that if they worked, there wouldn't be any more, because the formula had already been found.\n\nPart of that is a rejection to what I saw as my wife's coping mechanisms (she went through a period where she read literally hundreds of these books, and many had conflicting ideas). I'm reading this one specifically because it was recommended by my counselor who specializes in this sort of stuff.\n\nDon't read the first paragraph as me taking away anything from your desire to learn or to better yourself or others. I simply state that as a way to show that I do have walls that I have built against certain things, and even considering the book you recommended, or the one my counselor recommended, are difficult things for me.  But, I now understand why that is difficult, and that's part of the process of improvement.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ylzjb/"}
