In fact, when you are first taken in, it is odd because you still sit in this little intake consultation thing where they get all your info. Think of the first time you visit a doctor's office, except there is a person watching you the whole time to make sure you don't get violent or anything. At first it feels kind of like, \"Are you fucking serious right now??\" but then the normalcy of the discussion actually started to really calm me down. Especially after the whole police thing. They are super nice to you once the situation is verified, but when they first arrive on scene, they don't know if you have a weapon or ulterior motives, so they come screaming at you with their hands at their hips and put you in cuffs while they secure the area. It may all sound intense, but it was the best decision I ever made. It gave me local connections to a facility that would take me even though I didn't have any insurance, introduced me to tons of people going through similar and often worse situations which helped with that feeling that nobody could understand, it got me the medication I needed, and it forced my mother and I to have a loooong needed talk that ultimately began repairing our relationship.
