Your wife is being a massive bitch. It's one thing to want to see everyone as human, with flaws as well as strengths, but quite another to insist that everyone is equally flawed before bringing issues to the table. Your wife is emotionally abusing you by treating you this way. You're walking on eggshells, your opinion of yourself has changed, you're not allowed to speak openly about problems within the relationship and if you try you become the scapegoat. I would be very concerned about how she interacts with your daughter, I imagine it is much the same. I mean, doesn't the fact that you're reticent to share with her that you've gone back to counseling say something to you?", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ym4xi/"}
