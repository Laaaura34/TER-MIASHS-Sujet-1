Not sure if the video is on his site, but we play it for the Youth Mental Health First Aid training. In his story, he jumps off the Golden Gate Bridge:\n\nFrom memory....\n\n\"Immediately after my hands and feet had left the ledge, the voice in my head [persecutor/paranoid hallucination due to bi-polar disorder] was gone!\"\n\nHe immediately regretted his decision, and wished he hadn't jumped. Pretty powerful clip if it's on there.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yj5co/"}
