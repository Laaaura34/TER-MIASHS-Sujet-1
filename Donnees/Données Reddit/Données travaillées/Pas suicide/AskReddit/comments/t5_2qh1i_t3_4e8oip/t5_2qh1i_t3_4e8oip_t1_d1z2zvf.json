It was a very dark time in my life and I had recently reached out to a woman that I loved and she talked to me and, to make a long story short she came to my home and left as promptly as she showed which really put me in a bad state of mind. I attempted to use a S&W .40 M&P edition. If anyone here knows about this weapon is that it's safety is on the trigger and not one that has to be actively be engaged or disengaged. When I tried to pull the trigger, my finger was too high in the trigger well and the gun did not go off, thank god. I dropped it and laid in my bed and thought about how that moment would have effected everyone that I knew and loved me and I just could not do that to them, so I sold my gun. \n\nNow, I'm happily married(to that woman, yes) and have two wonderful dogs that I care the world for and have a great support system here in my home. It's still hard to talk about my depression and it still sticks with me, but I fight it tooth and nail every day. I'm glad I survived and I'm more than happy to tell others out there dealing with the same pain that I had... that it's OK. You are a wonderful person and there are things meant for you out there. Don't let those thoughts slip into your mind and change your patterns. Don't let your depression control you; I did and I am ashamed I ever let it happen. Read this and learn from it, know that taking your life is not the answer. \n\nIf any of you read this and need help, message me here. I might not respond right away but I will talk to you if you feel you have nowhere else to go.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1z2zvf/"}
