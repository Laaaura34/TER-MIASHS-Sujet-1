It's a pretty nonsensical series of books, but there's one part where one of the characters is about to be subjected to the worst torture in the universe -- a machine that shows you how insignificant you are to the universe. It shows you how little you matter to the trillions of life forms even if you were the galactic president. However, his friends save him by making sure he gets tortured in an alternate universe, created just for him to avoid going insane. So he's the most important person in that universe and he leaves the experience with an inflated ego. While you might not have the ability to switch realities, you can change your perspective. We all might be insignificant in a cosmic sense, but if you have a more modest goal -- like personal happiness, then you can be massively important both for yourself and your friends.
