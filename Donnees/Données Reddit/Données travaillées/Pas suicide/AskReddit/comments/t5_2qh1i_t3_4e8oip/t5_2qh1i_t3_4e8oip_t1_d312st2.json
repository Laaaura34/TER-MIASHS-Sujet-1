Going through four suicides my senior year of high school. I have lost 6 people to suicide. October 31st 2015, i was supposed to go camping with some friends, I wasn't going to go to the party. I had this gut wrenching feeling something bad was going to happen. But al my friends ditched me and I went to that party. I find happiness when I drink and i needed some that night. I told myself I'm just gonna drink as much as possible because i don't care what can happen. I woke up in the hospital, the medics said they thought i was dead arriving on the scene. I still sometimes wish to this day that i would've just died. Its always in the back of my mind on a daily basis. I try my best to stay afloat. My car an 88 gl10 subaru sedan is really the only thing that has been keeping me alive. Im a subaru ambassador so I got that gong for me. It still sucks though never knowing exactly when this depression shit is gonna just quit. It'd be cool to just have someone that knows exactly what it feels like to lose your aunt or friend to suicide all within a couple months apart. Its been two years since my aunts suicide and I have yet to bring myself to go visit her at her grave. I want to so bad but I just can't. Ive been telling myself that Im alright but truly I'm still broken.... ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d312st2/"}
