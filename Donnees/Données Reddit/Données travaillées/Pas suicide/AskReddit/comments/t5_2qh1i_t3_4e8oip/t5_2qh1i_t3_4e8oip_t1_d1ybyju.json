Do I try again?\" \n\nI had hung myself with a belt, I was pretty young at the time, probably around 12 or 11. It was mainly due to bullying, lots of kids told me \"kill yourself\" on a daily basis. So that and just the added stress of my the constant fights with my parents pushed me to a breaking point. \n\nSo yeah I hung myself with a belt and when I did I blacked out and woke up to find the belt loop slipped. \n\nI sat there for what felt like hours, when in reality it was probably just 30 minutes. Then decided not to try again at the time I was still somewhat religious and considered it a \"sign from God\" to not try again, or some kind of second chance. \n\nMy parents didn't know for years, unlike most people I wish they had found me. Part of the reason I was pushed to a breaking point was constant fights with my parents. Which would end with me locking myself in a room and repeatedly punching myself in the face while crying to \"punish myself for being a bad son\". I had hoped if they found me they would ease off of me and get me help. My looking back I'm pretty sure suicide attempt was a cry for help. \n\nI had actually told my parents around 4  years later about my suicide attempt, in an attempt to get some therapy to move past the issues that pushed me to that point. The response I got was \" You didn't attempt to commit suicide! You're lying. At the most you just THOUGHT about it\". I love my parents but sometimes they can be really cold.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ybyju/"}
