Part of me feels like I could be free to eat the end of a shotgun if I didn't have to be concerned about the suffering it'd cause my mum/dad/brother. It's been like this for so long that the most I can do is wait for my parents to die.\n\nDoing that to my mum especially would permanently destroy her. While it's a fucked up thing to do to my brother, I simply can't continue to exist for 40 odd years just to spare him that pain. It's asking too much, and honestly I think he would/will/does understand. \n\nThanks for the kind words though.
