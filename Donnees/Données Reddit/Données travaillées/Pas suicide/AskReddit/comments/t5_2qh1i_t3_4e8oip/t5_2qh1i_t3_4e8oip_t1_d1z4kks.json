She always told me that she couldn't handle being on this world without me but it looks like that isn't the case anymore. I really don't talk to anyone else but her and now that she's gone i'm just a mess.\n\nHowever, life moves on and there isn't much I can do if she doesn't want to be a part of my life anymore.
