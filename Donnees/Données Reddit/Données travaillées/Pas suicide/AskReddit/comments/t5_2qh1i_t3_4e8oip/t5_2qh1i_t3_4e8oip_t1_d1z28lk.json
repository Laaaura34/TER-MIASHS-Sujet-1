It took a long time to take effect, and I had thought maybe my attempt didn't work. But I definitely did start to feel it, and it scared the shit out of me.\n I was rushed to the hospital, but it seemed everything was literally moving so slow, and echoing as if I were in a tunnel. The last thing I remember at that point was the ER staff giving me oxygen. After that I pretty much had no memory of anything that had happened after for a solid month.\nI haven't made another attempt since. I guess what I had realized was, my life literally passing before my eyes was so much worse than what I felt was the \"need\" to take it for.\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1z28lk/"}
