And thanks for asking-- part of my healing process was to seek out other people who were struggling and try to talk it out with them. I mod /r/anger and /r/TheChurchOfRogers because of the lessons I learned the hard way, and because it helped me to look in the warped mirror and see myself at so many different points in my struggle and to see folks who were decent and having a hard time more often than not. I can't speak for everyone, but I know that it wasn't always easy to look in that mirror, and that it sometimes left me feeling worse off than when I started. I liked it when I saw someone I could relate to who had just screwed up and who let me think, \"we all make mistakes and I'm one of them.\" It was disheartening when people seemed irredeemable while I talked to them, and I wondered if I was the same way as them. \n\nBut I'm much, much better than I was thanks to making positive changes in my life and accepting my wrongdoings and moving past them. \n\nHow are you doing?
