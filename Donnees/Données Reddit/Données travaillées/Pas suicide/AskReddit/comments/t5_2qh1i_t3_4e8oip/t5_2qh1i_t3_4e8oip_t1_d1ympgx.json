It's an anesthetic, and the expense is probably the cost of buying it black market. I could be wrong, and that person may be in another country, but I don't think ketamine has FDA approved uses for people.\n\nAfter some quick research, it is not FDA approved, but is being used by some doctors \"off label\" which means full cost. This info was current about 6 months ago. Make sure that you let your doc know that you are aware of the off label research so they don't think you're trying to get high on a party drug.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ympgx/"}
