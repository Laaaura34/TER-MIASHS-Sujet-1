I was a miserable, angry preteen. I was finished. \n\nThen I thought of how freaking much I loved my 4 year old niece. I couldn't stand the thought of not being around to watch her grow up. \n\nShe's 20 now, in college studying to become a nurse, and we are still close. I have another niece and a nephew. I'm married with twin toddlers of my own. \n\nLife finds a way. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yip3z/"}
