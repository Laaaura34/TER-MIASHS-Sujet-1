I took a bunch of pills and of course, threw them back up. I called my friend and he drove to my house and took me to the hospital. They kept insisting my father needed to know, despite the fact that he was a huge part of the reason I attempted in the first place. They notified him, things got worse. All I could think was \"I'll have to try again.\"\n\nWhen I was seventeen I was pretty fucked up, I was addicted to pills and afraid of living. My boyfriend had overdosed and died when I was 16, and it fucked me up bad. I was still living with my shitass father, and he was mostly clueless as to how unwell I was. I tried to overdose again. I failed again. Called the same friend, and despite the fact that I hadn't talked to him in about a year he took me to the hospital. This time they didn't notify my father. \nMy friend cried. I cried. I think my exact words were \"enough is enough, I just have to get the fuck out.\"\n\nI moved out a month after I graduated high school, and two years later I'm doing a lot better. I'm clean, I've got good friends I think, and I almost never even think about my father. \nJust because someone is your parent doesn't mean they're not horribly toxic. You don't owe them shit. Do what you have to do-it's not being selfish, it's fucking survival. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yd7la/"}
