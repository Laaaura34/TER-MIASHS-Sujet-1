I had taken quite a bit of trazodone, but not as drastically as most pill stories I read. Every few minutes, if I was still conscious, I took another one. I don't even think my intention was to die, I just didn't want to be conscious anymore. \n\nI was dealing with heart issues around the same time, and already had a few recent ER visits for that. This visit just blended in with the others. I don't know what it was that tipped my mom off to call an ambulance, but afaik to this day she doesn't know that that time was different.\n\nAnyway, to actually answer the question, my first thoughts were mundane. *Well, I'm not dead, so I guess I'm not supposed to be.* Later I felt awful, specifically towards a friend of mine who had done something similar. I had copycatted and only realized it in hindsight.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1z7tge/"}
