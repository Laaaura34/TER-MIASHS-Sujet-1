I'm too tired right now to come up with anything profound to say, but I want to tell you that I was hospitalized for depression and anxiety a few years ago, and I still feel ashamed of it a lot, even though I am doing much, much better. I totally think that going through the ringer like that made me recognize and appreciate and empathize with other people's pain. And that has made me a better person. Your words helped me recognize that in myself, so thank you. Thank you so much! ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y5fdi/"}
