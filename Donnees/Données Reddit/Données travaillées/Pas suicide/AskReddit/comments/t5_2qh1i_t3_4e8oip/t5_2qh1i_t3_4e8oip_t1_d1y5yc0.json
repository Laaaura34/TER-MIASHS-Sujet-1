I think it's hard for people to understand because everyone's always focused on a \"cure\" or how to fix things. People ask you to tell them what's going on and then when you do, instead of just listening and empathizing, they're already analyzing and calculating and concocting a plan of attack for how to fix you. Most mean well but it's exhausting and always makes you feel shittier than before because you can't live up to their plans and expectations for you. It takes time and personal growth to heal. I wish more people knew how to support those who are struggling and try to understand their point of view without putting so much pressure on them.
