I picked out the place and method but I finally had the courage to speak up to a few people close to me. They really came through and I honestly didn't expect the response I got from them.\n\nThey supported me as I finally told my doctor and scheduled to meet with a psychiatrist. Now I'm on a regular dose of anti-depressants and I'm cleared from the shrink. \n\nI would say my depression is completely at bay with my medicine and friends to help.\n\nPlease don't overlook the power of your loved ones. Go spend some time with your grandparents so you both can enjoy each other!\n\nI hope things get brighter for you ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y63mb/"}
