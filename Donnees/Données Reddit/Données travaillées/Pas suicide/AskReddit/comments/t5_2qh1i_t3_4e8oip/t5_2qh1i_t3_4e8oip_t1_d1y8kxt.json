I think I said something like \"why the hell are YOU here?\" After the overdose wore off and I was in the psych unit, I flipped shit at a nurse and slammed my door. She told me something about who knows what but I was still not all there and thought she was lying to me. I was livid that I was still alive. Apologized to her a few days later when I came around. I was mostly really angry I had failed at killing myself and completely out of it from overdosing and monoxide poisoning. Here I am, four years later, I still wish I had died but I don't think about killing myself very often anymore. My life is extremely boring, unfulfilling, and I'm pretty resigned from it. I'm just waiting now. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8kxt/"}
