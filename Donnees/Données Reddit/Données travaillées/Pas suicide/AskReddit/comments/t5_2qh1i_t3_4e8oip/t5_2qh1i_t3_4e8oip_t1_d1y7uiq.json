Was super depressed about the loss of my grandmother and loss of my big brother.  One in 2009, that latter 2012.Took a BUNCH of Xanax.  Didn't feel life was worth living.  Lost girlfriend, lost job, Mother was recently put in nursing home.  Never had a Father.  Got shot faced drunk.  Took the pills.  Started watching YouTube videos.  Black out.  Remember laying on the couch, fading in and out.  Remember calling my mother, \"I fucked up, send an ambulance to my apartment.\"  flashes of a cop in my house.  Flashes of be in the back of an ambulance.  Flashes of being at the hospital with friends around.  Come too as I'm being taking from the hospital to the psych ward at the hospital a couple towns over.  Spend a week there talking to psychs.  Get a prescription for anti-depressants.  Move into a homeless shelter/halfway house because I have no where else to live.Get off meds because I don't feel like they have any effect.  Live with friends on and off.  In and out of jail on and off.  That's where I'm at now.\n\nEdit:  am currently drunk.  Recognize my problem with alcohol is the root of all my problems.  Can't stop though.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7uiq/"}
