It would be nice if it worked like that.\n\nSometimes you have to look at depression like this; You are standing down looking at someone who is standing in deep hole. From where you are standing it seems easy to just climb out of the hole. From the perspective of the person standing in the hole, every time they try to climb out the walls give way and they just can't make it. Meanwhile the person above says, \"Come on it's so easy!\" and they can't understand why the person in the hole doesn't climb out. The person in the hole gets mad because, damn it all it's just not that simple.\n\nThe person standing above says, \"Take my hand let me help you.\" and while their outstretched hand is reachable, the person in the hole sees it as too far away and too much effort. They are tired from trying to get out of the hole and just want to lay down in the bottom of it and give in.\n\nThere are things that can help and things that a sufferer can do to help themselves, but there are moments when even the best help just isn't enough.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y5cuo/"}
