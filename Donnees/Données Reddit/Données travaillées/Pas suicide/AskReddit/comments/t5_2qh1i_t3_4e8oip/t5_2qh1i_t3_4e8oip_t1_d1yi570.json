Banning/confiscating all guns would obviously prevent gun suicides, but that's not the right answer.  And I am entitled to say that, since this has touched my life in a very close and personal way.  \n\nSuicide can be the final step in a lifetime of self-destructive decisions and behaviors.  Dealing with the underlying mental illness deals with all the shit in a person's life that leads up to the suicide.  Take away the gun, prevent the suicide, but this does nothing for the burning wreckage the person has made of their life.  Help the *person* get right. \n\nI hate it when people try to politicize this stuff.  It sends me into a blinding, seething rage when I see people on social media mocking people who are victims of gun accidents, trying to push some political agenda.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yi570/"}
