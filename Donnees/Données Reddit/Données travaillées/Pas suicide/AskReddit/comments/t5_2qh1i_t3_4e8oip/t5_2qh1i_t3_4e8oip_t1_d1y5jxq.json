Currently the thought of thinking differently about the world seems as rational as trying to convince myself that moon is made of brie. Not sure how I would go about changing that other than to try things I've already tried. \n\nRegarding your ninja edit - I think that therapy, mindfulness and things like that can indeed affect mental wellbeing to a large degree but I don't thinks it's reasonable to dismiss the chemical aspect. The brain *can* get a massive chemical fuck up and often medication is the only fix. Things like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder won't be helped by talking it out.
