I don't know your religious affiliation and I apologize if I'm coming off as pushy, but God's plans are totally beyond our understanding, not even his angels know it.

For what it's worth, I'm praying for you. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y5mir/"}
