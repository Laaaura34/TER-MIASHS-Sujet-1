I consider myself a humanist of sorts, which might show in my comments right now. Even though it is indeed within yourself, there is absolutely no shame in asking for help from others, and sometimes nearly necessary. I made the grave mistake of isolating and fighting everybody who tried to help me. Whatever you do, please accept help. Even if you can't seek it out, I'm certain you have somebody who cares. Let them come to you and accept it as best as you can.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yg4xw/"}
