Not because I lived, but because I saw my attempt out to the end and accepted death. I think my first actual thought was \"Am I dead?\" which is a question that I wasn't able to answer for awhile. I felt so disconnected from the world that I felt there was a chance I was dead and it was just a lucid dream. I've used the experience positively though. I don't fear for my life in any situation and I'll give up everything I own to help out anybody else who's suffering because I already gave up my life, my suffering doesn't matter anymore. I'll always draw the short straw if the option is presented.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y4tih/"}
