It's a long complicated story, but he did end up in the state pen several years later for a different offense. He died pretty soon after getting out. \n\nI was \"welcomed back into the family\" after he was arrested (I'd been declared persona-non-grata after cutting him off from contact with my children). I still feel like I should have walked in the house, told everyone \"I fucking told you so,\" and walked out (like I said, I still struggle with anger about the whole thing). But, meh, that was a while ago. My sibling (whose child was the victim in the case that ended up with my dad going to jail) has to live with the knowledge that the warning signs were there, and they'd been warned explicitly. Nothing I say can add to that.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ygpyv/"}
