I've suffered from it for 4 months, lost my part-time job, stacked on bills, and my education path to post-secondary was destroyed. Everything was a huge mess. The way I tried to end my life was by smoking tons of pot in one session. I know it wasn't gonna leave me overdose but I know it affects the brain so I thought it could end it all. \n\nNo one knew about it except my bestfriend until 2 months ago when I came home crying drunk, sobbed infront of my mom and dad.
