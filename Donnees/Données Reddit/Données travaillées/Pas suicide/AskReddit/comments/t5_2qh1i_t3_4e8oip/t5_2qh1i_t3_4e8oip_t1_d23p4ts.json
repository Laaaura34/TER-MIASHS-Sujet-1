And that's also really good to hear you've gotten closer to most of your family as a result. It's hard to have the motivation to do something just for yourself.\n\nI don't know why, especially with something like diabetes, too. I had a hard time bringing my A1C down after that string of hospitalizations and my rationale for getting it down to 7.5 after several years was \"I don't want to be fucked up for my fiance at the time\" or \"I don't want my mom to be there if I do fuck up\" or just having to rely on her.\n\nIt's a long struggle and to be honest, I'm still fighting that good fight there with you. It's hard to find motivation for myself in my day to day life, but someday I'm sure we'll get there, I like to think. Your family and friends will cheer you on too, and that's probably one of the more beautiful things about having a support network. I look at my older sister the way you look to your younger sister and it's nice... having that buttress should we ever need it.\n\nAnyway, I'm rambling lol. I get kinda wordy and this sort of pseudo-philosophical tone to my writing so if it sounds like I'm trying to be a sage, I'm probably just in need of sleep haha. Keep fighting the good fight because we'll make it to our finish line one day and I like celebrating with teammates.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d23p4ts/"}
