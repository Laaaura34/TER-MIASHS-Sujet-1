It's probably one of the most heart wrenching experiences of my life and stays with me still. It's been 18 months, and he's alive, working part-time as he still recovers from the after effects. There are certain visceral moments as a parent - that is one of my top ones. And I worry, still, because he doesn't talk about it anymore - will he be ok?", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1zcr3m/"}
