But my point is that suicide isn't always a mental illness. And to be so judgemental about it doesn't sit well with me. I've never romanticized it, or claimed it to be noble. I merely believe it's a choice we all have, one that shouldn't be taken away.\n\nWhen you, or others, call it a mental illness, you take away that choice from those around you. I think we should all be allowed to choose life, and to choose death, as we see fit, without strangers judging us.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yh7xt/"}
