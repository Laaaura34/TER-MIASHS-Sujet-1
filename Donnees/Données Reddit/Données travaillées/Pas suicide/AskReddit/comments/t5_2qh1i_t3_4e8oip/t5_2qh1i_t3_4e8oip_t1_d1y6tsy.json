Everyone.  You, me, any member of society, anyone.  Physical dependency happens fairly quickly but it can be managed, and the earlier you get off the medication, the easier it will be.  \n\nA person in chronic pain who takes opiates regularly will obviously be addicted.  It's not the physical dependence that is really the bad part.  The bad part is the mental side, where some people can develop cravings which will increase the likelihood of them abusing the drugs or taking more than needed.  As you take more and more of the drug, your tolerance goes up, meaning you need more of it to get the same effect.\n\nThe problem, then, isn't that they are technically addicted ( as long as it is only physical addiction, not abuse), but that they will need a growing supply of the medication as time goes on.  Eventually, you'll reach an upper limit because your body will need so much of it just to get the same effect and relieve pain.
