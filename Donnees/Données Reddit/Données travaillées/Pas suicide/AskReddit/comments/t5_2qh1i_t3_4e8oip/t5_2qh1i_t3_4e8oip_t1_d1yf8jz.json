So I just wait for death instead, like everyone else- but it also gives me anxiety, knowing it's coming. I drowned once, at 17, too- I know what death is like, I can wait. I also know, you can't ask forgiveness for a murder you committed on yourself. There is a purgatory for suicides. Just don't do it. Time is an illusion. Everything shall pass, even you, when you're supposed to. Plus, afterward, I had my stomach pumped at the hospital, and when I got home, the beating of my life from my mom for putting her through that. I then moved out at 15, and to be completely honest, I did try a couple more times after the first time- but after drowning/dying at 17, briefly, it gave me a new outlook on everything.
