I was such a failure at life that I couldn't even die correctly. After I left my note where it would have been found, I was weighed down with regret and embarrassment. I had to face everyone after the stunt I pulled. Once I was allowed to have visitors, my parents were the first to see me. I couldn't even say a word before they both had their arms around me, crying. Every negative emotion I had at that moment washed away. I felt the sincerity in the way they held me. I felt loved. I still battle my depression. It's even gotten crippling as of recently. But as long as at least one person loves me the way my parents do, I know I'm not completely alone.
