It wasn't a suicide, but he hadn't been doing very well throughout the week leading to his death. On the day he passed I tired calling him a couple times to see how he was doing but he never picked up. I kinda brushed it off, thinking that he was sleeping or resting. Went to check on him and I found him dead. It's been three years and I've gotten better, but if I don't hear from my brother for a few days or if my girlfriend runs an errand and I don't hear from her after a while I get panicky.
