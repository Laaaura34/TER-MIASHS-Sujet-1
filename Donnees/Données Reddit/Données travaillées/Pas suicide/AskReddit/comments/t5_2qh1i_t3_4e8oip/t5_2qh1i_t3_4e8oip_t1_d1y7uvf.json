Over the period of roughly three months I had been prescribed four different medications for back pain, and after enough mornings in pain and misery and watching as the marriage I had just gotten into crumble around me, I decided to end it. Two of the prescriptions I was allergic to, and all told I had somewhere near eighty pills to swallow, so I set out to end it in a numb mess.\n\nI went down to a vending machine, slapped in enough money to get about eight Monsters, and just sat around the corner of the building trading back and forth between chugging Monster and throwing back pills. Once both were polished off, I walked over to a trash can, disposed of the empty bottles and cans, and went to light up a cigarette. All told it was maybe two minutes that it took me to slam the medication down, so I figured one last smoke was reasonable. A friend saw me, asked if I was alright, and I just looked at him and smiled. \"I'm fantastic, I just committed suicide.\" I finished the cigarette, snuffed it out, stood up, and blacked out on my way to the floor.\n\nSince then things have gotten better. It took a lot more trauma, a touch of booze, and a lot of nights spent crying over my past opportunities , but in time I came to realize that it was possible to be fine again. I'm sad it took so long to be okay, but I suppose that is the essence of the thing.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7uvf/"}
