Once you get out of it the positivity stays with you.\n\nThis is so true for me. It took years for me to realize the issue was anxiety Even just putting a name on it was a huge step forward. For 15 years or so, I feel like there was this looming cloud. Would today be the day that I would finally give up, you know? Then, I got a handle on my anxiety and one day I woke up and that cloud was gone. It's not like life is perfect, but I can breathe easier knowing that i won't have to consider that decision every day for the rest of my life.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y95h5/"}
