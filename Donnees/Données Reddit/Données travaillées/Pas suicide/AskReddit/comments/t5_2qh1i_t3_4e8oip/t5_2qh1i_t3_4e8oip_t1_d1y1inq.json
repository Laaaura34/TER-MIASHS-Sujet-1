At first my mind jumped to: where am I, what is this, what's going on, why can't i move?\n\nThen eventually things become less hazy and you put it together that you're in a hospital hooked up to some machines, and nurses going back and forth periodically checking your vitals. Then you start going over in your head, trying to relive what happened in the hours before and how you got here.\n\nDid i fall down? Did i get in an accident?\n\nEventually you remember getting home belligerently drunk and running into the bathroom and...that bottle of pills...did i down it? what was it? am i fucked?\n\nAnd this all took place over a course of several hours, maybe half a day, but you keep coming in an out of consciousness and rare moment of lucidity.\n\nEventually you ask where you are, they tell you you're at this hospital. you might have a phone nearby, you try to let somebody know because you don't know where anybody is. you're just alone, and afraid, and every moment running scenarios on what the worst case scenario is and for the doctor to wear that grim look.\n\neventually you see your family. that look in your eyes after your parents drove 8 hrs in the middle of the night after getting the call from your roommate....shit.\n\nedit: funny this question comes up. anniversary of that night is april 26th, a few weeks from today. I celebrate that year the same every year, getting as drunk as i can. expect the same out of it this year", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y1inq/"}
