But I'm putting it here in case anyone is browsing this thread with morbid curiosity like I did when I was looking for inspiration for the best ways to kill myself.\n\nIt is a hell of a road but it gets better. Don't give up and kill yourself, not yet. Give yourself a few months and promise yourself that you will at least try until then. I gave myself six months after I decided antidepressants as a last resort (had avoided them because of stigma) and it truly saved my life. It's not the same for everyone but I will never forget the first time I felt happiness again. I had locked myself in my room for so long and had found pleasure in nothing. Nothing big or small could sway how horrible I felt and how much of a chore it was just to go through the motions.\n\nThen after a few months (yes months) on antidepressants, I was driving down the road and I thought to myself, \"What a nice day. It's really pretty outside.\" Then it hit me like a ton of bricks that it was the first time I had a single positive thought in so long that I finally broke down and cried the good tears. It felt so good to have something feel good. I got out of my car and sat in the sun and literally soaked up every little bit of that good feeling I could.\n\nPlease don't give up, guys. It sucks and it's hard but I promise when your moment in the sun comes after months of darkness that it won't erase the pain but there will be a little enjoyment of life again, and it will be good.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yepyd/"}
