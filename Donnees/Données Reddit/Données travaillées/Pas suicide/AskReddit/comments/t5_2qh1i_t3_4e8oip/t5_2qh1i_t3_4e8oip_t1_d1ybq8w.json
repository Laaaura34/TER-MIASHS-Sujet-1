It's been 6 years and nothing has gotten better, but what are the chances if I live another 30, another 70? I mean, I don't want to waste my youth but I'd rather give it a chance. If I'm happy for a moment it's better than what would have been for an instant.\n\nI don't believe in an afterlife, so this life is all I have for myself. I'd rather try and fail, instead of not trying at all. If someone was holding a gun to your head and offered to step back 30 feet and let you try and dodge, would you take it, or let them shoot you point blank? That's me.\n\nMy method was starvation. Let me tell you, that shit hurts, and it's slow, and it felt like I deserved it.\n\nI think my stomach is still fucked up from that.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ybq8w/"}
