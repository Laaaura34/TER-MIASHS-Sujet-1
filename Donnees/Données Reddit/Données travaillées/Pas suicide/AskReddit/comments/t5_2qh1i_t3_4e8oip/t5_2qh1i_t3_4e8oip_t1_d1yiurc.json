I actually asked someone to kill me. There was no where for me to hang myself and i know if i tried asphyxiation, i could relax when i passed out and survive. So he actually agreed to it. He tried killing me with an electrical cord (long story about the agreement) and i just remember waking up, he was still there, and it took forever to come to. When he realized i was still breathing i heard him calling my name and i just started crying, mixed emotions of relief, sadness, failure, just a lot of mixed emotions, every time i tried (pills, gun to my temple, femoral artery). I popped three discs, nearly crushed my windpipe, and had terrible welts. My fucking boss just thought i was kinky.\n\nI finally got locked up in the psych ward after getting 20 stitches on an attempt on my femoral artery. I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I'm on auxiliary medication and go through intense therapy. Suicidal ideations will always be there,  BPD kills 1 in 10 sufferers, but I'm doing a lot better.
