It was in 2012, the middle of my self-hanging (I started choking and gasping for air) and I remember a part of me said to myself \"You're better than this, you bitch.\" So I desperately grasped onto the belt I was dangling from and managed to unbuckle it before crashing into a heaving mess on the floor. \nI tried multiple times few months later before fully believing I was worth it in this world. The belt, I hang it up as a reminder of those dark times and make myself remember where I am now and how far I've come; a high achieving student at Uni with a stable casual job.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8lc8/"}
