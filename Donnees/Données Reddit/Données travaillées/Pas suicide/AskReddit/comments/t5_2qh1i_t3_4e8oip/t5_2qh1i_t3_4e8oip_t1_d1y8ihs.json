I lost about a week of my life. I somehow moved down the road to my friend's house and fell asleep in my friend's bed, and he checked every few hours to make sure I was still breathing. I think I just slept for most of that week, I just completely shut down. It's just a big huge black space in my life. My friends called an anonymous couple or something and two people came down to talk to me, and they talked me into checking myself into the hospital.\n\nBest decision of my life.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8ihs/"}
