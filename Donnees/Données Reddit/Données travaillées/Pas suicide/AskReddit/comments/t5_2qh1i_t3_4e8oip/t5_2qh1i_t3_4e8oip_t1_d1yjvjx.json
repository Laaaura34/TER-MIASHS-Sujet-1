When I wake up in the morning and can't think of a single reason why I should move, or when every little thing becomes an obligation. When you're not paralyzed by any strong emotion, but by lack of emotion...the fucking ennui of it all. But you half ass it anyway, because what if your roommate knew? What about your family? When you don't care about your life at all, but you're afraid of being a burden on the people that love you, so you trudge along anyway. You might not feel love for them the same way you remember feeling as a kid, but you try to make them not have to worry about you because that just becomes one more reason why your life is a burden on the world.\n\nDepression sucks. Don't know if this is how it feels to most people, but I feel like I've been here for years. Maybe I'm just lazy.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yjvjx/"}
