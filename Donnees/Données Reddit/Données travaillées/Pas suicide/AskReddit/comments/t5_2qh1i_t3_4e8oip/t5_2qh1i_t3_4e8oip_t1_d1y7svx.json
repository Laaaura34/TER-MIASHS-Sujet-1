She loved gore and violence and just death in genera, I found this quite interesting and talked to her for a good hour or so and she would literally tell me anything, it was an eye opening experience. \n\nI like people like you, your very honest and genuine and it makes it easier to talk to you because I don't have to dance around certain subjects as much and I get answers to questions I've always wondered, so thanks I guess", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7svx/"}
