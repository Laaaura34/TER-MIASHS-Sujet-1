She was my first. I went to the local supermarket and got strong sleeping pills. I don't know if they can actually kill you, but I took about twenty and thought that would definitely do the trick. Woke up dehydrated as fuck, and very disoriented. I do not know how much time had passed. I was still living in the house with the ex and her boyfriend (My best friend at the time) and I stumbled to get water. The only thing going through my mind was how pissed I was that it didn't work. I went on that way for three years with severe depression and self-harm with frequent thoughts of suicide. \n\nThe day I started to love myself was just one month ago. I realized people love me and care about me and that I am a good person. My internal agony disappeared completely. I'm able to feel more, care more, do better things, lose weight, eat healthier, and kick my habitual drinKing into occasional drinking. I've honestly never felt better. The cause of all this? Another breakup. Funny how that works. My ex, while not right for me, she taught me how to take care of someone, and when she left I directed that knowledge on myself. I thank her for that, and now that I have happiness, I'm glad my soul is still contained in this plane of existence because the world needs me, and I need it. It feels honestly amazing and I'm proud of myself. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yieyj/"}
