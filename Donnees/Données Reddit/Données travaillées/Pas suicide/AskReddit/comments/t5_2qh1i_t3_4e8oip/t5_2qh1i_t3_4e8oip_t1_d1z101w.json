It does fuck with you in the superficial society known as high school.  I was never bullied but being called \"pizza face\" got tiring and it was cyst like severe acne.  I too was a big boy and I love Pink Floyd.   It wasn't easy, I went stag (no date) to prom, I did my own thing.  But here's a story for you, in the 80's there was a drug called Accutane and I very much wanted to have it so it could clear up my acne.  However, you needed a prescription and I didn't have the money to visit a dermatologist.  Fast forward about 10 years later and turns out it caused birth defects so it worked out for the better that I couldn't afford it.  I just want to say, the acne went away, I lost some weight because I started to lift weights, I still love Pink Floyd, I'm married and have an awesome 11 year old son.  I'm not trying to be a hero or anything, but I do know it's refreshing when you can relate to someone just like me and know that they were able to survive and get through it.
