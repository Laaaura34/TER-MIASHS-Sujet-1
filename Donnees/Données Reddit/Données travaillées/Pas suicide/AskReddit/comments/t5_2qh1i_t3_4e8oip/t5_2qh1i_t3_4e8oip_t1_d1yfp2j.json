If they knew you were in so much pain that you took your own life, they honestly deserve it. Then next time they will take a bit more care how they treat people and react to them. \n\nYou are your #1 priority. You can't help others until you help yourself.\n\n(I'm not saying people should suicide, I'm simply saying that guilt tripping people to stick around is NOT the way to keep them living. It puts more stress on them than anything. Instead people should promote SELF growth and love. So that they can start healing themselves.)", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yfp2j/"}
