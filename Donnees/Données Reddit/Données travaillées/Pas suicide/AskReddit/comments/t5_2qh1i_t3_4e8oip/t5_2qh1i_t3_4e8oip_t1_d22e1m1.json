You and your ignorance disgust me to a level that's hard to comprehend.\n\nI cannot imagine how absolutely frustrating and annoying it would be to be around someone who believes we cannot improve. How do you go about life? What do you do?\n\nIf you don't try to imrprove yourself, that doesn't explain why you're making stupid comments that if everyone adopted, would lead to us probably all killing each other from the sheer idiocy we would face on a day to day basis with so many people never believing the could do better...\n\nWhat kind of a world is that?\n\nWe could really do with close-minded people unable to change and improve like you just leaving. Just whatever way you choose, get away from this planet.\n\nIf you happened to be a suicidal person there's no reason for anyone to console you or try to make you feel better because it won't work, because you won't accept anything other than \"life is shit, humans are warmongering idiots\", so why should anyone ever try to help you when you're down?\n\nIt seems a reasonable solution to leave you be, since to attempt to change your behaviour for the better would make you a hypocrite... Jesus I hope you're just a troll and these aren't your real views because if they are maybe I will kill myself because knowing that really makes me fucking want to die.
