I just downed a bunch of pills that would probably kill me, or half heartedly slipped on a noose, even slitting my wrists, I didn't go the full mile. I just did it. Death wasn't the solution, it was a means to the solution. I always just pretended that once I'd done this, once I'd gone through with it, my problems would go away.\n\n\nThey still linger, dumb, dumb problems that any underprivileged child in Africa would laugh at, and that's what keeps me going.
