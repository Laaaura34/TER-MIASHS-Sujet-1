Took a bunch of Tylenol PM (big bottle. Huge.) Somehow one of my roommates found me, while I was blabbering, took me to the hospital down the road, and all I remember was waking up 2 days later. They committed me to in patient and I was able to basically lie my way out within a week. Friends helped me out and I was able to take an emergency LOA. About a week and a half later I was back to work thinking I was fine until shit started going south again a few months later. Finally got some real help and ever since I've been doing pretty well.
