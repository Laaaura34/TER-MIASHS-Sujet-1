I took a handful of hydros and downed some vodka and started wandering the streets.  I was aware if I died at home that no one would find me.  Passed out walking down a sidewalk, and some good Samaritan called an ambulance.\n\nLong story short, no one knows.  When asked where I was, I just say I was out of town for a card tournament and a convention.  Not even my best friend knows because I am afraid she will be upset that I broke our promise.  We promised each other that should we make an attempt on our own lives, we will tell each other first.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6d5c/"}
