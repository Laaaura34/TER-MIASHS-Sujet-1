I had tried several different ways and somehow I always fucked it up. I hadn't taken enough pills, I didn't cut deep enough, I couldn't hold myself underwater long enough, and I was a minor, so I couldn't get my hands on alcohol. After a while I became more depressed because of how unsuccessful I was, and realized I needed help. It was one of the hardest conversations I've ever had with my mom.\n\nI was in the psych ward for about 2 and a half weeks, and honestly, it was the best thing thay could've happened to me.
