Therefore all that is left for someone supporting someone with depression is to support them. \n\nThe more you realise this the more ridiculous some platitude seems.\n\nAlso, to help cope personally with the responsibility I feel is to realise how little you can actually do for them but that little amount (listening, being present for them) becomes invaluable.\n\nTake for instance a common cold, really all you want when you are I'll with a cold is to be wrapped up warm and to just feel cared for. There is no cure for a common cold (not the greatest comparison, I know) however having someone who is concerned for you can really be quite significant.\n\nIt's also important to realise that making them better isn't your responsibility but supporting them and ensuring they feel loved is all you need to or can indeed do.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1zlfl9/"}
