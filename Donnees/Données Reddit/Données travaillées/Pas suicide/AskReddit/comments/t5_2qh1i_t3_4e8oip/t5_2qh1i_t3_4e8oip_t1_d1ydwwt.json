But I'm far happier without her and honestly, I don't regret it at all.\n\nIt's been about 9 years. I tried to rekindle a couple of times in those years, from encouragement from my grandmother or sister or my mother herself. But those times just solidified that I did the right thing in the first place. I'm better without the toxic.\n\nSome say, \"You need to learn forgiveness,\" or other things along those lines. And it *has* actually taught me a lot about forgiveness and love. But ultimately my decision is not about forgiveness at all. It's about what is healthy for me. I'm not angry about what she did and I don't hold a grudge anymore. But my life is healthier without her, and that's okay.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ydwwt/"}
