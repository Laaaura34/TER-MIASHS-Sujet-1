The doctor said I barely hit a nerve with the syringe.  Because of the damage, I have some wonky feeling on my left forearm, sometimes like electricity going from the inside of my elbow up to my wrist.\n\nIt also meant that I cannot make that arm (and the leg too) do so much work.  I have to take care not to overexert the affected limbs.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y8uww/"}
