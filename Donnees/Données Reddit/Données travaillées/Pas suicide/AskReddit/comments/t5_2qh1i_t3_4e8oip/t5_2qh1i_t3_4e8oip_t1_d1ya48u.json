ANd her front brain eventually tells her self its not her fault, back still in the back of her mind she wonders what she could have done differently, or that maybe it was cause of her. Suicide doesnt get rid of the pain, it only transfers it to those you leave behind. SO i am quite glad you are still here. My friend and HER thoughts are the reason that even though i have been tempted, i havent actually tried it. I cant bear giving pain to other people. \n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ya48u/"}
