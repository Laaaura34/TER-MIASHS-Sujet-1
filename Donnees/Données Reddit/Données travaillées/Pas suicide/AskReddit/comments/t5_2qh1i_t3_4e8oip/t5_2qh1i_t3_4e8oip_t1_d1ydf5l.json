Still here.\n\nSecond attempt: How did that not work?!  What the fuck!\n\nThird attempt: Alright, there's probably a reason for this.  Maybe I should do that whole 'keep on keeping on' thing and figure it out.\n\nAlmost had a fourth attempt, gun was under my chin.  Only thing that saved me was that I didn't know how this woman I was developing a  relationship with would find out.  We'd just begun talking through text and Skype, and I hadn't told her how I felt about get, yet.  So I put the gun down and got a tattoo instead.
