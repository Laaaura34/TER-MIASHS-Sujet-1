It pained for, what it seems like, days now. \n\n\nThat incident was really bad for me because every time i thought about killing myself, or even started to actually do it, i would get scared of failing again. i decided that I wouldn't do it until I found a quick and painless way. \n\n\nafter that, whenever I read, heard or came to know that someone had committed suicide, I was more curious about 'how' rather than 'why', but still years went by and no luck. That was until I saw the imitation game a few days back, searched online how he did it, and it said he used apple seeds. All these years I had this excuse of not having the means to do it and now that I have.. I don't know.. I mean things still haven't gotten better, I still have no friends, no family, still in pain all the time, still a handicap.. still all alone.. and I don't want to be alone, not anymore. I don't know if I can do this all alone..  im sorry I know this wasn't part of the question asked, but I just.. had to get it out.
