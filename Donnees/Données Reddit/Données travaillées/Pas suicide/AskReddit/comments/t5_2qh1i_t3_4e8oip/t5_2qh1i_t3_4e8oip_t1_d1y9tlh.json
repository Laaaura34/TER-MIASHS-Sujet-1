I went early, and the car slowed down enough that I wasn't seriously hurt. I got up straight away and ran, just felt like such an idiot and was really glad I was okay only because the guy in the car didn't deserve to suffer the consequences of my actions. Then I just really hated myself because I knew I was too afraid to every take my own life, that I was going to have to keep living because i was scared. Then how unfair everything was, that I was feeling this while the people that caused it where living happily. \n\nSo I pretty much decided to live to spite the people that caused me so much pain. Had a lot of anger at the time and I manage to use it to keep me going. When I got home my mum got a bit of a shock, I was pretty good at playing pretend until that night. My mum realized what a bad state I was in and took me to get help. Probably not the best way to go about it but it worked and I've gotten a lot better since.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9tlh/"}
