That was the first thought that popped into my head and I obviously wasn't thinking straight. I drank a full bottle of wine, three bottles of cider, two beers in the space of about 10 minutes. I hoped that if I drank them fast enough (I'm only 5\"2 and about 120 pounds.) I'd get alcohol poisoning. But alas I just got super drunk and emotionally messaged my boyfriend what I had done, went to the bathroom and smashed my head on the sink intentionally in the hopes of giving myself brain damage, then passed out in his room. I awoke to paramedics standing around me doing all sorts of tests. (Blood pressure, sugar levels etc etc.) They asked me if I wanted to go to the hospital and I said no, they couldn't force me and since I wasn't in any actual danger they had to leave. \n\nIt was embarrassing for me because I'm a very awkward person and quite a lot of people in the halls had seen this commotion and wondered what was going on, two people who weren't my boyfriend actually saw me passed out on the bed.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ydkq8/"}
