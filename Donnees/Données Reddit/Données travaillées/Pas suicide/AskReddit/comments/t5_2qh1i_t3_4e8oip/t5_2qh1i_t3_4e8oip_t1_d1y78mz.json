(Catholic upbringing. )  There was a woman taking notes, and someone had gotten my family and they were around me. My father expressed his disappointment and my mother kept asking questions I had no answers for.  I believed they weren't real, just visions to torment me. Honestly, the way my family treated me was a big part of why I did what I did. This idea that I was in hell or purgatory crossed my mind a few times the next day as well. I didn't realize I wasn't dead until after I was settled in and friends started coming to see me and giving me support and encouragement.
