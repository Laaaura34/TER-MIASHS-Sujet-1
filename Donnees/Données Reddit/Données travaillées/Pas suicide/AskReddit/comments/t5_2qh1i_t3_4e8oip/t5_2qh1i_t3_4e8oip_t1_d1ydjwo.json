Let's call him X.\nX and I met while he was in a very dark place, over the internet. We have now been friends for three years, and let me tell you, he pulled himself out of a very, very dark place. He would attempt suicide at least once a month and every time he ended up in a hospital with annoyed parents and nurses watching him so he wouldn't fuck with the tools. X still struggles today but as far as I know has not tried to kill himself in several months. I love him with all my heart (heh, gay) and so does his boyfriend (double gay.) He had, during attempts, cut his arms, overdosed, and jumped from his roof at least once. But he LIVED.\nAnd I get to meet him for the first time soon, and I can't wait, and neither can he, and I'm going to hug the hell out of him.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ydjwo/"}
