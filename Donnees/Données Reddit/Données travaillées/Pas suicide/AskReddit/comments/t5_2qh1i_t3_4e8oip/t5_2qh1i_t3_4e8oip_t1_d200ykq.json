I was choking them down by the handful and chased it down with some nyquil so I'd fall asleep before I started to vomit. \n\nI remember my dad called before I started to fight the sleep, and slurring that I was glad the I got to talk to him but I had to go now. \n\nObviously I woke up the next morning, and my first thoughts were terrible. I felt like I was such a failure the I couldn't even kill myself right. Then I felt incredibly stupid because what I had taken wasn't even close to lethal. Some 75 advil, a package of dramamine and a blister pack full of little red pills, I should have chugged the drano under the sink instead. \n\nMy mom took me to the doctor that morning because my friend told the school what I'd done, and I wasn't given a moments privacy for a while, so I obviously didn't go back to correct my mistakes.\n\nI'm glad for it now, my life isn't great but it's what I got. \n\nEspecially now. My older brother died 2 years ago, and my dad doesn't know how close he came to having me kill myself 12 years ago. I thought I'd be less of a burden if I went but after my brother's death, which was not a suicide, I'd know that I'd haunt this family for fucking ever. \n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d200ykq/"}
