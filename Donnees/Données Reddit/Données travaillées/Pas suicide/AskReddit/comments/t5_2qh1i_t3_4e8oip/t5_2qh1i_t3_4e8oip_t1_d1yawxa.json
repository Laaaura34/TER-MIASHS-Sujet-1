Between medication and therapy, I'm working to change that. It's super hard. She relates depression and PTSD to being in a tar pit; you are sinking but right now you're holding onto the branch. Try to get yourself up a little at a time. \n\nYou can't take big leaps and bounds, and every step is a struggle. She also tells me that being in constant suffering does not make future trauma hurt less. We think if we suffer we will numb ourself to the pain, but in reality it doesn't help. So every day I try to find something that makes me feel happy and MAKE myself enjoy it for longer. If your default is like mine, please try to get on some sort of medication; it's not a cure all, but it helps. It also takes time, and you will slip. But just focus on the little steps you can do. \n\nI hope this helps. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yawxa/"}
