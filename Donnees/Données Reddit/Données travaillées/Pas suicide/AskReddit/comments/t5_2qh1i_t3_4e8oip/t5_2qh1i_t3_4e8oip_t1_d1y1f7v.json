My dad and I are pretty big gun nuts. My dad has a reloading bench and is big into doing his own hand loads (a part of the hobby I was never into). He has a few rounds made up that are complete except they aren't filled with powder. They're just the trimmed cases with the bullet pressed to it that he keeps to take and compare for measurement purposes, but because of the lack of powder they are inert. I grabbed one of these by accident, because at the time I really knew nothing about reloading and assumed it was just a regular round. When I went to shoot myself nothing happened. I pulled the trigger and it just clicked.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y1f7v/"}
