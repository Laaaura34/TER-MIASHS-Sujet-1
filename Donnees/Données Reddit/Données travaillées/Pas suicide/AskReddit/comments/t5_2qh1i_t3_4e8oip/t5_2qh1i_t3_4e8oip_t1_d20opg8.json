Also a T1D for 12 years who has struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. This is how I always pictured I would go but I've never actually had the gall to do it. I have actually experienced a hypoglycemic episode recently that kind of sounds familiar.\n\nI was just not eating so much while on an insulin pump and, often and admittedly, blind bolus for meals which leads to too much insulin. One night, I just felt off. I knew my sugar was low but didn't know *how* low. I took some glucose gel and went to find snacks/food in the house.\n\nI remember turning on the TV, eating a bowl of chocolate mini-wheats and peanut butter crackers, and just sitting on the couch. I was sweating profusely, breathing heavily, and just trying to calm down. I've never experienced a sugar this low and I've been as low as 30-40 without those symptoms so it had to be <25.\n\nI grabbed a sleeve of thin mints from the freezer, sat down, and just blacked out.\n\nI remember waking up a few minutes later with half the sleeve eaten and a chunk from the movie I had been watching. I just kind of looked around, took a deep breath, and went back to bed.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d20opg8/"}
