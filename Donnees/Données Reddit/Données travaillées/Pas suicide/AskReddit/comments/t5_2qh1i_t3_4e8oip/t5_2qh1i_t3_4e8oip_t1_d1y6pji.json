I was brought out of sedation so I could have a breathing tube removed, and I remember the sensation of having it taken out was revolting. The whole experience was horrifying, from being told that I'd been sedated and on a ventilator for a week, to listening to people die around me in intensive care, to the hallucinations I had as side effects of my attempted overdose, and having to spend a few days getting my legs to walk again. I wouldn't wish it on anyone, and it cemented my resolve that I'd never put myself in a position to suffer like that again. Having survived that means I now know I can take on anything life has for me. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6pji/"}
