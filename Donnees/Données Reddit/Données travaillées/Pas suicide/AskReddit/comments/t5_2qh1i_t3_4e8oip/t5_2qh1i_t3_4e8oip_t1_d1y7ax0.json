Although I wasn't able to ACTUALLY go through with it, I attempted suicide twice in middle school. I was generally hated, and suffered from extreme OCD, and hadn't had my meds fully worked out. The constant bullying, anger, and hurt never helps. Even today, I still suffer from OCD and depression, which amplify each other. Since middle school, I've forgotten much of what happened, and even I've even forgotten most of the details of my two attempts. I did learn that even if I did it, it would be a million times worse for those who cared about me. Even as depressed as I get today (which doesn't help after major spine surgery), I don't consider suicide an option. I couldn't hurt my family and friends like that. For those of you who are thinking about it, don't. It can get better. Although I'm still not exactly fantastic, I can get through the pain. You can too. Fuck, I was like ten or eleven when I got through most of it. If a middle schooler who can't grasp the concept of how others care about them made it, you can too.
