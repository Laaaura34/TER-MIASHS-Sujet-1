Your \"big dreams\" are to save the world. Your \"smaller\" dreams are to help others improve their lives. Your \"attainable\" dreams are to create to amuse, entertain and help others get through each day. You are an amazing person with an enormous heart. Never give up. Whether you believe it or not, it's people like you that make the world a better place.\n\n\"So I guess you can't achieve your dreams if you don't have money.\" There's Kickstarter to help get things off the ground, or even the reddit mobs..I saw a post recently about a guy that created his own hot sauce company with the help of people on reddit.
