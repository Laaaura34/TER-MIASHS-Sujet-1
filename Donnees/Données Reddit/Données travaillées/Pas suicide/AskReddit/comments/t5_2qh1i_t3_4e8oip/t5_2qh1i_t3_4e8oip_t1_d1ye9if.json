Hearing everyone's personal stories has been very humbling, and I'm amazed and proud of people for what they go through. I'm pleased you looked up the quotes! I didn't source Russell Brand's quote deliberately because it was just a little thing he wrote in an article about football. I feel kind of silly that it affected me so much, but it really is something I hold on to. He's a very clever guy who has dealt with a lot of depression himself, and I respect that. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou have a wonderful outlook on life and I think that will carry you far. Thank you so much for commenting!", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ye9if/"}
