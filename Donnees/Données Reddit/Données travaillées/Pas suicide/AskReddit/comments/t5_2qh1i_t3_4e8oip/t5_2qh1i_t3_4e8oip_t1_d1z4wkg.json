I zoned out so much, next thing I realise I was at the front door already. That kept happening everyday.\nThen I sat on the edge of my bedroom window, suddenly I started having thoughts about what would happen if I took off. Yeah, that didn't happened either.\nI was really young back then that other suicide ideas didn't occur to me as an idea (like hanging, drug overdose etc). I wasn't brought up with movies and had limited TV access so I never knew.\nRight after the last cowardly \"attempt\", I thought about the people that loved me, close friend and baby brother and sister. I would give up everything for them.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1z4wkg/"}
