Roomate wokea up extra early for the bathroom and found me just in time. \nDoctor said I was a couple hours off dying. \n\nMy first thought when I woke up was that of sadness and anger that I failed; even with all my family in the ER. I even harbored some resentment and hate to my roommate for saving me for a few months. This was in September last year. \nNow I'm doing a lot better and I'm really glad that I survived. Life has really started looking up finally. \n\nTo anyone that has similar thoughts or intentions please try to get help from anyone. Or turn yourself into a hospital. Life is worth living even through the dark painful moments, it'll get better. Not over night, and it'll take me effort, but it's worth it.
