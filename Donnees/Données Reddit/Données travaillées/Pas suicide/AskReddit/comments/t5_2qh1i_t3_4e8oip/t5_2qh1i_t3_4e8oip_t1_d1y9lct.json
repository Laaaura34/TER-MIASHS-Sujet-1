It didn't work after three attempts in a row . Upon realising it wasn't gonna happen when I couldn't steer anymore,  I figured it was divine intervention, I wiped a whole bunch of blood off my face and walked to the local police station to turn myself in.  I remember being annoyed that my smokes were all bloody. After I'd survived,  my despair was replaced by frustration,  but at the same time elation that maybe there was an undiscovered purpose as to why I am here. They had an ambulance take me to hospital where I had my head glued back together and I was released with no follow up. But my initial thoughts were, \"God hadn't called my number,  so therefore intervened\" and I'd better let the cops know.
