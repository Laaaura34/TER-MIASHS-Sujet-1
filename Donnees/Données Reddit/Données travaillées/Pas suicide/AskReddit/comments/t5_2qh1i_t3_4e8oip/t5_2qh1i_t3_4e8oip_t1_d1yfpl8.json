Force fed charcoal, paddles to the chest, breathing tube ... all that jazz. The first thing my dad said to me when I finally came to the next day was \"Do you know how much this hospital visit is going to cost?!\" He proceeded to scream at me for all the debt my hospital stay had put him in for seriously YEARS afterwards. I never heard him express sadness over what I'd done, or been scared that I technically died for a minute. Nope, according to him, I failed at killing myself just to put him under a mountain of debt. Sorry I didn't die, then, Dad.\n\nTL;DR: My dad's a dick.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yfpl8/"}
