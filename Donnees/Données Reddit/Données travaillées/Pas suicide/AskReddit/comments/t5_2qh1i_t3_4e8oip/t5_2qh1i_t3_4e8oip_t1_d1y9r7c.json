I literally moved away from all my friends and started fresh I looked myself in the mirror one day and said 'I don't want to be like this anymore' and did something about it... previously to that  I thought I had no hope but one day I just snapped and if it wasn't for me it wouldn't have happened.. no one else could do it for me... I spent 4 years fucked up and now I'm clean for 7 - Good luck and stay strong - Keep your mind busy with whatever it is you like doing or work.. it certainly helped during the first year.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9r7c/"}
