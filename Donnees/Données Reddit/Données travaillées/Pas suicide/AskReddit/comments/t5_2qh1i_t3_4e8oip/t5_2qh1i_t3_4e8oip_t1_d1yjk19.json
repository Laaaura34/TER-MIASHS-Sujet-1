They're common sense.  But not everyone practices common sense every day of their lives, and so could use a reminder.  In the koan above, the message is about impermanence.  All things die - or break.  If you keep that message in the forefront of your mind, you'll be less likely to take the things you love for granted.  That's the message of the koan.  All things WILL die, so embrace them while you can. \n\nReplace the glass in the koan with a pet or a person you love.  You don't say, hey this is a good pet.  That's not the point.  You say, hey I'm going to see my pet die one day, I should spend some time with him while I can. That's the point of the koan.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yjk19/"}
