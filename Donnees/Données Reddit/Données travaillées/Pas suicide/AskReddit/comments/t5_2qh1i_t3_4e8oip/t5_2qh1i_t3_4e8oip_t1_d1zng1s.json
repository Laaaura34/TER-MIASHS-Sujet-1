I had suicidal thoughts every single day and I would save the little packets from medicine bottles, food, etc. that are supposed to keep the moisture out (silica gel) and put them in my drawer. One day, after a terrible day at school, I came home and just....couldn't deal with it anymore. I took out the 25 packets I had saved up over a few months, tore them open and swallowed them all. I mean, it said \"Do Not Eat\" on them so I figured they'd be poisonous. When I finished swallowing them, I decided to go on MSN messenger and send my goodbyes to my friends. I end up talking to one of my friends about the shit day he's having and that he's worried about his mom because she had to go to the hospital for surgery. I calm him down and he says the sentence that I will never forget, *\"Thanks for talking to me, I don't know what I would have done without you.\"*\nWithout even typing a reply, I run straight to the bathroom and make myself throw up everything. Now he is my best friend, going 7 years strong!\nI found out months later that silica gel wouldn't really have harmed me and now I'm always randomly letting my friends know how much I appreciate them in case they're going through a difficult time :)", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1zng1s/"}
