I turned 16 when I was  in there. \n\nWhen I tried to kill myself I took multiple handfuls of pills. All that I could find, but it mostly it consisted of advil and iron supplements (for my anemia). Then I drank till I couldn't stand up, laid in the shower puking and cutting. I ended with a double digit blood alcohol level and almost lost my liver from the toxicity of the iron and alcohol. Its lucky I survived. \n\nWhen I finally sobered up by the next afternoon I just stared at the wall while my parents talked at me and cried. I hated myself. I couldn't get fucking suicide right. I felt blank.  I was in shock (or catatonic?) for a few days. Im better now.
