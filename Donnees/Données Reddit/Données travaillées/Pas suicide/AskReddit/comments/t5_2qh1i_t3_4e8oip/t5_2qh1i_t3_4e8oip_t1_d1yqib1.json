But this isn't what it's about. If they're considering suicide something is wrong or they're missing something. SOME thing in their life is wrong enough and the people close to them aren't enough to fix it.\n\nIf I were suicidal I wouldn't want my mother to know about it or guess at it and try to \"fix it\" by being unnaturally nice or treating me with kiddy gloves. I would like her to be better overall normally regardless whether there is suicidal behavior or not. Because humans are such a social creature it's the social things that often lead to these suicidal behaviors (even the economic ones really come from social pressures). This is why I said that it's the responsibility/role of everyone that's close to you to \"keep you fine\". It's not one specific person's fault, but a shared one.\n\nWhat do you think how many people consider suicide that weren't affected by social issues? I think it's very very few if any at all. This would then mean that the people closest to you just aren't enough, but again, it's not a specific person's fault, just that something is missing. Maybe that something is even impossible to fix, but you can't say that suicide is a selfish thing because those close to you will miss you. If they're going to miss you then they need to overall be better enough so you wouldn't even get into such a spot (and again, it is not a specific individual's responsibility).", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yqib1/"}
