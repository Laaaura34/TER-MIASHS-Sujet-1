Just about everything that could go wrong did go wrong that year - my projects were failing (and not even in a useful, \"I could go in that direction instead!\" kind of way), I was given a fortnights' notice to vacate the family home, my 4-year relationship was on the rocks, and I was excruciatingly lonely at the bottom of the totem pole at the lab, with a supervisor who didn't know how to and/or want to relate to me.\n\nMy then-partner found me sobbing in my underwear in the kitchen that night, halfway through making the first cut. It took two people (the flatmate helped) to pull clothes on me, then drag me to the local Emergency Department. \n\nMy first thought on being tackled in the kitchen was a bitter, \"Great, so I'm even a failure at this as well.\" That echoed through the next five hours being watched by the beady eyes of three no-nonsense orderlies, who didn't hesitate in almost literally sitting on me when I was caught trying again while the nurses' backs were turned.\n\nOver a decade's worth of therapy and meds later, I am much more functional. Progress has been slow but definite, and I can emphatically now say that the place I was that night is a place where I never want to be again.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d23l3we/"}
