There were two periods of time where this happened, and both times I was in a complete downward spiral and extremely unhappy for months. \n\nThere were a variety of factors that influenced me:\n-Stress from school (first time was my senior year where I was working and pretty heavily involved in extracurriculars, second time was college stress) \n-I felt alone and worthless because either my friends distanced themselves from me or I would distance myself so I wouldn't burden them with my problems \n- Uncertainty about the future \n-Generic teenage identity issues \n\nI hope that answers your question.
