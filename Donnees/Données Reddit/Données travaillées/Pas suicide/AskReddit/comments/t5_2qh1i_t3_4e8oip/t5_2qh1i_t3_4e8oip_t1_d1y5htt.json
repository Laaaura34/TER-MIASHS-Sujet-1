I didn't have a lot of options, and didn't really plan it out, but I brought a bottle of caffeine pills with a combined total of about 8g of caffeine. I'm not positive in hindsight that it'd be enough, but I didn't care at the time. \n\nWell, my sister pieced things together. She refused to get out of the car, and called my parents, who called the police. I ended up getting pulled over on the highway, so I got out of the car and managed to down most of the bottle before I was tackled and arrested. As I got hauled into the ambulance, I turned to my parents and asked them that first thought. I think that moment was the first step to recovering, after seeing how much that one sentence hurt them, and how much they cared. \n\nI spent the next two weeks in the psych ward before being released on the condition that I continue medication and therapy. That was 8 years ago, and in that time, I learned the answer to that question: because people care. They cared enough to help me see that there are other options. I'm not quite 'there' yet, but I've met some amazing people, one in particular, that I don't want to lose. I may still hurt, but it's a small price to pay to wake up to his face every day. \n\nWow, that got lovey dovey, didn't it? I guess, when looking back on those intensely emotional events, the good comes out alongside, right?", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y5htt/"}
