I know how you feel, tried twice to kill myself, failed the first time, got saved the second one. My now husband got me help, a couple of years later my family found out and they helped too, with their support, 16 years of tons of meds, 5 shrinks, 2 psycologists, multiple hospital visits, and year in therapy, I'm 36, finally happy and enjoying life, it's such a weird feeling after all those years of being depressed and wishing for death. It's never too late to start over! Loads of love and hughs, please hang on, it takes time, sometimes it feels forever, but it can be done.
