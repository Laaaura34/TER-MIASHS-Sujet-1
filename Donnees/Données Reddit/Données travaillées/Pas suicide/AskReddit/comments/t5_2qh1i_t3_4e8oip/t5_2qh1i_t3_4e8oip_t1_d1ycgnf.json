It tells you your situation is uniquely inescapable. No solutions aside from that final decision that so many people make every day. If life is a bastard, depression is a sociopathic, manipulative murderer.  \n\nDepression is not you; it just lives inside. Starve that motherfucker to death. Everytime you go outside your comfort zone, you are telling that darkness inside you to go screw itself.\n\nPeople always suggest the services all around to help you through suicidal behavior, but threads like this are truly the best service. \n\nEDIT: Sorry for this not actually being a suicide story. I started to write something personal, but apparently I'm not ready to dredge that up yet.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ycgnf/"}
