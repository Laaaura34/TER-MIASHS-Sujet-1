Goes to show how stable and considerat a person you are.\n\nDespite this disrespectful attitude, here's my response: reread my comment. I did NOT say you should never prevent a suicide attempt. I said **REPEATEDLY** preventing succesive attempts is tyrannical and indicates the egomaniacal belief that one can be always, absolutely, consistently more right and/or sane than someone else.\n\nSuicide, several times, is a choice, however a hard and grievous one. It **must** be respected in that sense, otherwise you're diminishing the person you believe you care for, by reducing her/his feelings, thoughts and choices to \"an illness\".", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yfmxo/"}
