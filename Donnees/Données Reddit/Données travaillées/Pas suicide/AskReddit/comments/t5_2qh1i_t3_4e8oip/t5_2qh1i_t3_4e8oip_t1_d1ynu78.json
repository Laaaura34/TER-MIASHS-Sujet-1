The post I responded to is something that mentally healthy people say a lot to make themselves feel good, but it doesn't actually help any suicidal people, it only testifies of a lack of understanding. It could actually make it worse.\n\nYou see a lot of suicidal people are mad at the world. A lot of people purposely jump in front of a train as a final 'fuck you' to the world. Not all, but still a lot. Calling them selfish is only going to reinforce that anger and worsen their condition.\n\nThere are very little suicide attempts which occur because of a lack of thought. The problem isn't a lack of thought, the problem is that their thought process is often faulty. To an outside party a father of two killing themselves is horrible. Who leaves their two kids behind, right? But to that father, killing themselves is precisely what they think those kids need. 'They are better off without me', they think.\n\nThe only thing calling them selfish is going to accomplish is that more people will keep quiet about their condition. Often what these people need is a party they can talk openly to and a feeling of being really understood. Even saying that there is a lot to live for isn't going to accomplish anything.\n\nIf you truly want to help a suicidal person, let them talk about what's troubling them, openly and without judgement.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ynu78/"}
