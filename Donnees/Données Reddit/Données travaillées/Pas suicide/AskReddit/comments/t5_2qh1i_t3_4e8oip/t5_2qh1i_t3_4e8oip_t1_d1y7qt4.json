I don't mean i want to sock you in the jaw, but there is so much that I learned the hard way.  Ill tell you, you won't listen because you have to learn for yourself but I'll still say it.  \n\nPain is a fucked up thing to live with, trust me, I still limp and hobble and run for the bathroom and poo blood, but I will NEVER think pain killers are the answer again.  They simply aren't.  You won't believe me, they make everything better.... for a while.... but after that?  They just make life a living hell.  Wondering where your next script is coming from, when your next dose of relief is coming, how many pills you have vs how much relief you can get for how long they have to last.  Then the addiction hits and you're so afraid of the withdrawal its paralyzing.  \n\nI used to think they just helped me, made me functional again, made me sociable and lively.  Then... you realize that all that pain you're suppressing, well,  it's getting worse.   Then when you finally run out of resources and are clean for a while, you can barely function because you haven't learned to deal with the pain the proper way.  All you know how to do is rely on pills to make you better.  \n\nMore of a side note,  don't rely on a girl for happiness,  its your own responsibility.   If you rely too much on her,  she'll resent you for it,  it's not her job. \n\nGood luck man,  wishing you well and i hope this helps.
