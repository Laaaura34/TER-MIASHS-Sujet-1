I have a birth defect (deformed legs) and just couldn't take the bullying anymore. So I got myself all strung up by a belt stuck in the door jam of my closet, stood up on a stool, and tried to get the courage to knock the stool over. \n\nThen I accidentally knocked the stool over. \n\nI hanged for about fifteen seconds, just long enough to make things start to go black. And then the cheap plastic belt I was using broke. \n\nI hit the ground and just yelled out loud \"OH FUCK\" because 1. The belt broke and I was still here, and 2. Thank god the belt broke and I was still here. \n\nEdit: Thank you guys so much for your wonderful kind words and support. As for what happened to the people who bullied me, one is in jail and the other is up to be a CEO. No clue how that happened but oh well XD  \n\nI've found something I am truly passionate about (comic books and animation) and things have been on a steady uphill climb. And to anyone currently struggling, PLEASE PM ME! Feel free to just rant or get something off your chest; I'm no psychiatrist, but I *am* a very good listener. Keep your chin up guys!
