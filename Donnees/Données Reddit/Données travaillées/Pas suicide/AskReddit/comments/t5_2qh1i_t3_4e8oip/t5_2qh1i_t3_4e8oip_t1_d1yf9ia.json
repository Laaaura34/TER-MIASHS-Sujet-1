I was bullied for my accent in an american grade school, my drawings, my writings, and my creativity. I fell forward and the line snapped instantly, afterwards I realized. \"Jesus christ I am out of shape.\"\n\nEver since, I haven't attempted, my mental breakdown I had several hours later was me telling my mom about it, who still to this day hasn't told a soul, not even my own neglectful father.  And then my life changed for the better, kids stopped bullying me, and I took therapy for a few years, I still remember my desperation, my want to just die. Looking back at what I had suffered, it only made me a better person in the end.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yf9ia/"}
