Supplement \"marketing\" teams love to tell you that you have to take this shake right after your workout to replenish your muscles. There is truth to that but honestly you could be replenishing all during your workout too. \n\nSo take it pre workout, drinking juice and egg whites all throughout the lift, and then take a smaller dose or 2 later in the evening right before big meals if you can handle it. \n\nPro's probably take it with gh 1-3 a day before meals, maybe more. Depends on the size. I used it for 2 weeks to help get me past 215lbs. I'm sitting at 235 without it now.\n\nEating some sugar before your workout too can also cause a natural insulin spike which you'll see often if you follow any IG fitness people. Some eat candy likes it their job haha. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1zsrid/"}
