Gaming was an escape for me (which my parents are against all the time), but I became severely depressed, and would always think of suicide as an escape.\n\nTo be frank, it wasn't a deliberate suicide attempt, but when I was in the middle of a deep pool and I started panicking, half my brain wanted me to accept it, while the other half wanted me to wait for Wednesday to hear about a girl talk about Christ. Long story short, she shared about Christ, and my life is now much, much better.\n\nIt's not like the depression is completely gone or anything; I still struggle to do anything on bad days, but remembering what God has given me and done for me gives me hope and strength to go on and keep doing stuff for Him. It's worth the pain.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y71v4/"}
