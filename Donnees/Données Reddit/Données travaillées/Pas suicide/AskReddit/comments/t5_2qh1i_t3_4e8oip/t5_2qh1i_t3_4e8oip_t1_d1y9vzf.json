I loaded three of them so the chances will be 50/50 and actually did the thing. I was so nervous that when I heard quiet click noise I thought that was the end. After couple minutes of shock I finally realized nothing happened, and first thing came to mind was \"OK, so if fate don't want me to die I'll try to manage myself\". Can't say my life wasn't shit after that, but it was definitely better.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9vzf/"}
