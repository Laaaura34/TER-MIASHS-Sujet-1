He taught me relaxation techniques so when it became unbearable I could find a quiet corner and relax through the pain.  I would highly recommend finding a licensed psychiatrist that specializes in pain management.  Part of my problem was anxiety about the pain and embarrassment about it, so I am sure getting help with that was also a big part.  Years later just turns out I have Celiac, it was just really difficult to diagnose.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yeb30/"}
