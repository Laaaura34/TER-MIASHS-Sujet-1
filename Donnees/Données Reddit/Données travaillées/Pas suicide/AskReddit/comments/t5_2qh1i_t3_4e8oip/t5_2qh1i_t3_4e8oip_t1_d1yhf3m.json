While my first conscious thought wasn't exactly positive, it later put things in perspective. I woke up on my bedroom floor, 2 days later. When I was finally able to move, I reached in my pocket to find my phone. (I didn't realize 2 days had passed at this point). My first thought was the realization that not one person had reached out to see where I was. I had a group of friends, none of which knew about my personal issues because I kept them to myself and these were more or less friends that could be called bad influences. Even though I couldn't really blame them for not checking on me, I just found it demoralizing that not one person called or asked where I was or if everything was alright. But in that brief moment of loneliness and desperation, I realized I had more to live for and that I needed to find more positive people to hang around. I called my mother, moved home, later moved out of state to a new college. Now 2 years later, I've met people that are now my closest friends, I'm in my last year of school, and dating the love of my life.
