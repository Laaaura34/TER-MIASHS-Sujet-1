They didn't believe the hanging was accidental though.\n\nOddly, the one time I overdosed on accident, it was assumed to be a suicide attempt. I was given codeine cough syrup and between the pharmacist mixing it at double strength and me reading \"4 tsp a day\" as \"4 tbsp a dose\" I ODed big time. I had pneumonia on top of it so ended up waking up three days later in a hospital.\n\nOn the other hand, I felt GREAT when I woke up. My cough was so much better after getting some sleep (I hadn't slept more than fifteen minutes or so for the last few weeks) and while I was out they used some kind of breathing treatment on me that cleared up at least half the yuck out of me.\n\nThankfully my doctor asked for the remaining syrup to be tested and found it was mixed to the highest strength, not the lower strength the doctor ordered for me. Doc figured if it had been an actual suicide I,would have swallowed the whole bottle, not just the mega dose I thought was a normal dose.
