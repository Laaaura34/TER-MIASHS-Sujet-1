My choices, and vices, and relationships.  Some days, it seems like all of them have been ways that I punish myself for not having succeeded.\n\nI wont talk about attempts. But, failing has always felt bizarre to me.  For a long time, I kind of thought that the me that tried, died.  This me was somehow another me.  Same problems, same insufferable internal dialogue, same crooked face.  I always thought that I *had* succeeded, but wasn't given peace, because I deserve the suffering.  I don't know why.\n\nI don't try anymore.  \n\nI think I am doing better now.  I don't have the fathomless pits, and the rocket ship highs anymore.  I miss them sometimes though, I feel like I was a more interesting person when I could afford to feel more.\n\nMy advice, if I had any, would be \"don't bother\".  Not only do the people you leave have to mourn you, but it doesn't end.  It wont.\n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7wte/"}
