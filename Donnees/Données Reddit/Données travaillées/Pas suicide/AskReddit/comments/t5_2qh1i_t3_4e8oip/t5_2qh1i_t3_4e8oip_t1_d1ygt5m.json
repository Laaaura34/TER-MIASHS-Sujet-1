But the question was why? It didn't make sense. I planned so well, but goddamn it it didn't work. I was in Emory for a while. I remember how empty I felt, how everyone was looking at me and it felt like they were judging me. Every time I found a moment of peace through the pain the question was \"why?\". After reflection and introspection (and helluva lot of therapy) it went from why am I here to why did I try? That's all that matters.
