I truly have lost counts of my thoughts, plans and attempts. I have battled mental health issues and mental illness that has always led me to suicidal conclusions. \n\nI feel like I can't escape the feelings, like they're a shadow watching my every move and that one day they will win, that my fate is inescapable.\n\nYou know what helps me? There is a young man who paces up and down my street, every day, several times a day, in rain or snow or sun or day or night. He is always pacing slowly, smoking a cigarette or drinking a soda or just contemplating. Whether I have a good day or a bad day, he will pace. He is the one constant thing in my otherwise turbulent, unpredictable life. He keeps me grounded on shitty and wonderful days. He will never know how much I appreciate and care for him. He saves my life every single day that he walks. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7jao/"}
