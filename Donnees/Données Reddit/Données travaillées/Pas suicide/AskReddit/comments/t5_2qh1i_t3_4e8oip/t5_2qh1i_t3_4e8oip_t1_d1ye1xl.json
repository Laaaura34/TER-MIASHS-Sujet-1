Once when I was 15, I tried to hang myself by tying myself to a tree. But I chickened out at the last minute. Another time I tried to jump off a bridge but same thing happened. The time I came closest was with pills. I took 2 whole bottles of Tylenol and Xanax and tried to go to sleep and not wake up again.\n\nIt took about 5 minutes for me to realize that this was a bad idea, not only because killing myself would be a terrible loss but because ODing on pain pills is, ironically, an excruciatingly painful way to die. I was in college at the time and I went to my school's free clinic, next thing you know I was being carried off in an ambulance and they were pumping my stomach and making me swallow liquid charcoal so it wouldn't stick to my liver. I was in the hospital for a week, first in the ER, then in a psychiatric facility.\n\nI don't really remember what I was thinking about after that, other than the fact that some of my friends came 2 towns over to see me as soon as they found out what happened. Some of them didn't even have cars so they had to walk or take the bus (and this was in New England in mid-January, it was fucking cold out). My dad came from about 2 hours away and gave me a couple books that I really liked to read. The one thing that really stuck with me was how much people cared about me and how much they didn't want me to die. I decided life was worth living and that I couldn't end it when I was at such a young age. I realized how many people loved me and I wanted to be able to give it back any way I could.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ye1xl/"}
