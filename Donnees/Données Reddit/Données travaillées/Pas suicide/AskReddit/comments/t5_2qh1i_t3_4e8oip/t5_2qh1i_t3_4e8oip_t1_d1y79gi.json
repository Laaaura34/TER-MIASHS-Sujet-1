The same drug may work for person A, but may not work for person B. If you find that it doesn't seem to be working, go back to the doctor and ask them for a different prescription. (IIRC they can also up the dosage and that sometimes works.)\n\nI don't know how many different medications my mom had to try out, but I know it was a lot. Now that she's found a prescription that works for her she's relatively back to normal. It's so nice to see her be able to function normally again. She'll occasionally have an off day, but who doesn't. Even those who aren't depressed have bad days. I used to worry that I might actually lose her. I still worry, because that's in my nature, but not nearly as much as I used to. Seeing her be happy again is amazing. \n\nSeriously, if you think you need antidepressant medication, go see a doctor! I can't stress it enough. I wish you the best of luck in finding happiness again. \n\nFeel free to PM me at any time if you just want to talk. :)", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y79gi/"}
