I was still really out of it and i managed to get the restraints off by using my teeth and tried to leave the hospital.  The security guards stopped me and had to tackle me to the ground.  They then restrained my arms above my head.  I must have passed out again because i woke up the next day in a psychiatric hospital.  I remember thinking wtf did i do and i felt really bad about the trouble I caused the nurses and guards at the hospital. But I finally got the help I needed and with medication and counseling I'm doing a lot better.
