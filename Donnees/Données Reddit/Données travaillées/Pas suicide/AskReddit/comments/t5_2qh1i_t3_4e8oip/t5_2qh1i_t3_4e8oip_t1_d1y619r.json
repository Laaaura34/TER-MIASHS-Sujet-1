I have dealt with my depression for over 20 years. At first all I could do was cry. I tried counseling but the counselors didn't let me talk about my childhood-- counseling is for the here and now, not to dredge up the past.. Was the message I got from them. Only problem was I experienced childhood trauma, never really bonded with my mom and was so afraid but unable to voice my fears-- even to MYSELF. So I spent a lifetime alone and fearful and unable to feel safe or able to be me. \n\nBut life is better because I found counselors on a hotline who have helped me learn and grow and feel I am okay. Though I still have a long way to go (still hate me and still feel I am such a waste and have no life) hopeful I overcome the rest of my problems.\n\nLong story short, keep going, keep searching for help anywhere you can... people, books, internet, nature, art, hobbies, sitting in the warm sun ... Talking and sharing with others IRL and online too!\n\nI am going to make it and so will you!", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y619r/"}
