To be honest I'm not sure quite how serious i was, or how much i was just looking for attention, but i took a good 2000mg of ibuprofen after drinking a good amount. The utter emptiness, followed by the moment of regret and grief when it really settled in what i did, followed by a lot of inner strength emerging, and a hell of a lot of crying...\n\nWell, i wish i could say i really did start getting better after that night but i dropped out after a break down a month and a half later.
