What if getting kicked out of school for being suicidal prompted the student to try again on campus? Then you'd not only have the dead student on campus that you didn't want in the first place, but it'd also be pretty obvious that the school partially encouraged it by kicking them out for being suicidal. \n\nHow about, I dunno, assisting the student with counseling resources or academic assistance if needed? I can't really imagine how making someone's future a thousand times less certain in a moment of crisis is gonna help them to stop feeling suicidal.
