The constant drowning thoughts that would leave me emotionally shaken seemed like they were just how I thought. \n\nAn example was I was always afraid to go to sleep at night because I was sure I would die in my sleep and thought nothing could be worse than that. As a result I would keep myself awake until 5+ in the morning just so I wouldn't go to sleep and die in my sleep. If I was in bed and felt myself drifting off I would jerk myself awake again.\n\nUltimately I decided to try medicine for my anxiety, just to see if something would help. I literally could not contemplate a state of being in which this wasn't the only way I thought, but I needed to try something. A couple medicines felt very off putting, very much like happy-pills where you're giddy about nothing. Finally I found one that seemed to not do anything. But the thoughts and constant state of panic just weren't there anymore. I went off of it for a bit and started feeling the exact same thoughts and constant panic. It let me be me, but without the anxiety.\n\nJust because something is in the brain doesn't mean it composes you as a person. That default state of terrible feelings doesn't have to be the default state. Work at it with a good doctor and you can get yourself to a reasonable default state.
