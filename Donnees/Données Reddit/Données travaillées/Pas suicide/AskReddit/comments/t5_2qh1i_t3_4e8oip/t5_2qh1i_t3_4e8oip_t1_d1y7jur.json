In your opinion, is there a better phrase to use?\n\nWhile I've never had to battle with depression, (I guess you could say I got really lucky, it skipped me) I know several people, especially family members, who have fought with depression. I know how much of a toll it takes on someone, and I know that sometimes being lazy is easier than trying to do. \n\nI guess it's because I've never experienced anything like it before, but I've always liked \"it gets better.\" I feel like it's intent is to reassure people, and make it known to them that someone is looking out for them. Trying to tell them that this too shall pass. I want to be there for them, but it's very difficult when I've never had the very unpleasant experience of being depressed.
