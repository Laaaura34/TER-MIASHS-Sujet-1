Coming from someone whos gone through about 12 different medications the past 4/5 years ,its a bloody miracle when you find the right medicine. \n\n\nI dont have major depessive disorder, but I do have a very severe mood disorder (bipolar) . And brain chemistry wise they are similar, similar enough for me to recommend an actual mood stabilizer. \n\nLithium has literally turned my life around. It keeps me from bad lows or highs. It basically chills out some of neuron cell activity. Which chills out how shitty your brain wants to be.\n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yplsx/"}
