Right after that, I got a girlfriend who dumped me 2 weeks in to the relationship. She waited 5 months to tell me it was due to her friends opinions on her having a boyfriend. I haven't been the same since. I have no friends and am just tired of it all. I'm sick of people destroying me and using me for their sick enjoyment.
