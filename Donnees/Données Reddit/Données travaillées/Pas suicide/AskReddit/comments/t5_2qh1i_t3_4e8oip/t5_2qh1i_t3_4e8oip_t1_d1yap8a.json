She tried to take a bunch of pills to overdose. I remember trying to take care of her after and get her to the hospital, but she refused to go. I remember her being absolutely out of it, confused, she said she was numb, and she had a lot of blurry vision. The next day she tried to go to work and wasn't much better, and her coworker finally made her to go the hospital. She ended up getting 5150'd and they released her the next day, didn't pump her stomach either. \n\nI do remember her being very upset, angry, and depressed that she didn't die and she ended up being 5150'd. But a few weeks later she found out she was pregnant. Thankfully, after having her first daughter she's been doing a lot better. She also had a son about a year later. She's been getting help for her anxiety and depression and I've seen a huge change in her. \n\nI can tell you that it was one of the worst experienced of my life, it was heart breaking. I felt not good enough to help her, I felt helpless. I know there was nothing you could do, but when my best friend, who is like my sister, tried to die on purpose... It was just horrible. \n\nIt has now been about 4 years since the incident, and we lost a friend due to liver disease. After that she came to me an apologized for ever putting me through that grief and she would never do it again. I, of course, appreciated the gesture but told her she didn't have to apologize. I understood she was in pain. But I am so happy she still walks the earth and is better. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yap8a/"}
