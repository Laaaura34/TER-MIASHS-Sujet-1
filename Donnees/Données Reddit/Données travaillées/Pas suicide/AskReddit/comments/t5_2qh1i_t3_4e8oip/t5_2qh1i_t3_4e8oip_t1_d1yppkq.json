It must feel like a huge amount of responsibility for you both to be her mom's constant suicide watchers. Your girlfriend must feel so grateful to have your support.\nI still think a therapist is your best option. I suggest looking up low cost therapy/mental health centers in your area. If she talks to a therapist on the phone and the therapist realizes that she's in a state of crisis (she totally is), the therapist is ethically obligated to help as much as possible - whether it means seeing her immediately and lowering the fee, or referring her to someone she can afford to see. \nIf your girlfriend's mom is still resistant, a helpful question might be \"do you actually want to die? or do you just want the pain to stop?\" Chances are she'll say it's the latter (you mentioned she feels responsible for the daughter who's still in school.) If you and your gf can find the number of a therapist for her to call, and give her the suggestion calmly and gently, and stay in the room with her while she calls and makes the appointment, I think it could be very helpful.\nGood luck to you both. I admire your bravery and desire to help. Also your mom sounds like a badass.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yppkq/"}
