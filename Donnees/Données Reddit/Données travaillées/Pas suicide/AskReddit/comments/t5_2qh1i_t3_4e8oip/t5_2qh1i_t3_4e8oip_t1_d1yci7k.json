Like not bleeding the lines of air at all, and even then it's questionable.\n\nIf you start seeing multiple feet of air in the IV lines I'd bring it to the nurses attention, but chances are you wouldn't notice any issue still. So like myself, you already know you're safe, but can't help but fixate your attention to the small amount of air in the tubing. I'm the same way when I go for my Remicade every month. Mostly because it's interesting to me to watch the stuff get pumped into your body. And the air gives you a reference point.\n\nI was around 13 or 14 when chronic health issues caused me to get IV's regularly. During this time any little bubble in the tubing freaked me out. Thankfully my mother was a nurse as well, so she telling me the small amount of air was fine made me feel easier.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yci7k/"}
