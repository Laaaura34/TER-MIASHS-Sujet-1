Exactly as you described I breathed in water during the struggle, started choking and coughing which brought in more water. The thing is you don't really pay attention to that pain because at this point you're struggling so hard to get out of the water and eventually you black out. Luckily I somehow got dragged to the edge of the current and washed up on a rock. The real pain came from the vomit and gagging to get all the water out. 1/10 drowing sucks ass would not recommend.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6cf6/"}
