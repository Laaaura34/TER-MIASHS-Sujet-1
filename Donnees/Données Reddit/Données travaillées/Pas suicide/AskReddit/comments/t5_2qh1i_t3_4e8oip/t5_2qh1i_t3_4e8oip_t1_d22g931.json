Well hell, maybe your right, maybe I should just kill myself, to make you happy, because actually you're the one who is pushing someone else to hate themselves- you're the one who is making others feel awful for your selfish, immature emotions. \n\nAnd if what you wrote to me wasn't based on a purely emotional response because of pain in your life, then I don't mind recommending that you stay away from threads about suicide on Reddit, because you could cause them to feel far, far worse. \n\nAnd if it is, well then I'm sorry for your loss but the same thing applies, you will just push others to the same fate...", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d22g931/"}
