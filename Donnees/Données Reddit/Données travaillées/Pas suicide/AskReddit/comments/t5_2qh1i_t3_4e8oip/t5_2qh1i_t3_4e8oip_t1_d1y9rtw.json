I didn't bother to see what kind they were. I just grabbed them and downed them. I was in shock over something I had done. It was more of a I can't believe I did that, I should be punished moment than a clear cut I want to die moment. I had meant to slap my ex. Our daughter was right beside him. I pulled my hand back to slap him. I was really pissed off. In rage, my hand turned into a fist. He moved our daughter to the area the fist was aiming for. I almost hit her instead. I stopped myself just in time. \n\nHe said he was going to call the cops and report me for abuse. I was freaking out and took the pills. I guess I really didn't want to die. A couple minutes later, I told him what I had done. He took our daughter to our neighbors and drove me to the hospital. After my stomach was pumped, my first thoughts were I never want to do this again. I felt that way though because I hated the pump. Not a pleasant experience. That scared me enough to never do it again. Once I was thinking more clearly, I realized I didn't want to die because I didn't want my daughter to live with the knowledge her mother killed herself.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y9rtw/"}
