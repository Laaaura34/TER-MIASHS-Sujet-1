I remember (I was still very drugged) coming home from the hospital and thinking \"tomorrow I'll try again and pull it off.\" \n\nThankfully I didn't, bur for the next couple years I was still in a very bad place physically and mentally.\n\nIt's only been through eliminating the negative people in my life and allowing myself to get closer with people who love me (and encourage me to love myself!) and managing my anxiety with light medication that I've changed my mentality for the better, permanently. \n\nThanks for the kind words, friend. Hope all goes well in life for you. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yovaz/"}
