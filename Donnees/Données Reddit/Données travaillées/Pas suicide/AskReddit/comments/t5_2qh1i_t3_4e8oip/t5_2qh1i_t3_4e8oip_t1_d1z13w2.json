I attempted to poison myself with carbon monoxide in my car far in an isolate parking lot, far, far away.\n\nThe car I had at the time was shit and shut off because of a bad engine before I could finally succumb to the poisoning. But I remember I was incredibly hazy and confused. Like a drunk confusion. Disassociated. Eyes swollen as fuck.\n\nI drove home to see my best friend and mother in a panic (my best friend was my last call good-bye and my work informed my mother I rage quit my job and was very unsafe). For the first time my mom believed how serious I was about my depression and desire to die. And it took a while, but I got counseling and help.\n\nI wish I could tell you my first thought, but the only thought I can have right now is that I'm happy my car was a piece of shit and life gave me another chance.\n\nNow I'm married, a college grad, and doing really well, counseling those who struggle with depression through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1z13w2/"}
