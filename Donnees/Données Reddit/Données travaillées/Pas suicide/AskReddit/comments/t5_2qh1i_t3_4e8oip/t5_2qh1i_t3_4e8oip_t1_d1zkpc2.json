Not everyone has the right family to support them. You can't pick who you are related to. You can pick your friends bf/gf, and I promise you, all you need is one good person. Just one. \n\nIf they're not in your life now, they will be. I know it's hard to hear, because it's pretty much me saying \"You have to sit and wait\", but when you find them, they'll have your back. \n\nAlso, all of us here are ready to help and give whatever advice you need. I find sometimes that's it's helpful to have help from someone who has gone/is going through the same stuff as you. :)", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1zkpc2/"}
