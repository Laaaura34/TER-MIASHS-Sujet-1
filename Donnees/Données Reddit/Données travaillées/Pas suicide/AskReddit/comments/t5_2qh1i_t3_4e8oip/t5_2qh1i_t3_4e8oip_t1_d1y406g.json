I'm my mind, it boils down to a person's disposition on life in general. I have been in the same position; I'm only 21, but I've had a very long history of parental abuse and self harm. I didn't even want to change. And if I'm being honest, I don't know what happened to make me feel like I can actually live in life. Note that I didn't say be happy in life; I find that to be too bold a statement. But something happened to me after my darkest hour. I can't explain it. This is why I refuse to say the blanket \"it gets better\". It might, or honestly, might not. But now I can honestly say that it is worth a try.
