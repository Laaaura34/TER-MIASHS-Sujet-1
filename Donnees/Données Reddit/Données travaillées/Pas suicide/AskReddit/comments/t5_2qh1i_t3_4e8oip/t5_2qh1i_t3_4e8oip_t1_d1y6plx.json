I vowed that next time I tried it would be during the day; I wanted so badly to see and feel the sun again.\n\n- Horror and fear realizing that my parents would be the ones to find me. Or worse, my little brother.\n\n- Horror and fear at the thought that it might not work, and I would have to go school again the next day. (Incidentally, this exact fear is the sole reason I decided not to try and drown myself while on a school trip the following year.)\n\n- Relief, shame, fear, helplessness, hopelessness, desperation once I realized I would still live.\n\nI was 12; for the past 17 years I find myself thinking of that awful night at least once a day. I spent the following 10 years trapped in a vicious cycle of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. \n\nI am mostly better now, but I still have my bad days.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6plx/"}
