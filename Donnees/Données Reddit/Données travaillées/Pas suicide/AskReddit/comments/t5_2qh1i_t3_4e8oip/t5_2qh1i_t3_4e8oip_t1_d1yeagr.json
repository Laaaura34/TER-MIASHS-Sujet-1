I choose to withhold life saving treatment.\n\nWhen I woke up in the hospital and realized that I had been transported and then treated against my will, I was .... devastated. There is no other word. To think that you are at the finish line only to wake up at the starting line....\n\nAfter the disappointment came the anger. \n\nI had a valid living will and a healthcare proxy on file at the hospital and with my personal physician. The hospital knew about my living will and ignored it. They didn't misplace or overlook it. Hospital records show that they reviewed it and did not act on it.\n\nI feel strongly that they should have been charged with assault. But the District Attorney did not agree with me. \n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yeagr/"}
