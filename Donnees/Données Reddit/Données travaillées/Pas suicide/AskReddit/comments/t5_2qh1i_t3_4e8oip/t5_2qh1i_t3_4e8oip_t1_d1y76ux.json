Then someone finally noticed that my lips were blue and i was rushed off to resus. Thank you for the two black eyes, nurses.\n\nMostly i was embarrassed though. My last suicide attempt was a good few years ago now, I'm in therapy/recovery and doing well. I never want to go there again.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y76ux/"}
