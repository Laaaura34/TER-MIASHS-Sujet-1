Frequent (seemingly random)  crippling depression that I have managed for years. I was sitting in my chair watching a video and I my last thought was \"fuck it\". I won't go into details but I woke up on the floor with my face in a pool of vomit and a bad scar across my neck. Then came the realization that I failed. Cleaned up and put on a high collared shirt before going in to work. \n\n\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yizy7/"}
