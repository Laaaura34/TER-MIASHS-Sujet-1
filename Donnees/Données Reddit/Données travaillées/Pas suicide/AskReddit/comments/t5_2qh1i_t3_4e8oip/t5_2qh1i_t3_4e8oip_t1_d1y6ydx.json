I was going to write \"Please don't\", but that's not enough considering the seriousness of the situation.\n\nI've never actually tried but went through about a year of wanting to and thinking about it a lot.  I decided I owed myself a chance to get better, so I decided I'd get some counseling and give it a year and if I still felt the same then I'd do it (I don't actually think I could, but it doesn't stop feeling like you want to).  \n\nSo I ended up going to counseling for about 2 years - it wasn't the best but it did help me move past wanting to die.  \n\nMaybe you owe it to yourself to try, you deserve the chance to have a good life.\n\nWhatever you plan to do I'm sending you a hug, a big hug", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6ydx/"}
