I called it the kiss of death, much like a hickey, but one from the Reaper himself. I had to wear hoodies for the rest of the summer to cover it up. It also reconfirmed my thought that the rope I had was too weak. Only two or three people actually know what happened with why I was wearing hoodies in summer. I don't really know. I don't like to think about it too much.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7dey/"}
