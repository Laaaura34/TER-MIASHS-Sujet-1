I truly hope things get better for you and your family. It seems to me that there have been a series of unfortunate events that have led you to where you are and I may be wrong by that, but by the way I have seen you talk to others on here, I feel like you are able to connect with other people on a deeper level than a normal person would be able to. Do you enjoy helping people? I think that because of your experiences, you may be able to help others get through hard times and relate on a way that can show them that they aren't alone and that things can change. They don't always, which I get, but they can for most. \n\nAnd if I may ask, what is it that is keeping you here? Is it family or something? Because I feel like if its been going on this long and you've wanted it to end this long, there has to be something keeping you from it.
