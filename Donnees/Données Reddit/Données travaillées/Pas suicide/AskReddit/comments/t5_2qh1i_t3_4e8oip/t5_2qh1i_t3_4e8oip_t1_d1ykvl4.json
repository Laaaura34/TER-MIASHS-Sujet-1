I appreciate that. It took a lotttt of therapy and learning from plenty of other failed relationships to get here haha. The PTSD and the anxiety issues are still there, but I've learned how to maintain them. Have a great boyfriend who is very kind and supportive, but part of the reason we work is I was able to articulate all this to him and help him help me whenever I'm feeling depressed again. I'm never 100% cured or anything, but it's a good life now. \n\nThat said, another redditer suggested a letter, might go with that! The guy hides out on social media a lot so I feel like I have to respect that. Plus I feel like FB messages, emails, etc all demand a response, whereas a letter doesn't. I'm sure he would be happy to hear it all, it's my good ol fear of the worst that I'm not sure I'm ready for (him thinking I'm stirring up drama again or something of the sort).", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ykvl4/"}
