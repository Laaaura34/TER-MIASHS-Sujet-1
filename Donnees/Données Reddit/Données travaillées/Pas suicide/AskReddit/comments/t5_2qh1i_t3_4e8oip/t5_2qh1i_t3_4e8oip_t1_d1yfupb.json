I'll try doing that then. Fortunately, my friend is getting professional help but she says that it doesn't help all that much. I'm also one her only friends that she feels close to so I do feel quite a bit responsible as a friend to help her. I also want to ask if there was ever a time when you didn't want to talk to anyone and you wanted space from others for a while? I ask because I don't want to be an annoyance to her.\n\nAs for myself, I honestly feel that my compassion is the best thing I could give. I'm fortunate enough to be in a stable time in my life, so I genuinely want to help others as much as I can. Nothing brings me more joy than making any of my friends laugh and I think that is the greatest reward for my efforts. Thank you for the concern though.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yfupb/"}
