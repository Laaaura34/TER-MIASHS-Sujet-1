I'm in a similar situation... Been trying to heal for 10-15 years without much luck, so I know what that's like. But I don't think about suicide much anymore, not like I did in the first few years. I think it's because I've glimpsed improvements a few times, so that has given me hope I can find the right key to unlock my life again. I would probably think differently if I hadn't had those glimpses. The biggest one was from ayahuasca (in Peru)... It cured me of everything for about 8 hours, but was unfortunately not permanent. I did meet people who were permanently cured of depression there though. It's no cakewalk (it was so traumatic that I haven't been able to convince myself to go back), but worth looking into if you've tried everything else.
