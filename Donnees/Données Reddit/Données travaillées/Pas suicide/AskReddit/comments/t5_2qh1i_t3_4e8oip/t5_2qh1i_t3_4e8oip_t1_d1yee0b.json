Thank you for sharing your stories, and for providing hope for someone who might need it.\n\nA childhood friend of mine just tried to commit suicide last week. Jumped off a 10 story building. Broke every bone in her body and is in an induced coma. We're not sure if she will make it. But I hope that if she does She is able to find the peace and love that she needs to help herself.\n\nSending all you survivors, the non-survivors and the tempted so much love right now.\n\nYou are loved, even if by a stranger. Best wishes with your futures.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yee0b/"}
