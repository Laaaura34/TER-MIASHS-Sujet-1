Apparently my dog starting barking something fierce when she saw me go in, so my neighbour jumped the wall to check it out and saw me. He jumped in and pulled me out. But I'd already drowned at this point. I don't know how long I was dead. Anywhere between 2-7 minutes. He revived me and my first thought was \"Fuck, I fucked up. I'm so pathetic I can't even off myself correctly.\" \n\nMany years later I am now mvery glad that I fucked that up! :) ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yc24b/"}
