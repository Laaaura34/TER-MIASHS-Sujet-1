There doesn't have to be a reason to do that, you can just do those things because you feel like it. So it might seem like your life is a waste and there won't be anything changing that (and you surely can't expect your life to change from one day to the other), but for me it's always worth giving it a shot, because you've good chances that you won't get another life better than the one you're having, if it turns out that there is no heaven/hell/reincarnation/70virgins. But instead, if you work hard and get some determination, your life could be absolutely amazing and satisfying in a couple of months/years.\n\nNo one is gonna help you though.. And this sucks.\n\nThen there's all that other crap about making your close ones suffer and bla bla bla..", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yejxh/"}
