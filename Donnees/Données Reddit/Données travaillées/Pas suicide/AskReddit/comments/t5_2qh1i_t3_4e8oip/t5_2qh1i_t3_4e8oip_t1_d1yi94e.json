I woke up in the hospital with my boyfriend next to me. I remember thinking about how fucking sorry I was for the pain I was putting him through. He couldn't even look at me. Then when my parents showed up and started screaming at him and ripping into me, I remember just desperately wanting to leave the hospital and wanting them out of my room. I honestly hated them the whole time I was there, but I was too weak to even speak, let alone argue with them and tell them to leave.\n\nWhen they moved me from the medical side of the ER to the psychiatric side, the only thing I could think about was how deeply I regretted what I'd done. The psych ER was the worst fucking place I've ever been. I didn't even feel human. All I could think for the 12 hours before they moved me to a real psych ward was, \"if I hadn't taken those fucking pills, I would be curled up in my boyfriend's arms right now instead of in a 6'x8' whitewashed room with no sheets or pillows and Nick Jr on the TV while listening to some girl shrieking and running down the halls outside my door\"\n\nNever again. If I get to that dark place again, I'm admitting myself to a psych ward because that place was actually incredibly helpful. But fuck dying and fuck the ER.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yi94e/"}
