Thank you for that last line because I don't hear \"I love you enough\" and it's something I belive this world needs. For what's it's worth I love you too and I'm happy that people like you exist. I'm depressed and have given up hope on humanity, society, and most popular culture but it's unique individuals like yourself that remind me there are still beautiful things and people left in this world to discover. Honestly from the bottom of my heart, thank you. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6bku/"}
