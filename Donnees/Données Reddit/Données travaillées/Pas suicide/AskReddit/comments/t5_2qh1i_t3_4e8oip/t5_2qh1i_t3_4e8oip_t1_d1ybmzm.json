I changed my mind, drove to the hospital, and had my stomach pumped. The doctors told me I was going to be sent to a nut house. I said nope, I noped the fuck on out of there, snuck out, and drove off. \n\nI ended up hiding at a friend's house for a while, then the cops showed up in force. My parents had told the police where I'd likely scampered off to. My friends panicked and flushed a shit-load of weed. I tried to sneak out, got handcuffed, and taken back to the hospital. \n\nThis time they handcuffed me to the bed while a sheriff patrolled the hallways. I wanted to try my luck by just wheeling out the bed. Anyway, a sheriff took me to a nut house in the nearby metropolitan area. He was really nice and tried to make me think about the good in life. Not what I expected from him, since he sounded and looked like a total redneck. \n\nBecause I was a suicide risk, I had to sleep in the hallway for three days under constant observation. Saw some good fights, pretty girls, complete psychos. \n\ntl;dr yes, they can handcuff you to a bed.
