It always just made me hate myself more for lacking the bravery to follow through (and as many people will tell you, suicide is truly not the coward's path: it takes guts to follow through)\n\nMost recently, I had been having rather frequent (a few times daily) suicidal thoughts, and was planning on jumping out of my 4th story window. These days, the main thing keeping me from killing myself is the thought of the poor person who would find me. I really don't want to traumatize some random college student (I live on campus). The last thing they need to see is one of their peers splattered on the ground.\n\nAnyways, I tried opening my window only to realize that there's a mechanism preventing it from opening more than 3 or 4 inches. Part of me was relieved, but another part was disappointed to lose my most convenient method.\n\nI've tried a few therapists but it hasn't worked for me. I want to try medication but I can't afford it myself and my parents don't believe in prescription medication so they won't help me get it. They've also tried sending me to a few non-traditional \"psychologists\" that, as you may predict, did not do anything except destroy what little trust I had in my parents.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yhq3u/"}
