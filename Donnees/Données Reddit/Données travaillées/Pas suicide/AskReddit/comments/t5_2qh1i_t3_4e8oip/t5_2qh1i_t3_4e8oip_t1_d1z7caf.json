I've attempted suicide a few times (I'm 17) but they were kind of half assed because I was scared.. For a good reason. The most recent time I decided I needed to go. I thought I was a hindrance to everyone I knew and it was better if I died. I swallowed my newly refilled bottle of venlafaxine pills and lied down. I fell asleep instantly. I woke up about 4 hours later and I could barely move. I heard my favorite pet, my gecko I've had for four years, jump on the glass and look at me. I realized how loved I was then. My twin brother was asleep in the room down the hall.. I thought about what I would feel if he did this to himself. I half limped half crawled into my parents room and woke them up to tell them what happened. I have never seen my father cry. My brother held me in the back seat of the car on the way to the hospital. I was able to leave after three days. The doctors said they were surprised I didn't go into a coma or worse. Ever since then, I have never attempted. I am proud to say that I am happy to be alive. Guys, it is never worth it. You are loved. There is ALWAYS a way to get through something.\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1z7caf/"}
