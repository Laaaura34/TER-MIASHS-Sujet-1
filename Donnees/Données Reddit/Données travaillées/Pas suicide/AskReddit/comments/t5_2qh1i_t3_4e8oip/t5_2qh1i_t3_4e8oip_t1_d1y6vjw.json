I couldn't control it and I just hoped I'd go back to sleep and the pills would take effect. The next morning I woke up and the first thing I did was start to cry. It had been another thing I failed at, another thing I wasn't good enough at doing. It just further solidified to me that I was a fuck up.\n\nThat day was pretty rough for me - I went to school and acted like nothing happened and during my free period called a suicide hotline. Honestly, it took a lot of will and strength not to try again that night and I'm happy I didn't. Basically, the way I looked at it was I'd hit rock bottom. This was going to be my lowest low and there wouldn't be anything that would make me feel worse, so I may as well give life another shot. \n\nThis was about 7 years ago now and I've put my suicidal thoughts behind me, but it was a struggle. My first psychiatrist diagnosed me as bipolar and I was on the wrong medication up until college when I had to take a medical leave my second semester and finally saw a new doctor when I got home. \n\nA couple years ago I got off anti-depressants entirely and I think that's something people don't really realize you can do (I know my mom didn't understand it). Sure, it's not for everyone, but in my case I was in a completely different situation at the time of my attempt and the worst of my depression. When I got off my meds I was probably 5 years older, going to college, around a new group of people, even in a different state. To me, it was worth it to go through a monitored withdrawal to see if I could function normally without them. That said, there is nothing wrong with people who do need to continue to take them for longer periods of time.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6vjw/"}
