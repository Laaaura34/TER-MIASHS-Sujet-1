I was hallucinating hard, and I remember talking to a cop, vaguely remember the pain of the nurses inserting a catheter, then nothing. I remember waking up strapped to the bed in the ICU very confused, wondering why my parents were there and why my friends were asleep on the floor. I finally came to full awareness when no one happened to be in the hospital room with me, late Sunday night, and cried so hard the nurse came in and gave me something to put me to sleep. To answer the question explicitly, once I came to afterwards I knew I was going to have to stay in a psych ward for at least a week, and that there was no avoiding what felt like my \"punishment\" for failing to successfully commit suicide. I kept thinking, \"If my life wasn't fucked before this, it sure as hell is now. I'll never have the chance to try again because now everyone is aware that I'm suicidal.\"", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d2013o0/"}
