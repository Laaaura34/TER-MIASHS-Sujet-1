In those cases, it's treated the same way as any physical restraint. \nThe order must be renewed by the physician every 24 hours or sooner, the restraints must allow *some* movement (though, of course not enough to grab any lines/tubes), they must be loosened and removed from each limb for 5 minutes every 2 hours, the nurse must document continued need and CSM of the sites of restraint and distal to them every 2 hours, and if they are removed for *any* reason other than CSM checks (ie, bathing, visiting) , the physician must write a new order to have them replaced. We also almost always 99%+ use padded cotton/cloth restraints as opposed to the leathers & buckles of days past. Even using a lap belt for an elderly patient who is trying to sit upright, eating, who uses it for postural reasons needs an order. All orders get reviewed by the department managers and Ethics committees daily. We try to staff a 1:1 sitter instead, if possible. Not always possible, especially in places like the ER. \nRestraints are a tricky thing... They are only ever used if a patient is a danger to themself or others, and reassessed frequently.\n\n\nEDIT: clarity", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ylghg/"}
