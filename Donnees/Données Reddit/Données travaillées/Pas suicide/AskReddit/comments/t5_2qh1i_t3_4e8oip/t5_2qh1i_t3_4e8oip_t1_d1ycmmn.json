A few months later, I fell into a much darker depression, and tried again. When I woke up from that, I honestly just wanted to die. All I could think about was how I could end my life. Probably the darkest day in my life, to be honest. If anyone out there is suffering the way I am, please message me. I'd be more than happy to talk with you.
