Counselors found out through a friend of mine that I was potentially planning to do it-- but even to this day I don't know what I would've done had the day came. I had planned to OD in the woods on OTC meds.\n\nMy first thought when they brought me in was that I knew I couldn't do it now no matter how I felt and that I just wanted to go back to class and forget that I had ever even thought about it. It also basically solidified me internalizing a lot of stuff that I still do to this day, because my friends still worry about me hurting myself more than 10 years later.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7k6a/"}
