Opiates and opioids are all basically the same. (Except codeine, which is a prodrug.)\n\nThis is most obvious when you're looking at addiction: someone who's addicted to one of them can switch to almost any other one with no ill effects. They all work by the same mechanism, target the same receptors, and have roughly the same effects on those receptors. There's not really any such thing as a \"heroin addict\" or an \"oxycontin addict\" or a \"morphine addict\"; they're all just addicted to opiates and opioids as a class.\n\nThere are differences in potency, in oral bioavailability, in the ratio of pain relief to respiratory depression, and in the metabolism pathways. All of those are relevant when a doctor is choosing which drug to prescribe for a particular patient.\n\nBut they're all minor differences. Desomorphine only differs from diamorphine by a few atoms and some numbers on a chart. Those differences make it less attractive, but not dangerous, not qualitatively different, not comparable to ethanol.\n\nKrokodil is only dangerous because it's manufactured by a particularly shitty kitchen-chemistry technique that leaves the final product full of horrible toxic crap. The drug itself is fine, though of course not recommended for recreational use.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y965r/"}
