There was no seeing the light or anything like that. It was so ordinary and plain. Something everyone goes through. I'm not saying everyone has a failed suicide attempt, but it just felt like one of those moments in life that everyone goes through, so it's not exactly something you bookmark in life. And I guess that lack of feeling made me bookmark it and remember.\n\n\nI had just tried to kill myself and all I could think was that it didn't work. You'd think there would be something, but there was nothing. Looking back, it makes me really sad. I cared so little about my life and I wasn't even in high school.\n\n\nIf I had succeeded, I wouldn't have made all these memories I now hold dear. So many things have happened since then and I would've missed it. That makes me wish I had cared after seeing I was still alive. Why couldn't I have seen that I was given another shot? Instead, I tried again months after that and still saw my life as insignificant. I felt that way for a long time after and still do at times even now, but...I don't want to die. There's still too much to do and I have someone I want to experience life with - with the baby I'm going to bring into the world soon. \n\n\nEven if I wasn't then, I'm so grateful now that I failed. Things got easier and life got better. I'm so happy I didn't miss it.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6t09/"}
