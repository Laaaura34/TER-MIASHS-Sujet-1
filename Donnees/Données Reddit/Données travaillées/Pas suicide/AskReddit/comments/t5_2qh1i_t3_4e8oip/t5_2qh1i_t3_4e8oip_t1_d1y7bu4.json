At the time my only regret was that I didn't wear turtle necks or a hoodie or something because when my Mom saw the marks on my neck I just wanted to kill myself all over again. Looking back, she was annoying for a long time about it but it has shaped me into who I am today and I don't fault anyone but myself for the things I did a earlier in my life. I'm in college now and it's time to move on. I haven't had those thoughts for a long time because I know the pain it would bring my family and that I am loved here. I'm sorry for anyone still hurting in this thread. My prayers and thoughts go out to you. ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y7bu4/"}
