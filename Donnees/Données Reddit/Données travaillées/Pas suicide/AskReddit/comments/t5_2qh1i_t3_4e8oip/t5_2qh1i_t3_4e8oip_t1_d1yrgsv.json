I was living with my ex boyfriend due to our lease not being up for another couple of months. He came home and started yelling about what the noise was. I had been drunk the night before and spilled a bottle of rum on his iMac keyboard, it broke and was just making some noise on the computer. I had no recollection of what happened because I got drunk and took a handful of his prescribed sleeping pills. \n\nApparently it wasn't enough. I told him what I did and he was more angry that I took his pills as opposed to being worried about my health. \n\nI spent the rest of the day with two close friends being in physical and mental pain, angry that I had failed. \n\nBut after a while, and to this day, I'm so happy I survived.
