I used a belt and hung it on a plant holder hook in the ceiling if the living room. I stood on the edge of the couch and there was a short time of deciding, but it was very short. I let go. It was uncomfortable, but it didnt really hurt. I passed out. I woke up on the floor because the plant holder hook had broken out of the ceiling. \n\nI thought I was dead because I actually felt good and it was hard to move or open my eyes. When I did, my dog was laying next to me. I couldn't believe that I just did it. I couldn't believe that I wanted to leave my dog and my family. I can't believe that I almost succeeded.\n\nThe next thought was a bit grotesque. That was so easy. So practically painless. If I decide to do this again, this is definitely the way I will choose to do it.\n\nThe final thought was that I needed to tell my mom. I needed help.
