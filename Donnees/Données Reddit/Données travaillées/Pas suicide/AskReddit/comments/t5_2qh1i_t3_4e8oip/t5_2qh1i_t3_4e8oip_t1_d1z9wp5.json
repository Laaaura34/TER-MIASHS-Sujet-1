In order to keep myself from going into a severe low, I tried to bring my blood sugars up as quickly as possible (with chocolate and soda), and for as long as possible (with the Chinese food).\n\nAs for why I didn't call an ambulance, I didn't want my mom to know that I tried to off myself. I'm sure if she found out it would have devastated her. Looking back I'm sure I could have told the ambulance about mixing up my insulins, but I didn't really think that far ahead at the time", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1z9wp5/"}
