However, as a person who never really had issues with their parents, I have a hard time understanding the \"cut them out\" mindset.  I mean I get that it happens and there are a few valid reasons for doing so, but it doesn't help me.  I don't berate my friend for doing it since his mom has said and done some really hurtful things, but it still doesn't fully compute for me.\n\nThe most helpful explanation he gave me was this: *\"I guess you've always felt your parents loved you, had good will and wanted what was best for you, right? Yeah. Well, my dad was like that, but my mom never was.\"*  (his dad is 10 years passed)", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1yi9le/"}
