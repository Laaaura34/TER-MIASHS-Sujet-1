I joked a lot, and made sure my arms were covered. Like a lot of other people who commented, I felt extremely groggy and I don't think I even totally processed what happened until a week later. \n\nEvery day I kept everything bottled up, and I only told my best friend. He was extremely worried and especially upset because I tried to kill myself on his birthday. I mostly remember thinking every day that I was so upset that it didn't work, and I wish I had cut deeper. I told myself that 'next time' it would work. \n\nAbout a week later, I got in a fight with my mom, and ended up confessing that I had attempted suicide and also said that I wish she got an abortion. \n\nShe drove six hours in the middle of the night from New Jersey to Pennsylvania, and I am grateful she did. I stayed home that day and I was going to attempt again. She took me to the hospital and I signed myself in for a week. \n\nIt was one of the best and worst experiences of my life, and I am still learning to cope with my emotions. When I got back from the hospital, my mom made me move to New Jersey with her and the rest of my family moved across the country. My friend lives in New Jersey as well, and he has been a major support system. I could never thank him enough, and I still hope that I can be happy and find meaning to myself in the world.
