I struggle with low points pretty consistently, with less and less ups between. \n\nWhile I've entertained the concept of suicide, I've never personally felt any compulsion towards it, and I've never seen a reason not living would be better than living. \n\nI want to serve in the military as a naval rescue diver or something similar, and this has been pretty much the sole reason I've avoided talking to a professional, as any mental diagnosis would disqualify from service. Also, my parents are vehemently opposed to any involvement with any branch of any military, and dealing with the transition out from being sheltered by my parents will be stressful to say the least. \n\nThe last 3 or so years of my life have made me feel more and more incapable of becoming an independent adult, and has made me question my mental health more than I would if I had just distanced myself from my father when I started realizing our relationship was holding me down.
