My boyfriend also suffers from ptsd and I ended up sitting on the floor on the other side of the locked door while he had a shot gun and fired it off not once but twice. It miss fired because of sand in the bag it was being kept in. It's rough being on either side of that door. I'm sorry for what you're going through. I've seen it first hand happen to the person I love most in this world. \n\nEdit: floor not door twice. Silly phone.
