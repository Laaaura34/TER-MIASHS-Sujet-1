Everyone was going to be angry at me now that they knew what I'd done.\n\nThe doctor was kind enough to have me on no visitors for a while. Only doctors and nurses, who were all very very kind to me. I couldn't look most of them in the face when they came in. I felt embarrassed. Ashamed. Normal people want to live, right? The doctor, two therapists, and a nurse assured me that my family and friends wouldn't hate me or be angry. They'd maybe be confused or a little sad, but they'd be supportive.\n\n\nThe saddest part?\n\nI was right. They did all hate me. *all*.\nDid wonders for my depression, let me tell you!\n", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6wks/"}
