You've gone through an awful time within your own mind, and instead of becoming bitter, or selfish, you've told someone that their happiness makes you happy.

I hope you have many years of happiness too, fellow friend :)", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y6msu/"}
