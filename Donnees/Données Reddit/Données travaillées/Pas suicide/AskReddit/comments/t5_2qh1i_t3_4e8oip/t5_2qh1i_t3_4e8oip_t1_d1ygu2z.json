I went to bed hoping I wouldn't wake up. When my mom woke me up in the morning I was confused and really sad. The next day at work (I work for my dad) and when I saw him I said hi and immediately went into the bathroom and cried I was 20. My dad has been working 14 hour days 6 days a week for one reason and one reason only. To support me and my mom. And realizing I tried to give up on him killed me on the inside. Through out the I cried atleast once an hour. Then I started thinking about my other relatives and my cousin at the time was only 8 and looks up to me like an older brother. I imagined my uncle at my funeral trying to explain to my cousin why I  did it and why I was dead. That hit me really hard. \n\nA few years later I tried again. But this time on sleeping pills. I took 50 sleeping pills (2400mg). 1200mg is considered extremely dangerous. And 50 pills was considered attempt suicide. So I took the pills and was on the brink of death and I knew it. I went almost completely blind. I couldn't see 2 feet in front of me and I couldn't walk more than 2 steps without collapsing to the ground. I couldn't see or feel anything. all I could hear was my dead weight body hitting the ground every time I fell. I managed to make it up the stairs and went to bed. I decided I'm either going to wake up or not wake up. I went or bed. \n\nI woke up and I was forever grateful to be alive. Ever since then I've been a much happier person I haven't thought about suicide since and I used to think about it all the time", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1ygu2z/"}
