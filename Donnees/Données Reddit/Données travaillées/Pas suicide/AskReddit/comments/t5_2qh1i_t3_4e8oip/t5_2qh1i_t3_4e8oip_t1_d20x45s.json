I stole two bottles of pills from my dad's cabinet, and after 5th period at school that day, I swallowed them all. I felt I was storming into the front line of battle. I was a vulnerable solider, unarmed and disoriented, but I knew could no longer hide in the bushes, I must strike fast and hard, all the while knowing that I would be struck down, like Butch Cassidy. But at least the waiting would end.
