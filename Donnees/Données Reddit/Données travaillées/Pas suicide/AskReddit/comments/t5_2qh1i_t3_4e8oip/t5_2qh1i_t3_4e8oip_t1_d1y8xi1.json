You know when you lose a tooth and put it milk? I was trying to figure out where I could get a lot of milk to keep my arm in. It took me a minute before it clicked - this isn't normal, why am I bleeding. Then all the aches and pain hit me. Worst of all were the emotions - felt like getting hit by a train all over again. Not a fun time, but my arm's reattached and I'm actually wearing the watch now. It was a gift from my sister originally, and I'm glad I can keep it as a reminder that almost telling me \"Life keeps going\". I apologize in advance if this sounded insensitive - it certainly is a depressing, scarring time for anyone survivor. Just so happened in my case to be sort of... different.
