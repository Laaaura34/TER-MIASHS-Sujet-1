I feel so stuck, fuck having a childhood. I'd rather of made straight As. I'd trade all my childhood friends to be successful. i don't even see them or want to because they probably pity me and think I'm lame as fuck. I stopped using social media because my life sucks dick and I'm tired of seeing everyone I know graduate and date and party when I don't have any money to do that or social circles. I hate this shit. I'm supposed to a a janitor or work in fast food my whole life? Nah I'm not going for that shit. I'd rather die. My best friend is a white D1 athlete best player on the team ,in the south and he'd ask me why I don't hangout with him, I always make up excuses. He gets swarmed in pussy and is super popular . 300+ likes a status/ post  you understand what I'm saying...  I'd be so out of place ,I feel so inadequate, he grew up rich and worked super hard and earned it and I haven't accomplished shit an I'm black and poor as heel. Like he's such a good person he doesn't realize that we are incredibly different. Those rich southern Greek life kids don't want to be around my black ass. It's crazy but it's just small shit like that that eats me alive inside.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/4e8oip/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_your/d1y713p/"}
