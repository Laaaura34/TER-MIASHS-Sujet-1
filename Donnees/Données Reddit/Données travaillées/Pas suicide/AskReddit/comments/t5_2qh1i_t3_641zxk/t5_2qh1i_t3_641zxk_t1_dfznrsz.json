I know that the thoughts that come into your head when losing the love of the life and the future together (especially if you witness your love die) are not just sad, you want to follow, to switch off the pain.\nI do not know much myself, since it's been a bit less than 2 weeks for me, but I am sure **you have to stop contacting** people that bring you down and blame you. In my case, my partner's parents were trying to push the blame on me or hurt me at any occasion possible. They were clearly the ones blamed in his last note, and  I know for sure they were the main reason this had happened, even though I try not to think of it as people causing suicide, but rather causing circumstances for his decision. Long story short, I've broken off the contact. All the info about the running tasks such as seeing the body, the funeral, getting his things runs through a trusted friend of him and me. Maybe you could do it too.\nI hope it helps a bit. I know it's hard and you don't want to live, I won't tell you to live either. I'll just say what I say to myself: being hurt is normal. Our body can deal with it. Good luck and please take care of yourself.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/641zxk/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_or_is_your/dfznrsz/"}
