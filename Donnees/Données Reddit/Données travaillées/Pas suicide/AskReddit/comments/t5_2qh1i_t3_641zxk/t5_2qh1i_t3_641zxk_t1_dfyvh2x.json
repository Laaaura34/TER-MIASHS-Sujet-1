I was completely wasted trying to cope (that never works well) and tried shooting myself. three times I pulled the trigger but each of the bullets failed to fire. I guess I must be stupid because it took me three attempts to realise maybe this isn't a good idea. Since that night I haven't had a single alcoholic drink, and I've had my guns stored at a friends place (precaution), and I've just spent time working on me. why I let things get so far out of hand, and trying to fix my mindset to make sure it doesn't happen again.\n\nEverything takes time. 4 months later things still hurt a lot but slowly other things start to take its place. you begin thinking about what happened less and less as new things come. Big thing to remember is don't shut yourself away. as much as you may want to, as antisocial and introverted you may be, spend time with your friends, meet new friends, or just go outside, get some sun.\n\nbest of luck my friend.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/641zxk/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_or_is_your/dfyvh2x/"}
