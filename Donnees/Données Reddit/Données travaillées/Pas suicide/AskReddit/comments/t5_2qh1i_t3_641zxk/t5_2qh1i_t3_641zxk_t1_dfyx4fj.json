He was 25 and the absolute love of my life. We were still together and had been for two years. The last year of our relationship was long distance. I was in NYC and he was in Ireland. He had been riddled with depression and addiction and told me he was contemplating it the night before but I thought I talked him out of it. The next morning our favorite band dropped a new album and I went to post it on his Facebook wall. Once I logged into Facebook that's how I found out.\n\nI wasn't able to attend the funeral since it was in Ireland. It's been 4 1/2 years and I still haven't been able to get out to Dublin to see his family. \n\nWhen you lose the love of your life the coping part never gets better but it does get a whole lot easier. The first year was rough, I tried to take my own life but failed ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4uodku/serious_whats_the_closest_youve_ever_been_to_dying/d5rgemn/)). The second year I started to try dating other people, I got help but my therapist ended up relocating. The following years after that was a lot of figuring it out on my own...keeping busy, crying, allowing myself to grieve etc.  \n\nOne thing that is important to remember is there is no time limit when it comes to your recovery. Take your time. I'm here if anyone ever wants to chat!", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/641zxk/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_was_or_is_your/dfyx4fj/"}
