It was too painful I gave up. That\u2019s when I figured that I should use another technique.\n\nThird attempt: I tried to overdose on my adhd pills. My heartbeat was super fast but I ended up surviving. I spent the night talking with online friends, they tried to convince me to go to the hospital but eventually gave up and just made sure I wasn\u2019t dying. \n\nFourth attempt: I tried to overdose on Tylenol. I took way above the lethal dose for adults while being 14 but threw up 5 hours after taking it so I was just super sick for 2 weeks and might have liver damage. This attempt made me so repulsed by the mere thought of another overdose attempt so if I try again it\u2019s probably going to be by slicing my wrist. I\u2019m getting used to cut deep on my arm so my wrist shouldn\u2019t be too much trouble.\n\nI\u2019m starting to get better but I\u2019m still suicidal just a lot less than before and I\u2019m trying to stop cutting.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/ogneq0/suicide_attempt_survivors_of_reddit_what_is_your/h4kbvxs/"}
