With mental health problems it is in a way unavoidable. The last couple of hours before my attempt was spent in enough emotional pain that the only things I could think of is killing myself to stop the pain. The reason I didn't do it earlier is the thoughts of how it would affect my family, and friends whom I may had conflicts with before (and would blame themselves forever).   \nThen the seconds and occasionally minutes pass by as the pain becomes more and more intense. As your world collapses and feel like you are drowning, it becomes intense enough that you would gladly strangle a bag of puppies if it would take it away. After that point regardless how much empathy you have for your loved ones, escaping pain becomes a priority (or at least in my case).", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/dx6y66/suicide_survivors_of_reddit_whats_kept_you_alive/f7oqecl/"}
