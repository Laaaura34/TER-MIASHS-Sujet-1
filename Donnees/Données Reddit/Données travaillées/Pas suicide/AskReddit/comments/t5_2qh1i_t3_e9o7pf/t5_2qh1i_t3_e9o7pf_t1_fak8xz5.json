Been on meds and in therapy ever since. Still very suicidal every single day. Depression is a disease, it never leaves some people... doesn\u2019t appear that it\u2019ll ever leave me no matter how much I honestly comply with trying different meds and coping strategies and all that.\n\nSo I\u2019m not really sure what you mean by \u201cokay\u201d. Am I going to attempt it again? No. So sure I guess I\u2019m okay. Do I consider life to be worth living? Nope, this shit sucks and is brutal. I\u2019ve just accepted that I must\u2019ve done some fucked up shit in a previous life and am destined to suffer. I\u2019ve accepted it and also accepted that I\u2019m too dumb/incompetent to actually be able to successfully commit suicide so it\u2019s not worth the effort to try. It\u2019s also not worth dealing with the resulting health problems and pain that come with a failed attempt. \n\nSo I just go through the motions and do all the shit my doctors tell me to do and wait til whenever my time comes.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/e9o7pf/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_whats_your/fak8xz5/"}
