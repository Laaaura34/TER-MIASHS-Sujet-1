A month ago I had to leave my girlfriend. I missed her. Found out she lied to me for our whole relationship. It fucking killed me. 3 of my best friends saw me shoot myself. They stayed with me and kept me calm ish while EMS was on its way. Surgeons saved my life. I regret everything and I'm thankful to be alive. I really hate myself, even more than before for what I put my friends and family through, for wasting the vision in my left eye, for being so fucking weak and opting out out over such stupid shit. So much regret.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/feyqef/serious_suicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_drove/fqzityz/"}
