When I have hard times I try to remember where I was before and that if I made it through those times I can make it through anything. Now when I see asks like this I try to answer them because I know sometimes people who are hurting come across them. I never thought I could know love and happiness and have a family. \n\nRight now if anyone reading this is hurting, go immediately and Google your favorite animal. I don't know why, but it worked for me in the past. Yes, I know it sounds stupid. Watching cute animal videos takes the edge off just enough to where I would give myself permission to live one more day. Have some sleep and then eat your favorite food the next day. Let yourself have that. After some sleep and a good meal, I usually realized I wasn't ready to die yet. \n\nIf that doesn't work, you can PM me. I know I'm an internet stranger but I do care. Hope this helps someone! ", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/7c5u3e/serioussuicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_happened/dpno8is/"}
