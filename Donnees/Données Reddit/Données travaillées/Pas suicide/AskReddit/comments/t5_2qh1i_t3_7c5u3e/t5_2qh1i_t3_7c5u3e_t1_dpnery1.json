Luckily I didn\u2019t get very far, and was stopped from doing anything very quickly. After the incident, I went to therapy and took medication to treat my depression to make sure the incident wouldn\u2019t happen again. I was shaken up for a long while, and had a hard time communicating with old friends as they knew what happened and didn\u2019t really know how to deal with it for some reason. After all the craziness, I was able to find hope, and new friends and family who believed in me.  It feels really great to be alive today, because I love my life so much.", "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/7c5u3e/serioussuicide_survivors_of_reddit_what_happened/dpnery1/"}
