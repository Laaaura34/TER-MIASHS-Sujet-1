ADHD?\n\nAt bedtime my phone keeps me up too late! It\u2019s 1:07 AM as I\u2019m typing this. I have to be at work for 7:00 AM. I\u2019ve been doing this for months. I don\u2019t know how to stop. It feels like addiction, because I know my brain and body are begging me to go to sleep.\n\nThe only thing that gets me to get to sleep eventually is that I HAVE to get to work on time. There comes a point usually around 2:00 AM where I\u2019m like: ALIGHT! Enough\u2019s enough! I need to get at least a few hours.\n\nIt\u2019s painful. It\u2019s sad. And it\u2019s getting dangerous. I notice I bump into things all the time at work because I\u2019m so sleep deprived. Probably not wise to drive either.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s strange too is that I\u2019ll be sleepy all day at work, get home and still stay up that late. Going for hour long walks doesn\u2019t help.\n\nWhat should I do?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt1ep1/my_phone_is_literally_killing_me_i_need_help/", "title": "My phone is literally killing me.
