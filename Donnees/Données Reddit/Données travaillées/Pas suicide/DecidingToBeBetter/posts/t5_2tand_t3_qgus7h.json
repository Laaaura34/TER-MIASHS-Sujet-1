I would keep it all to myself because I was just a kid what the fuck did I know about that shit? Plus my mom probably wouldn\u2019t have believed me or I would never be able to see my siblings cause they stayed with my father (side-note I\u2019m not going to go much into detail on this part but I was harmed by my stepbrother and another I\u2019m not to proud to admit) & the only person I felt safe with in some way was my blood-brother but nowadays that isn\u2019t going well\u2026. He told me something similar happened to him while we were in the car with his mom who was disappointed to hear what her other son had done to people. Also after my stay there when I returned a few weekends later my brother didn\u2019t talk to me neither looked in my direction and never speaks to me now like wtf dude that really ticks me off (I noticed big changes he\u2019s now more feminine acting, I think to myself maybe he thinks I\u2019ll be mad he\u2019s gay or something.) then theirs me shy or just untrusting of others & broken with drugs to numb the pain cause therapy ain\u2019t working or anything besides that & I think I should maybe call quits so I can finally be free.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgus7h/im_at_the_point_where_quitting_seems_to_be_the/", "title": "Im at the point where quitting seems to be the only option.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Significant-Ad8278", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 179, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635335067, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgus7h/im_at_the_point_where_quitting_seems_to_be_the/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437379.61359, "replies_charged": false}
