It\u2019s not going well, and I\u2019ve realized it\u2019s because I don\u2019t actually value myself enough to advocate for my needs. Have been in therapy for years with limited (but some) growth. \n\nI grew up in a home environment where it was beneficial for me to shelve my own wants and needs in favor of my parent\u2019s. I\u2019ve always viewed myself as a nuisance and as taking up too much space; this self-concept made me a very good child, but it\u2019s totally maladaptive as an adult. \n\nI know the things I need to say and do, the self-talk I need to give myself, but at my core I just can\u2019t seem believe I\u2019m allowed to have wants and needs. As a result, I freeze, panic, and over-compromise constantly to keep the peace with others and make them happy. That approach usually works in the short-term, but I end up feeling frustrated and walked on in the long-term\u2014especially because I know it\u2019s my fault for not speaking up! I\u2019m the only one that can change my life, but how can I truly convince myself that I\u2019m not being selfish?\n\nTL;DR: I want to improve myself, but have difficulty wanting good things for myself/believing I deserve them. Self-sabotage is familiar, but also making me miserable.
