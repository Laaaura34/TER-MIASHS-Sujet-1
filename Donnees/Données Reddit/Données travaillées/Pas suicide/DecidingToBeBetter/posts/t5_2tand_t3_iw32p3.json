And it is both of our jobs to focus our energy on where we have power, meaning only in our own lives. \n\nWe\u2019re so often taught that it\u2019s a disgrace to be \u201cself-ish\u201d and misidentify taking actions, setting boundaries, and saying no for our own well-being as being a selfish thing to do. I\u2019m now recognizing that being selfish really only means having an ill intent & taking wrongful actions towards others for my own gain. Selfish is an act from the ego, while taking action for yourself first is an act of self-love & from the soul. \n\nSelfish is not saying yes to yourself and no to others. It is not taking action that will disappoint others when you have your own growth & well-being in mind. It\u2019s time to reframe what we believe being selfish is because we have a lot of people walking around (hi, me) thinking that having their own best interest at heart is somehow wrong & that we need to people please in order to be \u201cgood\u201d. \n\nI need to put my own needs before the ones of those around me in order to serve us all better. It is an act of love. \n\nWanted to send this message to anyone who needs to hear it right now, because I know I totally need this reminder.\n\nIt feels good to feel whole again because I\u2019m taking care of me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iw32p3/its_time_to_take_care_of_you_first/", "title": "It\u2019s time to take care of you first.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "erinpanzarella", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 43, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1600558368, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iw32p3/its_time_to_take_care_of_you_first/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438463.6397057, "replies_charged": false}
