You cannot have a world that works, you can't have an organization, a marriage, a relationship, a life that works, except on the premise of self-responsibility. \"\n - Nathaniel Branden", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kyift8/something_to_think_about/", "title": "Something to think about.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "KaizerKrauser", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1610801620, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kyift8/something_to_think_about/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438459.6488273, "replies_charged": false}
