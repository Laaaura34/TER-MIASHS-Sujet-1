My dad and mom moved to America and I stayed in China with my grandparents for a few years. I felt abandoned. In the states, I moved a lot for my dad\u2019s job so there were many times when I didn\u2019t have many great friends. Doing life and fitting in always felt like an uphill battle. I wasn\u2019t really good at too many things.. I had so many insecurities and inner pains I tried to bury.\n\nBy high school and college, I was able to channel a lot of my insecurities and traumas into people pleasing. I was GOOD at making people like me because I had figured out the algorithm. I became addicted to approval and affirmation from others because I lacked that in my childhood. I filled those voids with social media likes and maximizing my social circles. I used alcohol and partying to escape reality multiple times a week.\n\nNow that i\u2019m 26... I realize that i\u2019ve wasted so much time chasing empty things in order to \u201cheal\u201d and overcompensate for my childhood pains. I passed and pushed aside potential deep and meaningful relationships because the idea of committing to one person scared me. I didn\u2019t develop any hobbies because the only thing I wanted to focus on was finding ways to get other people to like me. I\u2019m still not close to my family... and I don\u2019t feel like many of my friends genuinely understand me either.\n\nI know that by writing this out, I can begin change and the healing process. I can and I will find purpose in this life. The beauty of life is that you can continue to transform and recreate yourself whenever you realize your present self no longer serves you.\n\nI wanted to get this off my chest and close this chapter in my life.\nI\u2019m sick of living for others, and i\u2019m sick of letting my past define me.\n\nIt\u2019s time to wake up. It\u2019s time to find purpose. It\u2019s time to fall in love. It\u2019s time to stop being a cynical child.\n\nEdit: Wow did not expect this to blow up. Thank you guys for all the love during these dark covid times. I will respond more individually when i feel better. Happy holidays! \nAlso I see some \u201cbro\u201d and \u201cgirl\u201d comments so just wanted clarify that I am\nmale. \ud83d\ude02", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kh4dq4/ive_wasted_the_last_10_years_of_my_life_chasing/", "title": "I\u2019ve wasted the last 10 years of my life chasing empty things and I\u2019m ready to start over.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "PayrollPrince", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2006, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1608504999, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kh4dq4/ive_wasted_the_last_10_years_of_my_life_chasing/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435402.8219597, "replies_charged": false}
