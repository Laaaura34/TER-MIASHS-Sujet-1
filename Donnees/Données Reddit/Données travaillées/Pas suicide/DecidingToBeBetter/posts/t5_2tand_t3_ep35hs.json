Now that everyone is a little older, and has more money, coke has become the focus of anything we do. Any day of the week, though addiction is adamantly denied. I don\u2019t want this life anymore, and after 2 years of trying to surreptitiously back out of the group, I have finally pulled the plug. \n\nSuffice it to say, they are not letting me go without a fight. Passively leaving wasn\u2019t an option. I\u2019m anxious about the ensuing arguments, but optimistic about my future.\n\nEDIT: thank you so much for all your kind and supportive words. They\u2019ve really been such a help this morning.
