They say that when you stop complaining you have a positive effect on the world and that what this post I dexided to do before bed last night seems to have done. \n\nAs for my day yesterday things went well and maybe it was easier, Not as many triggers to complain about.  So today maybe I'll be tested more, but seeing all these responses has put it in me to keep it up.\n\nDay 2: I owe redditors from this sub a big thank you.  Because of all the comments I doubled down my efforts to NOT complain for a 2nd day.  \nIt was a good day.  I feel really good.  I did honk and cuss at a truck on the way to work though, but I will not dwell on it.  I will just do better tomorrow.  \nI noticed people were more pleasant to me, but I also get the vibe people are wondering why I am so quiet.
