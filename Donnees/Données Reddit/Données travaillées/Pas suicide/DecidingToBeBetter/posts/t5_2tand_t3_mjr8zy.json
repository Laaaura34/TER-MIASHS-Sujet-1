I also fall prey to perfectionism, analysis paralysis, Information overload and FOMO.\n\nThe problem is that these counterproductive thinking patterns prevent me from attempting to overcome them. It\u2019s Catch-22. There are countless resources on overcoming perfectionism and overthinking, which is overwhelming, so avoid it entirely. \n\nI can\u2019t move forward in life because there is too many options in how I can move forward. For example, I neglect my health because I feel lost in the sea of information on diet, exercise and my ailments. And I haven\u2019t even begun tackling a big financial decision I should have made months ago. \n\nI question everything. I can\u2019t be certain of anything. I\u2019m paralyzed and I feel like I\u2019m losing my mind. I ponder pointless questions like \u201cIs there objective truth?\u201d or \u201cHow can I be sure of anything?\u201c or \u201cWhy do anything?\u201d.\n\nMy problem is not that I\u2019m unable to push myself to do things, but that I\u2019m unable to convince myself that an action is correct. I even discard personal experience e.g. I know that good sleep and going on walks make me feel a lot better, but it\u2019s not enough for my brain to be convinced that I shall focus on building these habits. \n\nAfter my only close friend, who could motivate me to act in spite of my indecisiveness, had left me, I just gave up on attempting to better myself. Even since then, I couldn\u2019t convince myself to do anything other taking care of hygiene. \n\nHow do I find the basis, the justification for doing anything? How do I become convinced, certain of something? It seems like I cannot prevent doubt from originating and I cannot force myself to believe something. \n\nI saw two therapists so far, but they were of little help. Please, internet strangers, give me some pointers.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mjr8zy/overthinking_is_ruining_my_life/", "title": "Overthinking is ruining my life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "overthinkoverthink", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 65, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617519915, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mjr8zy/overthinking_is_ruining_my_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437511.4260032, "replies_charged": false}
