The new things i enjoy are yoga, reading, podcasts, and some sort of exercise. Which is cute and all but, i every day i wake up at 5 and try to do my routine and clean my room, make breakfast etc and do all the other stuff EXCEPT for studying. (I am in year 12 going year 13 in Uk which means that i have to study in the summer because i didn't do that great) and i've been trying and lost motivation. How do i actually get to studying because i feel overwhelmed and annoyed, and life is so boring i keep doing the same things and i don't like it :(", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p67new/every_day_feels_the_same_help_me/", "title": "Every Day feels the same, help me!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Tiny_Smile_", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629218731, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p67new/every_day_feels_the_same_help_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436460.752344, "replies_charged": false}
