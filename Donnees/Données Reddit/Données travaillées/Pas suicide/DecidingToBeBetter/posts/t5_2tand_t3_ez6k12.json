I have so far been very cool, but they took all the pain of reading everything I have posted on reddit from past 20 days to prove that what I say is not creditworthy. I have reported their comments which seemed too personally offensive. For almost a week I have stayed anger free and I am keen on being polite when I deal with rude self centered people. But this fellow redditor is testing my limits. Please suggest ways in which I can ignore their mockery. I don't want to block them or leave the sub, I just want them to exist so I can come over mockery and Ignorance, I usually get angry on such people very easily, but they exist everywhere and I need to learn to deal with it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ez6k12/a_fellow_redditor_is_calling_my_ideology_shit/", "title": "A fellow redditor is calling my ideology shit!
