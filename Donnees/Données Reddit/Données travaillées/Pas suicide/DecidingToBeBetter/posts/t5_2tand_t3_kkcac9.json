I'm 22 years old, I lost my teenagers to depression and I never, never managed to do something, my parents are getting old, I want them to see my success, but I don't know what to do, how to do it. I did not manage to enter university a couple of years ago, I did not fulfill some fantasies (none), I like (I love) skateboarding but out of shame I never practiced it, I want to start again at 22 but I think it is very complicated, I look to my cousins, friends, and colleagues of my age and they are already very ahead, I think it will be impossible for me to reach them, please help me I need advice, from experiences it helps seriously. I am literally bankrupt and I want to start living, make up my lost years, I have the energy and the ambition but I don't know how to do it. If you got here seriously thank you, I hope God bless you, happy holidays.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kkcac9/its_too_late_to_start_is_better_say_goodbye_yall/", "title": "Its too late to start, is better say goodbye y'all...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "YourNativeBruh", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 22, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1608955928, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kkcac9/its_too_late_to_start_is_better_say_goodbye_yall/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435570.552532, "replies_charged": false}
