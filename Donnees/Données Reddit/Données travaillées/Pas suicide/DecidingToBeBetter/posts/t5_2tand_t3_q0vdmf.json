Not only is that less healthy for me but also so much more expensive. Tonight at around 7pm I was wondering if I should get groceries and cook or just get take out and play games. Usually if it\u2019s this late, I opt for the latter telling myself that it\u2019s too late to cook. But tonight, I told myself that I still have a good 5 hours left of the day and it\u2019s up to me on how to spend those precious hours. So I bought ingredients, made a big portion of dinner so that it\u2019ll last me a few days and now I\u2019m sitting at my desk enjoying my home cooked meal. And it\u2019s only 9:30pm. It feels really good knowing that I spent my time well. Just wanted to share, thanks for taking the time to read this!\n\nEdit: thank you everyone for the nice comments!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0vdmf/i_went_grocery_shopping_and_made_dinner_tonight/", "title": "I went grocery shopping and made dinner tonight instead of getting take out and playing video games", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "nayponn", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 427, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633310664, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0vdmf/i_went_grocery_shopping_and_made_dinner_tonight/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438378.9724436, "replies_charged": false}
