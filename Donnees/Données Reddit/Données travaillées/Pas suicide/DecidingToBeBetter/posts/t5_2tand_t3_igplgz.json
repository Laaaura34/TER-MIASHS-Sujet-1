I started my NoFap journey and have completed 30 days and today's my birthday so this is my birthday gift to me! It isn't easy to quit old habits and the blue balls phase was difficult, bit of exercise helped. Even my friends used to say that I watch too much porn and eventually I lost lot of them because of the way porn and beating my meat made me into. It wasn't easy to get past the 7th day mark I reset the counter twice.. now its been more than 30 days and I ain't stopping now!
