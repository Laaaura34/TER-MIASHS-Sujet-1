I can tell today is going to be a mad rush at work, but I hope to get my haircut in the afternoon. I really hate getting haircuts its so awkward. I have found that I am managing my anger and toxicity better as I continue to focus on myself. I played bocce last night, which to my surprise I have a natural ability for lol. I think I will stick with it as a new hobby. \n\nToday I meditate on the thought that there is always more room to maneuver than you think. The concept that if you do everything, from preparation to execution, things would turn out in your favor. I think this relates quite heavily to my new journey here, how with focus and preparation and a effort, I can make the changes I want to see in my life. To be a better friend, lover, and family member.  I am still holding out on texting my girlfriend, especially when she is at work. The obsession with responding or staying in contact is not healthy and only yields poor outcomes. I am very much in love with this girl and I want to continue to keep things fresh and alive.\n\nToday I will workout back and Bi's in the gym. I am excited to see what I can do. I will update later in the day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oz8gb0/day_4_deciding_to_be_better/", "title": "Day 4: Deciding to be better", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Ohboyburgers", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628262290, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oz8gb0/day_4_deciding_to_be_better/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436501.823736, "replies_charged": false}
