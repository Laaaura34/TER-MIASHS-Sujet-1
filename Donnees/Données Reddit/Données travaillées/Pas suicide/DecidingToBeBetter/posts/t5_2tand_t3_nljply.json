It's been a year since we had to spend time with her because of the pandemic and there is a little monkey-wrench in the dynamics of the relationship as I just had my first baby so somehow I find her even more irritating. I want to have a pleasant experience for me, my husband and our newborn, and I worry that the heart on my sleeve will give me away. I've never been good in dealing with people I don't care for  -not at work or my personal life. Generally I try to avoid them and these types of situations but that's not an option here. What are some tricks, tactics, self-talk and other coping tips you might have before and during this engagement that can help all my annoyances just roll off my back?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nljply/how_to_deal_with_aholes_when_there_is_no_escaping/", "title": "How to deal with a-holes when there is no escaping?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Last-Oven5807", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622042841, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nljply/how_to_deal_with_aholes_when_there_is_no_escaping/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437670.2416728, "replies_charged": false}
