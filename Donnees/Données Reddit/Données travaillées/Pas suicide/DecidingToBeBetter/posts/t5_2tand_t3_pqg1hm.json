I have OCD too so this question pop up quite often and then start the cycle of comparison to others and self degradation, it is frustrating. The point is, I want a strong  conviction that I can clear the exam in 2022 and will work hard for it and give it my all. How do I deal with the this thought or how do I make my conviction stronger !?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pqg1hm/need_advice_for_the_constant_thought_of_not/", "title": "Need Advice for the constant thought of not making it in exam during a particular year", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ExcellentSprinkles72", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631940611, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pqg1hm/need_advice_for_the_constant_thought_of_not/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436015.798326, "replies_charged": false}
