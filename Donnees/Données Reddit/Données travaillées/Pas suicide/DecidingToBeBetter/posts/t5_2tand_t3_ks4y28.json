Focusing on problems can have benefits, but being solution-focused has been shown to be *way* more beneficial. By focusing on solutions instead of problems, we turn problems into opportunities, a much more positive and productive way of looking at obstacles than focusing on problems. By viewing problems as opportunities, we give ourselves the chance to build new skills and develop new attitudes about them. It makes us more flexible and creative, enabling us to realize that there are many ways to look at negative events in our lives, and this helps us create *even more solutions*.\n\nWhen I made this change, it didn\u2019t make problems go away, but it gave me a new lease on them, and more freedom to frame them and deal with them than when I was focused on the problem itself. When you focus on problems, there\u2019s only one view: the problem. When you focus on solutions, there are *infinite* views, and there is potential in that, which comes with a deep sense of liberation and power.\n\nSo instead of focusing so much of your time and energy on the problem itself, I\u2019d suggest spending a bit of that on \u201cOkay, but what can I do about it?\u201d You may be surprised how quickly your mood changes when you do.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ks4y28/solutionfocused/", "title": "Solution-focused", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LCBrianC", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1609991376, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ks4y28/solutionfocused/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435474.604582, "replies_charged": false}
