Meanwhile, I have 4 credits from the one class out of 7 I\u2019ve taken since then. If I didn\u2019t want to take the college route, I wouldn\u2019t care about being behind. \n\nBut I want to be educated, I want a higher paying job, I want to follow my intellectual calling and maybe get into law, or business, or some type of research. And learning, having academic peers, anything about school except having to be consistent is enjoyable to me. The problem is that college demands consistence, and I have been barely skating by since my sophomore year of high school. In fact, the only times I\u2019ve been successful in school were before sophomore year when I believed I had to do well in school to survive as an adult, and the second half of high school into the beginning of college when I abused Adderall. \n\nThe past year I\u2019ve worked to travel and that quick, tangible gratification works well for me. Except now I refuse to work less to focus on school and make anything but travel my priority. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I have the time, I just ultimately don\u2019t care enough to manage. \n\nI feel like this might be one of those things you have to just shut up about and do or cope with the consequences, but if anyone has advice I am extremely open!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oi5him/motivation_for_college/", "title": "Motivation for college", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "nefertariisded", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626013901, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oi5him/motivation_for_college/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436465.8610182, "replies_charged": false}
