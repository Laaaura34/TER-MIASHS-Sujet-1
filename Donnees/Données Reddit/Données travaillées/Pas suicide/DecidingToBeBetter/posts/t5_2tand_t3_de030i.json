Most people are pleasant and our transaction/conversation goes smoothly and efficiently. However, I do receive the occasional pain in the ass customer as I\u2019m sure everyone in the customer service field is familiar with. I get cussed at a lot people use harsh language with me they get frustrated with me as though everything is my fault. I get talked down to almost every day. I have a tendency to take the frustration and discomfort home with me even after I clock out. I find myself being upset about the altercations hours after I leave work thinking about the situations and getting worked up all over again. I want to be able to leave work at work and enjoy my time when I\u2019m off the clock but the separation is difficult for me does anyone have any tips or tricks on how to leave work in the workplace?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/de030i/i_take_work_home_with_me_and_have_a_hard_time/", "title": "I take work home with me and have a hard time letting go of the bad days", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "vampyqueenn", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1570347282, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/de030i/i_take_work_home_with_me_and_have_a_hard_time/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437704.0489585, "replies_charged": false}
