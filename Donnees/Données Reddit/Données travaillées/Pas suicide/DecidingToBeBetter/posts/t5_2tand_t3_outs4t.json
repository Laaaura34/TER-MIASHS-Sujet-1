When this happens I usually go for a walk and I can do it for hours a day. And it's not that there are no things that I like, I love playing chess, solving puzzles, juggling, skateboarding, playing the piano ...\n\nBut when I start with any of these activities I really feel that it is nothing important, that they are shitty activities that do not get me anywhere, yet another hobby that is not useful.\n\nThis lack of purpose towards something bigger is what causes me suffering, I want to build a life that I am proud of and it certainly is not spending all day playing chess. But to this day I still do not know what that purpose is that will make me feel fulfilled.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/outs4t/i_do_not_have_any_porpuse/", "title": "I do not have any porpuse", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Algoro97", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 32, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627678683, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/outs4t/i_do_not_have_any_porpuse/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436703.6791651, "replies_charged": false}
