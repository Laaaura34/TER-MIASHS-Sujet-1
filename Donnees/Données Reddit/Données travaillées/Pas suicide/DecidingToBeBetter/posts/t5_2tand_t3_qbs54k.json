If it\u2019s something let\u2019s do it, but if it\u2019s not, or your unsure then I don\u2019t have time for this\u2026 which sounds like a healthy way to look at dating\u2026 \nexcept that I\u2019ve realised I have a fearful avoiding attachment style which causes me to be moody and push and pull emotionally both in my own head and my partner/person I\u2019m dating. And this has happened with 2 people I\u2019ve seen potential with but it gets full on and I\u2019ve scared them. \n\nI had some trauma from my childhood/teens which has lead to PTSD. I have done all the work I possibly can to move through that trauma. However I do think that some of the above mentioned is related to some abandonment issues I have. \n\nI want to make it clear than I can be very detached from  my partner and never control them, just have a over bearing need to control my life and if I don\u2019t feel in control I go to pieces. \n\nOther noteworthy things; I\u2019m secure in my life, grateful for the privileged  life I\u2019m creating for my kids and I, don\u2019t desire to get married or have more kids, but would like to find a partner to grow old with. \n\nSo I am deciding to be better and I would love recommendations for books, podcasts or other media/reading that could possibly help me start to let go of control and work on moving to a more \u201csecure attachment t style\u201d while I wait to get into therapy. \n\nTL:DR I would like recommendations for podcasts/books etc to help me move to a more \u201csecure attachment\u201d style from a fearful avoidant, and to learn to chill and not have to control every minute of every day in my life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbs54k/i_want_to_learn_how_to_be_more_secure_and_chilled/", "title": "I want to learn how to be more secure and chilled in dating.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "what-evsy", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634701312, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbs54k/i_want_to_learn_how_to_be_more_secure_and_chilled/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436446.4954076, "replies_charged": false}
