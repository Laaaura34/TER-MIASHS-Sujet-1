Now that's bad, and I know that. But it's what has taken me to where I am today. My childhood was not good and fear of being stuck there got me motivated to get through university and get out. I was homeless for lack of a better term with my partner for a year, couch hopping with friends until we found secure jobs. Once that was done we bought a house together. Decided to be better together. \nBut now the obstacle comes. I'm comfortable. I dont know what to do in this comfort. And I don't feel fulfilled in it. My self care has gone down, my interest in hobbies and activities is not existent. I want better, I know I can do better. But I am completely stuck on what to do now that I'm not running from something. \nI hope this post makes sense.
