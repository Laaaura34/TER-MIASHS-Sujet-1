He called me a liar, manipulative, shitty, said I use my depression to make myself the victim and how I use my depression as an excuse for my shitty and petty behavior. He said I never acknowledge it or try to work on it. He said I'm selfish and I only do what is beneficial for myself.\n\nI honestly wasn't shocked. I was just really sad. I didn't even know I was that bad of a person. I knew I had things to work through, but I dont think I am manipulative or a liar. I didn't realize I had been playing the victim or anything like that. I've also never had anyone else say that I am this way. I've actually had people tell me that I am the exact opposite of these things. I was thinking it was just because of our past relationship and he was just venting everything he had been wanting to say to me. But now I'm not so sure. I feel like absolute shit. And I already really struggle with my self-image.\n\nHow do I be a better person? Like I said, i thought i was already getting better at these faults, but then he said I wasn't even trying. So I'm trying to figure out how to get even better. I dont want to be who he says I am.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gm6adb/how_to_be_a_better_person/", "title": "How to be a better person?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "yellowsb4hoes", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1589824048, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gm6adb/how_to_be_a_better_person/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435502.2547612, "replies_charged": false}
