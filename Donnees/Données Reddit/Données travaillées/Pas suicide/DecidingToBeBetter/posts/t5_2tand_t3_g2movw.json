I was sad, anxious and messed up I really didn't think I would do anything about it. So it was announced that the lockdown is going to continue for the next 21 days. I've read that in 21 days you make or break a habit. \nSo I made a list of things I wanted to everyday.\nThe list included things like meditation, workout, learning how to play a guitar and few other things.\nEveryday I write down atleast 10 task I've to complete and I'll tick the box once it's done, the satisfaction that I get after doing this is priceless.\nNow I workout twice a day and meditate around thrice a day. My anxiety is reduced to a great extent, I feel very healthy mentally. Plus today I noticed that I am in the starting stage of developing abs.\nIt's all about being consistent.\nToday is day 24 and I am already looking forward to completing my tasks.\nI decided to be better. :)\n\nEdit 1 : Thank you for the gold, stranger. This is my first gold and I can't tell you how amazing I feel.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g2movw/i_am_following_a_routine_from_past_23_days_and_i/", "title": "I am following a routine from past 23 days and I feel so healthy both mentally and physically.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "theforcedreader", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2451, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1587068151, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g2movw/i_am_following_a_routine_from_past_23_days_and_i/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438112.860805, "replies_charged": false}
