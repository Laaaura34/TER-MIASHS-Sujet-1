I grew up upper middle class with parents that coddled me. I was allowed to quit when things got tough. That has led to me never wanting or knowing how to push through things. I would say I'm pretty much programmed to quit.\n\nThere are a lot of other things I need to work on, but the one affecting my life the most right now is my lack of grit. It's actually terrifying. When I've only trusted quitting for my entire life, then try to take something seriously and apply myself, I just kind of laugh. Like, it doesn't even seem plausible.\n\nWhen I get the money (in about a month or two) I will start seeing a therapist because I know it will help. But as for right now I don't know what to do. Any advice or tips? Or anyone in the same boat?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8i6x0e/im_programmed_to_give_up/", "title": "I'm programmed to give up.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Portland28", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1525880126, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8i6x0e/im_programmed_to_give_up/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438297.645752, "replies_charged": false}
