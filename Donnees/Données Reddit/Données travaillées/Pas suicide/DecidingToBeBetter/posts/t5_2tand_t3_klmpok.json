This lasted for a few years \n\nToday at 18 I try my best to show emotion but I feel like I literally cannot. If I open a gift I can only smile and say thank you, I can't gasp or have my mouth agape. I don't ever have big reactions to anything \n\nI think my case is particularly bad as everyone I know well has said I don't show much emotion at least once and am still repeatedly told that.\n\nSometimes it's really hard to express myself. I still feel every emotion and I've improved a lot but I still can show only so much. Can I fix this or is it irreversible?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/klmpok/i_cannot_show_emotions_other_than_happiness_and/", "title": "I cannot show emotions other than happiness and anger", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "HairyRevolver", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1609144699, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/klmpok/i_cannot_show_emotions_other_than_happiness_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436879.9664118, "replies_charged": false}
