For as long as I can remember my father(47m) especially after I turned 11 started calling me fat you need to work out and what not I\u2019m very sensitive and easily cry and afraid of him coz he\u2019s abused me my sister(20f) when she was younger and hit my mother he thinks he\u2019s better than all for context my parents are In an arranged marriage and unfortunately in my country more than 60% of the women undergo domestic violence and divorced women are looked down upon. \n\n\nMy sister when in 7th literally was ghosted by my father and slapped because she was fat I was in 4th at the time and my mother and sister hid it from me because they wanted to protect me. (My father has a bad temper too when my maternal grandmother died my mother was pregnant with me and she was crying in her room and he came in and said \u201cshut the fuck up or I\u2019ll send you back to your home \u201c ).I have been harassed for my appearance to the point I loathe how I look and don\u2019t even like to get my pictures clicked (I\u2019m shaped like a diamond I\u2019m fat ofc but I\u2019m relatively tall so you can\u2019t really tell I\u2019m that fat but I do have a big butt ) my father over the years has called me a cow and what not he has forced me to run (ik I sound entitled but I don\u2019t like physical activity as in running I\u2019m fine with cycling but that too with friends and I used to be a national player in a sport and a medalist too ) I have always thought if I cease to exist will everyone be happy quite honestly the only thing stopping me is my sister and mother who have endured much more than me I have always suffered in silence because my father does this shit because it\u2019s his way of telling he \u201cloves\u201d us. \n\nRecently I started diet I have lost 25 pounds in the past 5 months I\u2019m far from looking what people consider fit but the main reason I started this diet was because I didn\u2019t want it to become a health issue I\u2019m still overweight but it won\u2019t cause a problem in terms of health. Today my father who thinks he has a great sense of humour once again tried to start make me run by saying \u201cI have taken it upon myself that I will make him run from tomorrow\u201d at this point I just want to give up is physical appearance that important I know I\u2019m not the best in terms of personality but I would like to think I\u2019m kind I am on the last straw does this world really Kithe people like us at this point I genuinely believe I won\u2019t ever find anyone who would love me and I just want to end this. \n\n\n\nI just want to be done with him when I grow up but I\u2019m genuinely concerned about my mother I know for a fact she wouldn\u2019t leave him even thought he is a toxic motherfucker to the point when a guy randomly texted my mother he made it look like she was cheating on him oh and I\u2019m agnostic but all my life religion has been forced on me and I just fucking know if I tell my parents this they\u2019ll abuse me verbally and quite possibly physically not my mother she\u2019s kind af she might try to change my mind but if I stand my ground she\u2019ll let it be", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nsy83c/ive_considered_suicide_atleast_once_a_month_ever/", "title": "I\u2019ve considered suicide atleast once a month ever since I was 12", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "BikeAmbitious9662", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622906963, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nsy83c/ive_considered_suicide_atleast_once_a_month_ever/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437990.354847, "replies_charged": false}
