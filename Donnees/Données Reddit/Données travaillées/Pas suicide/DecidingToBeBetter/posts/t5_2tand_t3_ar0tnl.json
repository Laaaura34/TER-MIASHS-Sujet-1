I really don't want to let these next eight months slip by me, I'm young, and I want to experience what the world has to offer, and I want to push myself. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm in reasonably good health, I meditate, I learn quick, and I don't need a lot to be ok. Basically, the next eight months for me are a blank slate, and I want to really live them. If you're younger than me and have ideas for what you want to do, please let me know. If you're walking the walk also let me know.  Here's the one I'm really looking for though:\n\nSay you're perhaps older than me, by any amount. Say you could come back to my position. I'm youthful, I would say reasonably good-looking, I am introverted and want to work on my people skills but I'm witty and can be charming. I'm also much more unattached to physical objects and comforts than most at my point, and I know I don't need a lot to be ok, as I mentioned. \n\nSay you were me, what would you do? I've got a real hunger for just living this part of my life to the fullest!\n\nDon't hold back, crazy and far out there, no matter where, I want to hear it!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ar0tnl/what_would_you_do_if_you_were_nineteen_healthy/", "title": "What would you do if you were nineteen, healthy, not tied down, and free?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "initiate_psychonaut", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1550262219, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ar0tnl/what_would_you_do_if_you_were_nineteen_healthy/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435835.4743917, "replies_charged": false}
