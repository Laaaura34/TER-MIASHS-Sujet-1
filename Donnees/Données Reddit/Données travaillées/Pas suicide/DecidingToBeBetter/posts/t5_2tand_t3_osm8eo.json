I imagined that everyone who looked at me saw me as \u201cdepressed person\u201d, rather than \u201ckind person\u201d or \u201cgenerous person\u201d or \u201cfunny person\u201d. But that\u2019s really no way to live. For the first time in a long time, I want to get better.\n\nI\u2019m these past few months I\u2019ve been doing all the right things. I\u2019m seeing a therapist and I\u2019ve started taking medication. I\u2019m trying to exercise more regularly and to eat healthier/better (not perfect, just better). I even found a new job that suits me better. I\u2019m just really scared that it won\u2019t work, and that all this effort will be for nothing. My therapist assures me that over time, taking these small steps will help me find my path. I\u2019m still skeptical and impatient. It doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m making  any real progress. Regardless, I will keep moving forward. There could be a beautiful life waiting for me. If it\u2019s out there, I want to find it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/osm8eo/im_trying_to_do_all_the_right_things/", "title": "I\u2019m trying to do all the right things", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ClassyNerdLady", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 15, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627390325, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/osm8eo/im_trying_to_do_all_the_right_things/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435373.5624707, "replies_charged": false}
