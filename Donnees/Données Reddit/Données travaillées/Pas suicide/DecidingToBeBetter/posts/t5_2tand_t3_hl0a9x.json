My daily baisis used to be waking up, playing videogames and studying. I would even treat my loved ones with indiference. I knew deep down that I loved them and that they were the ones that made my mind\u00b4s grey clouds fade. I put a really hard thought on this behaviour of mine and I concluded one of the most awful things you can do for the ones you love and for YOURSELF, is to suppress your feelings and emotions. I used to do this.  I used to have a really hard time expressing happiness, sadness, and, most importantly, love. Gladly, I realised, on time, that this was the thing that would lead me to my doom. It may sound really obvious, but when you find yourself in a state of mind where nothing else matters but your school/professional success, this idea gets so blurred it feels like the most stupid thing to do. Concluding, I can say that the first big step in becomming a better person is to emotionally free yourself. Don\u00b4t be afraid to show your emotions and you\u00b4ll be gifted with lovely smiles and the feel you can achieve anything. Emotions are as natural as water, be as expressive as the ocean.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hl0a9x/youve_got_to_free_yourself_from_your_emotional/", "title": "You\u00b4ve got to free yourself from your emotional prison", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "cowpoke442", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 85, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1593852968, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hl0a9x/youve_got_to_free_yourself_from_your_emotional/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436874.549145, "replies_charged": false}
