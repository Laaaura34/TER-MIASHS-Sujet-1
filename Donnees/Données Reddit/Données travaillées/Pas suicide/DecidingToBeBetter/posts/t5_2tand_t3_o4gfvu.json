I know how many calories I should be eating and I do try to maintain that during the day but I end up binging at night and instead of calorie deficit, I end up overeating. Maybe it's some sort of eating disorder, not sure. Also, I think I'm addicted to milk. It's really bad for my health, I'm milk intolerant but I don't know why I can't stop having it after meals most of the time or as a snack. I don't know what to do. I want to stop being overweight, live a healthy lifestyle, have a good relationship with food and not beat myself up constantly over food and weight. All suggestions and advice is welcome.
