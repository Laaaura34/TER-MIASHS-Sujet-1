My counselor said I should focus on improving self-esteem this week. I don't know how to do that. What I'm doing now is trying to journal about good actions I've taken or things that I genuinely like about me. However, anything I journal about seems to fade quickly and is replaced by guilt/feeling bad again. \n\nAre there other ways or methods I should be trying? Any tips around the subject of self-esteem are welcome. \n\n(I know that no one here is a counselor. We ran out of time last session for me to nail specific practices/techniques down. Im just seeking any tips/advice from other people trying to also improve this area of self-esteem.)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nu7qoc/how_to_improve_selfesteem/", "title": "How to improve self-esteem?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "justanotherb1tch", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623055911, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nu7qoc/how_to_improve_selfesteem/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438344.1563017, "replies_charged": false}
