Now I know true love isn\u2019t immediately a firework show on the first date but there is that initial romantic feeling that we\u2019re all familiar with. She and I had a fun time and enjoyed our dinner and it was after that I realized that we were possibly better off as friends if she was comfortable with that. In the past I would be afraid to tell a woman how I felt after the first date for fear of hurting her feelings. Now I realize that was a a selfish way to behave that harms her and myself. I told this woman a couple days later after giving it some time that I saw her as a friend instead of a romantic partner and she commended my honesty and agreed. Now I have a potential new friend and the opportunity to continue to search for that special woman in my life!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mple28/im_taking_charge_of_my_dating_life_by_not_taking/", "title": "I\u2019m taking charge of my dating life by not taking the easy route", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Palmetto89", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1281, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618255851, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mple28/im_taking_charge_of_my_dating_life_by_not_taking/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436243.7587178, "replies_charged": false}
