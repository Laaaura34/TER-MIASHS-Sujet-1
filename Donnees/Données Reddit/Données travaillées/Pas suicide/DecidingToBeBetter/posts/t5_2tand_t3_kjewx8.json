I got a job at a well known company and more pay than I make now (+$19K), but I'm not quite sure if the work is what I want to do. I would undoubtedly learn amazing skills, but ultimately in terms of type of work it's not where I want to be long term. At my current job, I'm underutilized and not learning or challenged, though In theory I could wait it out there until I found something better. I also am up for a promotion but I doubt they'd pay as much. \n\nI'm really struggling to make a decision and would like to be able to put my fears aside and make one based on what's best for me. I made a pro con list to evaluate the job independently of my current job but I still can't make a decision.  Talking to some people who worked at the company made me feel better about the culture, I need help - any advice on how to evaluate these decisions?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kjewx8/how_do_i_push_my_decision_anxiety_aside_and_make/", "title": "How do I push my decision anxiety aside and make a decision about a job I got?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "NotSoNewYorker", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1608814143, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kjewx8/how_do_i_push_my_decision_anxiety_aside_and_make/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437850.6565738, "replies_charged": false}
