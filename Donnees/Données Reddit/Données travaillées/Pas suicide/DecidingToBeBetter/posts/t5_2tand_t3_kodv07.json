I also have a family, and I am working on building a side business which is also very important to me.  I currently work 10-12 hrs a day on average, maybe more, and I work frequently on the weekends.  I know this is not healthy and is not sustainable.\n\nI watch my diet, sleep 8 hrs a day, and I also meditate to try to manage the huge amount of stress and overwhelm.  I am well aware of the past patterns of - overwork and long hours, being able to make progress just by sheer amount of hours that I work - but inevitable I crash and erase progress that I\u2019ve made.  I want to maintain some type of balance that would allow me to maintain a consistent work schedule that is sustainable.\n\nHow much downtime should I be scheduling in my day?  I don\u2019t even know how many hours of free time and relaxation a person needs?  1-3 hours?  More?  Thanks for any advice on this.\n\nEdit:\nAs a corollary question - I know this may seem really dumb question.  What counts as \u2018downtime\u2019?  Sitting on the couch watching YouTube?  Can I count activities such as meditation, or my hobby of practicing guitar as \u2018downtime\u2019?  Probably a dumb question but I want to get this straight because I always overcommit.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kodv07/how_much_downtime_does_a_person_need/", "title": "How much downtime does a person need", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "gigachadhd", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1609517888, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kodv07/how_much_downtime_does_a_person_need/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437749.2787442, "replies_charged": false}
