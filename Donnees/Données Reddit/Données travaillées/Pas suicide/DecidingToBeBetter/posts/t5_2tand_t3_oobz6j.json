Lately I've gone completely sober from everything. I find it really hard to find stuff to do and have been spending a lot of time by myself. Most of my friends smoke weed or drink a lot these days, and I can understand it's summer time and people wanna cool down with some drinks at the beach. Honestly though, I really want to improve on my health and fitness, and be surrounded by people who don't smoke weed. I am thinking these days about going abroad to Italy or somewhere and teaching English perhaps to have a break from my current friend circle and meet some interesting new people. Can someone maybe give me some thought as to what you think would be good ? Any advice is welcome, thanks", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oobz6j/22_days_sober_from_weed_thinking_about_moving_to/", "title": "22 days sober from Weed, thinking about moving to another county temporarily", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "pinkog420", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626817808, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oobz6j/22_days_sober_from_weed_thinking_about_moving_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438320.785515, "replies_charged": false}
