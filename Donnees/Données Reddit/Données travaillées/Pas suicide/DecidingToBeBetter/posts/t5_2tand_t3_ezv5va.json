Getting out of high school and living on my own allowed me more freedom to eat the way I saw best. Symptoms of orthorexia appeared, didn't eat carbs for a year, and over exercised to maintain a specific body type. Injured an arm, and ate way below maintenance to make up for my inability to workout. Lost 30 lbs in about 2-3 months. Then started working out again, but more reasonably. Still wasn't eating enough, and felt deathly tired all the time. Barely made it through early morning labs.\n\nThis semester, binge eating has come in. The old restrict-binge cycle common to ED. Eat too much, spend the next 2-3 hours in a ball of anxiety and guilt, decide to fast to try to make up for it, and repeat. Yesterday was particularly bad, eating an entire box of pasta in one sitting. I decided it was time to do something.\n\nNoticing cycles of an unhealthy relationship with food over the years, this is something worth seeing help about. Trying to develop independence for my career has run counter to seeking help as beneficial, but I can separate career and personal goals for now.\n\nI'll talk to counseling services tomorrow.
