I\u2019ll come back after a few weeks.\n\nEdit:\nMinor tweaks", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt5pue/if_you_cant_keep_a_promise_to_yourself_you_likely/", "title": "If you can\u2019t keep a promise to yourself, you likely can\u2019t keep it for anyone else", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "kickyblue", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 168, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632310842, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt5pue/if_you_cant_keep_a_promise_to_yourself_you_likely/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436436.7776365, "replies_charged": false}
