When I\u2019m having an \u201cepisode\u201d what are some ways that can get me out of it? \n\nIt\u2019s ruining my relationships :(\n\nEdit: I want to add that I\u2019m in therapy, I\u2019m very physically active, I eat very well, and I make it to every class and every shift at work. I have a good family that loves me and friends too.
