I hope these words are helpful to you**\n\nAt some point in your life, these thoughts must have crossed your mind:\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do with my life. Life is hard and tedious, I\u2019m suffering, why am I suffering, is this suffering worth it?\n\nAnd of people who answer no, likely they still choose to live another day, even if they do so begrudgingly\n\nI believe from fear of what happens after death, or not wanting to hurt the people who love you\n\nI still struggle with these thoughts and feelings and when I went looking for answers I didn\u2019t find much\n\nAnd if I did it was pretty scattered, and took a lot of time to mentally process before it was helpful\n\nBut eventually I thought of 3 metrics of how to live, which has helped me through a lot of depressed states\n\n**It\u2019s better to live a slightly \u201cselfish\u201d existence, than for you to not live at all.**\n\nDepending on your culture and personality type you may not resonate with this, especially because for the majority of people I\u2019m pretty sure you want stuff. Whether that stuff is a girlfriend, a boyfriend, sex, a car, a house, there\u2019s likely something in life you want\n\nI used to believe that you shouldn\u2019t want or expect anything out of life because nothing is promised, and if you want anything it\u2019ll keep you from appreciating what you have now. And I used to be really proud of how little I wanted, I felt like I was a more zen person being able to detach myself from the materialism and pleasures of the world. But now I feel there\u2019s a duality to wanting things, especially possessions, and it can even be good to cultivate your desires. For example I used to really judge guys who loved cars, and would cringe so hard if their phone home screen or desktop background was a picture of their dream car\n\nOn one hand I\u2019m just in awe, because it felt like they were so confident that having that car would definitely make them happier, but empirical data overwhelmingly shows this isn\u2019t the case, so why did they still want the car despite the evidence?\n\nOn the other hand I can\u2019t help but respect their natural interests, and if the aesthetic or performance of a car really excites you, it wouldn\u2019t be right for me to say that\u2019s stupid or \u201cselfish\u201d. In fact, there are times I\u2019m envious of that desire. A strong desire, something that excites you, can keep you going in life, it can give you the fire to get out of bed when it\u2019s cold and early, and be that light at the end of a tunnel, and for some people that\u2019s a car and that\u2019s okay. And even if you feel your desire is the stupidest thing ever, I would encourage you to be at peace with it, cultivate it and pursue it.\n\nPersonally I hope it\u2019s not a car, it could even be an abstract concept, one I like a lot is to love and be loved.\n\nBefore I move on I want to give credits to Danganronpa, a character named Kaito inspired me to write this in a scene, when after the death of one of his friends he says\n\nWho cares if you don\u2019t have a reason to live?\n\nCan\u2019t your reason for living be something simple like good food or your friends?\n\nWhich I disregarded at first because it just grossly oversimplifies what you should base your life on, but that\u2019s just Kaito\u2019s character, he\u2019s a kind hearted, simple minded guy, and all of us I believe have met \u201csimple\u201d people who have simple wants and pleasures, and I\u2019ve even looked down on people for being \u201cnormal\u201d or basic, and maybe you\u2019ve also secretly judged them too. But part of you may also be secretly envious, because while we\u2019re deep in our thoughts, they\u2019re off enjoying life and connecting with people, so maybe our introspection isn\u2019t worth clinging onto if it inhibits us from living well\n\n**Socializing & Belonging**\n\nWe are social creatures, it is in our biology to need social connection. The same regions in your brain that regulate dopamine when you\u2019re hungry fire when you\u2019re deprived of social interaction. In prison, one of the most feared punishments is being put in the hole, which is just social isolation. I\u2019d even wager many prisoners would rather take a beating than subject themselves to social isolation.\n\nBut in our culture we glorify the idea of the lone wolf, the alpha, the edgelord, the gladiator, brands based one one player, one personality, even if it\u2019s a team sport. When in reality those people are some of the saddest and loneliest people you\u2019ll ever meet. And even outside these categories it\u2019s really tempting to prioritize comfort over bonding, especially if you have a good and well respected job, and you want to come off as strong and capable, well-adjusted and normal, but to find and develop real friendships and relationships requires vulnerability and rejection, both of which are, respectively, already extremely uncomfortable.\n\nSo this process requires patience and courage, and continual hope that you will eventually meet the people you\u2019re meant to meet.\n\nAnd it\u2019s likely you already have at least one friend in your life who you can\u2019t help but smile, make jokes and laugh with just by hanging out, and feel comfortable sharing pain and joy with. Make it a point to spend time with them at least once a week, don\u2019t wait for them to hit you up. Friendships end by assuming it will remain strong without consistent meaningful contact. Marriages end if a couple chooses not to plan meaningful dates anymore, under the assumption that they see each other everyday anyway so it\u2019s like they\u2019re \u201cdating\u201d 24/7. But just like we shouldn\u2019t rest on our laurels, we shouldn\u2019t assume a relationship will remain strong without being purposeful\n\n**An element of the unknown**\n\nMystery, adventure, excitement, and the longing for something new. All these feelings are tied to an element of the unknown. Whether we know it or not we satisfy this need in our lives with things like traveling, romantic pursuits or our consumerist demand for Apple to release a \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cbetter\u201d iphone every year. Even something wholesome like having children, a big allure of parenthood is the unknown of how your child will navigate the world and form their identity, and being able to see and contribute to that.\n\nAnd we can keep making travel plans, go on cute romantic dates, have sex, buy the new iphone, raise kids, raise our kids\u2019 kids, and all these things will likely bring us some form of happiness\n\nBut we\u2019ll always crave more, and we\u2019ll grow accustomed to every new pleasure we experience or acquire.\n\nSo how do we introduce a consistent and sustainable element of the unknown in our lives. A few things immediately come to mind: Sisyphis, Astronauts, Outer Space and God\n\nLong story short, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of it, Sisyphus is the guy in greek mythology who has to roll a boulder up a hill but once he does the boulder rolls down the hill so he has to roll it back up for eternity. Personally, this story terrifies me because it hits so close to home with how most of our lives play out, and there\u2019s nothing we can do to escape that destiny. However in our case, if we\u2019re privileged enough we might be able to pick what kind of boulder we roll up the hill. And outside of the things I already mentioned, the most \u201cexciting\u201d \u201cboulder\u201d I can think of is being an astronaut exploring outer space, and space truly is the final frontier remaining for humans to explore\n\nSince we\u2019ve geographically recorded every place on Earth and documented almost every species of animal, which is great for the progress of education but has almost killed our spirit of adventure.\n\nImagine life, just a few centuries ago, you\u2019re sitting in a pub, there\u2019s no internet, and a traveller just returned from a voyage. And he\u2019s like, guys there\u2019s this animal out there, on the other side of the continent, it\u2019s like a dog sheep thing, it\u2019s tall and it\u2019s neck is so long it can just stand around and eat the leaves off the top of trees. Without the internet, you might conclude that this guy\u2019s crazy or he\u2019s seen a magical animal and your imagination might run wild with what other beasts exist and what the world is like where they live. But today, if I were to describe to you a fantastical beast, as long as you can find it on google, you probably wouldn\u2019t give a shit about it, like it\u2019s cool and interesting it exists, has these features, and thrives in this environment because x, y & z, but there\u2019s no feeling of mystery anymore\n\nBut space is so mysterious, perhaps infinite, so I can see the allure of billionaires wanting to go to space, but personally I don\u2019t give a shit about space either because even though these people are witnessing and experiencing the most awe inspiring, adventurous and mysterious thing this world has to offer, this experience can lead them to depression.\n\nI feel like this implies something about the human spirit, that we were never meant to reach the apex of anything, and if we do it we\u2019ll either find a new apex or be miserable.That we have a constant longing to achieve our goals, but we don\u2019t realize we don\u2019t actually want to achieve them, at least not fully. Figures like Walter White from Breaking Bad and Kobe Bryant come to mind, they didn\u2019t stop at the top, because even the top wasn\u2019t enough\n\nWhich reminds me of my favorite Chance the Rapper verse:\n\nGod is better than the world\u2019s best day. God is better than the best day this world has to offer.\n\nAnd I hope you don\u2019t think I have an ulterior motive trying to convince you you need to believe in God, because even if you don\u2019t believe in God you can still think of God as a concept and still benefit from what I\u2019m about to say.\n\nAs humans sometimes it\u2019s frustrating trying to understand God. When I heard people say God is mysterious in his ways to justify every tragedy, I used to roll my eyes so hard. I would think if God exists why would God allow this tragedy to happen or if God wanted us to believe God exists, God should appear before us and perform impossible miracles like a magician. And I used to be really frustrated with this, deep down I wanted God to exist, but also wanted hard evidence before I could believe.\n\nBut now I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way because if God was a God I could fully comprehend, that is no God of mine. Wouldn\u2019t you also reject a God you could fully understand? Because we expect God to exist at an infinitely higher level than us, beyond our three dimensional perspective, and beyond the knowledge and understanding we could ever hope to accumulate, that\u2019s the minimum we would expect of God before we would ever accept a being or entity to be God. So even though the mystery can be frustrating, we wouldn\u2019t want it any other way. And if we accept the existence of such a God to truly exist, and believe that God is part of our lives and wants to guide us, we are blessed with a consistent and sustainable source of an element of the unknown, which cannot be found anywhere else in the world", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oyypgn/why_do_you_still_choose_to_live/", "title": "Why Do You Still Choose to Live", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "leexrnr", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 0, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628220993, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oyypgn/why_do_you_still_choose_to_live/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435549.4704788, "replies_charged": false}
