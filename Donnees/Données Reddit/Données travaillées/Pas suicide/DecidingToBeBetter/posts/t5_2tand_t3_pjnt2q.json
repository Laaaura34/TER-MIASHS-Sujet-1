I was in San Diego and I absolutely love it in SD. Very laid back, people are nice. Just love it.\n\nI like a lot of things about HK but also dislike a lot of things. It's way too claustrophobic, stressful, and there are way too many fking people, it's ridiculous. People are so mean too, everything's just about money money money and the work culture is terrible.\n\nHowever, I have to stay because of family responsibilities. I can't change how the city is built, I can't change the culture, I can't change how many people there are. The only thing I can change is my reaction and have a positive mindset about things. How can I do so? I consciously try to everyday, it works for a few moments then I see all the negativity again.\n\nIf I hate it so much here, maybe I should just go back to SD.
