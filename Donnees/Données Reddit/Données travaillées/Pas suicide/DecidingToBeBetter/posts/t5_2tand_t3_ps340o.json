Is there a way for me to get rid of those ? Therapy (and if yes, maybe certain therapies that help more with that than others?) ? Changing how I think about a thing? Meds? \n\nOpen to any and all answers, thanks in advance for any response and reading <3", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ps340o/intrusive_thoughts_and_how_to_get_rid_of_those/", "title": "Intrusive thoughts and how to get rid of those?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Farowlol", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632169777, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ps340o/intrusive_thoughts_and_how_to_get_rid_of_those/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435088.6501644, "replies_charged": false}
