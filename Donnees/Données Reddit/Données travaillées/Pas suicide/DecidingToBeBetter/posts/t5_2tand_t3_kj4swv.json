I wanna be able to walk around without shame about my decisions and be content with everything I\u2019ve done in my life, I wanna be in the best shape I\u2019ve ever been in.. I wish to improve my grammar and to have my grades up, I wanna be that top student in the class. I have the brains for it but don\u2019t put in the effort.\n\nI want better control of my emotions, I wanna be more empathetic and sympathetic towards people. I want a genuine bond with somebody, I wanna look at my partner and smile knowing I could die for this person and not regret anything. I wanna live a long, meaningful life and travel around the world.. meeting new people. I wanna smile without having anything deep down hindering me from really meaning my smile. I wanna be the man, in my eyes and the people I keep around me.. I want genuine friends, I want to be spiritually, emotionally and physically connected with God. \n\nI don\u2019t want my mama to worry about me..

I\u2019m done reflecting on the past and stressing myself out about things I can\u2019t change, I\u2019m done laying down all day and not doing anything, I\u2019m done being addicted to my phone and letting people walk over me. I\u2019m done playing with people\u2019s emotions and letting people play with mine.

I\u2019ll be somebody worth meeting and worth remembering; I\u2019ll be better than my past, I\u2019ll be better than my mistakes and I\u2019ll learn from them.
