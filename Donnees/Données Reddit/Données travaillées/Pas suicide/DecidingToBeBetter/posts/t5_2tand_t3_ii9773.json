An exaggerated state can develop into complete lameness. Quite young people give the impression of having the resignation of a bitter old man or woman. When you dig into such a black mood you find that behind it there is overwhelming greed-for being loved, for being very rich, for having the right partner, for being the top dog, etc. \nBehind such a melancholic resignation you will often discover in the darkness a recurring theme which makes things very difficult, namely if you give such people one bit of hope, the lion opens its mouth and you have to withdraw, and then they put the lid on again, and so it goes on, back and forth.\u201d \n-Marie-Louise Von Franz \n\n\nThe older I grow, the more important I\u2019m finding genuine gratitude to be and the more I\u2019m learning the value of humility in accepting that I can be \u201cdepressed\u201d without any true warrant. I could list off all the reasons I have to be negative, depressed, or even suicidal. That\u2019s a waste of time when there\u2019s at least *one* think worth LIVING for(and I don\u2019t mean just being *alive* for.)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ii9773/this_is_a_quote_about_depression_that_felt_like_a/", "title": "This is a quote about depression that felt like a hard kick in the ass.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "manicboi_vs_mania", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1598628771, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ii9773/this_is_a_quote_about_depression_that_felt_like_a/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437555.2268474, "replies_charged": false}
