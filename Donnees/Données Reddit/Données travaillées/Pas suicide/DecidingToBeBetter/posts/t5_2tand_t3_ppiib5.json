I never thought about what I ate, just that I liked healthy tasty food. I loved anything spicy. I was a healthy weight for my height. But tbh, I wouldn\u2019t have known because I never weighed myself. But I was very insecure because I was a late bloomer. I looked awkward. I had puffy frizzy hair, gaps in my teeth being fixed with braces, I hadn\u2019t developed at all so I thought I looked 12, and I had bad acne. \n\nI started doing musical theatre and I met this group of girls I wanted to be friends with. They were *so* talented. They sang better than me. They got really good roles. And guess what? Turns out, they wanted to be friends with me too. But it wasn\u2019t long until they started making comments on my weight. They told me that because I was underdeveloped I looked trans, I was grossly skinny, I was like a bag of bones and they spread a rumour that I had Marfan syndrome and anorexia so no one wanted to be my friend. Cause who wants to be friends with a girl who has an eating disorder? They would humiliate me in front of others all the time about my weight. And people laughed. But I was so inexperienced in life I didn\u2019t question them, I questioned myself. They ended up stalking me, following me to the bathroom to see if I\u2019d throw up, and then they excluded me. \n\nI had diagnosed ocd and was seeking treatment but I found my new obsession: my weight. I started going on a caloric surplus. I ate way too much for my weight, and then it would always be unhealthy food. I was binge eating thinking this would make me curvier and I\u2019d make friends. I refused to wear clothes unless they were baggy, and I didn\u2019t have a healthy relationship with food. I didn\u2019t eat to be healthy, I stuffed my body. My IBS was not fond of me for that one. Doctors wouldn\u2019t take me seriously when I told them my concerns about binging. They said \u201cwell you\u2019re not throwing up, so you don\u2019t have an eating disorder.\u201d \n\nI looked online for pills to make me put on weight, ended up losing weight because I wasn\u2019t eating anything healthy. I was tired all the time. I just wanted to be accepted. \n\nI told my therapist my adventures of weight gain. She told me to just continue what I was doing. I then went vegan thinking I\u2019d gain serious weight eating hummus all day. \n\nOnce I entered university, I refused to date. I couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of a guy critiquing or seeing my body. One day my mom sent me a photo of how I looked before all this started. I saw I had nice wide hips but a tiny waist. Which is what I was trying to accomplish. I saw a happy girl who didn\u2019t think about calories and beat herself up if I didn\u2019t reach them. I decided to start seeing a nutritionist and switched therapists. \n\nTurns out I had body dysmorphia and binge eating disorder. But my doctors didn\u2019t take me seriously because I wasn\u2019t trying to be thin. \n\nI got into weight training and developed a healthy relationship with food. I even found a love for cooking. I saw my body as a vessel that keeps me strong so I need to look after it in order to stay strong. I wear the clothes I want and blocked everyone from my highschool years that hurt me. \n\nIn short, eating disorders are complex and its not black and white. If you find yourself struggling with food, be sure to contact a doctor who you can trust. It isn\u2019t how it\u2019s portrayed in the movies.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ppiib5/how_i_developed_an_eating_disorder_in_the/", "title": "How I developed an eating disorder in the weirdest way.
