I don't feel like discovering groundbreaking new hobbies for myself either. My daily life pretty much consists of playing a few video games, binging a bunch of movies and going on a 10-20 minute walk once and that's about it. I tried doing yoga, working out, reading books, writing some myself, drawing and a few other things thus far but I simply don't feel like I'm having fun or like I'm even interested in doing any of these things.\n\nHence why I want to go to therapy, because there are probably a bunch of underlying issues that I need to deal with first before attempting to be normal and have hobbies and interests. Problem is, I'm not getting therapy any time soon. I estimate a few months, maybe I'll need to wait until next year even.\n\nSo with that in mind, what can I do to work on myself in the meantime? If anything. I'm definitely getting tired of my monotonous and pointless lazy lifestyle, but my previous attempts at spicing it up with something new have failed because essentially it seems like way too much work. So I'm trying to think of something easy and simple.
