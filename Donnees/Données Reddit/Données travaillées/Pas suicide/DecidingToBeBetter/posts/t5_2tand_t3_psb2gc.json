I just had a major surgery that I\u2019d been putting off for quite some time due to school, which was the first step to improved health and happiness. Next is therapy, where I\u2019m hoping to find the root cause of my main issues (social difficulty, never had a first date, self sabotage, and regret of wasting my teenage years). I know happiness is out there, I just have to find it. My goals for the rest of 2021 are:\n\n- find a therapist I like\n- go on one date minimum\n- submit my PhD application\n- go back to the gym \n\nHere\u2019s to being better.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/psb2gc/today_i_made_the_decision_to_go_to_therapy/", "title": "Today I made the decision to go to therapy.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "plutonian-shore", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 232, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632197050, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/psb2gc/today_i_made_the_decision_to_go_to_therapy/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435122.6669416, "replies_charged": false}
