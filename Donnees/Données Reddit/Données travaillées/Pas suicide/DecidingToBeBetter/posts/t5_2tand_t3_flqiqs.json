This is my first post on Reddit. \nI make websites for a living. I am a freelancer and work from home. \nWhen I don't have client work, I spend my time making designs for my portfolio. \nI don't have any social life. Never had a girlfriend. \nI am not active on social media and haven't tried any dating apps. I had a few friends but I disconnected with them. I think I am in this situation because of  my ego, insecurities, and soft nature. Feeling depressed and desperately want to make friends. \nI want to change and I am trying hard to get my life together. I'd appreciate any help.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/flqiqs/30m_single_feeling_lonely_never_had_a_girlfriend/", "title": "30M single, feeling lonely, never had a girlfriend", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "sailjo", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1584687388, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/flqiqs/30m_single_feeling_lonely_never_had_a_girlfriend/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438264.168541, "replies_charged": false}
