I have a learned people pleasing tendency and have trouble speaking up for myself in friendships and at work. In the past I would get angry or frustrated (i.e i didn't actually know how to properly communicate) so I try to watch myself now. I know it's an important skill for me to have so I'm doing my best to learn it.\n\nI am 1) so scared to upset people 2) recently have been troubling discerning people's motives/true colours. I used to be good at this but I've been feeling murky about it (maybe because I haven't been trusting my gut feelings about people)? 3) at work I feel so anxious if I say no to someone especially because my job is not permanent and I've been told to always say yes to things 4) I have insecurities of people not caring about me, not being good enough, people not listening to what I have to say... all things I'm aware of and trying to work on.\n\n\nAny advice is REALLY appreciated!
