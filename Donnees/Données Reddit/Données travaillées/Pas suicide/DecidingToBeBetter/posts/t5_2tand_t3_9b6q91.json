Each moment of change creates an opportunity for transformation. We just have to make the choice no matter the odds, if they are for or against us. The Universe gives us exactly what we need, sometimes we become blind to the blessings that are right in front of us, and the gifts that we can share with one another. Today definately tested me and had me look at emotions I haven't examined in a long time, I had to let go and accept their realness. But deep down I know the Truth, the bliss that lives within, the spark that Wills to express itself. Today's lesson was to stop lying to myself, cut out the bullshit and love myself to the fullest.\n\nIn order to see the change, \nWe have to be the change. :3", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/9b6q91/everything_is_here_to_teach_you/", "title": "Everything is here to teach you", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "trapshaman9", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1535523286, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/9b6q91/everything_is_here_to_teach_you/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435653.3976462, "replies_charged": false}
