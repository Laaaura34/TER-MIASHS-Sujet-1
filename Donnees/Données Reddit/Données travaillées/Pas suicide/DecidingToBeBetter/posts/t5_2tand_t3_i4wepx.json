Since then I've been pursuing a series of \"work at home in your underwear\" schemes to avoid re-engaging with society. Mostly that's meant a lot of financial support from my family.\n\nA few weeks ago I finally got up the nerve to start interviewing again and landed a job right away. It's nothing fancy, but it's something I can do without getting overwhelmed. My first paycheck was just deposited in my checking account. \n\nIt feels so nice to have my own money that I can spend without having to rationalize/justify leeching it off my parents. I'm really happy right now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i4wepx/i_got_a_normal_paycheck_for_the_first_time_in/", "title": "I got a normal paycheck for the first time in seven years", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "conandy", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1789, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1596735916, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i4wepx/i_got_a_normal_paycheck_for_the_first_time_in/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436188.6066318, "replies_charged": false}
