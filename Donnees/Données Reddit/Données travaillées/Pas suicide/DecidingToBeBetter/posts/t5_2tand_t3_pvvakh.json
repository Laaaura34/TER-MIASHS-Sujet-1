It is like a hydra with thousand heads. It is dopamine addiction. Stopped smoking? Ok, lets play videogames for 8 hours straight. Decided to stop playing games? Ok, go for porn. No porn and fap? Sugar! No sugar? Gambling! No gambling? Instagram!\n\nSo I told myself \"stay the fuck away from dopamine\". It was an addiction. It was really hard, but I overcome these crawings. After 2 weeks I felt the results.\n\nNow after more than 6 months everything is interesting. Cooking? Interesting. Learning new skill? Interesting. Go to the woods? Interesting. Even cleaning my room, preparing clothes is interesting.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvvakh/i_overcome_my_dopamine_addiction_everything_is/", "title": "I overcome my dopamine addiction.
