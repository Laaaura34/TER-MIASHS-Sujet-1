I\u2019ve worked for the same company in IT since I was 19. I\u2019m pretty \u201csuccessful\u201d in my job and people talk of me as such. I finished my degree whilst working. I run and try to keep fairly fit. I have recently quit smoking for a month having smoked in secret for about 10 years.\n\nThing is I\u2019m coasting. I\u2019ve not got that \u201cdrive\u201d to push with my career or physically. I flirt with job applications both internally and externally and make plans to run a marathon PB, but just can\u2019t get really motivated behind anything. \n\nLockdown has been somewhat of a pleasure for this mindset. Doing little beyond the minimum has been ok.\n\nBut I\u2019m terrified that this is it. Coasting through to retirement and beyond. \n\nI just can\u2019t find anything that fires me up. Perhaps that ok. Perhaps I\u2019m \u2018there\u2019. \n\nI see people walk out of careers to start again. That\u2019s not a financial reality. \n\nNeed some kind of kick up the backside.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n3dyq6/how_do_you_get_that_drive/", "title": "How do you get that \u201cdrive\u201d?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "s_g_c_101", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619983948, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n3dyq6/how_do_you_get_that_drive/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437747.5462127, "replies_charged": false}
