I've stayed in bed until 16:00 yesterday just looking at my phone and the rest of the day went like shit although I had a nice meal with the flatmates. \n\nToday I woke up at 13:00 (not ideal but way better than yesterday) took a shower and it immediately made me feel good. I feel already better and so creative that I can sit in front of my gear and make some music today after weeks of not being able to create anything.\n\nI keep reading here about the importance of taking little steps if necessary and felt nice to be able to finally experience it myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/psjf33/its_interesting_how_a_simple_thing_like_taking_a/", "title": "It's interesting how a simple thing like taking a shower can uplift your mood so much.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ssd256", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 92, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632233162, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/psjf33/its_interesting_how_a_simple_thing_like_taking_a/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437208.933212, "replies_charged": false}
