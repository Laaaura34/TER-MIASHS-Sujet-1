Yes a lot of it is due to me being unemployed due to the covid-19 pandemic but that isn\u2019t an excuse. \n\nI spent my my entire 20s living my life with the \u201cno regrets mentality\u201d. I went to culinary school and became a chef by age 22 and thought that\u2019s what I wanted forever. Turns out that wasn\u2019t the case. \n\nAt age 23 I moved to Australia, as so many young ppl do and busted my ass in several establishments and saved enough money to stay and travel through Asia for over a year. \n\nAt 25, my mom passed away. Shit happens, is what it is, but I end up with a modest amount, Enough to continue my \u201cle se fair\u201d attitude throughout the rest of my 20s. I go through most of Europe, travel South America and boom here I am at 30. I did invest some of it but that isn\u2019t goin so hot and that\u2019s another story. \n\n\u201cOh boo hoo rough life\u201d \nI agree. It\u2019s been blessed to a certain bitter sweet degree, I can\u2019t deny that. \n\n But what tf do I do now?? I gave up cooking for bartending cuz I felt it better suited what I liked doing. But now I live with two roommates, have just enough money to keep living the most basic life ever and no real career to speak of. \n\nI spent my 20s living my life with no regrets and now I\u2019m a 31 year old with no real career and no prospects. Despite doing what so many people say they want to do, traveling the world, I now feel like I\u2019m in a hopeless rut. I feel like if I\u2019d stayed the course and not gone anywhere I\u2019d be in a far better place now. \n\nCan anyone else relate to this? \n\nTLDR; I spent my 20s traveling and now I\u2019m in my 30s with no real career prospects and feel lost af.\n\nEdit: reading it over it sounds like some first world problem shit. But I can\u2019t imagine I\u2019m the only one goin through something like this, even if That is what it is.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kqubj6/regretting_a_no_regrets_life/", "title": "Regretting a \u201cno regrets\u201d life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Trufflehunter89", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1609836156, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kqubj6/regretting_a_no_regrets_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435579.7762687, "replies_charged": false}
