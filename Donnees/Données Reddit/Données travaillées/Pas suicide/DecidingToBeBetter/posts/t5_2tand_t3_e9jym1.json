I put off making the comic I was working on because it was a lot of time and effort and what if it didn't do well? I haven't written anything in over a year because of the same reason. I don't apply to new jobs even though I hate the one I'm in because what if I don't get it? \n\n\nBut what I fail to acknowledge is that whenever I have tried, and I mean whenever I've got my ass in gear over something, I've had a pretty good time with it. Sure success doesn't come easy or right away. Sure some ventures are more successful than others... But that's what's fulfilling. It's fulfilling to look at the progress of something on day 37 and remember day 1.\n\n\nSo today is my day 1. I'm gonna start working on my creative stuff again and not worry about the reaction at releasing it. I'm gonna worry about finishing it and enjoying the process and working towards an end product I'm happy with. Because while yes having something be a runaway success would be great, the point is to cross the finish line.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/e9jym1/you_cant_fail_if_you_dont_try_so_why_try_at_all/", "title": "\"You can't fail if you don't try, so why try at all? \"", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "spicychicknnugget", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1576132455, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/e9jym1/you_cant_fail_if_you_dont_try_so_why_try_at_all/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438079.8808444, "replies_charged": false}
