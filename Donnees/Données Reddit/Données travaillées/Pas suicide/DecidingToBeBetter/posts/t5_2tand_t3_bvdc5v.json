This month was Meditation May, before that was No Profanity April, and I\u2019ve done No Snooze, Stretching, and some other months. \nWorking together with friends to hold each other accountable has been very rewarding. It\u2019s a fun socializing adventure, and it\u2019s fun to compare perspectives throughout the month and explore differences in people\u2019s experience. \n\n**Overarching Purpose to Joyful Jubilee June**\n\nThis month is basically a month of positive expression. It\u2019s an attempt to curb, stall, and remove negative language, negative framing, and be extra mindful of analyzing events with the silver lining in mind. It\u2019s simultaneously something that requires active consideration in reducing automatic negative expressions and in actively encouraging positive framing at all times. \nThere\u2019s an [abundant amount of research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4161121/) that frames optimism as a physical, emotional, and mental benefit, with optimists living longer, earning more money, having more energy, having more friends, and feeling more purpose and contentment in their lives. \n\nThis month will be challenging in particular because the world is often a negative place, and negative is not only natural, it can actually be pretty healthy sometimes. That\u2019s why this challenge will sometimes feel artificial, sometimes be strenuous, and sometimes force us to work against our natural reactions and genuine feelings towards something.\n\n**Structure and Examples**\n\nI\u2019ve got some structure that I plan to utilize for myself, but as with any month that I am pitching, all are welcome to make any adjustments that they so desire, as long as they commit to something consistent and hold themselves accountable. \n\u2022\tNo negative expressions: No negative comments, complaints, or negative feedback allowed. You can\u2019t say badmouth anyone, diss on anyone\u2019s outfit, criticize media or experiences haphazardly. You have to find the \u201cpositive language\u201d variation of said expression. Saying \u201cThis is bullshit\u201d during a game of billiards. Re-frame to say \u201cI\u2019ll do better next time.\u201d \n\u2022\tNo complaining: No room for personal frustrations being expressed about the environment, oneself (no self-depreciation talk), or about failures. Comments like \u201cDamn I\u2019m hungry\u201d become \u201cFood sounds lovely.\u201d\n\u2022\tNo sarcasm: Sarcastic comments include either negative language, or a negative tone. Pretty hard to not have sarcasm play out like a backhanded joke, and I\u2019ve yet to discover a genuine positive framing towards sarcasm. \n\n**Exceptions:** \n\nBecause negative feedback is a reality at work, during intense interactions, and in life in general, there should be a way to request a space for \u201creal talk\u201d. For instance, I write movie reviews, and I\u2019ll be mindful to frame most of my reviews as very positive, but I\u2019ll have to specifically identify I\u2019m about to provide negative feedback about something. \nIf needing to engage in \u201creal talk\u201d with a partner that is getting a bit serious, directly communicating a need to discuss something heavy for 5 minutes can create a safe space for negativity apart from consequences. \n\n**Consequences:**\n\n For this month, I\u2019m going to apply 3 gratitudes to any negative statement or expression that is uttered. The punishment aims to undo the negativity by adding positivity, specifically about what that negative statement focused on. \u201cHer shoes are grimy\u201d can be undone by calling out that negativity, then stating \u201cI hope those shoes make her happy. At least she has footwear. And she\u2019s got a dope attitude when she wears gear like that.\u201d\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nJoyful Jubilee June is all about being mindfully positive. It\u2019s about reducing negative expressions, complaints, and instead peppering more positive comments in your life. It\u2019s about love, and warmth, and being hella fuckin\u2019 gooey to yourself and your loved ones. It may be a little fake, a little forced, and a little arduous at first, but hopefully it leads to genuine positivity soon enough.
