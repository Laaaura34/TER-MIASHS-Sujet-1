I'm gonna stop feeling that way. I'm so tired of being so bitter and mean to people who just wanna live their lives, of laughing at people without knowing their circumstances, of calling someone names without understanding their pov. I've always been an empathetic person but sometimes I give in and like to make fun of \"stupid people\" for fun. This not only isn't sincere but is a gross mindset, I feel absolutely disgusted and after spending time with certain people I've realized that it's just wrong to make fun of others for your own satisfaction. It's childish and wrong and unnecessary, there are other ways of seeking joy and I'm just gonna stop. I'll actively avoid certain communities on reddit that do nothing but make \"fun\" of people and irl, I have decided to be much, much kinder and genuine and sincere towards everyone I meet.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m7vmm3/ive_decided_to_stop_being_mean/", "title": "I've decided to stop being mean", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Light_yagami_2122", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 36, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616087426, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m7vmm3/ive_decided_to_stop_being_mean/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438111.4828918, "replies_charged": false}
