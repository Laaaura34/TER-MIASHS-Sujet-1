My question is rather can a fear or avoidance of happiness exist?\n\nThe background to this is the fact it\u2019s how my personality seems to work - even my gf has picked up on it. I actually tend to make choices and decisions that are detrimental to my happiness. Some are spur of the moment decisions that I\u2019ll later regret, or it\u2019ll be avoiding events or activities that I know to be beneficial to my mental well-being. \n\nIt almost feels as though I relish in being miserable. Often I do enjoy being grumpy, though this is what I\u2019d call good grumps akin to Larry David, I enjoy complaining and being grumpy sometimes. Furthermore when I am in a bout of depression, it feels better to forcibly remain somewhat sad when an opportunity to improve presents itself. Is this because I don\u2019t want to be happy or is this the trap of depression? Depression is like a comfy sofa I don\u2019t want to leave, even though it\u2019s time to stand up. \n\nI\u2019m constantly wondering whether I don\u2019t want to be happy, and whether that\u2019s a permanent flaw or just a passing phase. Have you felt something similar? And if so have any advice. \n\nThough I\u2019m not quite sure of the nature of happiness, maybe it\u2019s moments of goodness in life or a passive mood. However why does it feel like my brain, or myself, tries to avoid it?\n\nI even joke with my gf, admittedly it\u2019s probably wrong to make light of it, that I\u2019d never kill myself because then I wouldn\u2019t be able to be grumpy any more. But it makes us chuckle and is never meant with any suicidal thoughts of mine - I\u2019m sticking around whether it\u2019s to make myself miserable or find enlightenment.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lwfhtl/does_a_fear_of_being_happy_exist/", "title": "Does a fear of being happy exist?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "croplolly", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614727545, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lwfhtl/does_a_fear_of_being_happy_exist/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435465.1984031, "replies_charged": false}
