This post will be a bit different as people say that a person with my personality should not be be awkward at all. Let me give you a brief background about myself.\n\nI am 6'3 with normal weight and I also workout regularly. Over the years I have also improved on grooming and personal cleanliness. I don't have supermodel looks but am decent looking. However, I am an introvert by nature and a very private person so I don't have a friend circle and also never had luck with women and am working towards improving in this area.\n\nMy biggest problem is that I am not at all comfortable in my own skin and have anxiety in public. I think that I get easily noticed in public places due to my height and then I am very anxious and walk awkwardly which in turn increases the anxiety. Sometimes I think people are judging me or even laughing at me. \n\nI have been working on this problem for many years and the intensity has reduced, but I just want to get rid of this and be normal, casual and relaxed. Because of this problem, my personality has no meaning and am not able to make a good impression.\n\nPlease give me some tips and/or exercises which can help me improve my confidence.\n\nThanks!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cs1nnp/how_to_be_comfortable_in_your_own_skin_and_stop/", "title": "How to be comfortable in your own skin and stop being awkward in public?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ImAK93", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 341, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1566137516, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cs1nnp/how_to_be_comfortable_in_your_own_skin_and_stop/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435993.177527, "replies_charged": false}
