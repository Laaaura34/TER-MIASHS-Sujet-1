I'm back at a medically healthy weight, but never regained all the weight I lost and my period is still irregular/infrequent. Even though it's not as bad as when I was at my worst and eating, like, a single 200 cal bag of chips for the day, I still only usually get around 900-1200 most days. I really want to get to a point where I can just have a normal apetite without thinking about it, so I'm hoping to do 1300+ for a week and possibly increase it in the following week until I get used to eating a normal amount. Wish me luck! :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pyhnxp/challenging_myself_to_eat_1300_calories_per_day/", "title": "challenging myself to eat 1300+ calories per day for a week", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "rancid_vibes", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 22, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633000610, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pyhnxp/challenging_myself_to_eat_1300_calories_per_day/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437438.919781, "replies_charged": false}
