Recently left my job in order to put my entire focus on my studies. I didn\u2019t want to leave anything to chance to failing this class knowing that I could almost immediately get a better job after passing my finals and state exam.  After much consideration and weighing the gravity of my situation, I left on a good note and started focusing on my school work. Not only did I get my highest grade on a test in this semester after leaving but I also started working out again. OH BOY! I was a self trained fanatic before working and I can\u2019t tell you how exhilarating it feels to do it again after having been complacent and juggling both school and work simultaneously. On one day I focus on running 6.2 miles, another day I focus heavily on calisthenics and martial arts, and on the day after I focus on weight training. Rotating this after a week has made HUGE changes in my life already. It\u2019s admirable to hold a job and go to school simultaneously, but if you have the chance to leave on a good note, are financially stable for a while, need to prioritize on your goals, and look out for your well being, do so because no one else will :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n0xutm/go_at_your_own_pace/", "title": "Go at your own pace", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "The-Great-Epiphany", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619675190, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n0xutm/go_at_your_own_pace/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436031.15844, "replies_charged": false}
