But as i am on a path to betterment i unfollowed them all and started following motivational pages, study tips ,better health etc. I have too say it was a great time waster for me just lurking around and fapping for no reason\n\nAlso i have decided to read more , audiobooks etc and try to be a better man. \n\nAny tips you have that helped to be better are welcomed \n\nGood day\n \nEdit: thanks kind stranger that was my first award.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jgijij/unfollowed_all_hot_actresses_pornstars_etc/", "title": "Unfollowed all hot actresses, pornstars etc accounts from my 2nd Instagram account.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dexo62n99", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1219, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1603438419, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jgijij/unfollowed_all_hot_actresses_pornstars_etc/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438337.797375, "replies_charged": false}
