She stared at me a lot. And everyone noticed. But then girls I was friend's with started talking shit about her around me, they would make up lies, and paint a bad picture of her. In retrospect, my \"friend's\" didn't want me ask her out, get to know her and even be repulsed by her. It worked.\n\nAfter highschool, she gained weight. She looked tired and stressed. And stopped taking care of herself. She let the haters get to her.\n\nEveryone around her destroyed her ego. Destroyed every opportunity for her to thrive in life. Even girls who didn't know her tried to sabatoge her opportunities for a potential mate (me).\n\nIt's fucking horrifying. Fucking people man. Trying to sabatoge your life in ways you wont even fucking notice. People can be so FUCKED. People you dont even KNOW are trying to ruin your fucking life.\n\nIm a male in my 20's and I'm starting to \"peak\" in life. Thriving to my potential. And I'm noticing people are doing this to me now. I can't really see it but i FEEL it. People want me to succumb to their hate. People want me to fail. And they'll fucking do anything.\n\nI will NOT let the haters get to me.\n\nI will SURVIVE.\n\nI WILL THRIVE.\n\nGOD BLESS", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j9yp23/haters/", "title": "HATERS", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "zomboy1111", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1602534010, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j9yp23/haters/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435310.34364, "replies_charged": false}
