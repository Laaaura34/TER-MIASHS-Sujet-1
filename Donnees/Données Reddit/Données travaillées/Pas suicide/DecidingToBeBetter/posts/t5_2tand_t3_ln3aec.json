But the difference today vs two days ago is immense and I feel ready to take on the world.\n\nThis is really what my 2021 is all about - taking on all the \"stuff\" that's built up over the years that I've been putting off, ignoring, or avoiding dealing with - and I'm really excited to have some concrete progress completed and to feel this energy to take on some more. \n\nFor anyone else out there facing something similar - you can do this.  Dealing with it will not cost you nearly as much anguish or energy as constantly running from it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ln3aec/momentum_creates_momentum/", "title": "Momentum creates momentum", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LilJourney", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613698713, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ln3aec/momentum_creates_momentum/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436405.032269, "replies_charged": false}
