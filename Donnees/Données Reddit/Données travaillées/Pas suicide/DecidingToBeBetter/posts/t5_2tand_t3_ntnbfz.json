I'm the type of person who likes to break things down in a very orderly manner (logic, analysis, synthesis) to solve a problem.\n\nI was really sick and tired of the advice on the internet which seemed to be either: A. Extremely formulaic (Step 1 - Eye contact, Step 2 - Say your name, Step 3- etc.), B. Hackneyed (Just be confident), or C. Sketchy af (I'm looking at you PUAs and Sales Gurus). All around nothing really resonated with me.\n\nNow, I am a musician. Been playing guitar for 17 years! I am a huge nut for music theory; I find it one of the most interesting concepts in the world.\n\nThat being something I am really passionate about, I began to attribute everything in life to how it could be translated via music theory. Social skills eventually became one of those things \u2013 and music theory really helped it make sense!\n\nSince then, I went from shy guy to TEDx Speaker, #1 Amazon Bestselling Author (more than 10k copies worldwide), and have made lifelong friends, had outstanding relationships, jobs, and more! Social skills was the greatest gift I could give myself.\n\nWith that said, for anybody looking to better themselves but you're sick and tired of the advice that's out there, here's my two cents:\n\n**Find anything that makes sense to you and use that as a framework for what you want to learn.**\n\nThere are a surprising amount of connections between seemingly different domains! If you can understand one thing, it makes it easier to understand all.\n\nOf course, if you're interested in social skills and music \u2013 just hmu!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ntnbfz/how_i_overcame_my_fear_of_talking_to_new_people/", "title": "How I Overcame My Fear of Talking to New People", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DaSpurdOfStonkStreet", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 22, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622990702, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ntnbfz/how_i_overcame_my_fear_of_talking_to_new_people/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436843.1097481, "replies_charged": false}
