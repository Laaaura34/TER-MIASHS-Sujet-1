And how can I stop feeling \"watched\" in all what I do now (by others but by myself too) and go through these times in a beneficial and positive way?\n\nI've fucked up my loving relationship, fucked up my friendships, and besides far-away friends, I'm officially alone and with ZERO human contact (excluding workplace, which sucks kinda bad).\n\nGotta get my shit together quickly, but I am not doing very well atm :')", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/llb7e2/3_areas_i_have_to_improve_on_zero_clue_how_to_do/", "title": "3 areas I have to improve on - zero clue how to do it", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mircofragomena", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613502870, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/llb7e2/3_areas_i_have_to_improve_on_zero_clue_how_to_do/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435460.6938448, "replies_charged": false}
