I have decent social skills, except for a thing: I fear that I'm not able to instinctively defend myself and my loved ones.\nI feel that if my gf was threatened, I would freeze and I wouldn't do anything. It never happened, but minor accident made me fear this. Generally. if somebody did us something bad, I would avoid a social conflict. \nI often think about I would respond in situation of emergency, such as an aggression, and I can't manage to get anxiety because I fear I would freeze.\nIn the past I stepped up multiple times for myself, I don't like being treaded on, but a minor accident that happened with my ex in a train station that caught me off guard destroyed my confidence.\n\nI tried to do Krav Maga, but it didn't help much (I don't know if it was because my gym wasn't good enough or what). I also talked about it with my past therapist, but he didn't care much about this.\n\nI want absolutely to change, what can I do?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pf0830/i_fear_that_im_a_coward_i_want_to_change_but_i/", "title": "I fear that I'm a coward, I want to change but I don't know how to", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dquirmis9", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 20, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630390960, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pf0830/i_fear_that_im_a_coward_i_want_to_change_but_i/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435966.2544515, "replies_charged": false}
