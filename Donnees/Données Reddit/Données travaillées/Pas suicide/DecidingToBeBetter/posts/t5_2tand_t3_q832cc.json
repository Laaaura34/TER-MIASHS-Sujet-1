My mum for a long time didnt want to hug me, shed squirm away, I cant remember her saying I love you, unless I said it to her (rarely). I was bullied as a child and so I've suffered with anxiety and depression my entire life. My mum sometimes comments on my body, I've struggled with OCD too lately. My mum has quite a hands off parenting approach. Also I have a naturally very high sex drive and developed it early. I also saw male validation as the attention I craved. Cue to porn and sexting strangers at 14 to 15. I also mixed with the wrong crowd and got into shoplifting which I stopped after realising that I'll completely fuck up my life, also I stopped with getting attention from sexting as I landed an adult which forever fucked up my trust to men. Most lads didnt even want an emotional bond, just my body. So now I am 16 and feel like a terrible worthless slut", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q832cc/got_better_but_my_ocd_hates_me/", "title": "Got better but my OCD hates me", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "hahashutupjerry", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634228384, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q832cc/got_better_but_my_ocd_hates_me/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635437983.0315378, "replies_charged": false}
