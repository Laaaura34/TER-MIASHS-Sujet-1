I left a couple months ago and do not regret my decision. You cannot grow in the same environment that took you down. I am breaking the cycle of the generational toxicity that's continuing to be passed down. Stay strong, break that cycle, you can, you will, don't listen to your toxic family who wants to continue living in that type of environment. P.S. If anyone knows of or would like to create a discord support group I would love to join :) or feel free to message me on here. TIA and best of luck to all. I know it's hard, but you're much stronger and way more capable than you give yourself credit for.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p7wvi2/breaking_the_generational_toxicity/", "title": "Breaking The Generational Toxicity", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Datchett_Craay", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629442233, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p7wvi2/breaking_the_generational_toxicity/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437468.1466496, "replies_charged": false}
