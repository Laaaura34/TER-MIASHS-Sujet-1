I'm at a point where I've learnt most of the things I already want to learn and even though I discover new things every day already, it's sort of a point in time where I'm looking for new hobbies to pick up. \n\nI've searched many subs already for good skills to pick up but a lot of the things in these lists I've already done; animation, drawing, sewing, music production, editing, learning a language (german), some basic programming, gardening / homesteading\n\nI plan to extend my programming skills and dip my toes into other foreign languages but it feels like there is a lack of variety otherwise. Does anyone have any recommendations? It doesn't even have to be a hobby specifically, maybe a field or topic that would be fun to research? I don't know. At this point I'm desperate for something that strays away from looking at text constantly on a screen. \n\nI was going to consider beehiving but with covid right now it's difficult to do anything outdoors. \n\n(For context I am 18 and already work full time as an animator, but I don't play any games at all and don't find YouTube that interesting and thus I have an abysmal amount of spare time)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pn605n/i_want_to_learn_more_shit/", "title": "I want to learn more shit", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LiteralHatCS", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631498115, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pn605n/i_want_to_learn_more_shit/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436772.8754969, "replies_charged": false}
