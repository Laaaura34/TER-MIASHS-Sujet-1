So, quick background story, I started smoked weed when I was 16 and have been hooked ever since. Can\u2019t even go 10 days without getting major withdrawals. Tried quitting gradually but that\u2019s just never worked for me. I have lots of friends that smoke and this is really hindering my performance as I have two jobs. Please help!! I\u2019m not slacking in life, though I feel I am inhibiting my true potential. I\u2019m 22 now, and I really feel like my  mental/physical health are quickly declining. Please help me quit :/ Thank you", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvhd7f/please_help_weed_is_killing_me/", "title": "Please help, weed is killing me", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "StatementProper7402", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 341, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632610173, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvhd7f/please_help_weed_is_killing_me/", "nsfw": true, "first_save": 1635437393.2344353, "replies_charged": false}
