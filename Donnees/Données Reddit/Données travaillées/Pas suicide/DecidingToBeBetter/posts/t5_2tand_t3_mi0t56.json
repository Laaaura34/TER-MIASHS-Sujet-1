It was such a regular part of my life that I sincerely believed it's just a part of me. That's just who I am - grumpy, miserable, unmotivated, pessimistic and easily discouraged. My ingrained, unchangeable personality traits. \n\nThe lockdown made everything much worse, I became pretty much non-functioning over the last year. This morning I realised that I have nearly a year of backlog of pretty important things I haven't been able to do because I was too much in my head or distracting myself as a coping mechanism. These things can be physically completed within one day. \n\nI got pissed off, I called my GP and I told them everything. I got prescribed 75mg Venlafaxine and got referred to therapy. I'm done surrendering to this situation, I don't want to be held hostage by my dumb brain chemistry and shitty coping mechanisms I have practiced for decades. I'm angry at myself for not trying earlier, I'm even annoyed a bit with my family not intervening when I was a kid, but I haven't been a kid for a long time so my family's inaction isn't even a valid excuse. \n\nWish me luck, guys. I'm a bit scared, but also kinda excited for the upcoming change. Any advice is welcome, because I'm not sure what to expect.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mi0t56/i_will_take_my_first_antidepressant_today/", "title": "I will take my first antidepressant today.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mucharuchakaralucha", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617299320, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mi0t56/i_will_take_my_first_antidepressant_today/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438362.0599127, "replies_charged": false}
