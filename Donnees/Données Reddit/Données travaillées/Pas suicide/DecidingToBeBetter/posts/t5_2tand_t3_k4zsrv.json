I realized that a huge stump on my life was a inability to get over my past and I let it strongly hurt me and I pushed away some people. At the same time it was thanks to my depression I REALLY found out who actually wanted to be there for me and who was there because I was so cheerful at the time. \n\nIt really hurts because I really wanted those people to be a part of my life and I don't know how I'm going to let them go but I think I have to in order to move on. \n\nAlso I realized that I wanted to live and not actually die as I wished for. However,  now I have to figure out what I really want to do with my life. Wish me luck everyone!\n\n\nAlso update: I got a interview for a job tommorow and my brother is going to go to the gym with me to help me achieve a personal goal of mine!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k4zsrv/finally_waking_up/", "title": "Finally waking up.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ldragosasuke", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 18, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1606874825, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k4zsrv/finally_waking_up/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435879.1497822, "replies_charged": false}
