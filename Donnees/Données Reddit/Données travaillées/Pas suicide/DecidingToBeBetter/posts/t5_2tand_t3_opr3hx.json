I dont want my mind to be a mental prison anymore. I just want to relax without being uptight or depressed and fatigued. I dont want to have to have these unhealthy coping mechanisms. I dont want poor health and i dont want to deal with the stres of diabetes at the same time. I want to do better for myself. I hope this isnt a mood swing and that i stick to this because i cant live like this. I just want freedom from my mental health struggles", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/opr3hx/i_want_to_be_free/", "title": "I want to be free", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "idklol45678", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627001080, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/opr3hx/i_want_to_be_free/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438051.056776, "replies_charged": false}
