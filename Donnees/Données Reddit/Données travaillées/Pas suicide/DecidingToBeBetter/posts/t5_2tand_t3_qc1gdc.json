Laptop, academic books relating to the topic, time. I just absolutely cannot start writing the damn thing. I'm afraid I will put it off for too long and then I will have to leave education altogether because I can't keep taking breaks. \n\nCan someone *please* give me some advice on how to get started with this, it really is plaguing my life and I bet once it's finished I will laugh at how easy it was and how I was so worried about something that wasn't that difficult to do. \n\nThanks", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qc1gdc/how_do_i_start_my_university_assignment_that_ive/", "title": "How do I start my university assignment that I've been putting off for three years?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "neutral_transmission", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634738167, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qc1gdc/how_do_i_start_my_university_assignment_that_ive/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436255.820707, "replies_charged": false}
