I regret existing, my birth and jump to the beginning when i was born and contemplate how differently everyone's life could've been if i didn't exist or die young. I am a very positive person when it comes to others, but when it's about me, I'm my own Ravager. In bad times people cling to hopes, take a leap of faith, thinking things would be better. Unfortunately, I can't keep hopes, henceforth i drown in my own negativity. I want to change now. In general positive advice, motivational talk doesn't work for me, sometimes worsens my head during tough situations. I'm too broke to afford therapy. I don't trust anyone in my family to open up. I cannot share with my IRL friends because my negativity is too overwhelming for them, or for anyone lol. So i dump my feelings on the Internet. All advices are appreciated, Thank you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdd5ia/how_to_not_be_negative_all_the_time_how_to_not/", "title": "How to not be negative all the time, How to not cuss & regret my existence, I want to change", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Any-Reply-3247", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 220, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630168742, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdd5ia/how_to_not_be_negative_all_the_time_how_to_not/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437088.3733423, "replies_charged": false}
