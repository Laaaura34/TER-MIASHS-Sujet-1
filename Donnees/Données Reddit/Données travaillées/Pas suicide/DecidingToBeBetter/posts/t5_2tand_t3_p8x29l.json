I started practicing it when I was in my worst state/lowest, I was An Agoraphobic mess. Housebound, and daily anxiety. I started training with YouTube videos and homeworkouts. \n\nTo skip past the long journey to where I am now, (able to go outside, having a job, an overall general improvement from then) \n\nI'm making the choice now, To commit to my training, and finally make the choice to compete in my first ever bout. I can't live this life anymore, without pursuing that which was always there for me, even in my lowest moments. This is a deep passion, this is my deep passion. \n\nI will no longer sit on the sidelines, and wait for a miracle. I am the miracle. I will create my storybook ending.
