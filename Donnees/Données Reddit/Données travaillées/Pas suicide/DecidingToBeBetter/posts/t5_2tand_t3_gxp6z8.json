And I recently found the perfect match!\n\nI  volunteer a few hours a week at a local food distribution center and it  is a lot of fun! We get food from stores that is going to expire soon  and give it to people in need.\n\nIt isn't word changing but I am still proud of it!\n\nMaybe my post can inspire someone to find a similar organization near him/her!\n\nGreenVirusRed", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gxp6z8/first_time_volunteering_at_a_food_distribution/", "title": "First time volunteering at a food distribution center for the less fortunate", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "GreenVirusRed", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1591442394, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gxp6z8/first_time_volunteering_at_a_food_distribution/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436614.464965, "replies_charged": false}
