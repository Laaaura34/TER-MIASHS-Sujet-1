Never about anything important, just small things. I feel like I can throw myself at any task, and learn it with little trouble. So I get into situations where I assume I can do it and most of the time have no problem.\n\nBUT, I can't be honest with myself. I tell stories that never happened, but never to incriminate others, more like a stand up comedian of my own non-existent life. never grandiose, but still untrue.\n\nNow I confuse what is real and fake, what I know or made up. I try to be better, and more honest but I just feel like my life is lacking. It's a copping mechanism, cause I grew up always feeling like I'm not good enough or ignored, so I play a better song so people will listen.\n\n[tl:dr] I lie so much about myself that I don't know what's true or false\n\nHELP, I just need advice on what to do so that I can break this cycle. To find out who I really am, To tell my friends who I really am, and to be able to see the real me in the mirror.\n\n(Funny enough my guilty pleasure is being honest on the internet, cause of the Anonymity make me feel like my honesty won't backlash at me.)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m4r910/am_i_getting_better_or_lying_to_myself/", "title": "Am I getting better?.. or lying to myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ZealousScorpions", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615710088, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m4r910/am_i_getting_better_or_lying_to_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437775.187795, "replies_charged": false}
