My closer friends have been texting me back and forth since then but the conversations seem to have died down and i\u2019m scared they are losing interest/ forgetting about me as i\u2019m no longer on their social media feeds constantly. Is this irrational and me overthinking? Aside from this I feel better and as i have exams for the next few weeks i\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll help me to focus on myself a lot more. But could someone give me some advice, as i think i need to stop relying on other people and become my own best friend. I am the sort of person who enjoys \u201cme time\u201d but i am scared i\u2019m relying too much on other people for happiness as i\u2019m not in contact with many at all right now. is this unhealthy or not? i guess i just need to count on only myself from now on. \n\nAny advice is welcome :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mtiaw7/i_deleted_social_media_but_feel_lonely/", "title": "I deleted social media but feel lonely", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mangledmags", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618770145, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mtiaw7/i_deleted_social_media_but_feel_lonely/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438351.7217245, "replies_charged": false}
