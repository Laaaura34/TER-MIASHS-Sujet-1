(Within reason). I'll be posting my progress and experiences on TikTok & Instagram. @challengeme___\n\nCheers", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ofvyus/send_me_challenges_to_help_better_myself/", "title": "Send Me Challenges To Help Better Myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "JulianLewis_", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625704317, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ofvyus/send_me_challenges_to_help_better_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435869.3661559, "replies_charged": false}
