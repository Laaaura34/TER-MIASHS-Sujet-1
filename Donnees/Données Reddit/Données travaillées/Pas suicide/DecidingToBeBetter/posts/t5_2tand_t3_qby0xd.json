The English equivalent would probably be \u201cepicaricacy\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m guilty of having this feeling for people I despise or even people I care about who may have recently been unpleasant towards me.\n\nIn the short term, the feeling feels amazing. I enjoy it kinda like a karmic revenge sort of thing. But I don\u2019t like what the feeling does to me in the long term. After the novelty wears off, I actually feel really sad for the person and I realize my reaction towards them is just a reflection of who I am and how low my self-esteem is to experience joy at someone else\u2019s misfortune.\n\nSo, I want to do better. Of course, bettering myself through exercise and eating right will raise my self-esteem even more, but just the thing about not wishing ill upon other people, especially when they do me wrong, is something I need to work on.\n\nAny help and suggestions would be appreciated.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qby0xd/trying_to_get_rid_of_my_schadenfreude_reactions/", "title": "Trying to get rid of my schadenfreude reactions.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "angrykumu", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634726832, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qby0xd/trying_to_get_rid_of_my_schadenfreude_reactions/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437293.074108, "replies_charged": false}
