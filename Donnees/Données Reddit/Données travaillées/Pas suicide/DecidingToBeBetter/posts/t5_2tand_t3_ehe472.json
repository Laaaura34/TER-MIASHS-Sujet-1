How are you?\"\n\n\"Doin pretty good\"\n\n\"Aw good, I'm glad.\"\n\nand then I stand there in silence while they ring me up. BUT. Today was different. We did the whole 'how are you?' exchange but when she asked me if I had any exciting plans, instead of saying \"Not Really\" I decided to be honest and tell her about how I'm going to attempt to dye my hair pink. \n\nWe talked about what shade I was going for, then she told me about how she dyed her hair a few months ago and I know it sounds lame, but I felt so... normal.\n\nI think I put a lot of pressure on myself to be very engaging and over enthusiastic when talking to strangers (which doesn't really work out in my favor because I'm not a very expressive person in real life) but I just told myself to stay chill and it all worked out.
