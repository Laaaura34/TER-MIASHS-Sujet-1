But am insight as to why I do this is I have never been truly happy with myself; I lie amount small scenarios to make myself seem better than I am. I wanted to believe I was separate from the pack, but I am afraid of how others will treat me because of my difference. I am sick of this I want to be a leader and I need to stop being afraid of what others think, I cannot keep wanting to be the alpha when acting in line with the sheep. I want to, from here on, stop caring about what others will think of me and purely act in the way that I want and disregard those who dislike my decision to be me. I constantly have anxiety of how others are looking at me from how I walk, to how I look, I feel small and insignificant, I want to feel like I am living my life and everyone else is living their own lives too. I wrote down a list of things I want, and specifically why I want them, to remind myself the importance of each task.\n\nBigger Build \u2013 I want a larger chest, to be more confident in myself and stop relying on reassurance from others approval.\n\nCompletely cut off masturbation \u2013 I want to stop being controlled by my dick and make decisions that are beneficial not only to me right now but me of the future.\n\nReach 25k in stocks - I want to be able to maintain a steady investment in my financial future.\n\nCut off gaming completely \u2013 It is a waste of future me\u2019s time and only benefits my short-term stress without addressing the problem.\n\nReplace time wasted on phone with time in books \u2013 I am recognizing that I am becoming dependent on my phone not only to fill the blanks spaces of my time but to get me through the day and not think about what I need to do.\n\nSpend more time outside/with other people \u2013 I have been putting socializing as a waste of my time because I could be grinding better gear or new levels in videogames. I want to make memories not better my fictional character.\n\nMake my classes top priority to break the habit of procrastination \u2013 I have been waiting till near the due date or the deadline to start working on schoolwork to keep my self-motivated, but I want to rely on my discipline not my energy.\n\nFix my sleep schedule \u2013 I want to maintain above an 8-hour amount of sleep per night regardless of weekends.\n\nClean room \u2013 I let myself get messing and instead of putting things away I pile them up and leave them till it gets bad enough that I have to do a large amount cleaning rather than just preventative cleaning throughout the week.\n\nI will make an excel spreadsheet making sure I follow each of these daily and I will update this post monthly or quarterly. I have waited too long to start and I'm ready for myself in 5 years to be grateful to the me of today that I finally started after years of failure.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lehvol/20_years_old_and_dissatisfied_with_my_life_i_will/", "title": "20 years old and dissatisfied with my life.
