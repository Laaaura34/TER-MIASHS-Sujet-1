I don\u2019t have anyone in my life whom I can depend on apart from my girlfriend. I\u2019m not very close with my parents nor do I have any close friends. She\u2019s all I have. And she feels very pressurised by it. It\u2019s too much for her. She even talked about how she sees herself take the role of multiple people in my life, mother, father, friend but not girlfriend. She doesn\u2019t feel like one anymore and I completely understand the kind of extreme pressure she might be under. She feels responsible for almost every tiny little thing that happens to me. \n\nAnd I really want to change this. I don\u2019t want to make her feel like this. I want to be better and take this pressure off of her. I want her to feel like she\u2019s my girlfriend and not just all the other roles. Not that it\u2019s a bad thing to feel this way towards your significant other but the pressure she feels is too much. What can I do? To take this pressure off? To get rid of this extreme emotional dependency? I hate that I\u2019m making her feel like this and I want to change so bad. I just don\u2019t know how to go about it. I really want to make things work. I really don\u2019t want to lose her. What is it that I can do to make this better? To get better?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9vxii/how_do_i_become_okay_with_being_by_just_myself/", "title": "How do I become okay with being by just myself?
