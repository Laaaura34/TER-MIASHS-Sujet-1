I\u2019m using social media as the example here, since it\u2019s what I myself applied these steps to, but whichever excessive/over-ing activity you do (whether that\u2019s watching porn, eating, drinking, etc.), these steps can be applied to that as well.\n\n1) Plan at least 24 hours in advance:\n\nThis is really important as we want to make sure we\u2019re using our prefrontal cortex, our higher brain, to decide our social media use in advance. Our primal brain is wired to seek pleasure and avoid pain in the moment \u2014 it doesn\u2019t see the long-term, net negative effects of the over-ing activity we\u2019re engaging in. So, we want to make sure our prefrontal cortex is the one in control.\n\nI personally like to take 5-10mins every Sunday to plan for the upcoming week. Write your plan down, and be as detailed as possible. For example: \u201cOn Monday, I will spend 20mins on Instagram from 5:00-5:20pm, and 20mins on Youtube from 5:20-5:40pm.\u201d Place it somewhere you\u2019ll see it as you\u2019re going about your day (your bedroom wall, for example). I\u2019d suggest starting off with a plan that is realistic and achievable for you.\n\nTip: I prefer having most of my social media notifications muted, so I only see them at the time I\u2019ve planned in advance to check that app.\n\n2) Follow the plan & Allow urges:\n\nYou\u2019ll have the urge/desire to use social media outside of the times you\u2019ve laid out in your plan. This is not a problem \u2014 it\u2019s totally okay. Our urge to check social media may seem so intense and like it\u2019s something that\u2019s happening TO us, but it\u2019s actually just something we programmed our brain with. Whenever we feel an urge to check social media and give in to what the urge wants us to do, our brain is rewarded with an intense dopamine hit, which only trains our brain to want it more.\n\nAllow yourself to fully feel these urges, without acting on them. Don\u2019t try to resist them, or willpower your way through them. Ask yourself these questions in the moment to help yourself truly allow feeling an urge: Where in my body am I feeling this? Is it heavy/light? Is it moving \u2014 fast/slow? Does it have a color to it? Pretend there\u2019s an alien next to you who has no idea what it means to feel an urge to check social media \u2014 How would you describe it to them? I personally describe it as a pull I feel in my chest towards my phone.\n\nWill it be uncomfortable to allow feeling an urge without reacting to it? Yes. Is it the worst thing in the world? Definitely not. The more you allow yourself to feel an urge without reacting to it, the faster you retrain your brain. The more you practice this skill, the less intense the urges will become. No website/social media app blocker (trust me, I tried those) will help long-term, if you don\u2019t practice feeling urges without reacting to them. And when you learn this skill, you\u2019ll actually have no need for those.\n\n3) Interpret mistakes from your future-self: \n\nAs you\u2019re implementing and practicing this process, there\u2019ll be times when you don\u2019t follow the plan, by giving in and reacting to urges. You may have thoughts after, like: \u201cI can\u2019t do this\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m never going to figure this out\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ll always be stuck spending too much time on this\u201d, etc. Instead of interpreting the situation from your present-self, ask yourself what your future-self, who\u2019s already where you want to be, thinks about this moment. Do they even really care about your first failed plan? They\u2019re probably thinking: \u201cMe making that mistake was just part of my process to getting here\u201d. Now that I\u2019m actually where I envisioned my future-self to be when I was struggling with overusing social media, that\u2019s 100% my thought about the mistakes I made along the way.\n\nThere you have it \u2014 there\u2019s more that can be said about each step, but I tried to put it as concisely as possible. This process is truly THE solution from my experience.
