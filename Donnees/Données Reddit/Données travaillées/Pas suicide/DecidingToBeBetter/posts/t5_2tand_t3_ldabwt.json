Due to an upcoming doctors exam, I decided that I no longer want to feel shame and embarrassment. Needless to say, I had a big task ahead of me. I contemplated if I should just cut it all off and go bald. Eh, wasn\u2019t sure if my head is shaped well enough for that. So I googled how to comb really matted hair. I found an article that instructed me to saturate my hair in cooking oil for added \u201cslip\u201d to loosen the tangles. I\u2019m amazed at how well this worked. Blessings to the lovely soul who posted this wonderful life hack. I stayed up all night and spent hours combing through the bush on my head, which produced shed sizable to a small animal. But I stuck it through until it was all done. I then gave my new tresses a good wash and condition. I feel soo much better. I am proud.\n\nEdit: Thank you all sooo very much for your words of encouragement and hope. I appreciate it dearly. I would like to respond to each of you individually, please forgive me if I missed a reply. I am reading your comments and I truly thank you. \u2665\ufe0f \n\nEdit 2: For those that may be going through something similar, please know that you are not alone. And there is hope to get through this. You will get through this.
