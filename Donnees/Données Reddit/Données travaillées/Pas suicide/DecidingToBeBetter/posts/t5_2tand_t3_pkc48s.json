I'm almost 18 and i still do this and i hate it. i get envious of everyone and i just feel like it's my loss every time i see something good happening to other people. i feel like this is the reason it gets a bit difficult for me to be happy for other people; and these are people that i care about - my best friends and family. i feel like it's because i have nothing of my own going on at the moment (which has been for a long time now,,, really long), i feel *this* low. like i used to draw but now it just makes me unhappy that i can't draw well and i just gave that up. the thing is, i know that this could be the reason for me feeling this way but i just don't do anything of my own and just sit around binging shows all day because \"doing\" is too difficult. but honestly what good thing isn't difficult yknow. i keep telling myself that i can change and i can \"do\" things but I've never been consistent. i think because of me choosing the easy way every damn time i'm starting to hate a lotta things. i wanna do things that i like, i don't know if that'll make all the envy go away but it'll be a start.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pkc48s/me_being_envious_of_literally_everyone_in_my_life/", "title": "me being envious of literally everyone in my life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SpecificePieEater", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 291, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631112960, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pkc48s/me_being_envious_of_literally_everyone_in_my_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436259.0402627, "replies_charged": false}
