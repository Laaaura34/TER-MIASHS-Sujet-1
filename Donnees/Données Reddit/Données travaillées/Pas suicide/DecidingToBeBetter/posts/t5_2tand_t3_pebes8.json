Worried about missing them. Worrying about missing all the little events that go on. Worrying about what if it's the last time I see them before something bad happens. Worrying that my absence will make them depressed. Worrying that their absence will make me depressed. Worried I won't like my new city. \n\nI've been a worry rat my entire life. My mom has told me not to worry so much about things I can't control and don't worry about things that haven't happened yet. But HOW?
