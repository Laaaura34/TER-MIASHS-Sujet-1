We all need it, most of us hate it, and a lot of us skip it.\n\nBut like the dentist is important for keeping your teeth in top condition, **discipline is important for a successful and happy life.**\n\nPeople think discipline sucks. I get it, it\u2019s hardly the most exciting way to live. But do you know what sucks more? \n\nNot getting what you want, and not becoming who you want. Sitting around wishing for things to happen to you, or blaming the world when it does. \n\nDiscipline guides the direction of your life. You can achieve amazing things with consistent, small efforts.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be how you\u2019re imagining it. I\u2019m not talking about ice cold showers, boiled chicken, and broccoli for the rest of time. Discipline isn\u2019t the end of your freedom, but the start of it.\n\n# Pick the right kind of discipline\n\nDiscipline isn\u2019t fun if you pick the wrong kind. \n\n**Reactive discipline** is the result of poor outcomes. We set rules to avoid repeated mistakes. \n\nFor a rule - or system - to stick, the motivators have to be right. We want to be in control, moving in a positive direction. Reacting is the opposite, outcomes control us.\n\nBecause of this, reactive discipline is unenjoyable, and often ineffective. We\u2019ve all promised ourselves to never eat like a pig again, stop getting so drunk, and to avoid less-than-stellar one-night stands. But the burgers, booze and bad decisions are always waiting around the corner. \n\nIt\u2019s a cycle of self-loathing, rule imposing, and let downs. It\u2019s disappointing and demotivating. \n\nThe opposite is true for proactive discipline. \n\n# Be proactive\n\nDon\u2019t wait for life to set your rules. Instead, decide what you want from life and set them yourself.\n\nProactive discipline will: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Let you enjoy life more**\n2. **Lead to results**\n\nWith discipline, you have the freedom to enjoy things when you want. But people believe otherwise.\n\nSocrates once said the secret to happiness is about developing the capacity to enjoy less. This was over 2000 years ago. These days, we can live like an emperor. But that doesn\u2019t mean we should.\n\nIndulgence doesn\u2019t make us happier; it just raises the bar to get there. There\u2019s diminishing returns. \n\nBy being disciplined, you keep the bar low. We think and feel in comparisons. This is a powerful psychological tool you can use for your own happiness. \n\nIf you\u2019re disciplined with your spending, treating yourself is actually a treat. When you\u2019re strict with your diet, pizza tastes like heaven. When you work hard all week, relaxing is glorious.\n\nOver time, you buy more freedom with your discipline. Good savers can retire well before 50. Eating well means you\u2019re not fighting diabetes and crying over cake later. Working hard now lets you build a life of meaning. \n\n# Building discipline\n\nDesire x Time x Discipline = Formula for success. \n\nBut discipline isn\u2019t easy. You have to build it like you would a muscle at the gym. The key to doing it well is picking something beneficial, not reacting to your life. Don\u2019t start with sugar if you\u2019ve got a sweet tooth, for example.\n\nIn *Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us,* Pink explains about the most effective internal motivators:\n\n\\- **Autonomy:** Control of direction\n\n\\- **Mastery:** Development of skills\n\n\\- **Purpose:** Feeling of meaning\n\nTick these boxes and you\u2019ll experience a paradigm shift. Discipline becomes a celebration. You want to prove to yourself you can commit to something more. \n\nThis is why I believe physical exercise is the seed of excellence. Control your diet and workout 5 hours a week for 6 months. You feel amazing, confident, and you\u2019ve transformed yourself physically. When you see what you\u2019ve done at the gym, you\u2019ll ask what you can do with your life. \n\nIf exercise isn\u2019t your thing, find something you\u2019ve wanted to try. Wake up 30 minutes early each day. Read, write, sing, practice handstands. Pick something you can be consistent with, and build from there. \n\nWhen you see that discipline gives the outcomes you desire, it\u2019s something you\u2019ll put into life more and more. \n\n# Get what you deserve\n\nThe life you\u2019ll live is directly proportionate to the effort you put in to create it.\n\nAbraham Lincoln said: \u201cDiscipline is choosing between what you want now, and what you want most.\u201d \n\nWhat is it you want to achieve? What would it take for you to look back at your life and know you made the right choice by giving it your all? \n\nMake the tough choices now and enjoy a great life later. \n\n\\--\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave a great sunday!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m9t8j9/how_to_start_being_more_disciplined_without/", "title": "How to Start Being More Disciplined, Without Ruining Your Life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "KieranDrew", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616319551, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m9t8j9/how_to_start_being_more_disciplined_without/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435462.3099, "replies_charged": false}
