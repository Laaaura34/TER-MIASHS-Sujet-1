I recently went through a breakup 2 and a half months ago and started seeing someone new 2 weeks ago, but they have already discarded me and i feel even worse now. \n\nI\u2019ve been binge eating a LOT this past week and I have no idea where my career is heading. I don\u2019t feel smart, I don\u2019t feel talented, I don\u2019t feel pretty and I don\u2019t see any hope for myself right now. I feel so stuck. I\u2019m hoping I can reset my mindset tomorrow but the thought of never improving past these habits terrifies me. This past year has had some of the lowest points of my life and I guess I\u2019m just posting because I feel like I have no one to turn to even though I have friends and family. I just needed to vent because I feel so alone. I pray to a god that I don\u2019t even believe in that things will get better.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4d755/i_feel_horrible/", "title": "I feel horrible", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tea_wit_da_ice", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633749809, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4d755/i_feel_horrible/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436761.2406886, "replies_charged": false}
