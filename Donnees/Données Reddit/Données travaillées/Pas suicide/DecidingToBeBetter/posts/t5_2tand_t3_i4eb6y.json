Daddy issues, my first sexual experience was a sexual assault, history of being cheated on and rejected for other girls. I\u2019ve always felt abandoned and rejected. I realize I have a tendency to choose abusive men, but have noticed an upward trend overall.. I think I am improving my judgment, as each one has been better than the last. But I still haven\u2019t found the right one (obviously) & find myself behaving in ways that I\u2019m embarrassed about afterwards.\n\nI\u2019m a very emotional, passionate person. I fall so hard and deeply. I\u2019m faithful, devoted, but also can be possessive (unintentionally). I put these expectations on the guys I like, and if they don\u2019t do or say what I like, I get triggered, resent them, & don\u2019t communicate about it until the anger becomes so overwhelming & I explode! I realize I need to work on my communication skills. I don\u2019t know how to tell them how I feel, and this comes to positive feelings sometimes too, like telling him I like him or appreciate him. I guess I\u2019m always on guard and scared of being hurt again. Over the years, I\u2019ve had this deep seated resentment towards men that I\u2019ve spent years of therapy to get over. Sometimes I\u2019m angry at them for their privilege of being male & not having had to deal with the struggles I\u2019ve had to deal with as a woman of color. & sometimes my anger is because of the male figure I had growing up, who was sexist and emotionally unsupportive. Logically, I know it\u2019s not rational. A lot of the feelings I have aren\u2019t. I\u2019m trying to resolve these negative feelings, stop being triggered so much, and be an emotionally balanced person.\n\nI am in therapy, always looking into self help, and have this awareness.. I guess I\u2019m seeking as much advice as I can possibly receive.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i4eb6y/how_can_i_learn_to_be_a_healthier_partner_in/", "title": "How can I learn to be a healthier partner in relationships?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwawayjuly220", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1596663014, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i4eb6y/how_can_i_learn_to_be_a_healthier_partner_in/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437857.9168906, "replies_charged": false}
