Addicted since I was 17-18 until 23. It has by far been the most difficult habit I have gotten rid of. Now I'm proud and glad that I actually did it! I drank water and chewed gum every time I felt a craving creep up on me, which was multiple times daily for 1 week. If you REALLY want to quit, you CAN do it!\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the overwhelming love in the comments.
