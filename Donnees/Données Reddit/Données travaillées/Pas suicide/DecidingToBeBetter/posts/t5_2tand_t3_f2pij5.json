I know it's not good and healthy for me, I can't just let loose and party and pretend like sleeping with this singer means nothing to me. I have feelings. It's hopeless and stupid and can never be because he's a celebrity. He doesn't know my name and doesn't care about, he probably already forgot about the one time we had sex. Still I can't help but dream and hope instead of just letting go and focusing on myself and my real life.\n\nI bought train tickets for the show tonight. The train leaves in 2 hours. I have 2 hours to talk myself out of going. I'm already missing the pre-party so what's the point? He will already have chosen the girls he wants to take to the hotel by the time I arrive.\n\nIt's a city I've never been to, I'm all by myself and I have no place to stay. I should stay home. I must decide not to go, not to be weak or impulsive. It's so hard... He fucked me over so bad.\n\nEdit:\nI didn\u2019t go. I stood at the terminal and waited for the train. Then I turned my back and left. I\u2019m crying but I\u2019m so relieved. I\u2019m going to tell them to cross my name from all the guest lists. I made the right decision.\n\nEdit 2:\nIt\u2019s been a rough day and evening but I still don\u2019t regret my decision. Whenever I see the new music video in my YouTube notifications or hear his music on the radio, my heart stings a little and I feel like I\u2019m out of breath. But I know that it won\u2019t last and maybe I\u2019ll be able to just forget what happened and pretend he\u2019s still this larger than life character that\u2019s out of my reach. maybe then I can listen to his music again one day without tearing up\n\nThank you everyone for cheering for me and congratulating me, it actually helped a lot to reassure myself I made the right decision", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/f2pij5/i_need_to_talk_myself_out_of_going_to_his_show/", "title": "I need to talk myself out of going to his show tonight.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "sleeparalyzis", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 664, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1581504982, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/f2pij5/i_need_to_talk_myself_out_of_going_to_his_show/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435906.4346416, "replies_charged": false}
