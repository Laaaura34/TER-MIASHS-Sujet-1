I lie in relationships when things get tough & I get so scared I\u2019m like a frazzled chihuahua who can\u2019t even speak. \nToday at 7PM I am going to tell my bf that I have cheated, I\u2019m addicted to sex, & going to tell him the whole truth & nothing but the truth. \n\nI don\u2019t know how I got here. I know I was raised that little white lies are okay & as I\u2019ve gotten older, I would speak w/ my parents & my mom would encourage the lies b/c they had reasoning behind it. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt their feelings\u201d, \u201cjust say youre busy, they don\u2019t need to know everything\u201d.\n\nI started a really hard vigorous program this year in January. I\u2019ve been nothing but stressed & I use sex as an outlet. My last affair was a couple weeks ago drunk & I made decisions I shouldn\u2019t have. \n\nI use sex as a way to de stress but I cannot always get it from the man I love. I know ppl will say that if you love someone you wouldn\u2019t be doing the things you did. It\u2019s an addiction. There\u2019s no excuse for me. But I would reason b/c I never had feelings for the others, it was fine. Just a hit it & quit it. \n\nThe first step I did yesterday was admit to him that I have a problem & im a pathological/habitual liar. \n\nI can\u2019t expect him to stay, I can\u2019t expect to understand. He says he does. Realizing how i can easily lose him is frightening. I haven\u2019t loved someone this intensely & passionately & have true love since I was married. But I made grave mistakes. I understand if he leaves. To whatever power out there, please don\u2019t let him leave but I get it if he has to. \n\nI need to shut my emotions off to tell him the truth. I don\u2019t want to. But I need to. I owe him the truth & nothing but the truth. \n\nStep one: I admit i have a problem. \nStep two: This morning, I cut off contact w/ all ppl (which is 3).\nStep three: tell the bf the truth. \nStep four: face the consequences, cry it out, & focus on what needs to be done. \n\nI have never been so terrified in my entire life. I have never been so terrified that I am nauseous & got nervous bowel movements. I\u2019m so sure I\u2019m going to lose the man of my dreams, someone who I thought could never exist. I take it all back. I wish I never did anything. I was weak minded. Scared to lose the financial security I was getting since I was giving sexual favors. \n\nBut I need to get better. I need to schedule an appointment w/ a sex therapist & a regular therapist & become better. I have to do for myself. \n\nI\u2019m taking the first step you guys. I know a shitty person. But for the first time in my life, I\u2019m accepting responsibility for my disgusting actions in a relationship. I\u2019m trying really hard. Just wanted to tell someone. \n\nI\u2019m trying. \n\n\nAlways be truthful! No matter how hard it is. It will save you more in the end. \n\n(If this doesn\u2019t follow the rules please let me know & I\u2019ll remove.
