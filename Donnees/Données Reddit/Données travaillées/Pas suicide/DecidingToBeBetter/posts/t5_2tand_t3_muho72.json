I get to work at a studio filled with creative people and work on exciting projects. It's pretty ideal as far as I can tell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne thing that's been nagging my is this slow erosion of my intrinsic motivation for art. I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar situation (not just art, can be anything) going from hobby to job, and watching your intrinsic motivation and passion to make the projects you wanted to slowly fade away. Don't get me wrong, I love my job and being creative and solving problems. But when the external factors are gone, I can't get myself to sit down and do anything. I can white knuckle it of course, but its nothing like the joy in the process I found back when I was just a student.   \n\n\nI remember from psyche class that when they offered money to someone for a task often, intrinsic motivation would be replaced by external motivation.   \n\n\nSo my real question is, has anyone got their intrinsic motivation back? Or have any insight into this phenomenon?   \n\n\nNot sure if this is the right place to post this, so if anyone can think of a better sub reddit I'm all ears.  \n\n\nThank you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/muho72/loss_of_intrinsic_motivation_for_passion_hobby/", "title": "Loss of intrinsic motivation for passion hobby /truned career.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "paper_sun", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618889308, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/muho72/loss_of_intrinsic_motivation_for_passion_hobby/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437260.2905793, "replies_charged": false}
