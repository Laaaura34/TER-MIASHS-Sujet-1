Exercising starts with pain, discomfort but all this brings out the feel good factor. My goal is to gain 60kg from 56kg, this month end i plan to buy a pull up bar, a barbell by the next, dumbbells by the following and then finally i have become the best i can be.\n\nPrior to this i started investing in other things like my teeth\ud83d\ude01, I'll be taking my oral seriously these days you know!! I bought mouth wash, an expensive toothbrush. I wear Arthur Ford cologne smelling dominant. Self improvement business is a very lucrative one, i advice anyone to try it.\n\nWow!! Before i forget i also read 2 good books so far. I plan to read 5 by the end of this year...
