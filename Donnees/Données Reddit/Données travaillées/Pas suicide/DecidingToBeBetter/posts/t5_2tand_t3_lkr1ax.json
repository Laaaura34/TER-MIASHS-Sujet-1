I lie about little things to more major things. The reason why I lie so much is because growing up, I would get into a lot of trouble (for things that are justifiable, other things just downright petty) and I felt I needed to lie so I wouldn\u2019t get into trouble. \n\nI also keep secrets, mainly from my best friend who I care deeply about. Today I told her \u201cI don\u2019t want to keep anymore secrets. I don\u2019t want to just lie to you anymore\u201d and we had a heart to heart, I basically told her a bunch of stuff I didn\u2019t tell her before but should have earlier. I\u2019m gonna be seeking a therapist pretty soon and hopefully they\u2019ll be able to help with this. \n\nBut until then, any advice you guys have to be honest and to stop lying? To stop feeling the need to keep secrets? Maybe some books that will help?
