I managed to shower but quickly and just jump back into my clothes asap, washing my hair and doing skincare was like a workout and I did it rarely. It led to some scalp health issues, dry flakey skin and my acne got worse. Recently Ive been doing better when it comes to my hair and face but because of my insecurities I hate being naked and I never moisturize my body. Well I dedicated today to self care made an appointment with a cosmetologist (and a check up with a gynecologist) and I took a long shower, did a face mask, a body scrub, moisturized my body and my face and put on some fluffy socks!!! I feel SO GOOD and fresh!!!
