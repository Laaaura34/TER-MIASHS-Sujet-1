I'm in college and fear that I won't be skilled enough by the time placements come. I dread plans cancelled with friends. I dread that I'm not spending enough time with my lover because of the pandemic. Dread that the pandemic has taken away from what I was supposed to enjoy in my youth, because I'm stuck at home with minimal freedom. \n\nNSFW part: I'd made a deal with a guy to lose our virginities together and his hinting that he wanted to back out because he'd met someone else made me break down. When he asked why it mattered to me so much, all I could say was that I was already 20, how much longer should I wait? I don't know why I feel this way particularly with respect to sexual encounters. I feel like I should be having sex ASAP or something is quite wrong with my life. It's irrational but I don't know how to justify it. Cancelled plans to have sex, people backing out of them just drive a stake through my heart. \n\nPlease advice me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ox1d92/how_to_get_rid_of_the_feeling_that_time_is/", "title": "How to get rid of the feeling that time is running out?
