I got better eventually, but thought it was too late to start.\n\nI\u2019m 27 now, and I decided to fuk it, and start from scratch! I\u2019ve created an instagram profile where I\u2019ll be sharing my practice drawings, sketches, and will document any other progress.\n\nI was wondering if there\u2019s anyone else over 20 who\u2019d like to join me on this journey? It would be fun to see each other grow, share tips and tricks, and support when we\u2019re feeling down. Also, if you think it would be fun to document it on instagram\n(you can set it to private if you don\u2019t want outsiders to see) DM me and we\u2019ll get in touch :)\n\nEDIT: woah, didn\u2019t expect this to blow up! Since there are so many learners, I\u2019m currently working on a discord for newbie artists.\n\nEDIT2: https://discord.gg/dxgn3W9W my insta: oozu.art", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pyscm5/im_27_and_i_decided_to_start_learning_how_to_draw/", "title": "I\u2019m 27 and I decided to start learning how to draw from scratch.
