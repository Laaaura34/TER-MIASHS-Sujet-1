At this rate i'm not gonna grow or flourish by sitting on my ass doing nothing. But I don't want my parents to pay for my living. That also means not going to college. The one way I can think of leaving home in going to college but considering I didn't think too hard about the first two times I pursued an education. I don't want to jump the gun, and then drop out again the third time. And it's allot harder to get out of home when you live in a town with no work. I'm really sick of making no progress at this point. Thank god i'm still only 20. Can't imagine still being in the same place 5 years from now. Just one half of my 20s completed wasted doing nothing. Avoiding that like the fucking plague.
