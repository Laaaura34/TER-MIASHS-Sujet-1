Look around you for opportunities to help others - you will feel great after, and so will they. \n3. Going to bed early and waking up early is always more rewarding than the opposite. \n4. There\u2019s \u201cNow\u201d you, and \u201cLater\u201d you - you have to decide when it is best to favour one over the other. \n5. Your decisions are almost never as important as you think - what is most important is actually making a decision. \n6. If you stop reading the news, a lot of your anxiety will suddenly disappear. \n7. Check your bank account regularly. Don\u2019t lose track of how much you\u2019ve been spending. \n8. There is a significant difference between \u201cwant\u201d and \u201cneed\u201d.\n9. Nothing will ever be perfect. \n10. A great project finished is always better than an excellent yet permanent work-in-progress. \n11. Read over your emails twice before hitting \u201cSend.\u201d\n12. You may not have much to relate to with elderly people, but they have stories that would blow your mind. Ask them. \n13. A day to yourself every week is necessary for your physical and mental health. \n14. Go to the doctor. Your fear of needles does not outweigh the value of your health. \n15. Stay in touch with people. You may move far away but you won\u2019t regret having a large social circle.\n16. It is definitely okay to go to the movies alone. I bet there\u2019ll be people there who\u2019ll wish they had the nerve to do it. \n17. Don\u2019t fall into the trap of needing to be \u201cbusy\u201d all the time. Going for a walk, reading a book, watching a movie, going out for coffee - these are all valuable ways to spend your time. \n18. If you don\u2019t want to do something, don\u2019t do it. Forcing yourself to go out if you don\u2019t want to won\u2019t lead to a great night - it will lead to you pouting in a corner. Stay in, but spend your time wisely. \n19. What you do is magnitudes more important than what you say. \n20. Don\u2019t worry about being funny and you\u2019ll be way funnier. \n21. Take a breath before you lash out at someone. \n22. Never hang up on anybody, especially your mother. \n23. Your birthday is not about you, it is about your mother. \n24. Cooking is a lot of fun if you choose to get into it. Don\u2019t follow recipes verbatim - learn to improvise and make each dish yours. \n25. Buy books at used bookstores. \n26. Go to the gym. If you really don\u2019t feel like going, just do one exercise. Short is better than none. \n27. You will never get there, so learn to enjoy the process. \n28. The world isn\u2019t as terrible as the news makes you think. \n29. Do whatever you can to preserve the environment. It\u2019s not just good-natured, it\u2019s an innate responsibility that you don\u2019t have a choice but to take part in. \n30. Whenever you feel worried about something that you cannot control, remember that worrying will do no good. If you can control it, then stop worrying and do whatever you can to fix it. \n31. Never be afraid to call people on the phone. Texting can only get you so far. \n32. If everybody likes you, it isn\u2019t real life. Wake up. \n33. Politeness has it\u2019s place, but so does bluntness, honesty, and depth. Don\u2019t be afraid to say something truthful. \n34. Don\u2019t be afraid to have an opinion, just use it respectfully. \n35. Don\u2019t get in arguments on the internet. \n36. Sex isn\u2019t nearly as great as everyone makes it seem. \n37. Your city has far more to offer than you know. \n38. Stop wishing you were someplace else and just be where you are. Your general circumstances are usually outside of your immediate control.\n39. Don\u2019t read movie reviews before you see the movie. \n40. Try genres you wouldn\u2019t think you\u2019d like, at least once. \n41. Watch films in their original language. \n42. Get involved and participate. Raise your hand when people ask for volunteers.\n43. Ask lots of questions in class. \n44. Sit in the front of the lecture hall. \n45. Taking notes doesn\u2019t work for everybody. If it doesn\u2019t work for you, then don\u2019t do it. \n46. Get to know your professor. Make sure they know your name. \n47. Pretend your due dates for assignments are a week ahead of when they actually are. Convince yourself that this pretend due date is real. \n48. Depth is generally more valuable than breadth. \n49. Other people share interests with you, no matter what they are. Find them. \n50. Market your talents and skills. \n51. Acknowledge your abilities and your limitations. Know what you\u2019re good at and what you\u2019re not. \n52. It\u2019s not your money. It belongs to society. Take it in and spend it to improve your life and the lives of those around you. \n53. You are certainly more attractive than you think you are. \n54. Always be early. \n55. If you take transit, give yourself an extra half hour every time. \n56. Don\u2019t promise anything you can\u2019t deliver just to please somebody. An honest negative always beats a deceitful positive. \n57. Under-promise and over-deliver. If you think you can get it done in 5 days, promise 7 days. You have more time and it looks good when you have it earlier.\n58. Design is important. \n59. You will meet many more interesting people if you take out your headphones and are open to interaction. \n60. Most people want to be talked to but are too afraid to talk to others. Be the one who is not afraid. \n61. Take fewer pictures, and spend more time actually seeing things with your eyes.\n62. Don\u2019t be ashamed of what you like to do, as long as it doesn\u2019t harm anybody else. \n63. Don\u2019t be afraid of being weird. Everybody is weird. \n64. High school ends, and your life blows wide open. \n65. Nostalgia is like mental heroin. It feels great but you can\u2019t live off of it. \n66. Social networks don\u2019t do as much for you as they say they do. \n67. Be willing to spend a bit more money on healthy, natural, eco-friendly food and products. Consider it a necessary expense. \n68. Buy nice clothes. You will feel good about yourself when you wear them. \n69. You\u2019ll wish you can grow facial hair until you can grow facial hair. \n70. The hours between 5am and 8am are magical. Rise early. \n71. Sometimes spending a lot of money at once on something can save you a lot more money in the long run on something else. Do the math. \n72. When you\u2019re at work, work. You owe that to your boss. \n73. It\u2019s human nature to gossip. It\u2019s fine to do it, but don\u2019t say anything you wouldn\u2019t want them to hear you say. \n74. Save \u201cHow are you?\u201d for when you actually want to know. Have real conversations with baristas and servers. \n75. Sometimes there are favours you just can\u2019t fully return. Do what you can to show your appreciation. \n76. Decorate your room however you want. It should be a place that you want to spend your time. \n77. Congratulate your friends on their success, and hope for more of it. Jealousy makes you into a jerk, and your sincere admiration will be returned to you. \n78. You can\u2019t always be a great person, and you will make lots of mistakes. When it comes down to it, do what you think you won\u2019t regret. \n79. Nobody can be as charming as George Clooney. \n80. Celebrities are just people. Treat them as such. \n81. They are also usually much shorter than you\u2019d think. \n82. After you turn 20 you really have to start giving back. \n83. Not everybody is an artist or a writer, but everybody can be creative and original.\n84. Take inspiration, not ideas. \n85. Your parents lived many years before you were born. Learn about their past. \n86. Travel doesn\u2019t have to be international, nor does it have to be expensive. \n87. If you\u2019re thinking something, chances are others are too. \n88. Look up when you\u2019re walking. The world happens at eye level. \n89. There\u2019s no shame in asking for help.\n90. Sometimes you either have it or you don\u2019t. Learn when you don\u2019t, accept it and try something else. \n91. Persistence and stubbornness are different things entirely. One will make you rich and the other will lead you into a hole.\n92. Patriotism is generally misled, bigoted, and ignorant. \n93. Borders are, for the most part, arbitrary. Be proud of where you\u2019re from but remember that you\u2019re a global citizen first. \n94. Change bad habits one at a time. You will almost always have at least one. \n95. Credit card rewards are not worth the debt. \n96. Admitting you\u2019re wrong is more important than being right. \n97. Say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d when you don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t pretend, you will look like an idiot.\n98. Flaunt your curiosity. \n99. Lists are easy to make and hard to follow. \n100. Some things can\u2019t be changed and must be accepted.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/20y33y/i_made_a_list_of_100_things_ive_learned_so_far_in/", "title": "I made a list of 100 things I've learned so far in my life.
