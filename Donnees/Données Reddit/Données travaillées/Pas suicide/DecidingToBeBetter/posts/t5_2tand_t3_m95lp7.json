Yesterday I noticed it had gotten too far. I had a job interview and was expecting a call from them this friday, but no one did. So I cried the whole afternoon telling myself this was proof nothing would ever change in my life. I realized living this way will never help me and that I want to think more positively. That might not change much or anything at all in my life but at least i'm not suffering as much as I have been.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m95lp7/finally_decided_to_stop_my_cycle_of_negative/", "title": "Finally decided to stop my cycle of negative thoughts", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "VidaCanhota", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1210, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616241575, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m95lp7/finally_decided_to_stop_my_cycle_of_negative/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437465.7297812, "replies_charged": false}
