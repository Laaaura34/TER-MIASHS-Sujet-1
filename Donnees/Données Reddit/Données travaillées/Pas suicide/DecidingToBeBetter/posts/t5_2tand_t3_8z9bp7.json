I want to be more appreciative of what I have and learn to enjoy the good things in life. Overall, be a more positive person.  What I\u2019d like is to get a tattoo that can be a constant reminder for me cool it and enjoy. Do you guys have any ideas with what this tattoo could be? A quote might be too long for me. Perhaps a single word? Or a symbol?
