I feel like a fucking loser for being in his late 20's and still living at home. I work full time, and I just don't make enough. At one point I was working 2 jobs and working 60 hrs a week. I was still struggling financially. Shit I'm so broke that I feel like no woman will want to be with me. I know that not all women are gold diggers, but I know that no woman will want to be the main supporter in the relationship. \n\nI'm trying to find a new job and I'm also trying to find new skills to learn, but I have a bit of a learning disability and I suffer from depression, so it makes it hard for me to pay attention and just stick with something.   \n\nI just feel stuck. I mean I'm happy that I'm not homeless. I'm glad that I have a good family that will let me stay with them, but I know this shit isn't going to last forever. My family is getting older and I know that once they pass away, I'm be fucked.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvitbm/i_feel_like_such_a_man_child/", "title": "I feel like such a man child", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Wh00pity_sc00p", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632615486, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvitbm/i_feel_like_such_a_man_child/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438180.192062, "replies_charged": false}
