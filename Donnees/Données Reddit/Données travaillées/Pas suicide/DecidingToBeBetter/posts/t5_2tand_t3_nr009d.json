I really am just in no mental state to accomplish anything and would stare at the wall all evening if I really could haha. \n\nCurrently my schedule is: \n\n* 4:00am - Wake up\n* 4:30am - Leave house\n* 5:00am - Get to work\n* 3:30pm - Leave work\n* 4:00pm - Arrive home\n* Assorted house chores/Make Dinner\n* Peleton Class 3x/week\n* Grad school class prep/HW/Class (~10 hrs/week + 4 hrs/week of class)\n* Spend quiet time with fianc\u00e9\n* Prep for next day (coffee/lunch/dinner clean up)\n* 9:30pm in bed\n* 10:00pm asleep\n\nAny thoughts on changes I can make to improve this? My fianc\u00e9 and I eat clean and very sparingly drink. I believe my critical opportunity is to sleep more but I do not see any way to do that and accomplish the bare minimum I need to do daily to get through the week. \n\nCurrent next thought is trying to get some clean caffeine on my way home and force myself to the gym. \n\nThanks in advance!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nr009d/need_to_find_ways_to_be_more_energeticproductive/", "title": "Need to find ways to be more energetic/productive after work!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "eagle_eye1", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622678343, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nr009d/need_to_find_ways_to_be_more_energeticproductive/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435106.7852085, "replies_charged": false}
