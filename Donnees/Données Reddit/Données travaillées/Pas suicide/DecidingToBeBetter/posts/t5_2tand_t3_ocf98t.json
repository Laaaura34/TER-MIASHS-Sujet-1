Anytime i want to pick up a new hobby or interest the only thought in my mind is hoping that people will approve of it or validate me. For example, i\u2019m trying to get back into art. but the constant thought in my mind is hoping someone will see it and approve of me. I think this stems from my self hatred/wanting to be liked. Now that i\u2019m older i\u2019m realizing I don\u2019t do a single thing for myself. Or even, I won\u2019t start anything new because I think about how there\u2019s others who are better at it than me, so there\u2019s no point of even trying. Just want to finally live for me but i feel like i\u2019m too far gone in my insecurities that at this age there\u2019s no way i can change.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ocf98t/i_feel_like_my_biggest_struggle_is_comparing/", "title": "I feel like my biggest struggle is comparing myself to other people/wanting to impress others?
