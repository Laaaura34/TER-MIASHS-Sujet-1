Overwhelmed by the \u201cpossibility\u201d that we can go anywhere and do anything, we become paralyzed by the fact that we do not know which of these \u201canythings\u201d will actually work out. Tired and hopeless, we find ourselves just living for the sake of staying alive.\n\nIn reality, there is no such thing as limitless possibilities. We each have strengths and weaknesses, things that we enjoy and things that we detest, and above all, experiences from our individual lives that closed some opportunities and opened others.\n\nRealize this, and acknowledge that instead of the \u201climitless possibilities\u201d that you were told to believe you have, you actually have only a few good choices that will fit your skills, ambitions, likes, and inclinations, and no matter how much you hope for this, there is no way of going decently through life without taking charge, making choices and giving up some things along the way.\n\nDrop the illusion of safety that your so-called \u201climitless potential\u201d is painting in your mind, let go of the myth of \u201cthe sky is the limit\u201d and take charge of your life by embracing your strengths and weaknesses.\n\nLimits and constraints will define you. The limitless potential that you might believe in, will not.\n\nCreate friction and growth in your life by knowing your boundaries and limitations and give your life purpose and direction by embracing the skills and inclinations that you actually have.\n\nKnow your limits and then decide which limits to push based on personal skills, inclinations, and preferences, rather than to live the illusion in which \"everything is possible\" and \"you can become whatever you want\".\n\nAll the best to you, reader!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/peq142/your_possibilities_are_not_limitless_remove_the/", "title": "Your Possibilities Are Not Limitless.
