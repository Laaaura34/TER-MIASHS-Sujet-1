I didn\u2019t realize I became dependent on it until last week. I tried going to bed at a normal time without drinking, and I wasn\u2019t able to fall asleep until about 2am. I tried again this weekend when I didn\u2019t really have to get up early (though I still wanted to), and again I wasn\u2019t able to sleep until past midnight both nights. I desperately want to maintain my sleep schedule so I can continue getting up early (it\u2019s the first time in my life I\u2019ve voluntarily woken up before 8am on a regular day) but I know drinking isn\u2019t the way to do it. Plus, this much drinking obviously hasn\u2019t been helping my wallet or my overall health either. \n\nI reached out to my best friend and told her I was trying not to drink over the weekend and why. Context: shes 2 years sober and im INSANELY proud of her! But she was very supportive and shared that had been one of her excuses she\u2019d use to keep drinking, but now she takes a medicine that helps her fall asleep. She recommended that if I struggled to fall asleep without drinking, I should talk to my psychiatrist. So, I already have my regular appt scheduled for the end of the month, and I\u2019m going to talk to my doctor so I can be better. For now, I do need to maintain my sleep schedule for school, but by the end of the month I\u2019ll be cutting back a LOT because I want to take care of myself better, and I don\u2019t want the problem to get even worse.
