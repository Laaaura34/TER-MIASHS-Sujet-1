I know that I have more to learn, but I am constantly stressed about making money. I feel like I have no skills. I just graduated with a BA in Film and Media, but I don't even think I have anything to show for it. I work full-time at a library, but only have enough money to cover all of my bills, and then a little more for necessities. I feel like I'm barely hanging on. I have three roommates and if one moved out tomorrow, I would be absolutely fucked. And I am planning on only having one next year, and how will that be? If one of my cats needed major vet work, done. If I had to go to the doctor, fuck me, I guess. I'm worried about paying for therapy right now, even though I have insurance. I hate feeling constantly restricted in my life. I hate relying on other people and their lives to make sure mine is intact. I hate living paycheck to paycheck, but I feel like I have no skills to actually do anything, or find a better job anywhere. I'm scared of giving up, I'm scared of trying, I'm scared of being homeless. I'm a ball of mess.
