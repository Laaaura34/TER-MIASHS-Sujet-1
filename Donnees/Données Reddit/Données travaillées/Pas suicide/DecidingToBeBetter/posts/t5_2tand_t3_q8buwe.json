I\u2019m 22 now and there has been moments where I have gone for a few months without smoking, but I always find myself picking up a dab pen or hitting my bong out of boredom. I\u2019ve been telling my friend that often times when I wake up after smoking I feel groggy and out of it. I\u2019m tired of feeling like that and accepting it as normal. Marijuana allowed me to have better laughs with friends and enjoy some great moments, but the long term use of it has done nothing beneficial for me. I\u2019m ready to move on from this pothead phase and be more clear minded and present in the choices I make.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8buwe/im_cutting_out_marijuana/", "title": "I\u2019m cutting out Marijuana", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bluehazel90", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 18, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634255513, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8buwe/im_cutting_out_marijuana/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435429.616959, "replies_charged": false}
