I don\u2019t participate in any activities at my university bc of my social anxiety so I often feel lonely, my life is kind of a mess, and it\u2019s hard for me to get motivated to actually change anything about it. I\u2019ve gotten to a point where I\u2019ve become complacent about my situation and don\u2019t actively try to change anything unless something big happens. \n\nFor example, two years ago I told my friend I had feelings for him but he didn\u2019t feel the same way. So for the first couple of months afterwards, I was really trying to overcome my issues bc I was in a lot of pain (I even went to therapy), but once that pain subsided I stopped trying. Earlier this year, I told him that I still liked him (I thought this time was different) but he rejected me again, and for the first couple of months it was the same thing: I tried changing my maladaptive thoughts, improving my self-esteem, working on my social anxiety, and so on. But again, I stopped trying.\n\nIt\u2019s become clear to me that I\u2019m only motivated to change when my situation causes me a lot of pain, and I hate that. If I\u2019m only trying to change in response to things like this, then it\u2019s because I don\u2019t even have enough love for myself to want to change *for me* regardless of what\u2019s happening in my life. So my question is: how do I motivate myself to change in spite of the fact that I\u2019ve become complacent with my situation? And how do I sow that necessary self-love to want to change for myself?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gijyvm/how_can_i_be_motivated_to_change_even_when_things/", "title": "How can I be motivated to change even when things are \u201cok\u201d?
