In all aspects of life, I only ever do what is compulsory, or what I need to do to avoid getting into trouble. \n\nAt university, I do my coursework the day before it\u2019s due, settle for below average grades and don\u2019t bother with any extra work - just turn up to class, don\u2019t listen, leave, submit a half assed essay and repeat.  \n\nOnce upon a time I was an ambitious teenager wanting to be a doctor or a teacher, get a first class degree and make lots of money. Now I can\u2019t be bothered with anything more than the bare minimum. \u2018Why waste time trying so hard to get to places I probably won\u2019t reach, when I can enjoy my life by playing video games and drinking with friends\u2019 \n\nI don\u2019t know what happened, but somewhere along the way I lost my drive. I used to write stories in the hopes of publishing a book one day in the future (my ultimate life goal), but I have since stopped bothering because \u2018it\u2019ll take too long to get there\u2026 what\u2019s the likelihood it\u2019ll actually happen anyway.. I\u2019m wasting my time on something that likely won\u2019t happen\u2019. It\u2019s the same with learning guitar.\n\nPlease help me. I saw a post recently from someone resenting their child for being the successful person they wish they were. I feel like that will be me in 20 years.\n\nEdit: I REALLY appreciate all of the lovely comments and tips and stories and books you guys have shared. Seriously. Wow. Thank you so much, I\u2019ll hopefully eventually respond to everyone, but for now please take my THANK YOU!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbx2td/im_terrified_of_my_extremely_average_and_lazy/", "title": "I\u2019m terrified of my extremely average and lazy lifestyle, but how do I change?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Silliest-Goose", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1069, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634722742, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbx2td/im_terrified_of_my_extremely_average_and_lazy/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436922.9785051, "replies_charged": false}
