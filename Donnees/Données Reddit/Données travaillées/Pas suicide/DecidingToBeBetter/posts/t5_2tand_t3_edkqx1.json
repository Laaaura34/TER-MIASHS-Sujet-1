But she said it in a way that hurt my feelings, and shocked my other coworkers, and made me feel frustrated instead of guided. I asked her to please be kinder with me but also let her know that I want to take her advice, and that if I have been rude or sassy to her (which may have insighted the way she spoke to me) to let me know, so we don't have bad attitudes around eachother.\n\nIt feels so empowering to communicate over issues instead of letting them fester into bad feelings and gossip. I don't want to be an overly sensitive or whiney person, but I absolutely want to be a person who doesn't allow other's to hurt me and learns to work harmoniously with others.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/edkqx1/told_my_boss_off_today/", "title": "Told my boss off today!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Raliegh96", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1576899719, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/edkqx1/told_my_boss_off_today/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437132.029435, "replies_charged": false}
