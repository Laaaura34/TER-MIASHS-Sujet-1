Then 3 years ago I spent time with my friends and really enjoyed life. My grades suffered a lot in those years and I felt I had wasted my life. \nI was depressed but I pulled myself back, studied hard and got myself into a top college in my country.\nBut now the study pressure here is crazy. Everyone seems to be way ahead of me and no matter how much I push I seem to be lagging behind.\nI have to alienate myself from my friends even more. My relationship with my gf has suffered a lot. She thinks I don't give her enough time. I have developed leisure guilt, simple leisure activities like reading a novel fill me with guilt and anxiety now.\nHow do you find the balance to live a productive life and also find time for yourself?
