I have a great job finally with a future. I have a beautiful woman who cares about me and just wants me to be happy. I have great friends. I\u2019m on a straight road to everything I\u2019ve been dreaming about achieving... but I\u2019m terrified. I\u2019m scared of my past. I\u2019m scared of being vulnerable. I\u2019m scared of growing up. I\u2019m scared to let people see the real me. It\u2019s caused outbursts of anger to cover my fear. I\u2019ve felt unhinged from reality. I\u2019ve been dealing with massive amounts of anxiety because I\u2019m over thinking and worrying and feeling like I\u2019m losing control of my life and my friends and family don\u2019t seem to really understand. Lately my partner has been suggesting I seek a professional to talk to and that only makes me feel weak. But I think having that neutral person would be very beneficial I just don\u2019t know where to start. I\u2019ve decided to fully commit to this I just don\u2019t know where to begin.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gubmba/ive_started_removing_the_armor_i_created_through/", "title": "I\u2019ve started removing the \u201carmor\u201d I created through hate, anger, lies, and drugs.
