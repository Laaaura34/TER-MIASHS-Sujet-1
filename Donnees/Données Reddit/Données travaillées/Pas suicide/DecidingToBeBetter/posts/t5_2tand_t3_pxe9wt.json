Last time I went to a funfair, I was extremely scared of going on a roller coaster to the point of tears & my best friend had to talk me through & sit through it with me. (during that time I wasnt really taking my mental health seriously. I was aware of my anxiety but wasnt really doing much to deal with it). 4 years later I have been consistently taking my sertraline, working out & meditating. I went to a theme park w huge rides & went on every single dramatic roller coaster & enjoyed every minute of it. Im 100% sure its bcos I decided to take care of my mental health n really focus. This has motivated me to continue because its enabling me to do the things I remembered doing.
