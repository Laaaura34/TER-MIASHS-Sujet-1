I guess I\u2019d really like some suggestions on how to feel better as I have no idea where to begin to move past this stage in my life and grow and flourish as a person. I hope this is allowed in this sub. If not, I\u2019ll delete it. \n\n\nIdk how coherent my thoughts are atm. I\u2019m also just going to say the first adjective(?) that cones to mind and feels right, no matter how much or little sense they make.\n\nLately I\u2019ve been feeling like my spirit/body/soul is clogged, like it\u2019s been used and abused and it needs to be cleansed and freed. I think one of the major reasons for this is because I was raped a few months ago. I\u2019ve been dealing with depression for years beforehand but I\u2019ve mostly felt \u201cmyself\u201d and free. I can always tell when I\u2019m not feeling this way as I can see the way people act when we interact. When I\u2019m feeling myself, I feel energised by people\u2019s presence and vice versa. When I\u2019m not, I\u2019m sure they can feel my energy shift. This has lead me to believe auras are real. I\u2019ve always felt like an outsider but now I just feel incredibly lost. This has lead me to partake in some questionable behaviour, like casual sex, being more risky with drugs, neglecting my studies a bit, and I just want it to stop. I guess I want to find and free myself, but how?? I don\u2019t know what to believe in or do anymore.
