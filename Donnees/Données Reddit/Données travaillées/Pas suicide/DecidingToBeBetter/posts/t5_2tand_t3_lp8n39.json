But if you step too far things can get out of hand. If you commit to stuff that's not \"you\" you may just build a facade rather than actual\u00f6y improve yourself. At least that's how I see it, feel free to challenge my thinking.\n\nSo, how do you step out of your comfort zone in a healthy way? Have been in a situation where your asked yourself the same question?\n\nExcited for your comments!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lp8n39/how_do_you_differenciate_between_things_out_of/", "title": "How do you differenciate between things out of your comfort zone and out of your character?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "NotComicButSans", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 22, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613947400, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lp8n39/how_do_you_differenciate_between_things_out_of/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435956.9750514, "replies_charged": false}
