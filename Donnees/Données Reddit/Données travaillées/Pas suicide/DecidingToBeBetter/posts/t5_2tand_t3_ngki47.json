Sleep quality is sub-par, no matter what I do I can't seem to get more than 7h or less of sleep per day. This makes me anxious and depressed then rinse and repeat.    \n\nI have the will to do better and I'm not giving up but I'm constantly running on 40% battery. I don't know how to break this cycle, any advice ?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ngki47/how_to_break_the_cycle/", "title": "How to break the cycle", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "STOCHASTIC_LIFE", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1621466892, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ngki47/how_to_break_the_cycle/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437668.7821896, "replies_charged": false}
