I got into fitness my sophomore year of college but after going through a traumatic event my PTSD and depression I developed bad eating habits that led to me gaining 50 pounds by the time I graduated from college. I tried a million \u201c30 day fixes\u201d and would lose about 10 pounds but it wasn\u2019t sustainable and I would go back to my old habits right after. My husband and I welcomed our daughter to the world in January and even though I was overjoyed becoming a mother, I was depressed because I had gained an additional 53 pounds during my pregnancy and felt awful about myself. Once I got cleared to workout on March 1st I\u2019ve committed to eating healthy in a way that I can sustain, and set a goal of being active every single day for an entire year. This includes going to the gym, taking my daughter on a walk, or doing yoga. I\u2019m almost 120 days into this and am feeling amazing, I\u2019ve also lost 60 pounds! I know it\u2019s cliche, but really embracing consistency over perfection has been a lifesaver and I\u2019m excited to keep seeing progress!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o6drfd/ive_lost_all_the_baby_weight_and_am_continuing_to/", "title": "I\u2019ve lost all the baby weight and am continuing to make consistent progress, in a HEALTHY way!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "theinfamousharvey", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 25, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624458025, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o6drfd/ive_lost_all_the_baby_weight_and_am_continuing_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438328.8689883, "replies_charged": false}
