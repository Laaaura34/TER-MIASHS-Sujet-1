I\u2019ve dropped out of college twice now, but am registered at my local community college for this upcoming semester. \n\nI realized that balancing a full time job and going to school aren\u2019t attainable for me so I quit my job. I don\u2019t have any financial support coming from my family, so this was a scary decision for me. I have enough savings to survive for awhile and ultimately, this choice aligns with who I am and for that reason I stand by it.\n\nI want more out of life than being someone\u2019s assistant, renting rooms in crappy apartment complexes, and driving a beater car. \n\nI want an education and to follow through with a goal. \n\nI\u2019ve readjusted my focus from doing well at work to applying myself to studying. Whatever job I take will be viewed as dispensable instead of somewhere to grow. \n\nI am nervous about this change, if anyone has advice about student loans or applying for grants I would greatly appreciate your insight.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o9y42t/after_dropping_out_twice_im_going_back_to_college/", "title": "After dropping out twice, I\u2019m going back to college", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Early-March-5553", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 852, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624930154, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o9y42t/after_dropping_out_twice_im_going_back_to_college/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435234.0548732, "replies_charged": false}
