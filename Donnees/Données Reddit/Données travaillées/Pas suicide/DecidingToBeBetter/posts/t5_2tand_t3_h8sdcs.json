But I know I\u2019m capable of being the outwardly strong woman I am inside. I just want to know how to get past such social anxiety and such a fear of confrontation.\n\n\nThrowaway cuz anxiety. I\u2019m oversensitive. A wimp. Whatever you want to call it. I wasn\u2019t always this way, but I guess years of verbal abuse and having your self esteem worn down can change a person. Anyway, I\u2019m not posting this for pity. Hell to the no. Rather, I just want to be able to fucking handle ANY kind of confrontation or interaction that isn\u2019t super pleasant and agreeable, both online and especially in person. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I just lurk on my main account, not only because I don\u2019t have much to say, but also I just fear that feeling of rejection, which is ridiculous something as insignificant as a downvote button or a troll comment could cause. But it does. I am *so* ~~admirable~~ admiring of the people in my life who are so outspoken and confident in potentially tense circumstances. I share those same values, the ones where I stand up for what I believe in, it\u2019s why I write music and write so passionately; I guess it\u2019s easier to express myself that way. But when it comes to any sort of clash, conflict, or even a *hint* of just plain meanness, I curl up into a metaphorical ball inside. \n\n\nLike, even if I do post something, I\u2019ll immediately exit out of Reddit for at least a few hours in fear of facing potential assholes. When I log back in and see I have unread messages, I literally squint and hover my thumb over the text, only revealing one word at a time to determine whether or not it\u2019ll be a nice comment or a mean one.\n\n\nIsn\u2019t that dumb? I\u2019m an almost 25 year old woman, and people still fucking scare me. I fear confrontation because I fear conflict, and I fear conflict because I fear being yelled at, belittled, and/or disapproval/not being enough. Obviously this stems from an entire childhood and adolescence with a verbally abusive parent, but the point is, I\u2019ve been on anti anxiety and anti depressant medications since January. While the depressive symptoms have gotten better, I\u2019m still very anxious, *especially* when dealing with people.\n\nI *know* people are just people, words are just words, trolls are bored cynics who thrive on this kind of effect their hateful words could have on someone like me, and they don\u2019t deserve that satisfaction. What matters most is sticking to my beliefs and thinking strongly for myself. I know all of this. Yet when a circumstance arises, all of that goes out of the window in my brain and I just become this small, silenced little girl again who is terrified to speak up for herself or that she might do the wrong thing. Or who feels she\u2019s just not enough, everything she may say or do is wrong.\n\nHow can I work through this and change this part of who I am?\n\n\nThis sub is pretty cool so I think I\u2019ll stick around for a few before succumbing to the anxiety and disappearing, but I\u2019ll be back because I would really appreciate any advice!\n\nE: yep I\u2019m gonna be that person adding an edit hours later because holy shit guys. I really didn\u2019t expect this to get much traction, just maybe a reply or two and that would\u2019ve been okay with me! But the amount of advice, encouragement and empathy I\u2019ve received feels so good. I\u2019m a bit overwhelmed with all of the comments so I apologize if I don\u2019t reply but I will read *every* single one with gratitude, and on the off chance there are any naysayers here or in the future, I will just keep my head up and shrug the comments off as I block em :) anyway, sadly therapy is very expensive here in the US of A, even with my insurance I\u2019ve got to reach my (high) deductible before anything is covered. BUT, obviously medication alone isn\u2019t helping and I\u2019d like to overcome this no matter what so I\u2019ll be looking into siding scale Psychologists for some CBT. I\u2019ll also be checking out ALL of the literature you guys suggested. Seriously, this is the shit I\u2019m here for in life. People just being decent people to one another. Thank you all!\n\nE2 a day later: hello so I coincidentally posted this while in the midst of a *butt load* of school work, as I\u2019ve just started back in college after taking a few years off :) I\u2019m reading *every* single comment (and re-reading/saving quite a few) because they have been such a comfort and reassurance. You guys are, in short, fucking awesome. Thank you. I\u2019m currently beating myself up (just a tiny bit) for not taking the time to respond to each of you lol because that\u2019s how my brain works, but know I\u2019m super grateful and also happy to know others could relate. If my post resonated with you, please read these responses (or perhaps even your own). You deserve/owe yourselves better, just as I know I do as well. Be sure to take care of you!
