I've listened to and read many near death experiences where they were met with love and comfort. In addition they were able to explain so many things around them while being \"dead\". Things like this make me want to believe in God, but I still have my doubts nonetheless. Overall, I do want to believe, but a side of me looking for facts remains unsatisfied. For the people that have strong Faith and wholeheartedly believe in God and heaven, what keeps you going? How do you will yourselves to believe against all the odds?\n\nEdit: thank you all who have posted, you've been a tremendous help. I'm expecting to have this question in my mind for a while, but I know that I shouldn't let it consume me. You guys have really brought up good points, and I look towards making the most of this life :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8wkbs9/hard_time_trying_to_find_religion/", "title": "Hard time trying to find religion", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "32bugsy64", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1530885862, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8wkbs9/hard_time_trying_to_find_religion/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437180.8397398, "replies_charged": false}
