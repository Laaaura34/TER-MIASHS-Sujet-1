My old life, torn to shreds... there is no turning back. But I can't help and remorse the goodness of the past. It was truly an incredible chapter, was it not? The chain of memories will forever be preserved within my heart, for they guide me as I seek solace.\n\nWe both know it was something words could not describe, our love that is. I know you will be okay.. you will find true happiness, I'm sure of it. You deserve it, with a noble soul that is so rare to find in this age in time, you deserve it more than all.\n\nThe chapter we shared was bliss right?\n\nThe adventures we had, oh how amazing was it to be able to explore this world with you. You showed me that this planet is beautiful and it has opened my eyes to see the life in a different perspective. I honestly cannot thank you enough, for all of what you did.\n\nDearly Beloved, you will always have a piece of my heart and soul.... but I have to close this page now, and begin a new chapter.\n\nI'm sorry I could not save you from myself..\n\nM.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8ytqn4/looking_back_in_admiration/", "title": "Looking back in admiration..", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "canihavesomehope", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1531579513, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8ytqn4/looking_back_in_admiration/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435655.5490549, "replies_charged": false}
