I'm gonna gather them up in a box and bring them to her house. I had a really close call today where I nearly relapsed and decided enough is enough. This is something that honestly should have happened a long time ago but I'm doing it now because I need to put this awful habit behind me. I'm really nervous about how I'll cope in the times when I feel I *really* need it and if this will just lead to me doing it another way, but we'll see.\n\nWish me luck!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfzhr9/turning_in_the_sharp_things_tomorrow/", "title": "Turning in the sharp things tomorrow", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TyroneYeBoue", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 21, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635226163, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfzhr9/turning_in_the_sharp_things_tomorrow/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437437.2022948, "replies_charged": false}
