However, sometimes, I feel like my happiness hinges directly on the people around me, regardless of whether the feeling is directed at me. \n\nThere\u2019s this tense atmosphere that pervades my home and simmers under the surface of a decent family life: disagreements, grudges, regrets and all that other stuff. Despite how cheery the family looks like at face value, I can\u2019t shake off the underlying negative emotions that run through the house. I\u2019m not too sure whether it\u2019s hard to be happy being in the family, or it\u2019s just hard to be happy for me overall. \n\nWhen my mother gets mad at my brother for screwing up his tests, my mood gets affected too. I still get affected by the fact that I didn\u2019t get into medicine 3 years ago; not because it\u2019s my lifelong dream, but because there\u2019s this feeling of disappointment and \u201csettling for less\u201d I feel in my parents. \n\nI\u2019m not too sure how to generate happiness by myself. I feel like if I go about trying to be happy when everybody\u2019s sad, I\u2019ll end up looking like a fool who can\u2019t read the atmosphere. I feel like I need some external source to affirm my happiness and reflect it to me in a feedback loop, otherwise I can\u2019t stay happy for long, and I\u2019m not too sure why.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5ahko/how_can_i_be_happy_without_the_input_of_outside/", "title": "How can I be happy without the input of outside people?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "electricloogaboo", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629095155, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5ahko/how_can_i_be_happy_without_the_input_of_outside/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437106.232681, "replies_charged": false}
