The more hurt you can take, it proves that you are still on top of the hurt. The moment you say, \u2018I cannot take anymore\u2019, the moment you start blocking hurt that is the moment when hurt has won.\n\nThe reward of the one who is capable of taking wounds is that he gets more wounds.\n\nI once met a young girl and she had a crystal in her palm and forcefully, almost violently, she was again and again, banging it against the floor, throwing it at the walls. I asked her, \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019 She said, \u2018Because I have been told that it cannot be broken.\u2019 When you are somebody who cannot be broken, your reward will be that you will receive more and more banging against the floor and the wall. The whole existence will know that you are unbreakable. So, you can take a little more of thrashing, pounding, beating.\n\nThe more thrashing you are able to take, the more pounding you are receiving, the more it is certain that you are capable of taking it. Hence, the more it is certain that whatever the world is throwing at you does not really affect you, bother you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fhzrku/joy_lies_in_your_capacity_to_take_hurt/", "title": "Joy lies in your capacity to take hurt", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AcharyaPrashant_", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1584106677, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fhzrku/joy_lies_in_your_capacity_to_take_hurt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437304.2214882, "replies_charged": false}
