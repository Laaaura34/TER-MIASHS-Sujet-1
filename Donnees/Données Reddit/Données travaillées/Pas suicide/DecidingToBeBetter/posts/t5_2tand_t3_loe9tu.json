I'm cutting out coffee as much as possible as I have digestive/nervous system issues and think it could help. Usually it's 2-3 cups a day that I \"burn off\" at work including one in the morning, but I've only had one or two this week (weekend treats.) I've been hit with headaches like nothing I've had before and had to take ibuprofen (which I never do). With my existing conditions it can be difficult to tell what's what sometimes, can anyone tell me if it's always this bad? How long will it last? Cheers!\n\n(Hope this doesn't break any rules, please delete if so.)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/loe9tu/is_caffeine_withdrawal_this_bad/", "title": "Is caffeine withdrawal this bad?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SlowConsideration7", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613848299, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/loe9tu/is_caffeine_withdrawal_this_bad/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435901.46288, "replies_charged": false}
