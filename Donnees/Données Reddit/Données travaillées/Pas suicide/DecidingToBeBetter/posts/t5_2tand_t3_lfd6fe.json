I\u2019m working on myself, I\u2019ve started CBT and got a therapist, trying to meditate daily and I\u2019ve stopped drinking (this was a big step for me as I always used alcohol as a tool to cope) I\u2019m nearly 3 weeks sober! \n\nSome days are tougher than others but I know things will be better on the other side. Good luck to all of you who have made the decision to be a better version of yourselves.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the awards kind strangers! My first Reddit awards.... it can only get better for here on out.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lfd6fe/it_time_to_change/", "title": "It time to change.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "IBTWSCL", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 505, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612795333, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lfd6fe/it_time_to_change/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436151.7043264, "replies_charged": false}
