He intended to show me something on the left screen and didn\u2019t expect that the right screen would share first and before he closed it I happened to see some open tabs filled with videos and forums dedicated to a certain fetish. \nI\u2019m not sure if he knows that I saw or not and when we got off the call my first impulse was to \u201cconfide\u201d in my SO what I had seen. I was also tempted to tell another friend but I decided to keep it to myself without telling anybody. A few years ago I would not have been able to resist the urge to gossip and I\u2019m proud of myself for respecting my friend and myself highly enough to mind my own business.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/paz61v/decided_not_to_gossip/", "title": "Decided not to gossip", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Unlucky_Af_", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1175, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629848291, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/paz61v/decided_not_to_gossip/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437932.5752347, "replies_charged": false}
