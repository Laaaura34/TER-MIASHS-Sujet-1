None of that constant push and pull, hot and cold dynamic was doing me any favors. You were an unattentive, uncaring leech who never deserved me and I was finally strong enough to show you to your place: the garbage bin.\n\nHowever, during those periods when we DID text (read: sext), I loved it. I read somewhere that sex with emotionally unavailable partners only seems amazing because they're starving you out of intimacy and sex is the only time you truly feel close to them.\n\nSo I kept screenshots of those dirty texts, your dominant words, your hard dick, that video of you jacking off to my pics, and whenever I felt like I needed a safe dosage of you, I'd go through them and masturbate. It was safer and smarter than unblocking and messaging you.\n\nBut it probably isn't healthy. You treated me like shit, and going back to those morsels of \"good\" times for a quick release of endorphins doesn't seem or feel right anymore. I can get myself off in other ways.\n\nAnyways, am I the only one who did this? If not, I'm curious to know how you feel about it, how you rationalize masturbating to your toxic ex, do you still do it and/or what made you stop.\n\nStay strong, y'all!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mmc6f0/a_few_minutes_ago_i_deleted_some_dirty_texts_that/", "title": "A few minutes ago I deleted some dirty texts that I'd always go back to.
