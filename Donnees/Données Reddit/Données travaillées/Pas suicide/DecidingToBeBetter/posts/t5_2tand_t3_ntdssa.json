By myself, I\u2019ve tapered my .5 Xanax 3 times a day down to breaking my .25 in half 3 times a day. So I\u2019m really taking very little. I\u2019m afraid though. If I feel withdrawals, that will remind me of my ptsd and make things so much harder. I\u2019m too far ahead to go back to those days of dread and derealization. I really want off Xanax. I\u2019m not sure I should, my doc isn\u2019t encouraging me to come off. What do I do? I feel like I\u2019m ready but how do I taper off more? Does anyone take this low of a dose? It might seem laughable but it\u2019s the way I cope. I can find zero resources of this small of a dose and what the affects will be if I stop. I\u2019m scared of symptoms and I\u2019m desperately trying to avoid them. I\u2019ve been on Xanax daily for 2 years. I\u2019ve been on half of the .25, 3 times a day for 6 months. I just really want off the Xanax. Any thoughts are welcome and appreciated.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ntdssa/low_dose_xanax_anyone/", "title": "Low dose Xanax anyone?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "cherryblossom2021", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622954778, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ntdssa/low_dose_xanax_anyone/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438346.2962708, "replies_charged": false}
