I\u2019m looking around for something better but there\u2019s not a lot out there right now. \n\nMy wife and family know there\u2019s something wrong but I don\u2019t really want to talk about it with them (dad shows no weakness, you know the drill). \n\nI feel like I have a big hole where I used to fill my days with \u2018fun\u2019 stuff, now I can\u2019t wait for the day to finish so I can go back to bed. \n\nI know I need to make a change. I wanted to ask you all what you did that make you feel better, not necessarily more successful or educated. Just something that felt worthwhile, something that made you want to get out of bed. \n\nThanks", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ki9bf4/what_change_has_had_the_biggest_best_positive/", "title": "What change has had the biggest (best) positive influence on your life?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LAPORTS", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1608656695, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ki9bf4/what_change_has_had_the_biggest_best_positive/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438123.0421863, "replies_charged": false}
