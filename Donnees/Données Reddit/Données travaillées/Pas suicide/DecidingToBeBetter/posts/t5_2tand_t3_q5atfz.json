It started off long distance and was amazing until we began to live with each other just over a year ago. Without going into the details, she pointed out how selfish I can be from little things to bigger ones and I completely agree with her. After reflecting on it I realized my family very much promotes being selfish but I don\u2019t want that to be an excuse anymore. I don\u2019t want to continue to be this way but I\u2019m not sure where to start. Telling myself to think about her needs/desires more often than I currently do hasn\u2019t worked in the moment on many occasions. Does anybody here know of books or resources that has helped them become less selfish? Anything useful is much appreciated.
