Yet I am stuck at home for the next 4 months at least. I have been sleeping extremely late (2 AM) and waking up minutes before my online lectures. And that too because my parents wake me up. I cannot fall asleep early, I cannot wake up early. I do not consume caffeine after 11 AM in the warning.  No alcohol, no drugs. I have chosen today, April 9, 2021, to be the day I fix my sleep schedule for good. My birthday is in a month, and this is the best birthday gift I will give myself. I request you to advise me on how to do this. Please. I beg you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mnc4eb/improving_my_sleep_schedule/", "title": "Improving My Sleep Schedule.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Legend_Of_LosAlamos1", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617953813, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mnc4eb/improving_my_sleep_schedule/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436871.4736507, "replies_charged": false}
