No close friends, never asked a lady out, never married or divorced or had children, just loneliness. I never developed a hobby enough to call it a passion. Never built anything unique or beautiful or special, and I was never beautiful or unique or special for anyone either. I'm a software developed but that's it, struggling to even get up.  \n\nPersonally, I do not like living anymore, but that does not mean I hate life, I just walk-sleeped through it: No risks, no fun, no passion in it, no tragedies, no drama. Dull and boring. I cannot leave life without hurting the family I love, so no quick exit from this limbo hell.\n\nBTW I'm not blaming anyone but myself.  At this point I think I given up on most of life, but I hope that anyone in his or her teens and 20s considers how my life went and don't make the same mistake.\n\nTake risk. Get hurt. Live, Love, Hate. Laugh and Cry. Do what others say but try doing the opposite too.\n\nAt this point I'm just trying to limit my loss and get to live in peace until I die and finally shut down forever this pathetic lifeline.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/", "title": "My wasted youth; please don't make the same mistake", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Eresssea", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1481, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633758062, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4f2tk/my_wasted_youth_please_dont_make_the_same_mistake/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435331.748918, "replies_charged": false}
