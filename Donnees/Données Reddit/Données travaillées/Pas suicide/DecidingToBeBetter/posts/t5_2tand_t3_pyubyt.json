I've always been someone who either needs to be absolutely shattered, otherwise I can't just decide to go to bed. I've tried all the advice on relaxing your body & face, breathing, avoiding light etc, however the improvements are negligible. If I do happen to get a good night's sleep one night, the next night I'll be too well rested to fall asleep. It's so annoying because I know this is the only thing that I don't have full control over, hence the one thing that feels like I'm leaving up to chance. Do I just have to accept that I can't control what time I can fall asleep, but can control when I wake up? Grit through more 2 hour sleep nights until my body gets the message? \n\nFor those who this sounds familiar, do you have any advice on how to reliably get to bed early and wake up early.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pyubyt/biggest_hurdle_to_being_better_is_not_being_able/", "title": "Biggest hurdle to being better is not being able to fall asleep!!!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "sammyybaddyy", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633040432, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pyubyt/biggest_hurdle_to_being_better_is_not_being_able/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438037.0638816, "replies_charged": false}
