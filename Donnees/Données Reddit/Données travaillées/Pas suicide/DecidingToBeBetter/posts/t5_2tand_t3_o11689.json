I just summarize my night and morning once, and summarize my afternoon/early night once. I treat it more like a diary.\n\nIs there a way to help yourself address your anxious thoughts and triggers when they happen? I'd like to do that in written form since talking it out loud doesn't really work, and I want to make progress by myself between therapy sessions. I also have to add that lately I've been lacking confidence and faith that I'll be able to get out of this current anxious period, so it's even harder for me to believe in myself now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o11689/is_there_a_methodworksheet_similar_to_journaling/", "title": "Is there a method/worksheet similar to journaling?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "anxiety___throw", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623837072, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o11689/is_there_a_methodworksheet_similar_to_journaling/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435785.7050216, "replies_charged": false}
