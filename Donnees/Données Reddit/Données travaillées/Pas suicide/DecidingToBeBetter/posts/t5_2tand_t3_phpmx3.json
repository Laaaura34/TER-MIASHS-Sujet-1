I have full-time school, a part-time job (which at some parts of the year turns into full-time hours), I\u2019m in a long-term relationship, and have other commitments to my family and friends and my own well being.\n\nAnother important fact is that I move at turtle speed: not literally, but everyone just does things way faster than I do. I\u2019m not making it up, yesterday I had my entire family helping me move into my apartment and they were all carrying boxes left and right. Meanwhile, I couldn\u2019t go at the same speed as any of them without going crazy. I also can\u2019t talk and do other things at the same time, that\u2019s how dumb my brain is, I\u2019m just not able to multitask at all.\n\nI\u2019m really tired of the way my brain works because it\u2019s holding me back in life. Every day, I\u2019m telling people that I\u2019ll do a task, and saying yea when someone asks me to do something, only to either do it too late, or forget to do it at all. I kid you not, this happens every single day. I try writing things down but I can never seem to remember to write down everything, like what if I don\u2019t have something to write with in my hand? Let\u2019s say I write it on a sticky note, how will I remember to write it on my master list? I also agree to plans that I totally think are doable, but then the time comes and I\u2019m running out of time! Hence I\u2019m late to do anything. I tried that trick where you give yourself ample amount of time to get things done, but that\u2019s not feasible with a pretty heavy school and work schedule.\n\nDoes anyone have any better advice for someone who\u2019s very forgetful and slow like me to make sure I\u2019m not letting others in my life down?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/phpmx3/i_dont_do_what_i_say_i_was_gonna_do_help/", "title": "I don\u2019t do what I say I was gonna do.
