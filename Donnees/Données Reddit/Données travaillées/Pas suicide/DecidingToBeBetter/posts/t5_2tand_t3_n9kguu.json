I say to you today continue your process. Heal. Hug yourself and allow small moments to come into your eyes where you stop and smell a flower on the same path you travel daily that you never noticed because your focus is miles ahead blocks maybe. \nHeal your inner child by allowing it to lead you in moments where your adult self is conflicted with defensive measures. Remember your 16 year old self. Your dreams and pleasure. Forgive those who transgressed for they only repeated lessons. Kiss those whose action hold you back for fear of again feeling what will come no more. Understanding that we love our way into experiences that may be our loved ones karma only to leave scorned with battle wounds wore as honor. So I say today be gentle with self. Ease into the day with your beautiful radiant true self. Set intentions yet allow the day to also reveal its true self \ud83c\udf39#lovebegetslove", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n9kguu/be_gentle_with_yourself/", "title": "Be gentle with yourself.....", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Truf_kees", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 23, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1620693023, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n9kguu/be_gentle_with_yourself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437751.5912716, "replies_charged": false}
