Her patience is very thin and whenever someone lies or talks behind her back or triggers her in a argument she shouts very loudly and sometimes also tends to physically assault (though me and my family stop her from doing so) and she\u2019s also been depressed since ages but the antidepressant haven\u2019t been helping her. She wants to calm herself down but she says that she can\u2019t think with a clear mind in that moment. She wants to know if there is anyways she can make herself better and is open to suggestions and advice.
