I found some friends who agreed to move in with me and for two years I was just enjoying life. Eventually though I began to feel aimless and like I wasn\u2019t going anywhere and decided to go back to school. I took a couple of classes a semester (it was all I could afford) but still wasn\u2019t taking things seriously. I finally got my wake up call in organic chemistry though, both due to the difficulty and an amazing professor who helped me see my own potential. He helped me get my life back on track and I owe a large portion of my current success to him!\n\nAfter 9 years of undergraduate studies, clawing my way back from a 2.3 sophomore gpa to a 3.49 graduating gpa, 2 MCATs, 4 application cycles, countless rejections and people telling me I\u2019d probably better start looking for a new dream, I officially can say I have been accepted to a medical school and will begin in July of 2022! It\u2019s been my dream since I was 5 so I\u2019m more excited than I can put into words. \n\nNever give up guys and gals, you\u2019re only one \u201cyes\u201d away from beginning your success!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qa9mld/started_my_20s_with_a_18_gpa_and_homeless_ended/", "title": "Started my 20\u2019s with a 1.8 gpa and homeless, ended my 20\u2019s (turned 30 at the beginning of the month) finding out I\u2019m going to be a doctor and in a 7 year long amazing relationship.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SaiyanStrong117", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2595, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634510919, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qa9mld/started_my_20s_with_a_18_gpa_and_homeless_ended/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436112.4534621, "replies_charged": false}
