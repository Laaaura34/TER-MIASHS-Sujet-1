I was diagnosed adhd at 9 and again at 29. Since I started taking Ritalin early this year, my life has mostly changed for the better. I still have some things I need to work on. My anxiety and stress management haven\u2019t decreased at all. \n\nI started going back to school, I ditched my low paying  receptionist job and got a job in my field of study. The people at the new gig know I\u2019m a student and that I have *some* previous relevant experience. \n\nMost people are working from due to covid (which is cool). My role is newly created and I\u2019m the first in the seat. I was given access to all the company docs and files and was told to have a look through and to get to know all the products. Everything is scattered all over the place haphazardly and mixed with old and new documents. It\u2019s a nightmare. I\u2019m on my second week as a coordinator and I still don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to be doing or how I\u2019m supposed to be doing it. I feel a bit put off by not having any training lined up except for some of the random meetings with other departments that were mostly scheduled haphazardly also. Which I had to mostly reschedule. I know I\u2019m hired as a coordinator, but I\u2019m new to the industry in which I\u2019m working in and of course, new to the company. Since I\u2019m the first and only person in this role, they have two more openings for the same role in different locations, but I don\u2019t see them advertised anywhere. Which makes me even more weary that I\u2019m just the guinea pig on a 90 day trial. \n\nI have no idea how to navigate this situation. A perfect example of why I\u2019m here. I get stressed so easily. I\u2019m awkward in the work place. I clearly lack confidence. \n\nI\u2019m looking for some kind of resource for some kind of stress management/job coach thing. I have no idea where to start. I\u2019ve always been easily intimidated and self conscious, especially at work. I can\u2019t help but feel like the dumbest person in the room or the last person last person to get the punchline.
