I made fitness an important part of my life and lost over thirty pounds, I left a miserable job and love my current career path and I removed myself from a group of toxic friends. I\u2019m definitely a healthier and happier person but as a result, I\u2019ve grown complacent and want to dedicate a few months to self improvement so that I can continue my journey of being my best self. I\u2019ve been lazier with my diet and exercise so I know I want to kickstart a more strict regimen but I also wanted to get inspiration on other ways I can improve myself. Please give me all your ideas and tips/tricks!
