Exhausted, but happy. I have a fun job with friendly colleagues, I met amazing new people and I feel a lot healthier, both physically and mentally. I don't even think I am co-dependant anymore -therapy does wonders! \n\nEven when I felt hopeless and scared and couldn't imagine anything good coming my way at all, it still happened. I love my life now and the changes are welcomed with both arms. \n\nIf anyone out there is struggling in a situation that seems too scary and hopeless to even comprehend, don't loose hope, cause the good things might be just around the corner.
