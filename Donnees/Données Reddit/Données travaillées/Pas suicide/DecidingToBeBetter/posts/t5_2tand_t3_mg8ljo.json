I'm sure if I haven't made this decision I wouldn't make it, but I did it. I hope this gives me a fresh air so I finally stop procrastining in my life. I really, really want to improve, and I'll do anything to do it.\n\nWish me luck, classes start on April 5th.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mg8ljo/i_decided_to_uninstall_league_of_legends_before/", "title": "I decided to uninstall League of Legends before starting University", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Cronnett", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1349, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617081346, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mg8ljo/i_decided_to_uninstall_league_of_legends_before/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437470.7405264, "replies_charged": false}
