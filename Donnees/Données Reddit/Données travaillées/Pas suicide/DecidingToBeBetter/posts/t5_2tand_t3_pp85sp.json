I\u2019ve been avoiding a call (a parent call where questions about school can be asked) for WEEKS. I have difficulty speaking to people I don\u2019t know online, or asking them questions for that matter, but I DID IT. \n\nI\u2019m still kind of shaking. But the host of the meeting was absolutely kind and welcoming, even though I was the only student there out of all these other adults. To me, this feels like such a big achievement. \n\nI\u2019m so happy. It wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought - quite the opposite actually. I did it. I DID IT! I can\u2019t stop saying that!\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more hurdles for me to jump over in the future but for now, I\u2019ll take this small victory. :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pp85sp/i_16f_beat_my_social_anxiety_again/", "title": "I (16F) beat my social anxiety, AGAIN!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Amberthms", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 45, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631774934, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pp85sp/i_16f_beat_my_social_anxiety_again/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438312.9172935, "replies_charged": false}
