That has made me wonder what have been the top habits that some of you have implemented to help out. I'll start with mine (all I try to do every day):\n\n1. Oatmeal for breakfast: This is at the top because it has made the most change and it's most surprising.\n2. Exercising for 30 minutes\n3. Meditating for 10 minutes\n4. Psyllium (metamusil) before bed\n5. Keeping the dishes clean\n\nI'm sure some of these aren't that surprising but I hope it can help some of you. I'm looking forward to reading stuff I haven't thinked about.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pbc9x9/top_5_habits_that_havehad_kept_you_sane_healthy/", "title": "Top 5 habits that have/had kept you sane, healthy and happy during lockdown", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "nullrand", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 564, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629901447, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pbc9x9/top_5_habits_that_havehad_kept_you_sane_healthy/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437054.0807002, "replies_charged": false}
