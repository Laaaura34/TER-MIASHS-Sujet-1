I still feel like shit about it when practicing in front of my bathroom mirror, I hope I can get some tactful constructive feedback. I just want to stop being sensitive and to freeze my heart to the world around me.\n\nI lost my virginity to a prostitute during my military service years to stop the virgin shaming, now I just feel guilt, shame and remorse from that experience. I had my fair share of verbal harassment/bullying from girls growing up that made it hard for me to even desire romantic happiness. I'm addicted to self harm and slowly kicking my substance abuse to the curb. I have a hard time in distinguishing what is playful banter and insulting cut downs, it sometimes  gets to the point where I start yelling like an emotional weakling and try to fight someone.\n\nIm trying to own up to my horse shit and grow emotional maturity so I can hopefully move on with my life in some form.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pn6qgo/does_owning_up_to_my_mistakesunpleasant_life/", "title": "Does owning up to my mistakes/unpleasant life experiences/addictions translate to emotional maturity??", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AppreciateTheLight", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631500842, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pn6qgo/does_owning_up_to_my_mistakesunpleasant_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435226.5436509, "replies_charged": false}
