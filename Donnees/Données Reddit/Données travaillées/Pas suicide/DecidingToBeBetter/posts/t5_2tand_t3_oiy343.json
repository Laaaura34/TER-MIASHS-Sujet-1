For more than a month now I've been making myself take long walks, and on and off I've been trying to control my binge eating. I had a period for awhile where I was just terrified to not have noise. Be it pot, food, shows or people. Any time I was alone I just dove into as much as I could to keep myself off my thoughts.\n\nBut the next month, I'm stuck. My husband will work every day for a month straight, I'm out of pot and not getting more for a good while, and while I'm stuck here sober I just...can't bring myself to keep binging and hiding. Each day I find myself planning to do so. I find myself thinking \"Eh, I walked yesterday, I was good all day, so I'll take a break. I'll have some junk food, skip my walk, and just relax.\"\n\nThen the hour for walking comes around and I can't bring myself to stay home and do nothing. I feel this...emptiness. Like I know it's wrong to sit around and do nothing like I used to, so I just get up and go anyways. And I'm always glad I did. But I've been carrying around that emptiness, that certainty that I want to change, even if my body and brain still want to be the way I was. So I just get up and go.\n\nI don't know how I'll handle the next month, but I really want to give it my best.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oiy343/the_next_month_is_going_to_be_a_practice_in_being/", "title": "The next month is going to be a practice in being alone with my thoughts.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "WrecksOfTheDay", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626116885, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oiy343/the_next_month_is_going_to_be_a_practice_in_being/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438048.2897632, "replies_charged": false}
