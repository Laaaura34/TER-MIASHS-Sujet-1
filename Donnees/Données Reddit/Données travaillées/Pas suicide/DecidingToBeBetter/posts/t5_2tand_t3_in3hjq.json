I also have general anxiety disorder and am on medication for the same.\n\nAnd usually 75% of my weekends are good. I try to get some exercise done, usually cook something fancy for myself and family, sleep a fair bit, watch a movie, read a book upskill myself and basically do anything i feel like doing.\n\nThen the clock hits 5pm on Sunday and I start spiralling. I feel one of the 100 different kinds of anxiety and sometimes multiple kinds in the same evening.\n\n\nI feel like I am wasting away my life, I am not doing the things i should be doing, i am not performing well at work or sometimes the all consuming, inexplicable feeling that something is very wrong I just don't know what. A fair bit of this is anxiety about work. Sometimes I start the work I planned for Monday on Sunday evenings itself to make myself feel better. It doesn't help.\n\nI don't know how many people feel this way, but if anyone has any advice/tips/articles or basically anything helpful to share about this, I'll be really grateful.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this post!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/in3hjq/how_do_you_deal_with_sunday_evening_blues_i_need/", "title": "How do you deal with Sunday Evening Blues?
