You can eat a donut in about 2 mins. \n\nThat 2 mins is heavenly, but only makes up about 0.2% of your day. \n\nI ask myself, do i care about that 0.2% or do i care about feeling good in the 99.8% that is the rest of my life? \n\nEspecially given that we will live for thousands of days, you cant let the 0.2% get control of you... prioritize the 99.8% and know that not eating the donut (or what ever unhealthy thing you like) will constantly make the 99.8% of life (the part that actually matters) WAY better.\n\nI only think about it this way for food but im sure this way of thinking could apply to anything that you want to try and cut out or develop a healthy relationship with. \n\nHave a good day people!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/aun7dd/how_i_like_to_think_about_food/", "title": "How i like to think about food", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "theyoungestjee", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 24, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1551112803, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/aun7dd/how_i_like_to_think_about_food/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437173.6572545, "replies_charged": false}
