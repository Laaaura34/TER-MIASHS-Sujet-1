I'm happy to say I'm NOT that person anymore. I don't drink anymore, I am basically \"all business\" in my professional and personal life, and really don't indulge in detrimental behaviors anymore. I feel so foolish and stupid from time to time when I think about this dark period. Has anyone else gone through this? I wish I could go back and apologize to everyone I knew at the time. I try to meditate and focus on the present, I'm actually very fortunate to have a good job and career potential right now, but for some reason I cannot shake the fact that there was a stretch of time in my life where I was so stupid. Any advice on how to stop the ruminating all together? I couldn't find much when I googled this.
