Even at my fittest in high school, I was mildly obese, so being larger is not new to me. However, I  feel like my weight is just increasing over the years. Despite this, I am currently in good health and want to keep it that way, so I am tackling my food issues. With all of the contradictory information about nutrition and weight loss on the internet, I think it would be beneficial for me to make an appointment with a registered dietitian to make sure I am making good decisions.  However, I was wondering if it would beneficial to additionally go to a therapist to work on WHY  I've been overeating, or are RDs knowledgeable enough to understand why people may have an unhealthy relationship with food and can further help with that as well? So, my question to reddit: would it be in my favor to go to both, or will just one suffice?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/drsbcb/not_sure_where_to_start_for_help/", "title": "Not sure where to start for help.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "PippinWithHippos", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1572919223, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/drsbcb/not_sure_where_to_start_for_help/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436533.8590257, "replies_charged": false}
