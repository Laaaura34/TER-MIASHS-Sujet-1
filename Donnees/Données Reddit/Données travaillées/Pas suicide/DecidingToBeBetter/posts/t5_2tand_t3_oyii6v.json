Everything I thought I knew about myself shifted, the things I was passionate about changed, I went through two big heartbreaks in love and life, only to finally float to the surface\u2026 during a pandemic. I learnt so much. \n\nI miss feeling content with myself. I used to take myself out on dates and be perfectly happy by myself. I don\u2019t know where that\u2019s gone but I can barely find out with lockdown. I\u2019m tired of being at home. I\u2019m tired of people coming and going so soon. \n\nI love myself, I do. I believe in myself and am compassionate towards myself, and yet can\u2019t seem to sit alone with myself. But I want to learn to. I\u2019ve changed as a person, so it makes sense that what brings me comfort would also change. I just need to find what that is. \n\nI\u2019ve decided to work on it actively. Instead of saying no to myself or procrastinating, I am setting the intention to do all the things I\u2019ve been wanting to; art, job applications, exercising, etc. It might take a minute to enjoy doing it, but I deserve to give myself a chance.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oyii6v/i_want_to_be_comfortable_by_myself/", "title": "I want to be comfortable by myself.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "think_way_too_much", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628172680, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oyii6v/i_want_to_be_comfortable_by_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435933.4384384, "replies_charged": false}
