I can honestly say I feel so much better and happier with my new morning and night routine. I\u2019ve also been drinking a lot more water and moisturizing. I don\u2019t think my skin has been this soft in years lmao. \n\nI\u2019ve lost some weight without incorporating exercise yet, simply eating better. I think I\u2019m accidentally doing intermittent fasting but I\u2019m not mad about it. I haven\u2019t been as hormonal or upset either. I can\u2019t wait to check back in next week :) Happy New Year everybody!! I hope in 2021 you find the strength and motivation to accomplish whatever you set out to do", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kopjwp/week_1_of_creating_healthy_habits/", "title": "Week 1 of creating healthy habits", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dobetterfeelbetter", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1609557150, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kopjwp/week_1_of_creating_healthy_habits/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438259.2615354, "replies_charged": false}
