We have amazing memories but looking in the past i realize that I never truly enjoyed these moments.\n\nIt could have been a love story for our entire life, we could have been great, marrying and having kids but I did not took care of her enough and let her alone so many times while I was wasting my time playing video games. For the last 4 years I have done nothing but working and playing, I lost most of my friends and did not travelled.\n\nI still have a great job and a good situation but I want to change my lifestyle, workout again as I used to and meet new people, making new friends.\n\nFrom now on, I will stop playing games and waste time, I will join an association to meet new people and help the others instead of focusing on myself.\n\nThis is the beginning of my new life, I want to become someone that I can be proud of, with a group of close friends and the next time that I find love, I won't waste it and let it die.\n\nStay strong friends, I know this time is hard for all of us but let's improve ourselves and become better", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mvb0rl/at_29_i_want_to_start_my_life_over/", "title": "At 29 I want to start my life over", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Aarshan", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 98, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618992656, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mvb0rl/at_29_i_want_to_start_my_life_over/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437473.6333492, "replies_charged": false}
