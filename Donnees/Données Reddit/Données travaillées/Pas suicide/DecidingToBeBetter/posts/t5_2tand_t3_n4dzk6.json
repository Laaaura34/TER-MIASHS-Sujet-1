Luckily I recovered by this morning.\n\n3.60 miles @ 13:32 per mile for 48:46 with an average of 152 bpm.\n\nMy understanding of low heart rate training is that my target bpm is 160, so all my running should be done at 160 bpm or lower. I had to stop and walk a couple of times to keep it under, but all and all today was a success in that department. Running at this pace is humbling; I am a university student and I am always the slowest person on a busy campus, but I'm getting better at keeping that thought out of my head. Decided to add about a mile onto the run today and hoping to sustain this. It's definitely way easier to recover when focusing on my heart rate.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n4dzk6/getting_in_shape_run_5/", "title": "Getting in Shape: Run #5", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ElVandy2378", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1620095493, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n4dzk6/getting_in_shape_run_5/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437528.4002373, "replies_charged": false}
