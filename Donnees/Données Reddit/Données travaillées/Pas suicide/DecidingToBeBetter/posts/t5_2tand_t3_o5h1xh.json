Actually, as you all know what happens in teenage life girls, attention, power etc. So actually I'm 50% introvert and 50% extrovert you probably know what I mean, I always prefer to stay alone because It was give me pleasure to stay alone but all my neighbour's teenage boys and infact my bro make fun of me, they said that I am very weak and I'm afraid to expose then last week I decided that I'll make friends and spend time with them and in that way I can also overcome social anxiety and I finally made some friends and last monday we are hanging out with each other whole day and It was fun but one thing happened wrong that they are very abusive, don't respect women and their mindset were a like a trash they are very common people they don't want to achieve anything in life they just depend on God and It's stressing me.
