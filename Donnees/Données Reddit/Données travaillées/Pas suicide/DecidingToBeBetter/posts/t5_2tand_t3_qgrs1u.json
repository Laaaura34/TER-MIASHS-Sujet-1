I\u2019m a 27F looking for advice and encouragement for starting over from nothing. I am realizing I\u2019m at a place in my life where it feels like it\u2019s either the end of the road or a new beginning (being optimistic) for me. I am at one of my lowest points in life. I have no money, no friends, no sense of purpose or motivation, no identity, nothing. I feel like a complete waste of space. I used to be so excited about life, but nearing 30 and having nothing to show for it makes me feel like a failure. I\u2019m drifting. So much time has passed & I honestly couldn\u2019t tell you anything I\u2019ve done worth anything during that time & if I have, I don\u2019t remember. I have gone to college and dropped out a number of times. I\u2019ve had so many interests and ideas that I\u2019ve left incomplete. In fact, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve ever really been able to finish anything in my life. And it\u2019s not at all because I\u2019m stupid or lack talent. It\u2019s quite the opposite. I just can\u2019t commit or follow through. I know that there are several mental health issues I have to deal with; depression, anxiety, quite possibly adhd. But I can\u2019t keep a job, don\u2019t have health insurance, so I can\u2019t afford treatment. I know, if I don\u2019t do something about it soon, I may not make it too much longer. I\u2019m sick and I want these feelings to go away, but i don\u2019t know where to start.
