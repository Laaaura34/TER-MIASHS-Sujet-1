I'm in highschool and get decent grades without studying and because of that I have absolutely zero motivation to do anything. I sit around in my bed all day and watch YouTube videos about things I don't even care about. Occasionally I masturbate, and by occasionally I mean 2-3 times per day. I have a decent amount of friends but I know that all of them have closer friends than me. I'm in ok shape, 87 kg at 185cm, but definitely not something too pleasant to look at. My life is meaningless and in shambles, and it's been this way for years.\n\nI'm looking for a starting point that I can go off of and improve my existence.\n\nI might be too far gone but any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n(I posted this on another subreddit as well, I just really need the help I hope that's not a bad thing to do)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cv5w4o/my_life_is_crap_and_i_want_to_make_it_better/", "title": "My life is crap and I want to make it better", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Justchillingz", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 0, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1566720421, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cv5w4o/my_life_is_crap_and_i_want_to_make_it_better/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437720.1862104, "replies_charged": false}
