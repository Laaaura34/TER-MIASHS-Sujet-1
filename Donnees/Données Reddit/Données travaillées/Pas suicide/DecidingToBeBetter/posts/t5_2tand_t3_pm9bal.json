I'm in therapie yet even with professional help I'd like to help myself too,\n\n\nThe bigger problem is that I can't fully control my actions and have a bad copping mechanism of pushing people away as if I'm a monster.\n\nIn to it added is the overthinking process, I'd always overthink messages and actions \n\nI'd like to change, not only to have connections with others but get mentally better and get to a step further into healing \n\nIt is my goal to heal, I'd like any advice you know.\n\nThank you for reading the post \ud83d\udc9c", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pm9bal/breaking_pattern_of_overthinking_and_gaining/", "title": "Breaking pattern of overthinking and gaining control of my own actions", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "goatly_olive", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631373713, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pm9bal/breaking_pattern_of_overthinking_and_gaining/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435238.370741, "replies_charged": false}
