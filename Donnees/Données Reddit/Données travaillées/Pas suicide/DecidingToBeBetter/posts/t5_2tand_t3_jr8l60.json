Mostly it is fear of what other people will think or how they will react. But I\u2019m coming to a point in my life that I really want to change this because I don\u2019t want to end up coming to the end of my life and regretting not doing more of the things that would\u2019ve made me happy. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on this??
