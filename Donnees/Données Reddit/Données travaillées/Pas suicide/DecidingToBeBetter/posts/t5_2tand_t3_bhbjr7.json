Well maybe like me you\u2019ve found it very boring lately. For the pst three months I\u2019ve been feeling like my days off weren\u2019t rewarding enough to me and maybe I\u2019ve been depressed. Turns out I just needed to switch up my hobbies. Going outside and fishing every Saturday really put me in a better mood. I\u2019m no longer feeling constantly bored and unfulfilled with my life. As a matter of fact I\u2019m doing better at accomplishing my goals because I\u2019ve found something to take my mind off them and actually make me happy with my downtime. Working two weeks straight only to do a hobby that\u2019s truly not making you happy anymore can really suck, so I really recommend you look into new things if you feel like your days off are all going to waste.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bhbjr7/i_see_a_lot_of_hard_working_people_on_this_sub/", "title": "I see a lot of hard working people on this sub, but one thing to mention is free time and hobbies that are fading out.
