It\u2019s a real problem for me. Especially at work, I tell myself \u201cas long as I do my work, keep my head down, I\u2019ll be fine\u201d - and yet, the more \u201cpopular\u201d employees, the ones who seem to spend they\u2019re whole day talking, often seem to be favored. \n\nI\u2019ve realized I\u2019ve let my \u201ckeep my head down and do my work\u201d mantra allow me to be completely avoidant, neglect checking in with my supervisor and coworkers regarding what\u2019s going on/needs of the day, avoid reading a room bc I might not like what I feel, avoid asking what needs to be done bc I am ridged and inflexible. \n\nMy therapist told me, when I\u2019m hide-y-whole-ing away, being avoidant, to ask myself \u201cwhat would a secure person do?\u201d And then - do that! \n\nIt\u2019s TERRIFYING for me to walk into my bosses office and say \u201cdo you need anything\u201d Ridiculous - I know. \n\nAnd with the new situation , and working remotely, it\u2019s easier than ever for me to avoid / isolate. \n\nSo, today I\u2019m being brave, and engaging. And tomorrow, and again the next day. Every single day.
