My studying and time management is so inefficient because I spend most of the time procrastinating! Because of this I don't get much relaxation time and when I do I spend it stressed or anxious about what I have to do, or feeling bad that I'm not doing anything! \n\nI always see videos about how people can only study for 2 hours a day early in the morning then have the rest free. Why does it take me double or triple the time to do the same things as everyone else? Plus I end up sleeping for 11-12 hours everyday because my alarms can't get me up earlier, messing up my sleep routine constantly and it stops me from being able to sleep the following night. \n\nSorry for rambling but I just feel like my sleep, anxiety and procrastination are ruining my life and performance at university, and I can't just willpower my way out of this. I feel so slow and overwhelmed by things that seem normal to others, and my self discipline is absolutely terrible. I'd really appreciate some insight on how to get things together. The doctor hasn't really helped with the sleep issue, and I feel like sleep is the key to start improvements on everything else.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qhahqt/university_consuming_my_life_how_do_i_manage_my/", "title": "University consuming my life.
