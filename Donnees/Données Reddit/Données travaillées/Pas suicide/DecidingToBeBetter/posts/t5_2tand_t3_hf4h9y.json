I found that motivational videos do help me to a certain extent and I realise that I should be facing my fears whenever possible, but sometimes I feel that as I face my fears, it overwhelms me to the point where I can fall ill if I stress about something too much. Heck it is really ruining my life to the point where I am afraid to even go for a run or go to the gym as I always have this feeling where I feel that I may be mocked by others. I am taking steps to overcome this and have been making small steps of progress but I would also like to hear your stories if any of you had faced the issue of caring about what others think about you and the steps and methods that you took to cope and eventually overcome them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this and I hope that whatever problems we face, we can all successfully overcome them with time and effort.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hf4h9y/what_made_you_finally_stop_living_in_the_shadow/", "title": "What made you finally stop living in the shadow of the opinions of others and started to do what you want to do without the anxiety of being judged or laughed at?
