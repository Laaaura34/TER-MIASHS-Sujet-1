They'll have a riot of a conversation but it'd be about things I'm not interested in, so I don't say anything. No idea how cracking a smile and making a quip every ten minutes makes me so \"great\". They also compliment each other on hair, clothes, and skin. I've always been ugly but I\u2019m the ugliest I\u2019ve ever been thanks to hormonal acne (at fucking 30) so I prefer to be ignored and thankfully do. \n\nSo while my insecurities usually remain under the radar among my friends, my relationship is bound to fail because I rebuff my boyfriend all the time. We relate better because we have similar interests but then he says I'm beautiful and that I'm the love of his life and I wonder whether he's hallucinating. Now, I could either continue disagreeing and be surprised when he leaves me or change my tune.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ody3d8/how_to_see_myself_the_way_others_see_me/", "title": "How to see myself the way others see me?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwaway-bones", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625452320, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ody3d8/how_to_see_myself_the_way_others_see_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435411.8660989, "replies_charged": false}
