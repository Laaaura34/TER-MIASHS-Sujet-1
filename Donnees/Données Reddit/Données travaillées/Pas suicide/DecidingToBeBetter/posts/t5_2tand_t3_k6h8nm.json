Like as if someone pressed the \u201crestore to factory settings\u201c button the morning after. I eventually sink into complacency. \n\nIf I made so much progress and did things that were almost uncharacteristically challenging, and did it super well, it always gives me that initial kick. I feel proud of myself. I feel good, and excited to do more/do it again. \n\nBut then I wake up the next day, or in a few days if the high lasted longer, as if it were all a dream. I feel like I\u2019ve gone back to my comfort zone of months ago and the same anxieties for the stuff I had just done well, hit me all over again as if I\u2019d never done them. Whatthefuk. It\u2019s so depressing.\n\nHow is it possible to progress if your comfort level keeps resetting to the bare minimum? Does anyone have any advice? Please help.
