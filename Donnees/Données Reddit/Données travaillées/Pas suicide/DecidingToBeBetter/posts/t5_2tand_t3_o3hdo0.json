My negative thought patterns were kept under controlled, I felt extremely confident and for those of you who \u201cnever felt\u201d or more accurately can\u2019t remember that strange elusive feeling, it\u2019s like this ever present cloak of pleasure in yourself, almost like being around a good friend twenty four seven but that good friend is you. I was more assertive, more compassionate to myself and more optimistic. I was also more willing to engage in uncomfortable social interactions BUT apart of me feels that it was just a sixty day fluke and that I can\u2019t get that back. I started doing the things I was doing back then again, meditation, exercise, I added prayer too so literal Godspeed lol. (Also the reason I fell off was because I had surgery in February for varicose veins in the left baby maker, lots of time in the house, and a few depressive moments, I lost the mojo.)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o3hdo0/lost_my_mojo_dont_know_if_i_can_get_it_back/", "title": "Lost my mojo don\u2019t know if I can get it back", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Myota_made", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624113219, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o3hdo0/lost_my_mojo_dont_know_if_i_can_get_it_back/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437496.636251, "replies_charged": false}
