There is a volatile work politics environment and I have had to adapt a lot to retain harmony (at the expense of my mental health).\n\nHe said how much he appreciates me for being the one who bends the most. And also that he is glad that one of my colleagues tempered my enthusiasm (because apparently before the environment became volatile I had too much of it).\n\nWhen I was hired 2 years ago I loved it! But a year in everything changed and it become a slog. Things just keep getting worse.\n\nWell I am through with doing all the emotional labour. I am done with bending for the benefit of others (and them taking credit for it). I am done with playing by the rules of someone else's game. (Been listening to 'Defying Gravity')\n\nI am going to finish the current project (just another 4 months), giving it my best execution but with minimal emotional labour. And then I will walk away, leaving the place to implode behind me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/crkfqy/im_through_with_being_the_one_who_bends_the_most/", "title": "I'm through with being \"the one who bends the most\"", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DemiSeren", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 71, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1566036967, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/crkfqy/im_through_with_being_the_one_who_bends_the_most/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437130.5472593, "replies_charged": false}
