This is obviously a false thought, but deep in my pain and suffering that was so often caused by me and my thoughts, I didn\u2019t think I was capable of changing that much. \n\nAnd then, one day, a questioned popped up: what if I try to be who I want to be instead of just spend my time thinking about how I can\u2019t be that kind of person? \n\nI\u2019ve spend the last 6+ years finding out the answer to that: if you actually want to change and commit to taking action in that direction, you can be and achieve anything that you want to. \n\nIt\u2019s not about quick fixes. It\u2019s about lasting commitments that you make to yourself overall that you have to stick to. Sometimes it\u2019s hard. Others it\u2019s easy and automatic. Sometimes I forget and then I figure out a month later that I\u2019ve been stuck in my head instead of doing something. But the reminder always comes back, and in those moments I know that I am the person I wanted to be and that the world is limitless if I just continue on this path of leaning into growth instead of running away from what\u2019s different because it\u2019s not what I\u2019m familiar with. \n\nI\u2019ve finally gotten to the point that I know doing what\u2019s out of my comfort zone is usually what\u2019s best and I can recognize when I\u2019m being complacent or stuck in fear. \n\nMy life is vastly different than it was 5 years ago. I know how much I\u2019ve committed to my own evolution even though some days it doesn\u2019t seem like it. \n\nHonor how far you\u2019ve come. Also know that it\u2019s actually very possible you can live a completely different life if you decide to and commit to that decision. \n\nYou are the one who dictates your life. \nAnd it\u2019s so nice to finally realize how true it is. \n\nSending you all love.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kywu4n/you_can_be_the_person_you_want_to_be/", "title": "You can be the person you want to be.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "erinpanzarella", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 48, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1610848847, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kywu4n/you_can_be_the_person_you_want_to_be/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436034.168909, "replies_charged": false}
