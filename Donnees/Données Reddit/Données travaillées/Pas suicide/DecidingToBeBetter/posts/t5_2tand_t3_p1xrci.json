As title states when do you think is time to see a psychiatrist/therapist? I don\u2019t think I have depression but for some time I\u2019ve been feeling unmotivated, don\u2019t know what to do with my career, I\u2019m dancing with an idea of completely changing my career to something more interesting or bringing at least some joy. Can\u2019t finish any task, can\u2019t decide what to do with myself, it\u2019s really frustrating. When dod you decide it\u2019s time to seek professional help?
