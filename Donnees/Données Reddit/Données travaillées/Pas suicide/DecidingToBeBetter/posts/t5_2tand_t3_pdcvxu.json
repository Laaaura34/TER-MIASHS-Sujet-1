I\u2019m around 5 months clean (with a short lapse of three days) from a crippling meth addiction that stole my soul. I\u2019ve been trying to quit this horrible drug for over a year, and I\u2019ve made a lot of progress. Over this past year I have been mostly clean and sober, with 5 or 6 short relapses. It\u2019s been a battle and I had to lose almost everything to even get to this point. My ex and I are having a baby together, she found out she was pregnant literally a week after we broke up. I put her through hell in my addiction and I was the one who ended it as I couldn\u2019t stand to hurt her anymore and i knew I was spiraling and heading towards another relapse. All the guilt and shame and self loathing just compounded until one day I couldn\u2019t deal with it anymore and ended it, thinking to myself it\u2019s for the best as \u201cshe will be free from you\u201d.  I feel like a coward for dealing with the situation in this manner, but ultimately I know it was the right thing to do. I\u2019ve probably cried every single day since that happened. Anyways, she\u2019s such a good woman that she had given me the opportunity to be in my child\u2019s life, assuming I stay clean and stable. The road to fatherhood for me will not be easy but I\u2019m not going to let this fucking evil drug take anything more from me, and more importantly, I will not leave my future child with a junkie father who isn\u2019t around. We recently spoke on the phone and I said some things about hoping one day we will all be a family etc, and she made it clear that we could never work it out. This hit me so hard, it\u2019s been a horrible week of the deepest sadness I could ever imagine. Last night I finally came to the realization that she was right, there is no way she could ever take me back after everything I put her through. I\u2019m still working on accepting that, and it\u2019s painful as hell, but what\u2019s most important is that I get myself well so that I can be the father that this little miracle baby deserves. It won\u2019t be easy doing the co parent thing with the woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, but I have to let her go and be free, and i won\u2019t let my baby suffer because of my terrible choices. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. My baby will never see me high or have to wonder what happened to dad, I\u2019m devoting my life to becoming the man I know I can be, the man I was before I touched meth. I\u2019m getting the old me back\ud83e\udd19", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdcvxu/loss_addiction_and_acceptance/", "title": "Loss, addiction and acceptance", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Jolly-Pirate-6856", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 88, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630167886, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdcvxu/loss_addiction_and_acceptance/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436296.3841052, "replies_charged": false}
