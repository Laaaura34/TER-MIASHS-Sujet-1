Within the past few months I've become very cynical. I'll talk behind people's backs or think negative things about people inside my head before taking the time to understand their situation.\n\nI want to change this. I've been bullied in the past and I know what it feels like to have harsh things said about me, but despite that, I feel like I am in the early states of becoming a bully myself.\n\nI know what I'm doing is wrong, but I can't seem to stop that when all the people around me are doing the same.\n\nThanks in advance :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/piphzg/how_to_become_more_kind/", "title": "How to become more kind?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "WizardGamerFTW", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630891195, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/piphzg/how_to_become_more_kind/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435077.1786304, "replies_charged": false}
