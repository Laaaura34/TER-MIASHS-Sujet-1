Although I naturally grew out of some of these things, when it's so deeply ingrained, it can be hard to change completely - after years of feeling inadequate. \n\nNow, I'm working at a job that I love, I have great friends and family, I keep fit to celebrate my body and I'm always working on my anxiety. However, sometimes I can fall back into my inferiority complex, just because it's familiar. On a lot of days, I'm embarrassed of myself, I'm self-conscious, and feel like everyone else is superior to me. Things that others may find easy, I can still find quite hard. That's why whenever I do overcome these feelings or act in opposition to my self-limiting beliefs, I feel so proud. Whenever I do something that my old self would've found terrifying, I'm amazed at my progress. \n\nMany of these things are 'normal' for others, so it can be easy to overlook your own betterment. But it's so important to celebrate your wins based on your old self and your personal history, rather than the norm because not everybody starts at the same level. I hope you all remind yourselves how great you are today and every day! \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nionie/im_so_proud_of_myself_especially_when_i_look_back/", "title": "I'm so proud of myself, especially when I look back at how I once was", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lib_ra", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 55, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1621707531, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nionie/im_so_proud_of_myself_especially_when_i_look_back/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437923.5816197, "replies_charged": false}
