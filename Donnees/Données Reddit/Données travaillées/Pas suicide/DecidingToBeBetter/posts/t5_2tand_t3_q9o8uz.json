He recently broke up with me n broke out engagement too. I thought we were getting married this month. \n\nWhen we broke up, he made me feel like I wasn\u2019t good enough. I wasn\u2019t pretty enough. Smart enough. He started dating a month after we broke up. She earns more, she is smarter m she is more pretty. Better than me in all ways, that\u2019s how I have been feeling.\n\nI have been stressed out a lot and trying not to blame myself for loving him when he didn\u2019t love me. I wish self love was easy. Now it feels lonely and alone and not good enough. \n\nI did start my weightless journey and Hoping to reach my goal weight within the next 8 weeks. I have cut down sugar and junk food- I can\u2019t quit but it\u2019s like 80% cutting down. \n\nI wish I knew how to be happy on my own. I can\u2019t go outside coz I dont have any friends. I went to a restaurant alone once and it felt embarrassing eating alone. I feel so lost and confused", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9o8uz/how_do_you_even_learn_to_love_yourself_or_like/", "title": "How do you even learn to love yourself or like yourself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bluecoffee0", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 41, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634431211, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9o8uz/how_do_you_even_learn_to_love_yourself_or_like/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436253.9458282, "replies_charged": false}
