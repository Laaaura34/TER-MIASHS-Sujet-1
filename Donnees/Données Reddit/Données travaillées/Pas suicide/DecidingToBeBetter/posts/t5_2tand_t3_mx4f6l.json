I strongly dislike people who rub their success in other people\u2019s faces when no one asked, but I never really stopped to think about whether or not I\u2019m actually as humble as I thought I was. \n\nBut recently, I got a good score on a very important test. And I realized that I\u2019m only \u201chumble\u201d because I rarely have anything to be proud of. Because when I\u2019m proud of something I act like a real asshole, and I don\u2019t know how to stop. I just have a really strong urge to shove my score in everyone\u2019s face, even if they\u2019ve expressed they\u2019re unhappy with their score.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve noticed in other areas of my life I\u2019m annoyingly prideful. Like in class I ask if a method I\u2019ve used is okay even though I know damn well it is, but I want people to know that I\u2019ve used my method. I\u2019m annoying, I know\n\nIt\u2019s probably because I generally have low self esteem and I\u2019m insecure about what other people think of me, which are both things I\u2019m working to fix. But those things take time to fix, and I really want to become less of an asshole as soon as possible. Is fixing those problems the only way, or is there some other way to fix my behavior? I know it should be easy because it\u2019s my own behavior, but it\u2019s just such as strong urge to be an asshole", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mx4f6l/how_do_i_learn_to_be_more_humble/", "title": "How do I learn to be more humble?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "60qo", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619209925, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mx4f6l/how_do_i_learn_to_be_more_humble/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437997.5046198, "replies_charged": false}
