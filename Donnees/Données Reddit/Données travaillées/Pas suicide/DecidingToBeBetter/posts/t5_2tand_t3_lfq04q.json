I changed my major twice in college (biology to business, business to forensics) because I didn't think I had the right qualities to succeed. I settled into a hollow life as a lab tech, keeping my head down for 7 years, making the meager salary of a public servant. \n\nI spiraled deeper into depression and (long, horrible story short) hit a point where I knew I had to make a change. I quit my career and took a leap of faith without knowing where I'd land. I couch surfed at friends' houses while I got on my feet and started as an entry-level test monkey for a software company. After six years, several promotions, and a WHOLE LOT of therapy, I'm a project manager. While preparing my taxes today, I had the startling realization that I paid more in taxes alone this year than I made annually as a lab tech. \n\nI still struggle with my self-worth, but I have some solid coping tools and now, clear evidence that deciding to be better six years ago was the best choice I could have ever made. I'm capable of success.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lfq04q/evidence_i_needed/", "title": "Evidence I Needed", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "akellah", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612830019, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lfq04q/evidence_i_needed/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435803.1187456, "replies_charged": false}
