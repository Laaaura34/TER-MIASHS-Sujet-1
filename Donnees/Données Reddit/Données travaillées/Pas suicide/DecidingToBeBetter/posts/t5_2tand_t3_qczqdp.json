Currently live with my bf mother who luckily takes care of rent. (All of this is relevant I swear)\n\nI am a certified athletic trainer working in an orthopedic office. There isn\u2019t much growth to be had in this line of work so I\u2019m looking to go back to school. I\u2019ve been looking into PA and RN programs but I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nI also have other interests. Like research (I loved my research capstone for undergrad), obviously healthcare, gymnastics (I was a coach but it doesn\u2019t pay well). \n\nIm trying to find a path that makes sense for me that will be fulfilling and will put me and my family in a better financially situation. But I can be lazy sometimes especially when I\u2019m not interested (ADHD diagnosis). And being a new mom complicates things because I\u2019ll have to work while going back to school if that\u2019s the plan. Many programs especially medical programs frown upon working while doing rotations and rigorous academic work. I already went through this and struggled to get through AT school. So idk what to do. I don\u2019t want to be stuck making max 50k and I want to learn more. I just feel stuck. \n\nTL; DR contemplating going back to school but also have a family, need to financially advance but want something I will love and use my knowledge.
