I have to be the smartest. I have to be the best looking. I have to be seen as the person that never makes a mistake. I fucking hate it.\n\nThis toxic way of thinking is limiting the way I experience life, I cant dance because I am afraid people will see me as lesser for example. I want to live a fun life, not this hollow pissing competition.\n\nIs there a book I can read, a thing I can watch or even a religion I can join to help me not care and have fun, to help me show my emotion and appreciation? I really need help. I want to be better, please help me because I don`t know what to do.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8v71u/i_want_to_be_less_political_and_shallow/", "title": "I want to be less political and shallow", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Tall_Squirrel5850", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634324849, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8v71u/i_want_to_be_less_political_and_shallow/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436768.990492, "replies_charged": false}
