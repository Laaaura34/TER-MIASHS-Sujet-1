Realistically a lot of us are simply not good enough to be successful in competitive fields in which a lot of people have a passion (e.g. music, sports, arts etc.). And a lot of us don\u2019t even really have a meaningful passion.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to say that, if you have a passion, that you shouldn\u2019t go for it since you will probably fail. By all means go for it if that\u2019s really what you want to do. What I am trying to say is though, that if you do end up at a job that you\u2019re not necessarily passionate about, then you\u2019re not necessarily going to be unhappy for the rest of your life.\n\nA lot of you will probably be able to feel totally happy with your life if you work a job that isn\u2019t particularly fancy, but still challenges you, lets you work with co-workers you really like and pays you enough. Especially if you have other sources of happiness/fulfillment in your life other than your job (e.g. good people, other hobbies, personal projects etc.). Just make sure that you don\u2019t fucking hate what you\u2019re doing, because yes, then you will probably be miserable.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to change the world to feel fulfilled. You also don\u2019t need to get your life fulfillment from a job. A fulfilling life can also be achieved through making positive impacts on the people around you.\n\nAnyways, that\u2019s just my perspective. If you thought these ideas were garbage, then feel free to put this shit into the trash can.
