However, recently this has gotten to the point where I find myself incapable of considering ideas anymore.\n\nThis morning, though, I feel as if I had a bit of a breakthrough.\n\nI don't do the things I want to do or half-arse them because I fear it won't be enough. It is a built-in safety net that reinforces itself because of the critique that comes when I do deliver my less-than-stellar products.\n\nWhat I want to know is whether there is any sort of idea or habit or whatever that can help me find acceptance in going all out. Maybe not without the fear, but at least without stopping at the first sign of resistance?\n\nAny advice is welcome.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mop48p/inaction_through_fear_a_thought/", "title": "Inaction through fear, a thought.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Bigdaddystonkinator", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618139305, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mop48p/inaction_through_fear_a_thought/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438364.3061695, "replies_charged": false}
