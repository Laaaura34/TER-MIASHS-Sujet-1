It also stops the infinite scrolling functionality on Facebook & Twitter, and you also have access to a \"focus\" mode that stops all your notifications from appearing whenever you are working and plays some music in the background to help you focus.\n\nIt's called \"Sofia\" (Wisdom, in Greek), you can get it here: [https://getsofia.com/](https://getsofia.com/). Although it is still in beta at the moment, I added my e-mail to the beta list and the devs sent me a link to download and install it on my Mac afterwards. It works like a charm!\n\nHope that helps!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dhhfso/managed_to_cut_my_procrastination_in_half_by/", "title": "Managed to cut my procrastination in half by using this", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "EldonMidyett", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1571004915, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dhhfso/managed_to_cut_my_procrastination_in_half_by/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435832.917445, "replies_charged": false}
