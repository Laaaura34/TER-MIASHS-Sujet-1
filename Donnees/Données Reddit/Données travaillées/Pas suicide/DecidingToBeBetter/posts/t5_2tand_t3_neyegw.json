Mostly because I find myself scrolling and scrolling, absorbing information about other people that\u2019s useless to my well being. It creates a false reality that everyone around me is doing fine. It also tempts me to post my own successes, in hopes of finding validation or proving myself to others. I decided to disappear for a few months and totally work on myself. I kept Reddit, because I find myself using this app solely for information that benefits me in some way. Like this subreddit. Anyone who can relate to doing this, please share your story and how you felt after some time. I\u2019d love to hear!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/neyegw/deleted_my_socials/", "title": "Deleted my socials", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lprettyflacko", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 92, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1621303649, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/neyegw/deleted_my_socials/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438433.6649635, "replies_charged": false}
