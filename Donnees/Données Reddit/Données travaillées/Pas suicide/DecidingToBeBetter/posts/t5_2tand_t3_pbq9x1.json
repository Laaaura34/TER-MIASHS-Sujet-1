I\u2019m a extrovert by nature and really need to meet new people. \n\nThis is just one of a few things I need to work on that\u2019s caused me to hit an all time low. It\u2019s been a very hard past few months but especially the few weeks. I\u2019m trying to get out of it and creating a social life again I know will help.\nWhere should I start? I\u2019m 27. Hit the bars like the early 20s again? Where are the communities as adults now that it\u2019s not school. I work in a field that I love but the personnel that work in said field aren\u2019t the type of people I\u2019d associate myself with. Besides 1-2 but everyone is married. Is it unrealistic doing things every week at my age now? \n\nThe feeling and anxiety of not doing social things and sitting at home when I\u2019m not at work is making me insane. It isn\u2019t healthy. \n\nI\u2019m also needing to workout which I\u2019ve never done. I\u2019m skinny and have zero muscle. Any advice on building muscle mass with an apartment complex gym at my disposal would also be appreciated.\n\nAny books from self help to fantasy would also be appreciated. I\u2019ve never been a reader and need more hobbies besides Xbox. \n\nOn that topic what\u2019s some good hobbies to pick up? I need a lifestyle change and I just need help and direction. \n\nI\u2019m also trying to date again for the first time in 5 years\u2026been in a massive dry spell and am super hard on myself for it. \n\nI\u2019m not expecting to get every question to my entire life answered but this is a cry for help. I\u2019ve always been the happy guy making everyone laugh. I don\u2019t know how I got here but it sucks. Been trying to find a therapist also. \n\nI love you all and I appreciate any advice or direction in advance!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pbq9x1/how_do_you_meet_friends_as_an_adult_what_about/", "title": "How do you meet friends as an adult?
