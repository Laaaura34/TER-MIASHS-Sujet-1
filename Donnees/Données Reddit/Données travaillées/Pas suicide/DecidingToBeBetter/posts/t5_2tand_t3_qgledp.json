I'm not expecting it to be easy at all.\n\nHowever most examples I find sound like the ways I've apologized in the past.\n\nCan anyone give me tips or maybe a point in the right direction? I owe it to someone and I want to fulfill that expectation, cause I do feel awful about what happened.\n\nThanks in advance", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgledp/i_am_told_i_dont_apologize_properly/", "title": "I am told I don't apologize properly", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Digitaladdiction9220", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635298271, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgledp/i_am_told_i_dont_apologize_properly/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435070.15471, "replies_charged": false}
