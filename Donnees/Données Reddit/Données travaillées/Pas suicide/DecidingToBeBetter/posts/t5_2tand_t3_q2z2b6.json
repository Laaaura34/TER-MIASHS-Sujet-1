I\u2019m not aiming for perfection. I wish to instead purposefully undo the negative patterns I accumulated while experiencing hardship.   \n\nI know I\u2019m missing some on my list, because I\u2019m deeply accustomed to my norms; I may be blind to the impacts of some of my behaviors as well.\n\nSo, I\u2019m curious to know from y\u2019all: **what teeny bad habits were you ignorant of, what negative impacts did they have, and how were you able to remove them from your life?**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2z2b6/what_perhaps_seemingly_small_bad_habit_of_yours/", "title": "What (perhaps seemingly small) bad habit of yours took a bigger toll than you realized?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "purplejeanjacket", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 488, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633572745, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2z2b6/what_perhaps_seemingly_small_bad_habit_of_yours/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436930.8684669, "replies_charged": false}
