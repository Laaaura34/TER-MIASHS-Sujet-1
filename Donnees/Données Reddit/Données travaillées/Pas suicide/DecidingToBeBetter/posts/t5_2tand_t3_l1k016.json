But even with the people I love most in the world, I have selfish thoughts so often. It feels like it's become a part of me, because I shouldn't have such thoughts around the people I care for most, right? \n\nI don't have motivation to do anything and become complacent no matter where I am in life. Even in moments where I should be at my most desperate, and even when I *want* to be better, I still feel apathetic and calm. And it feels like nothing will actually change if there is still so much of me that is okay with just living life like this. \n\nDo I not want it as badly as I thought I did? If yes, then how do I make myself want it? I can't figure this out. I want to be a good person, like those beautiful stories you sometimes find online. How did they become selfless? Is there a process to it?\n\nThese are just some rambles of mine as I try to sort out my thoughts, I'm sorry.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l1k016/i_am_a_deeply_selfish_person_and_it_scares_me/", "title": "I am a deeply selfish person, and it scares me", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "burntoutstudent1213", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1611180977, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l1k016/i_am_a_deeply_selfish_person_and_it_scares_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436037.304446, "replies_charged": false}
