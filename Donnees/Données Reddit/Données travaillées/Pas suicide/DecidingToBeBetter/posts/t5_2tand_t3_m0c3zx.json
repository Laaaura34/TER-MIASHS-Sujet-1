I had divorced recently and had to support my older son\u2019s mom. I had moved to another city and had to rent a flat. My expenses were relatively high, so I couldn\u2019t afford to earn little. I dreamed about writing books, but the easiest way to make more was to join a commercial firm as a manager \u2013 which I eventually did. And it was a long-term mistake.\n\nTo think strategically means evaluating one\u2019s current situation thoroughly and impartially. One should make sure that their reality perception isn\u2019t distorted or biased by money because it happens far too often than we think.\n\nWe all need to earn money to pay for necessities. If you\u2019re a parent, you have to think about your children\u2019s future. We have to take good care of our parents and don\u2019t fall behind on mortgage payments. But, at the same time, we must not betray our fate for the sake of current earnings.\n\nI have seen many people who put the most critical thighs in their life off because they \u201cneeded to earn money.\u201d And I was one of them. At some moment in the past, they decided that they would begin doing things they loved (and which they had talents to) \u201csome later.\u201d The problem with \u201csome later\u201d is that it never comes.\n\nAnd do you know what? They weren\u2019t particularly successful in earning money (and neither was I). They were no millionaires or at least rich people. They were working hard, but that work was neither rewarding nor profitable. By contrast, all the successful people \u2013 business people, pop or movie stars, football players, etc. \u2013 never put their careers off for the sake of mortgage payments. They have their ups and downs, of course. But could you imagine young Cristiano Ronaldo applying for a job in a bank, thinking that he will start playing football \u201csome later\u201d?\n\nNow I earn more as a book\u2019s author and a strategic consultant than I used to while being a CEO. And this job brings me more joy and satisfaction, so I killed two birds with one stone. Look at yourself. Your current position must be a result of your own decisions, and those decisions shouldn\u2019t be distorted by money. I believe that a happy person is not the one who earns more. A happy person enjoys the possibility of doing what their love and being in demand. And very often, it brings more money at the end of the day.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m0c3zx/money_as_a_strategical_distortion/", "title": "Money as a strategical distortion", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "sbiryulin", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615195597, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m0c3zx/money_as_a_strategical_distortion/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438118.6638396, "replies_charged": false}
