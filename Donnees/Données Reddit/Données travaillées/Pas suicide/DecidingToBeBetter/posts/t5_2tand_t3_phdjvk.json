A true miracle awoke within me this morning, a feeling of peace and relief once and for all. I cannot forgive myself for the pain I caused but it hurts me no more. I forgave myself and the people who left me behind once again. All I wish is a celebration of life with them but alas, I don\u2019t ever think that they would ever believe in what I went through again only this time a leap of faith into the sky. I finally found myself whole enough to love myself, the friend who left and the love of my life whom I failed once more.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/phdjvk/well_today_i_finally_did_it_i_finally_let_go_of/", "title": "Well today I finally did it, I finally let go of my trauma and I\u2019m proud", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TheBurningMaul", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 29, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630702103, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/phdjvk/well_today_i_finally_did_it_i_finally_let_go_of/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437918.9372022, "replies_charged": false}
