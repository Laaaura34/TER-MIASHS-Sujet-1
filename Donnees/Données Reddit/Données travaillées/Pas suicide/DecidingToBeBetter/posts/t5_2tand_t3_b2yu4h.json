At the age of 28 (male, 29 in 2 months) I am officially off of all anxiety and depression medications for the first time in 20 years. This has been a very long battle, one surrounded by incredibly loving and supportive parents, a slightly younger sister who is my best friend, and a therapist and psychiatrist who truly believe in me. This was by no means a feat that could have been accomplished alone, and I am so thrilled to finally be at this point. However....I feel completely lost. I had convinced myself that I would be successful in the production side of the entertainment industry. I graduated school at 23 and I made some projects that didn\u2019t really go anywhere. A few small accolades, sure, but nothing more. During this time, I didn\u2019t exert myself. I found comfort in complacency, and while everyone around me was telling me to push myself if I wanted to succeed in this field, I\u2019d find every excuse to do the opposite. So now, being nearly 29, working a minimum wage customer service job, single, living at home (though paying rent to do so)...I feel completely overwhelmed. Being off of the medications have made me feel again - or , more accurately, feel for the first time in 20 years - and I\u2019m terrified that I wasted my 20\u2019s coasting with nothing to show for it. Yes, I have this personal success in regards to the meds, and I\u2019m not trying to undercut the importance of that. I just feel like I am somewhat of a failure. \n\nThis may be some depression talking, which I will have my therapist and family to help me with, but I feel like I\u2019m running out of time. I feel like I should be further along or more \u201cout together\u201d by this point. I come from a family of very hard working, self made, successful (both on the monetary and personal levels) people. Literally generations of people who weren\u2019t afraid to put their all into something and eventually found success as a result of it. I know that exists in me, somewhere, but it\u2019s been dormant for most of my life and the thought of going all in on something terrifies me. On top of that, being that I\u2019m thinking more clearly, I\u2019m starting to question whether or not I even want to continue pursuing the industry I\u2019ve been mentally committed to for 14 years. \n\nI\u2019m at a crossroads, a quarter-life crisis, and I feel so incredibly overwhelmed. I want a successful life, but I question my ability to actually push myself in order to achieve it.\n\nFor anyone else out there that has gone/is going through this, can you lend some advice?
