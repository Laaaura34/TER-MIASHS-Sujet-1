I've got enough self-awareness that Im not finidng joy in life, that i've lost motivation, stay up way too late and struggle to function. But I decided to become better for myself, my kids and husband. \nI've got a few things on my list that I've started / will start to work on but I can mark one thing off. I told myself the next job I see advertised that matches my skill set, I would apply, regardless of who was advertising. On Monday, I applied for my dream role. I had a call today to ask if I do an interview next week. Advertised roles in my line of work are rare as chicken teeth so Im beyond excited for this opportunity. Even if I dont get it, Im happy to make the first cut.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt7v8v/applied_for_dream_job_on_monday_and_got_a_call/", "title": "Applied for dream job on Monday and got a call back today", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MuchOutlandishness25", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 54, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632318333, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pt7v8v/applied_for_dream_job_on_monday_and_got_a_call/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437292.7644997, "replies_charged": false}
