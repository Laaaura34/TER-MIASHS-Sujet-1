In my late teenage years I committed horrible acts. I can't be specific, although they were not of a criminal nature, but were still morally repugnant. I am in therapy for my issues, and have been making some good progress.\n\nI think about my past every day. Everything I've done, all my sins. I am known and respected in my community. But it's all a facade. Nobody sees the ugliness behind my polite smile, nobody knows of the awful things I've done. There are times, I must confess, where the guilt overwhelms me to the point of considering suicide, feeling like the world would be better off without me. I have changed, I am not the person I was five years ago, and look back in disgust.\n\nI find myself wondering about sins I didn't even commit. There were several times when I could have acted far worse than I did, but thankfully even in my darkest days I still had a shred of a conscience.\n\nBut what's the point of that? What's the point of feeling sorry? The past is set in stone. I have made changes in my life, some days I feel happier than I used to, although I don't deserve it. Can horrible people truly move on to become good?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p7k43n/is_there_truly_redemption_for_the_worst_of_us/", "title": "Is there truly redemption for the worst of us?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Low_Ad_7363", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629396128, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p7k43n/is_there_truly_redemption_for_the_worst_of_us/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435369.705892, "replies_charged": false}
