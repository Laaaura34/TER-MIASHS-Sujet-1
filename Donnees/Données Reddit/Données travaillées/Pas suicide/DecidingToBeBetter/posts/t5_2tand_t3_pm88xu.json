Not an introvert I'm loud with people once I get comfortable with them, but like \"not very outgoing\", and low self esteem and confidence is one of the main reasons. Because there was a huge improvement in my mindset this quarantine, I was motivated to put myself out there, step out of my comfort zone and always do what I'm uncomfortable doing, also, growth mindset is a big big help. It felt like I could accomplish anything. \n\nI was too dumb to realize that it would not be as easy as I expected. That I could just fake it till I make it then I would be just fine. College started just last month and every day until now I realize that the anxiety is still here. I still overanalyze everybody's actions, my self esteem didn't get any better, I guess I did a few things that I'm usually against doing but I'm really having a hard time. I'm still intimidated by everyone. \n\nIt was just my mindset after all. I can't convince myself to be confident and don't give a sh\\*t about the small things. I can't stop myself from worrying about useless stuff. My friends would sound \"off\" to me, and my mood will change in a swift even though they probably didn't even think about it.
