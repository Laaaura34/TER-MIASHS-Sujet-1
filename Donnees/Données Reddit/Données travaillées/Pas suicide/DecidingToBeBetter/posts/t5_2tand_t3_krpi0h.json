It's not enough to have people around you that are nice, but you also need people who understand exactly how much work you are putting in so you can have someone besides yourself proud of your growth. (Example: If you're an author, your family and friends may not think you've reached success until you write a New York Bestseller.) You deserve to receive praise every step of the way. After finishing that first chapter, rough draft, final draft, landing a publisher, etc. Find your tribe and affirm each others actions to create more peace of mind you are going in the right direction. Without this kind of support system, you may doubt yourself and change course, even if you were going the right way the whole time. You may not always hear them cheering. But that doesn't mean you haven't achieved something worth of a standing ovation.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/krpi0h/go_where_you_are_appreciated/", "title": "Go where you are appreciated", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "zackaryfloriano", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 118, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1609945283, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/krpi0h/go_where_you_are_appreciated/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435889.3952794, "replies_charged": false}
