But I didn\u2019t address it talk about why, I indulged it. \n\nI ended up breaking his heart so I could run off and feel appreciated by someone else. I didn\u2019t tell him that was why though. I avoided telling him much at all because I \u2018didn\u2019t want to hurt him\u2019. I am a coward.\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t stick to it because actually I did love him. So I tried stayed attached to him and ended up messing his feelings around while I tried to understand my own. \n\nI built a huge and messy web of lies because the truth seemed impossible and so dangerous. I hid so much, but found private ways to try and process it, like talking to my friends about half truths and fleeting feelings. \n\nAll he wanted was my commitment. He was willing to forgive me for all of it if I could just show him I was serious about dedicating everything to him again. I couldn\u2019t do that. \n\nAnd as irony goes, I am now in place where I feel like I can, where I\u2019ve processed so much of the darkness and realised what is actually important. Yet he\u2019s accessed my phone and read everything I\u2019ve shared and confessed to with my friends. The half truths, the really painful truths, more lies. \n\nHe knows the darkness in me that I wanted to hide from everyone. He knows my deepest secrets, all my doubts, all the shameful things I\u2019ve thought and felt towards him throughout this time. I can\u2019t imagine the pain he must be feeling right now.\n\nI throw myself into other people\u2019s problems as a way of avoiding my own. I talk up such a good game about being a fair and understanding person. I am full of shit. My imposter has been revealed to the person I was trying most to hide it from and I am facing my retribution. \n\nI deserve every moment of this pain.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ot6gqi/i_thought_i_was_good_but_im_so_selfish_and_i_have/", "title": "I thought I was good but I\u2019m so selfish and I have to change", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "allthecolouredgrass", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627464487, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ot6gqi/i_thought_i_was_good_but_im_so_selfish_and_i_have/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436979.0413544, "replies_charged": false}
