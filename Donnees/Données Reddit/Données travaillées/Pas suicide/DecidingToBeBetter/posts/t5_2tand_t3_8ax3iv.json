I avoid failure and fake humility to make myself seem greater than I am. I take up hobbies that seem like something a cool guy would do. I prostrate myself before others I care about in hopes that they'll do the same for me. I resent the happiness of others because they derive it from sources that aren't me. I didn't really love her, I was attached to the satisfaction of having someone to routinely impress and think about me. The crippling instability and literal constant thought about her isn't due to love, it's because I lost the dopamine rush I derived from attention and occasional admiration. My self harm wasn't the outward expression of a soul tortured by depression, it was the manifestation of a narcissist desperate for pity. I deserve none.\n\nThis post isn't so much for asking how to be better, as it's basically the foundation of my entire being, and changing that would be like making Paul McCartney hate music. But how do I avoid giving into it as often and keeping it from hurting others/me as often? The 'withdrawals' I have when people dislike me a physically sickening. I've had compound fractures that hurt less.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8ax3iv/im_honestly_just_not_a_good_person/", "title": "I'm honestly just not a good person", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SnicklefritzSkad", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 201, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1523265153, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8ax3iv/im_honestly_just_not_a_good_person/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438156.637073, "replies_charged": false}
