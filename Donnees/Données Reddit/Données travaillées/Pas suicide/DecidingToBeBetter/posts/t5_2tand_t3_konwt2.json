Freezer and some fridge space is totally full and I\u2019m set for the month. I have spent a quarter of the amount of money on food I normally do on dinners and I\u2019m PUMPED. \n\n\nFirst time I meal prepped and I\u2019m so proud it went well and I have all these delicious and healthy (relatively) meals ready for me. No longer have to worry and plan and subsequently get depressed which leads to ordering or just eating a family sized bag of crisps for dinner. I\u2019m going to force 2020 to be better. Here we go.\n\n\nI made: Biryani, Swedish Meatballs and Mash, Lasagne, Cajun Pasta, Tuna Pasta Bake, Shepherds Pie.\n\n\nI definitely plan to be healthier but I wanted to start off easy and just focus on portioning correctly. I know I can be my worst enemy so hopefully this will force me to actually Be Better.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/konwt2/have_no_one_to_tell_but_i_cooked_a_whole_months/", "title": "Have no one to tell but I cooked a whole months meals for 2 people over the last 2 days of the year and I\u2019m proud.
