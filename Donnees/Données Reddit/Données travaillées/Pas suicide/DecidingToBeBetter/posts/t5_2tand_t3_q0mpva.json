Ill take it easy with myself and forgive myself for my mistakes and will be my own best friend. I will try to put  an end to the negative spiral that goes in my mind. Any advice or words of motivation are appreciated :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0mpva/im_so_sick_of_being_depressed_and_watching_others/", "title": "Im so sick of being depressed and watching others on my Instagram stories living their best life, so I'll create the life that i want for myself by myself", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LostinTranslation594", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 252, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633283001, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0mpva/im_so_sick_of_being_depressed_and_watching_others/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436251.3021839, "replies_charged": false}
