Main reason for struggles is we've come unprepared. I suffered severe depression and anxiety alone when all the years of hard work went into trash, from a 12k dollars monthly income to zero. I was too scared to start over, and too embarrassed to start from scratch again.  But I realized that, that should end now, I have no one to blame but myself I need to own my mistakes. I have transformed myself once, then I can do it again. I know the process, I believe in myself.\n\nSo as the new year starts, I am immensely pleased to announce that I am starting 2 new jobs, and starting from scratch.\n\nMay we all have a prosperous new year.\n\n\\#motivation #becomebetter #journey", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kql6wi/starting_from_the_scratch/", "title": "Starting from the scratch", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Esteep", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1609803706, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kql6wi/starting_from_the_scratch/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437883.122153, "replies_charged": false}
