About a week ago, I decided to take the journey to self-compassion and take advantage of quarantine in a beneficial way. I started to ride my bike almost daily and my goal was to ride 10 miles. \n\nI started out at 4 miles, built it up to 7 and today I ACTUALLY DID IT!! As I finished the last loop around the my neighborhood I hit 10.22 miles in 1hr 18 min. Although I can\u2019t feel my legs much, I\u2019m so proud of myself lol. \n\nA month ago, this pandemic caused me so much anxiety and depression. Since I started to think of the positives more, to be grateful for what I have, and to love myself for who I am, my mentality changed completely and for the better. Sure, there are days where I\u2019m not doing okay mentally (which is totally OKAY), but what\u2019s important is not giving up even when those bad days occur. \n\nReading everyone\u2019s posts in this subreddit makes me even more motivated so I just want to say... GREAT JOB! KEEP IT UP! YOU\u2019RE DOING AMAZING!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/grsrl3/10_miles/", "title": "10 MILES!!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "anicondah", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1590614880, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/grsrl3/10_miles/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435503.062989, "replies_charged": false}
