Now that I've been back in the UK for 5 months I can honestly say I've never felt this hollow and empty in my life.\n\nI came thinking I was going to be a movie director and have ridiculous levels of success. In reality, what actually happened is that I gained 17 kg in body weight.\n\nI've never worked a day in my life. I applied to 2 jobs within 3 weeks and declined both of them before I even started because the idea of work scares me. \n\nI'm known as the embarrassment in the family for dropping out of medicine. Some friends and family don't want to speak to me anymore. Now I'm thinking of going back to the overseas med school and getting the degree, even though I don't want to be a doctor. \n\nI think the most optimistic and terrifying thing about life is that you can do anything.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nn9k3l/dont_know_what_to_do/", "title": "Don't know what to do.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "guitar_strummer", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622241420, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nn9k3l/dont_know_what_to_do/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437497.7641163, "replies_charged": false}
