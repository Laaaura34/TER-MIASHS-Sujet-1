I had my eye on a course that requires intermediate programming in JavaScript (which I didn\u2019t know previously) and I\u2019m finally there! \n\nAll weekend I was completing coding challenges and celebrating, \u2018I did it!\u2019. Those moments used to be few and a result of a lot of googling. I still google but more for syntax rather than for tips on how to approach the logic or actual solutions. \n\nSolving coding challenges wasn\u2019t something I\u2019ve done in my other languages, we usually went from basic syntax to building projects in school which is supposed to be a good way to learn but I think a certain level of proficiency should have been acquired before then (and I didn\u2019t have it). \n\nIn any case, I leveled up.
