Taking care of oneself does not necessarily mean spending lavishly, sometimes it is the smallest things such as taking a deep breath and being still. Many of us are accustomed to prioritizing other people's welfare that we tend to forget ours. Try to change that mindset. Remember, you cannot pour from an empty cup. You need time to replenish your spirit so it allows you to serve others from the overflow. In short, you cannot flood the world with kindness if you are not kind to yourself. \n\n>***\"When things change inside you, things change around you.\"***", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ikkjn9/read_what_is_selfcare_and_why_is_it_important/", "title": "Read: What is Self-Care And Why Is It Important", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "jnpln", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1598968020, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ikkjn9/read_what_is_selfcare_and_why_is_it_important/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437627.1948652, "replies_charged": false}
