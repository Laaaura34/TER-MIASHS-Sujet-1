I\u2019ve tried to adjust things, but I think finally coming to terms with this has the potential to change my life. I don\u2019t want to sound overdramatic, but at this point my phone is really messing with my life and happiness between not being able to sleep, focus, or be present. I guess what I\u2019m asking for is help with the motivation to follow through with it because now I\u2019ve decided I want to, but I could keep making excuses forever. Does anyone else have experience with this? Sorry if this is the wrong place for this, I just feel like you guys are a little bit nicer than some of the other more specific subreddits I\u2019ve found about this topic (I mean no offense to them - I understand why).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lt5kxs/getting_rid_of_my_smartphone/", "title": "Getting rid of my smartphone", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "krazykrizy", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614367480, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lt5kxs/getting_rid_of_my_smartphone/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437736.5779586, "replies_charged": false}
