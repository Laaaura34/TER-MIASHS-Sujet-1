I've heard it described as a bottomless pit inside of all of us, that can't be fulfilled with drugs, money, or my favorite method, food. I've been using food since my early teens to get over this feeling, using it to comfort me at the end of a long day, or long spans of depressive summers. It didn't work though, because by 14, I was extremely unhappy, having mental breakdowns at school etc. \n\nI began intuitive eating this year, and soon after, I realized I had a deep unfulfilment that I was filling with food. It helped me look forward to living, if that makes sense. I always told myself \"Well at least I can eat \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ later.\" to get me through the day. Then I'd binge on food, not wanting to feel myself \"empty\" again for as long as possible.\n\nHow do you fulfill yourself other than food?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/funt38/fulfilment_other_than_food/", "title": "Fulfilment other than food?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ranrur", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1585976723, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/funt38/fulfilment_other_than_food/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436723.421055, "replies_charged": false}
