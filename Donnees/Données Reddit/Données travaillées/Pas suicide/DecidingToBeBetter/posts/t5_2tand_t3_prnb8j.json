I left, and made a life for myself. \n\nNow, more than 4 years later, I want to go back and find a real career for myself, something I am passionate about and can be proud of. \n\nI know it\u2019s going to be a long journey, and I\u2019m definitely scared about falling into previous habits and pitfalls\u2026 but I\u2019m also committed to making a better path and that is what is driving me. I\u2019m ready, and I\u2019m going to do this!\n\nIf you have any advice on school, finding one\u2019s niche, motivation, etc\u2026 I would love to hear it.
