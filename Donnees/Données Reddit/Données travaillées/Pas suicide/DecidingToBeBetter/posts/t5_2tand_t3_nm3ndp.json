Sometimes, that\u2019s calling or reaching out to a friend or a professional. Sometimes, it\u2019s going to the store. Sometimes, it\u2019s going for a short walk. Sometimes, it\u2019s using my voice (selective mutism). Sometimes, it\u2019s using exposure therapy in short increments for noises and lights. Sometimes, it\u2019s doing a chore that\u2019s been waiting for a week.\n\nBasically, change doesn\u2019t happen all at once because I didn\u2019t become this complex person all at once. But, becoming complacent is the true enemy of becoming better. I\u2019ve fallen victim to it too many times in my life and I refuse to do that anymore. \n\nEvery day, I do something difficult and every day, there\u2019s a new challenge that awaits me. Every day, I struggle with the idea of staying in bed vs. doing something. There are a lot of things in my life that I have no control over but there are a lot of things that I do.\n\nMy twin flame died last month and this is the first hard death I\u2019m dealing with sober. Like, 1000% sober. All of the small difficult things I do daily don\u2019t compare to this, but it is something I not only want to do but have to do. \n\nSo, my friends, I extend this challenge to you. Do one difficult thing a day. It doesn\u2019t have to be this huge show. It could be bringing those dirty dishes to the sink or putting your clothes away.\n\nEvery day, we have a choice to make. But, every day we are given an opportunity. Take it.
