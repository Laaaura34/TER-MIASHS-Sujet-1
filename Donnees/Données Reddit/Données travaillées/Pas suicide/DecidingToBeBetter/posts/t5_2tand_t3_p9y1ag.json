No one to help me out of bed on bad days. No one to celebrate the good.\n\nI imagine this is what good friends good family or a good relationship feels like.\n\nToday I'll try to get on my Dr calender.. I hope this time it doesn't get cancelled. It's hard to even get me to schedule much less re schedule...\n\nWish me luck. I don't want to fall apart.
