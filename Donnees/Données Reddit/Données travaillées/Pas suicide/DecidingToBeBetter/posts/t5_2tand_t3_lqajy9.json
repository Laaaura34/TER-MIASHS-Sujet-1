At first, it's not really a big deal for me, but it slowly affected my relationship with online friends, I became much more distant toward them by instinct and starting to doubt myself if my choice of word or attitude toward them is acceptable which contrast to my friendly and easygoing personality in the past. As a result, I engage in conversation less and less with them and before I know it, I'm basically a ghost on an online platform.\n\n It really didn't help much either once I got into college, I tried to make myself look as friendly and outgoing as much as possible, but after some time has passed I'm slowly reverting to my quiet self, even so, I'm still very lucky for making some friend and a group in college, even if it's a single group and they're very patient with me and my personality (Everyone in my group has a very friendly and outgoing attitude).\n\nNow I'm in my second year of college and I really want to get rid of this habit for both my family and friends. Any advice would be really helpful, thank you for reading this!  \n\n\nPS. English isn't my first language so I do apologize if I make grammatical errors.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lqajy9/how_to_overcome_my_overthinking_habit/", "title": "How to overcome my overthinking habit?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Toramaru22", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614058868, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lqajy9/how_to_overcome_my_overthinking_habit/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435442.3486328, "replies_charged": false}
