A couple days ago, I marked being 6 months sober without even realizing it until yesterday. \n\nOver my senior summer, I used all my graduation money on drugs. Pot, acid, shrooms, mdma, alcohol, nicotine, and even cocaine. I was going through a breakup, witnessed paramedics narcan my father, surrounded myself with God awful, manipulative influences, and simply victimized myself. I fell down the dark rabbit hole trying to escape my problems. I avoided my therapist, pushed away family, \u201cgot around\u201d, became extremely impulsive, and found myself a sugar daddy. \n\nAfter New Years, I got a job offer at an ER. I found my purpose in life that I had forgotten. I dropped those friends, boys I had been fooling around with, the sugar daddy, my drug dealers; Then I opened up to my therapist. I felt embarrassed and disappointed in myself. I realized I didn\u2019t want to be stuck in the same cycle as my parents. \n\nSo, here I am. 6 months later. Finally fucking sober and giving my middle finger to the universe.\n\nThank you for reading.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nrp9eu/6_months_sober/", "title": "6 Months Sober...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "r01y4t", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 85, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622757754, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nrp9eu/6_months_sober/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436132.5375414, "replies_charged": false}
