Lately, my compulsion for the dopamine of scrolling the feed has been too damn high.  \n\n\nI used to post a lot also, but I stopped a few years ago, and my quality of life improved a lot, by being more present\u2014not calculating my next flex on Instagram.  \n\n\nHowever, I still use it as a means of following varied information outlets that you wouldn\u2019t find elsewhere, like pop culture, memes, and even just my friends from back home (and the things they share, that give me a glimpse of what\u2019s happening in my native country more widely).  \n\n\nI used to have an Android that would allow me to block Instagram on certain periods of the day through some apps. Now I\u2019m with iPhone, and while it does have the Screen Time function, that is rather a dreadful and inefficient way of trying to do the same thing. So I constantly delete the app for a few days, then install it again after losing habit, but the habit builds back quickly.  \n\n\nI have tried many things, but I\u2019d love to hear if my fellow Redditors have faced this and could share some advice.
