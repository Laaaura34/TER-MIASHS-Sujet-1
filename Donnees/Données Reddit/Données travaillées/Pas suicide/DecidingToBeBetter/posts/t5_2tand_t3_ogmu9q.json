I have been watching pornography . Only up to recently did i try to quit it . Mainly because i started getting more hobbies like reading and learning about stuff that i enjoy(mainly about science ) . I found out that a significant ammount of time in a day i use to masturbate . \n\nI tried quitting it , first , by engage myself more into my hobby but when nighttime came , i masturbate myself into i fall asleep and did the same thing in the morning . I then  tried  to quit by blocking websites , apps , anything that related to porns . It works for awhile until few  weeks  later i snapped and when back to my old habbit . When i was forcing myself to not masturbate . I see that my body reacted violently . My heartbeat increases , my eyesight became a bit blurly,  my leg started rubbing each other , my head constantly visualizing sences   throughout the day . When i do masturbate , i dont feel good , happy  , anything at all . Only afterward did i feel miserable for wasting time  and \nHating myself . I tried Journaling myself each day but then quit , doing different types of hobbies but then found a loophole for when to mastubate . It seems that the momment the craving kicks in i just cant resist it . \n\nI did a reflection momment where i just think for a bit and found out that i constantly thinking about porns related things .\n\nIdk what to do now beside just ignore it and when  it comes . I just kinda gave in  and  i convinced myself that is fine . Eventhough i know it's not .\n\n\n\n\nEdit \nHello . So it is one day after the initial post and i have received some great advice from many kind people . \nMany of whom ensure me that this reaction of wanting explore myself at a young age is a normal and okay thing .  So ill try coping it with by minimum ammount of time spending masturbating . I have had an urge at today morning  and usally i would spend wasteless  hours and feel bad later on (most of the times i do not remember any of it except after im done ) . Now I try  dealt with it by  going to the bathroom and did a quick one instead . It was suggested by u/Delphicon . I'll admit that tge urge is kinda now gone and i dont really feel anything . \nI thought of keeping myself a journal throughout this process seeing what will happen . At day something , i will make an update .\nIm happy to see many suggestion like workout , mediate  and cold shower . I try to implement it  into my day  routines .", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ogmu9q/i_cant_quit_porn/", "title": "I cant quit porn", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Commercial_Fold3230", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 21, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625800175, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ogmu9q/i_cant_quit_porn/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436454.283699, "replies_charged": false}
