It automatically triggered me to answer even though I told my partner I should not take the call, I did it anyway. I overstepped my own personal boundaries and well being for someone who is not present in my life and I have hurt my own self in doing this.\n\nI was so worked up from the call that I had an anxiety attack after I hung up and was trying to re-establish my bearings and focus on the test, but I could not do so. Admittingly, I looked up two questions online and changed my answers. I have spent the last week berating myself, I have talked to my therapist and several people about this and only two people have told me to tell the professor about it. I have been losing sleep, having panic, and feel an incredible amount of guilt about this and have also been feeling guilt when I want to do anything that is remotely considered fun.\n\nI finally broke down and emailed the teacher. I am relieved that I admitted it, but so afraid of the repercussions. I have my A.A. and went on to a university as well and did a quarter there and have never had this happen or been in trouble for anything.\n\nI explained all of this to the professor and have expressed my shame and guilt over this, apologized profusely, I have also admitted that I am afraid of being expelled and having this on my permanent record which could prevent me from getting into a university after this, but that I understand there are consequences for the actions.\n\nI am VERY aware of what I have done and have no intention of ever doing this again. \n\nHas anyone been through this and what was your outcome?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k1qoj9/cheated_on_an_exam/", "title": "Cheated On An Exam", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "talespinner1977", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1606436393, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k1qoj9/cheated_on_an_exam/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438460.4636252, "replies_charged": false}
