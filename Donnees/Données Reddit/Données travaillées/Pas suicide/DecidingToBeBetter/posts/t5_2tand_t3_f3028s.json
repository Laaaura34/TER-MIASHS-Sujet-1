Hadn't seen him in a couple of months, as with most of my friends where I live. The kicker is, we all live within the same like, 3 mile area, yet I've barely seen most of them in the past few months, mainly due to my own staying busy and being pretty okay with not having much of a social life. But last night reminded me that, even being someone who is more than okay being a social recluse, keeping at least a mild social life is super important. It's crazy that I can live so close to so many friends but literally not see any of them for months on end, and not even make an effort to see them. So I'm gonna change that. I'm gonna work on being more social and seeing the people I care about more often, even with an already hectic schedule. It's easy to take those close to us for granted, so I think that makes this goal all the more worthwhile.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/f3028s/the_importance_of_maintaining_a_social_life/", "title": "The Importance of Maintaining a Social Life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "pissinmeplease", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 657, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1581549117, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/f3028s/the_importance_of_maintaining_a_social_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437007.1506195, "replies_charged": false}
