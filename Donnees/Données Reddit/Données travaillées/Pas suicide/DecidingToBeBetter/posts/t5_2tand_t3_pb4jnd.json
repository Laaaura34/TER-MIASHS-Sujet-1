I\u2019ve started eating right and cooking meals for myself, I even have fun cooking. I started getting active again, I love working out it feels amazing and I do a lot of yoga. Yoga is my favorite, and meditation. I\u2019ve been taking extra good care of my hygiene and keeping my space clean. I switched into a new major in college which was really tough to figure out, I even took a semester off to figure out what to do with that and just worked jobs constantly and disappeared and moved home during that time, but now I feel so so so much better and like I\u2019m finally on a good path. That was huge and scary. Now I feel motivated in school again. I am in therapy and reflecting on everything. I feel like I know myself so well now, everything is connected. I am more calm minded and logical in decisions. I\u2019ve begun to set boundaries in toxic relationships and stopped trying to please people I don\u2019t even like. I\u2019m prioritizing my well being when I make decisions. I\u2019m not smoking weed every single day anymore. I\u2019m reading again. There\u2019s a lot more. I feel so much more right with my soul.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pb4jnd/ive_made_so_so_so_many_changes_the_past_8_months/", "title": "I\u2019ve made so so so many changes the past 8 months", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Outrageous_Reward136", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629868266, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pb4jnd/ive_made_so_so_so_many_changes_the_past_8_months/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435782.7650542, "replies_charged": false}
