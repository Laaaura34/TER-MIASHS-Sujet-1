I basically rely on women for all my validation which has not worked well for me so far. I try to attend events but I get really anxious and usually talk with them for like five minutes and then they leave or just chicken out of approaching. I see my friends dating and hooking up right when I'm there and it just makes me depressed that I am unable to connect with girls or many guys for that matter. It's worse because people say I'm attractive, but I just don't have the confidence to do anything. I'm not an incel or anything it is definitely all my issues which are preventing this from happening but I just need some general advice on how to stop looming over this. It really bothers me because I really want to have affection / partner.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0qef0/everyone_around_me_is_datinghooking_up_and_it/", "title": "Everyone around me is dating/hooking up and it makes me depressed", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "No-Pop-256", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633293981, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0qef0/everyone_around_me_is_datinghooking_up_and_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438190.4388459, "replies_charged": false}
