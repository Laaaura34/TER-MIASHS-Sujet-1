When I was a freshman in college, I decided to be a doctor since my dad passed away from cancer when I was young. I wanted to be an oncologist ever since I can remember. It was kind of pushed onto me by my mom since having a kid who a doctor is essentially a dream for most parents. \n\nI had a really tough time at college my first year. I was dating someone at the time (my first boyfriend) who was at home and older and he didn\u2019t make my life easy. I let it happen because I was young and na\u00efve. I essentially was left out of all group activities. Everyone I knew was accepted into a sorority but the one I had \u201ctried out\u201d for didn\u2019t accept me even though they had no quota and took everyone else. It started a huge bout of depression as I was young and rejected and dealt with a lot of issues with self esteem my whole life. \n\nI transferred home and had no idea what I wanted to do, but I decided it wasn\u2019t being a doctor. I went to a community college while i figured things out and decided on accounting based on my moms recommendation. And I transferred to a prestigious school in my area that was cheap. About a few months before my graduation, I had the realization that I could not be an accountant for the rest of my life or I\u2019d be miserable. I fell into a huge depression. I resented my mom for \u201cforcing me\u201d to follow something I didn\u2019t like. But in reality, my life is my choice and I can\u2019t make any decision without my own consent. \n\nFast forward 4 years later, and I work at a non-profit doing accounting work. It is not my \u201cdream job\u201d in any way but I have realized that happiness doesn\u2019t come from a job, money, or anything outside of myself- it comes from within. Everyday, I work on improving myself with love instead of resentment or feelings of lack, and it has transformed my experience. I don\u2019t love crunching numbers behind a desk, but I do love my life everyday because I decide to begin each day with my own purpose, to live with love, authenticity, and openness. Instead of dreading work each morning with the fear that I am wasting my life today, I look for opportunity to grow. Whenever resistant thoughts arise, I work on them. I let the feelings come up, see where the trigger is, and take action towards healing it. \n\nI\u2019ve always been passionate about writing and helping people, probably because I know I could\u2019ve used that when I was younger when I felt lost, and want to be a ray of hope and shine a light toward others people\u2019s own power that we all have within. There\u2019s so much we can control but we don\u2019t have to hold on so tightly to a plan because we have no idea what\u2019s going to happen or what opportunities arise in our day to day lives. Our entire life can change in an instant. \n\nI look forward to each day instead of thinking \u201csame shit, different day\u201d, because I have dedicated my life to growth. I truly believe this will manifest in my outer life one day, if I stay true to myself and am authentic in every interaction, which I struggled with for so long. I try to be the best girlfriend, daughter, friend, and coworker each day. When I fall short, I learn and start again with new insight. \n\nEach day I take small steps towards becoming the best me possible. I take courses on self improvement. I read a lot. I write because it\u2019s my favorite thing to do. And I share what I\u2019ve learned along the way because I think that\u2019s why I am here. But i don\u2019t have to have my dream career to live my purpose. I can live it everyday. And that\u2019s what I am trying to do, live my purpose in each action I take, and learn about myself and others during these daily interactions so I can gain new insights. I have been truly happy living this way, so I wanted to share for anyone who feels like they\u2019re stuck in their career or hating each moment of their life when they\u2019re at work or wherever they are. \n\nYour purpose is more than your career. Live your truth, be compassionate, loving, and kind to yourself first and foremost, and the rest will fall together. If you strive to be the best version of you everyday, I know your life will reflect something extremely beautiful back to you. If i can do it, I am positive you all can. \n\nSending you all love", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dzmt00/dont_get_so_caught_up_on_your_dream_career/", "title": "Don\u2019t get so caught up on your \u2018dream career/ purpose\u2019.
