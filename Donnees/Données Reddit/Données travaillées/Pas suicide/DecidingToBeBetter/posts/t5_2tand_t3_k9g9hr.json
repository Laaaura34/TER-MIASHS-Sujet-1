Weed was my crutch, my excuse, and my safe place which in a lot of ways kept me in a toxic relationship with someone who had serious issues, and was verbally and mentally abusive. I stayed in that relationship for 6 years with someone that refused to quit with me no matter how hard I begged. She had full knowledge of how bad my addiction was, and how bad my asthmatic lungs were getting. I left her over the summer, but kept smoking before my workouts, but didn't hurry myself to step away from one thing that kept me somewhat happy. \n\nShe ended up being as bad as I thought, never made an attempt to say goodbye to my parents, family, friends, and went after my money and personal effects. She took so much at one point, I just realized these possessions mean nothing to me anymore and that health was the only thing I needed to take away with me. \n\nAs I approached quitting I contiued replacing weed with working out and eating better. Typing this makes me so happy I kind tear up, what is that about? Anyhow I lost a lot of weight while slowly quitting for a few months until finally dropping the last of my stash in the garbage... that moment sucked and also was freeing, 150$ of weed, 200$ vaporizer, and misc pot stuffs. Worth every penny to be done.\n\nI hope others who read this know that yes its hard, but once you get past that first 2 week period it gets easier. There will always be temptations, but knowing who you want to be, can be who you actually were in the first place... that always gives me comfort. If anyone reads this, thanks. Im finally happy (even in 2020). Peace and love homies and cheers to your progression and growth.\n\n\nEdit 1: wow thank you all for the support and awards.
