My wife (and our couples therapist) have been encouraging me to get my own therapist for months. Though I know they\u2019re right, I have been CHOOSING to use my justified pain as an excuse not to.\n\nBut today. I did it. I made an appointment with a therapist I think will be a great match. From the outside it might seem small, but for me right now it\u2019s a massive accomplishment. \n\nThanks for listening.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lalpxa/i_finally_made_an_appointment_with_a_therapist/", "title": "I finally made an appointment with a therapist!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "kjimbro", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 75, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612234591, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lalpxa/i_finally_made_an_appointment_with_a_therapist/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436191.1019642, "replies_charged": false}
