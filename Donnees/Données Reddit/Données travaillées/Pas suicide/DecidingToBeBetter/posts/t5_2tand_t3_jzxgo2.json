I don't visit at a lot of social media sites (Instagram, Reddit, and YouTube are it), but I've seen how little \"meaningful engagement\" I get out of the majority of the content I scroll through.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo tonight, I sat down and made a list of all of the subreddits that show up in my feed. I worked through the list one by one and asked \"is the content here useful to me? or is it just noise?\" If I couldn't answer that one way or the other, I went and poked around a bit to look at the sort of content in those subreddits. Some where funny, some were cute, and some were mildly interesting (literally). But many of them were, more or less, noise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not planning on \"quitting\" reddit anytime soon, I think it still bring value to my existence. For now, I'm just working on leaving the parts of reddit that don't. Improve the signal to noise ration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd like to do this again in the short term future. See what subreddits I miss, which ones I find I don't need anymore, which ones I really enjoy that were buried among the others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I thought I'd share this with you r/decidingtobebetter, in case there's anyone else out there who can find some value in this post. Plus, I wanted to let this subreddit know that it made the cut.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis time ;)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jzxgo2/i_left_28_subreddits/", "title": "I left 28 subreddits", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Dejouxx", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 967, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1606189459, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jzxgo2/i_left_28_subreddits/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435436.1975343, "replies_charged": false}
