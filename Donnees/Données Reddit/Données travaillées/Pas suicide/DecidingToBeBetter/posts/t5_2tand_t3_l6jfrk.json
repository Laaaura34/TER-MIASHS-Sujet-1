I used to drink to turn off the negative voice in my head, or to stop my mind from racing. That isn\u2019t an option anymore. Neither are medications, as my addictive tendencies and extreme lack of impulse control make it very easy to abuse them. I want to retrain my thinking. I need to learn how to use my extreme drive to my advantage at home. I\u2019m so used to physically demanding jobs that it\u2019s hard to focus on simply folding the laundry, or putting dishes away. The biggest struggle I have is misplacing something. I completely lose it, and hyper focus on the recovery of the item while putting everything else off.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l6jfrk/i_want_to_be_a_better_dad_but_i_cant_get_out_of/", "title": "I want to be a better Dad, but I can\u2019t get out of my ADHD head.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "GobisFree", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1611794879, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l6jfrk/i_want_to_be_a_better_dad_but_i_cant_get_out_of/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435183.1626072, "replies_charged": false}
