Starting today, I\u2019m not drinking, and I\u2019m only going to smoke socially until I feel ready enough to give it up completely. I\u2019m done being controlled by my addictions. Instead, whenever I want to do something counterproductive, I\u2019m going to throw myself into my music. Record covers, beats, original songs, anything as long as my body and mind are being used to create something of value for myself and the people around me. My body is a temple for the music I create.\n\nThis is the sobriety arc.
