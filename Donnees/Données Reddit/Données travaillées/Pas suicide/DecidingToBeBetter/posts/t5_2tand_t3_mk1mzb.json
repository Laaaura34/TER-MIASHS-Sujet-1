I do a job I enjoy and I\u2019ve got good family and friends but I\u2019ve always been fat. There\u2019s only been one time in my adult life (during 2006 when I decided to run the New York marathon and slimmed down from 273 to 231 lbs) tbag I\u2019ve not been well overweight. It\u2019s never really bothered me; I had moments during my life where I\u2019d see a photo or catch my reflection and just be like \u2018what are you doing?! You look terrible!\u2019 But on the whole I\u2019m just the fat jolly guy and don\u2019t let it get to me. But something changed at the end of last year. I aw some pics and decided that for the sake of me and especially my 5 yo daughter that enough was enough. \n\nI chatted to a group of friends all over the UK who all had similar challenges of their own, set up a whatsapp and started out on 1/1. I weighed in at my heaviest ever, 300 lbs and set myself targets and a plan. Walk 10k steps a day, minimum, manage calories through my fitness pal and maintain a sizeable deficit (typically ~1000 a day) and off I went. Well the weight has fallen off (in 13 weeks to Friday, I\u2019ve lost 66 lbs) and I\u2019m now 234lbs. 3lbs off the lowest I\u2019ve ever been as an adult and I\u2019m planning on going well below even that. I\u2019ve lost 8\u201d off my jeans size and have had to sell basically my entire wardrobe! \n\nBut the thing that\u2019s been REALLY amazing is how this has impacted other areas of my life. My little side hustle of a business which I\u2019d spoken about but done nothing with is now up and running. I\u2019m totally on top of things at work and full of motivation. I now get up at 0545 and walk for a couple of hours minimum, listening to audio books, podcasts and music and I\u2019m more creative and thoughtful than I\u2019ve ever been!\n\nI also realise how much I\u2019d lied to myself. I\u2019m still fat at 234 lbs - but I\u2019d long told myself that if I got to about 252 then I\u2019d no longer be overweight! I\u2019m gonna get myself to a place where I\u2019m genuinely not fat any more and be able to look back and see what\u2019s possible when I apply myself.\n\nStill lots to do both physically (another 24+ lbs to go I\u2019d say) and mentally (keep pushing myself to drive my side hustle forward and challenge myself to push on at work too) but the difference I\u2019ve felt this year has been huge and I\u2019m delighted with the way I\u2019m looking and feeling! Hopefully some things there that inspire others to try something they\u2019ve put off and get stuck in to their journey!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mk1mzb/my_growth_in_2021/", "title": "My growth in 2021", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SpoonieAB3", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617560286, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mk1mzb/my_growth_in_2021/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436201.368189, "replies_charged": false}
