I just kinda laid in the bed and realized over time that between the ages of 18 and 26 I decided to do a lot of get interested quick things without thinking about what I wanted to complete. \n\nSo at 27 I decided, no more. If I want to be a teacher (for example ) I need to get all the info in going to need to at least *know* how to be a teacher. It isn't enough to just WANT it I have to start behaving like the adult within me to begin with. That 30 year old adult needs to basically be an accomplished youth and he wanted to do a lot of things. Perhaps it's time he completed his list of MOOCs instead of just \" saving them \". \n\nI'm sorry for ranting I just realized that I admit it. I flubbed it... hard... I was younger and became too interested in everything and now I'm about to be a 30 year old not accomplishing almost nothing because I was unwilling to make those necessary few steps to habit building that would have flourished to something greater. No more. \n\nI'm here. I made a countdown clock on my phone and im going to complete something ANYTHING on that giant list of stuff. I don't know if all of it can be completed but maybe a majority could. And frankly that's good to me too.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/d3mgoh/3_years_to_real_adult_hood/", "title": "3 years to real adult hood.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "blkplrbr", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 133, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1568365152, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/d3mgoh/3_years_to_real_adult_hood/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436546.884293, "replies_charged": false}
