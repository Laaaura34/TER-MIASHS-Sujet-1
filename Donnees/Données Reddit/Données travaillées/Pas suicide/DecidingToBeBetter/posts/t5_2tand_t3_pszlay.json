While things have generally gotten better, the last month has been a really bad depression period. I\u2019ve always been wary of SSRIs due to the side effects and have justified not taking them with the line of reasoning that therapy and lifestyle changes can be just as if not more effective for some people. \n\nExcept then I don\u2019t actually make lifestyle changes.\n\nI know exercise makes me feel better, but I don\u2019t do it. I know I need to get more sleep, but I don\u2019t make a serious effort to stick to a bed time routine. I know I have a better day when I shower, but I skip it for days at a time. Etc etc.\n\nI\u2019m on a wait list to get a new doctor in a few months, and I\u2019m going to actually take steps toward these lifestyle changes each day between now and then (even if they\u2019re small). If I\u2019m still feeling awful by the time I see the doctor, I can try antidepressants knowing that I\u2019ve already done what I can on my own and that they\u2019re probably necessary.\n\nI have a friend whose anxiety is seriously getting in the way of her health (e.g. migraines from stress, not taking medication for a serious health problem because of fear of side effects) and it\u2019s gotten so bad she\u2019s moving back in with her parents. Seeing that play out has been a big wake up call for me \u2014 I need to take better care of myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pszlay/getting_out_of_my_own_way_and_following_through/", "title": "Getting out of my own way and following through on depression strategies", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Tarsiertree", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632283718, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pszlay/getting_out_of_my_own_way_and_following_through/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436443.1221461, "replies_charged": false}
