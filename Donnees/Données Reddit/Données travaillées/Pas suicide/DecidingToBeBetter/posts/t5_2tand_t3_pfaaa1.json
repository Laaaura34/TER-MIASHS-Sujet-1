I\u2019ve made a lot of progress since I discovered it, but the days I fall back I feel like giving up on trying to do better. \n\nSomething that I\u2019ve done a lot is having the mindset/actions of \u201ceveryone else is wrong, and I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d I\u2019ve been working on that a lot, but then I always come to the question of-what if this situation isn\u2019t me? Should I take the blame anyway, or try to fix it even if it might not be me? Should I overcompensate for the times that I blamed others when it was my fault and I caused a situation? \nI suppose im stuck in the question of validation and acceptance of the given situation. \n\nAnother thing is I want to be open about it. I want to tell everyone that I am so they know what they\u2019re getting into with me, but I know that\u2019s an off putter with others. I already don\u2019t have too many friends, and the ones I do have I cause some kind of drama with at some point. Wether they do something to upset me, or I have a few days or a week where I go completely backwards and I\u2019m a total narcissist. I don\u2019t know what the \u201cright\u201d thing to do is, so I keep it to myself and make references so at least they\u2019re somewhat aware. Is that a good thing to do? Is that normal? Will that do more harm than good?\n\nI want to be my best self. I understand why I\u2019m this way, I understand where I lack, and I understand it\u2019s going to take time to fully improve and be a normal, healthy person. I\u2019m just so lost in conflict and pain from situations. Any advice from others like this, or have dealt with it would honestly be amazing. It\u2019s such a taboo subject that I feel like I can\u2019t talk about it or I\u2019m going to upset others with it.
