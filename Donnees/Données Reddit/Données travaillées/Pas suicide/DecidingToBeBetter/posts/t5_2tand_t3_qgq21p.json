Very easy to like and charming. He\u2019s a 6\u20197, hot, smart, funny and kind man. \nAnother great thing about him is that he\u2019s always had girl friend groups, which I think is a really good thing. I really do get along and love his girl besties, most of them are lesbians anyways, but when it comes to girls I\u2019m unfamiliar with, I\u2019m immediately jealous. I\u2019ll assume they have history or that the girl wants to fuck my boyfriend. Obviously, he\u2019s very liked by women and men alike as he\u2019s been friends with both all his life, but I\u2019m just always assuming the women are on a mission to get him in bed. \nWeirdly, I don\u2019t feel the same jealousy towards men (we are both bisexuals) and even encourage him to let me know if he wanted to take steps towards experimenting with men. \n\nI really do trust my boyfriend not to cheat on me, but I how do I \"trust\" him not to crush or fall for another girl who\u2019d he\u2019d leave me for, or that would make him regret staying with me.... That\u2019s my worst fear. \nI\u2019m also envious of him, for not being jealous/envious like me. I resent him because I wish I had his confidence and security. I also resent him because he\u2019s never had his boundaries disrespected like I have (previous partner) and so he\u2019s never had a reason to become hyper vigilant. I hate my jealousy so much, it makes me feel weak and immature. \n\nI just don\u2019t believe that I am enough. That there isn\u2019t someone objectively better for him than me out there and that the person isn\u2019t coming to steal my boyfriend. \nI just don\u2019t believe I\u2019m \"it\". \n\nI want to change for the better. Even if he isn\u2019t the man I spend the rest of my life with, I\u2019m tired of not feeling like I\u2019m \"it\". I\u2019m tired of wanting to be other people. I feel like I deserve to think I\u2019m the greatest person I know, as narcissistic as that sounds. I want to work on self love and acceptance. \nI don\u2019t know how. \nAll the advice I\u2019ve read sounds like culty coachy bullshit.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgq21p/im_tired_of_being_an_envious_and_jealous_person/", "title": "I\u2019m tired of being an envious and jealous person, especially in my relationship.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "bipbopbip666", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 33, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635315289, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgq21p/im_tired_of_being_an_envious_and_jealous_person/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435814.3381321, "replies_charged": false}
