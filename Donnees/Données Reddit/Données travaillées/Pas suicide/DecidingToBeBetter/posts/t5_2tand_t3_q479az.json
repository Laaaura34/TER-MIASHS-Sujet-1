I'll then let them reassure me that I'm not a terrible person, and message later saying that I was drunk.\n\nToday, I was feeling really shitty. I'm having to quit a job I love due to health concerns, and I've been feeling awful about it. I was going to send this text to a friend of mine calling myself a failure and angling for self pity, but instead I...didn't. Instead I went for a walk, had some apple juice, and watched ted lasso. Am I feeling better? No. Am I feeling proud of myself for this small win?
