But I did not let it affect me negatively. \n\nI went to my phone's gallery and saw the pictures of my parents and siblings from my birthday last month. I feel soo much better and calm and ready to sleep again.\n\nI think I did good, I'll take a look at my own picture as well. Looking at those photos calmed me down and it's like, I felt so good and not alone. \n\n:)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ol5yoz/i_woke_up_from_a_nightmare_and_did_not_let_it/", "title": "I woke up from a nightmare and did not let it scare me", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "finesparrow", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 19, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626396530, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ol5yoz/i_woke_up_from_a_nightmare_and_did_not_let_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435798.8116078, "replies_charged": false}
