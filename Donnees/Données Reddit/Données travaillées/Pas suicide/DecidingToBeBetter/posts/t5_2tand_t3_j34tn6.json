And i thought I missed her so much that I should beg to get her back. I got so hard down on myself that I thought no one will ever love me and like how I look like she does... How could there be? I don\u2019t even like me.\n\nShe\u2019s only shown me how little I mean to her in return. We\u2019re not getting back together. She doesn\u2019t want me. My heart dropped through my stomach and hit the floor before being wedged permanently in my throat. It\u2019s painful to swallow hard truths if your metaphorically suffering from a cartoonish cardiac whiplash.   \n\nIt was a toxic relationship from the get go and all the revisit to the idea of the relationship with her made me realise how unpleasant and abusive she really is and was. Totally un-self aware and mean and tactless. Often about my appearance and weight. Often in front of others and my family, which made it worse. She went on rants about me. Screamed at me. Spat at me. I thought I deserved it all somehow.\n\nSee I\u2019ve never been beautiful. I\u2019ve never been the one to get any looks or have anyone whistle at me or ask me for my number. I don\u2019t go out with friends of an evening and expect to meet anyone, and the only thing I do pull at the end of a night out if the tray of greasy takeaway closer to me while everyone else wanders home.\n\nI feel invisible and yet simultaneously, a red faced caricature, full of sweat and billowing, bulbous folds and chins and made of all the clumsy, unflattering moments everyone winces at. I hate who I am. I can feel how everyone else hates me too.\n\nOver the years my own fucked up childhood got in the way and made my relationship with food and exercise a horrible mess and I started eating and being lazy/hiding out away from people as a coping mechanism. I am now officially obese, I hate it and it makes me horribly depressed and lacking in confidence most days.\n\nBut I think that\u2019s the problem. I\u2019m looking for others to make me feel good and valid. That\u2019s never going to happen. No matter if it was my partner or my friends or my family. \n\nIt\u2019s my fault I don\u2019t like me. I\u2019ve been falling for people who don\u2019t love me for who I am. I\u2019ve been desperately looking for self love eating mountains of junk food until my guts hurt. I\u2019ve not bother counting calories for so long that I\u2019m unaware just how much I attempt to consume in one day (spoiler: waaay too much). It\u2019s a bandage over a broken leg. It\u2019s not helping me.\n\nI need to love me. And loving me isn\u2019t just giving me what I want all the time and rushing to satiate cravings and jumping head first into the takeaways because I feel sad/grumpy/hungry... I can\u2019t just guzzle what I want and expect to be fine! That\u2019s not how it works. Not anymore. I gotta do what I need to do for me. I gotta drink water mostly. I have to get exercise in. I have to start giving a shit and doing the painful and uncomfortable and often deeply unpleasant.\n\nThat\u2019s why people who are beautiful are attractive really, yeah they look good but they also take care of and love themselves. And loving yourself doesn\u2019t always looking like giving in and just eating all the time, that\u2019s making decisions for the long term. I want that for me too.\n\nI want to love myself again. I want to lift weights and get my anger out and listen to metal while I do and not really be sure of what I\u2019m doing. I want to feel strong and lean and beautiful and wear different clothes and surprise myself and surprise everyone else around me. I want to feel healthy and \u201cnormal\u201d and gorgeous and happier. I want to meet other people there who care about themselves too and care about each other and have a laugh with them. I want mates who look out for one another and are interested in the world around them and doing more and going on adventures together. \n\nToday I took the first step in loving myself and getting what I want, I joined a gym. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do when I get there after work and I\u2019m nervous and I\u2019m upset that I don\u2019t know how and I\u2019m the ugliest fattest little thing anyone\u2019s going to see in there today and I\u2019m already cringing... \n\nBut I\u2019m still going to go. Because today I start loving me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j34tn6/today_i_joined_a_gym_and_stopped_pretending_like/", "title": "Today I joined a gym and stopped pretending like I\u2019m okay with being obese and depressed.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "B--E--A--N", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1441, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1601541749, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j34tn6/today_i_joined_a_gym_and_stopped_pretending_like/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438090.5791252, "replies_charged": false}
