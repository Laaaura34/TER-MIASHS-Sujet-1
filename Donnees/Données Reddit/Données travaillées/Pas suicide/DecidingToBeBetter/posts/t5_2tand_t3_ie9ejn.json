However, when I walked 3 miles to the nearest Target I found myself thinking \"If you buy this, you won't use it, and not only will you be depressed you'll be broke too\". \n\nNot broke, but I don't need another board game I can't play, and so I walked back home. \n\nA big part of what I usually used to do was buy things for that eventual dopamine hit that rushed in when I would get a package but my biggest source of unhappiness is where I live and I'm going to need money to move. \n\nSo I don't know, feels good, and I'm proud of myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ie9ejn/today_i_didnt_try_to_buy_my_way_out_of_a/", "title": "Today I didn't try to buy my way out of a depression", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TheDood715", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 423, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1598058684, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ie9ejn/today_i_didnt_try_to_buy_my_way_out_of_a/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435900.0909545, "replies_charged": false}
