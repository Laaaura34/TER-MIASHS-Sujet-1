I don't like to just copy things without knowing it, but because of deadlines I do it a lot especially for math. This semester, the math is very confusing for me and I felt I have lost track and won't be able to cover it, and that's why when this assignment was posted, I was especially afraid. I started with the problems that felt familiar to me, and I did hit a roadblock in one question where I got too excited and made some daring assumptions which made the calculation impossible on my calculator, and most online calcs, however a friend helped me with one and it was such joy to see the answer was correct! That gave me a boost to go on, I had more difficulties but as I could refer as many online materials as I wanted, I did till I was able to solve all of the questions. At the end, I couldn't believe I actually have solved all the questions, on my own! It was a productive weekend for me! I want to continue like this for all my homework! actually doing your homework is such a good feeling.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o4azfl/i_did_my_math_assignment_on_my_own/", "title": "I did my math assignment on my own!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tall_and_funny", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624211261, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o4azfl/i_did_my_math_assignment_on_my_own/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437326.4728694, "replies_charged": false}
