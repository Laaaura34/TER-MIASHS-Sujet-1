But no people are saying I'm rude and aloof.\n\nIn fact, I had to quit my last job because my desire to keep things work related caused a lot of static and people claiming that I thought I was better than them.\n\nIs there a way to learn to be more charming and come across as friendly and sincere (which, I feel I am sincere, but people misinterpret me all the time)?\n\nI've tried \"How to win friends...\" but felt it was about faking sincerity. I want to learn to communicate in a genuine fashion that doesn't scare people or freak them out.\n\nSuggestions?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gq43l5/tips_for_being_more_charming_and_socially_pleasant/", "title": "Tips for being more charming and socially pleasant.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "fire_breathing_bear", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1590379661, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gq43l5/tips_for_being_more_charming_and_socially_pleasant/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435815.8109148, "replies_charged": false}
