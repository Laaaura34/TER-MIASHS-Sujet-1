Talked about a lot of things. Turns out there were a lot of emotions that I was hiding underneath the surface that sort of just came out in that session.\n\nFound out that have trouble with realizing my self-worth, judging myself based on how much value I provide to other people, and trust issues.\n\nI don't get to talk to people much about what I'm going through. So I'm glad I was able to at least have a day to talk to a professional to sort of figure some shit out.\n\nI don't know if I can get everything figured out by the time the semester ends, but I feel as though today was a good start.\n\nI still have feelings of inadequacy that I aim to deconstruct and hopefully overcome. I just know that it takes time to do so.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pr30h2/just_had_my_first_therapy_session_today/", "title": "Just had my first therapy session today.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "angrykumu", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 21, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632034231, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pr30h2/just_had_my_first_therapy_session_today/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437380.511602, "replies_charged": false}
