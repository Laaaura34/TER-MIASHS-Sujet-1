Even if they're complete strangers. I want to not care, but I can't. Like a part of my brain doesn't allow that to happen\n\nSame thing with my fear of being judged. I am aware it's completely imagined most of the time. The times it's not, I'll be judged by people whom I'm most likely never going to meet again, anyways. But it's like a part of my brain refuses to acknowledge that. And it stops me from being myself\n\nAny advice would be welcome.
