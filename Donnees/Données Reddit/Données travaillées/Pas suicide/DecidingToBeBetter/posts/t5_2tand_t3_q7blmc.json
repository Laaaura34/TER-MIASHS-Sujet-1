I tried to make a friend but after many failed attempts leaving me feeling like I was a bother or a burden or annoying for participating in conversations I didn\u2019t even initiate sometimes. I\u2019m chalking it up to we just don\u2019t mix. A while ago I would have went in on myself like you\u2019re such a ducking weirdo. you\u2019re never gonna have any friends etc etc but today I talked myself through my emotions and I told myself after ever attempt you still feel weird and like a burden why keep trying they clearly aren\u2019t as interested as you are and I should move on so I can see and meet my people/person. Feel kinda bummed for trying but also kinda proud I did", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q7blmc/i_put_myself_out_there_lol/", "title": "I put myself out there lol", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "DaddysLittleFoxie__", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634133092, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q7blmc/i_put_myself_out_there_lol/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437943.9116974, "replies_charged": false}
