It's been 6 weeks straight that I've closed my Apple rings on my watch (something I've never done before) and as a bonus, I've lost 15 pounds so far! \n\nMy overarching goal is to try to be a better partner to my spouse and a better friend to myself. \n\nJust wanted to share my little milestone with somebody. I feel incredibly grateful - and I can't believe it's been close to a year!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mu1tq7/10_months_sober/", "title": "10 months sober!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "manwithperm", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1058, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618842561, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mu1tq7/10_months_sober/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436135.415341, "replies_charged": false}
