I took a lot of shots in a bar with people hoping to get laid and have fun but ended up getting wasted and possibly fucked up a few friendships. I have BPD (borderline personality disorder). Therefore, I am at risk of worsening it when I get drunk. Either I become manic or super depressed and impulsive. This time the ladder happened. I can't exactly remember what happened,  but I ended up saying \"fuck you, I am leaving.\" to someone I was sitting with and stormed all the way home. I have reflected and come to the conclusion that partying really isn't my thing and I definitely need to get my shit together. This is why people don't seek to hang out with me. I have tried to fit in for years. I am just going to stick to drinking with few people at home. Deep inside I think it is pointless for me and I don't enjoy it at all. I am going to stop chasing girls for the sake of chasing girls. I feels great to be wasted; it is where you learn your most valuable life lessons. This is mine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: What is going on???? Never expected to get so much support!
