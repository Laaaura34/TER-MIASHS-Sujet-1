All in all, I was so over him and somewhat \u201cscared\u201d of overhearing what he\u2019s up to through the office gossip grapevine. I tuned him out as much as I can and pretend he\u2019s invisible and I\u2019m not affected by him.\n\nNow that I left the job for almost one year, I was blessed with this new working environment and a new WFH routine. \n\nBut this week, out of nowhere, i got the Instagram notification that this guy requested to follow me...and the requested time was 2:49AM.\n\nSeeing that at 6AM, my mind was wide awake and flushes of bad memories and self-doubts came over me. Was he reaching out? Or was he planning something? Should I accept it just to tell him I\u2019m over it? But am I over it? No!
