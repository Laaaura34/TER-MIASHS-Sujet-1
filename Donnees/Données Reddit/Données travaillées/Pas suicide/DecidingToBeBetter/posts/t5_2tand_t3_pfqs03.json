A few years ago I was at my lowest adult weight and somewhat slim because I was heavily depressed, unemployed, sleeping a lot, and barely eating. \n\nNow I\u2019m in a much better state - full time employed in a fulfilling job, independent, happy in a relationship. I gained back a bunch of weight so I wasn\u2019t \u201cskinny\u201d anymore, but I figured I wasn\u2019t overweight and the weight gain was just a result of, you know, actually living my life, eating three meals a day due to my work schedule and energy needs, you know. \n\nBut of course COVID happened and we\u2019ve had a lot of lockdowns. The combination of not getting out much and stress/boredom eating has meant I\u2019ve gained a fair bit of weight over the past couple of years. I don\u2019t own scales, but I\u2019d say I\u2019m definitely overweight now. I\u2019ve had to start buying large/x-large size clothing and that made me feel very miserable, not to mention the fact that I\u2019m probably heavier than my slim boyfriend. \n\nI started running five weeks ago, which I actually enjoy (that was huge bc I always hated exercise!), and attempting to cut down my eating, which I absolutely hate lmao. \n\nI\u2019ve simultaneously been trying to eat less junk (cheese and chocolate are my big weaknesses), and reduce portion size. I try to still eat things I enjoy like pasta and rice, because a lot of normal low calorie meals just aren\u2019t enjoyable for me, or too fussy to make. I let myself have coffee and Coke Zero because at least they\u2019re low calorie treats. But it feels like maybe I\u2019m not cutting back enough, because i don\u2019t feel like I see any progress, even with the running. \n\nI keep seeing pictures of slender or muscular women on reddit and feeling depressed that I\u2019ll never look like that unless I apparently remove all joy from my food. \nI get hungry easily and I love food, so the idea of cutting back or only eating salads is really disheartening. \n\nIt feels like a no win situation and I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s the point. I feel like I\u2019ll be unhappy with my appearance no matter what - I have weird bone structure so I\u2019ll never have a thigh gap or big hips even if I lost a ton of weight. I\u2019ll never be pretty and waifish or fashionably curvy - I\u2019m afraid if I even succeed in building muscle, I\u2019ll just look like a rectangle. It\u2019s so depressing. \n\nI think I just want some advice or encouragement while I\u2019m having this low point. It just sucks worrying I\u2019m not doing enough or that what I am doing is pointless/not making a difference.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfqs03/feeling_torn_about_desire_to_look_better_and/", "title": "Feeling torn about desire to look better and desire to just enjoy life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "exobiologickitten", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630490698, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfqs03/feeling_torn_about_desire_to_look_better_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436712.1315558, "replies_charged": false}
