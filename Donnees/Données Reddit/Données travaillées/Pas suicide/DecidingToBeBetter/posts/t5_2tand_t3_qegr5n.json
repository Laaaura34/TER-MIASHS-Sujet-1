I need it to be perfect, and when I make a mistake I can(and have)go into a meltdown(that\u2019s a thing autistic ppl struggle with)\n\nGetting out of the meltdown is an entire different thing altogether, I have to actively try to keep myself from hitting the wall or I can hurt myself. I can\u2019t even calm down on my own, a family member, usually my sibling or my Mom has to intervene. Give me a hug and remind me to breath. Thankfully they don\u2019t last long, but getting out of it is *entirely* dependent on someone else with experience helping me out of it. I don\u2019t think any of my friends would know what to do\n\nHow do I stop being over critical on myself?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qegr5n/how_do_i_get_over_the_need_for_everything_to_be/", "title": "How do I get over the need for everything to be perfect?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LizzieLove1357", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 42, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635033882, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qegr5n/how_do_i_get_over_the_need_for_everything_to_be/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435766.8781352, "replies_charged": false}
