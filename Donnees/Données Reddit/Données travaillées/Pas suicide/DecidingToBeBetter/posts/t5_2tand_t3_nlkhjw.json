I\u2019m graduating high school soon, and I\u2019m grateful to say that I\u2019ve been able to accomplish that goal. But, I haven\u2019t done anything since. I don\u2019t really have anything pushing me now, since I already achieved my goal that I\u2019ve had for years. Again, I\u2019m extremely grateful for the opportunity, yet still feel a little emptiness inside, which makes me feel guilty because this is something I\u2019ve worked sooooo long for. I think part of the reason of this is because I\u2019ve always expected \u201cexcellence\u201d from myself, and rarely celebrate any achievements myself. Congratulations from others don\u2019t make me feel any better, they just make me feel bad because I feel like I\u2019m not doing enough to celebrate.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure where to go next at this point. I still don\u2019t really know what I want to study, although I tell people medicine when they ask. I find it interesting, but I just don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll be able to choose a career path when I have so many varying interests.\n\nNot really sure what the point of this post was. I have absolutely no reason to complain about anything and am very fortunate, just a little bit lost, even though it definitely doesn\u2019t seem like that from an outside perspective.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nlkhjw/feel_pretty_lost_after_achieving_a_lifelong_goal/", "title": "Feel pretty lost after achieving a life-long goal.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "2021CollegeAcc", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622044892, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nlkhjw/feel_pretty_lost_after_achieving_a_lifelong_goal/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436154.5855222, "replies_charged": false}
