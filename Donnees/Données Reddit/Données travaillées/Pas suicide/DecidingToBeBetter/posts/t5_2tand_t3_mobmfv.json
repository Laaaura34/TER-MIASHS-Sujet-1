We've all grown up playing video games, eating junk food, etc., but a good friend and I (we're both 23) have started distancing ourselves from the group because they don't want to \"grow up,\" nor do they provide positive energy.\n\nFor example, one friend (23Y) lives in their parents basement and complains about them regularly whenever they ask him to do something. Mind you, he doesn't pay rent or any bills aside from his car payments. They also don't try to seek education or pursue a career, which makes me feel as though I'm talking to someone that refuses to \"grow up.\"\n\nIdeally, I'd like to surround myself with people that aim for success, but it feels as though this group of friends will always be stuck in the past.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mobmfv/is_it_appropriate_to_separate_myself_23_from/", "title": "Is it appropriate to separate myself (23) from group of friends that refuse to grow up?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "daedric_dooley", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 138, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618083981, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mobmfv/is_it_appropriate_to_separate_myself_23_from/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437224.5059419, "replies_charged": false}
