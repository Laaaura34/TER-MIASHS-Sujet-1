As with any start, we are first pumped up and excited, then the actual hard parts come in such as discipline and moving out of your comfort/habitual zone.\n\nNot only you may relapse into your old \"bad\" ways, but since change takes effort while non-change doesn't, it's easier (at least at the moment) not to change. This is what I call Instantaneous Explicit Pleasure VS Longterm Implicit Pleasure.\n\nSadly, no one can change you except you yourself. If you desire to change but can't seem to push yourself, or are in the process of changing and feel like stopping, remember that \"change is hard, but pain is harder\". You will have to put in effort if you want to change and there will be shitty/hard times, but these painful/shitty segments of change are better than remaining in your current painful or unsatisfying situation, making you generally miserable and passive-aggressive.\n\nIf \"change is hard, but pain is harder\", then change is worth it despite the effort and hard work that has to be done to make a change.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fr5j9f/change_is_hard_but_pain_is_harder/", "title": "Change is hard, but pain is harder", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "GreyFox-RUH", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 617, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1585486811, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fr5j9f/change_is_hard_but_pain_is_harder/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437757.708812, "replies_charged": false}
