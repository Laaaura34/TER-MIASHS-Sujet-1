So I will just put it out in the simplest way that my brain can think of. \n\nI am in my mid 20s and have an emotional development of a dependent 10 years old. I constantly feel the need to talk to someone (mostly friends) because I am in some sort of physical or mental pain, or feeling alone or depressed or anxious or overwhelmed (just like now, I guess). And when I am done talking, I go back to feeling the same emotions which lead me to feel guilty for wasting someone else's time and energy. Sometimes I get angry at them for no reason. This results in an aura of toxicity and an unstable environment around me.  That's why I must do something about it. No matter how minute a step, I want to take it if it's in the right direction. \n\nI would be grateful for any suggestions (except a therapist, can't afford them). Books, articles, practical advices to apply in my day to day  dealings.
