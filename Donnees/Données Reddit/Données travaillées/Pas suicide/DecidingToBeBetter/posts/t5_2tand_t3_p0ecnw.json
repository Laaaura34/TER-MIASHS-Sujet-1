Low self-esteem is the enemy of making positive change, even if that seems contradictory. \n\nI'm on a massive health kick at the moment, in part (but not all) because I've started seeing someone who has made it abundantly clear that he fancies me because of some of the things I hate most about myself (big ass, for example) and that makes me feel good, which in turn gives me motivation to do good things for myself. It's not that I'm reliant on that person for motivation, it's just given me a different perspective on myself.\n\nMaking your partner feel bad about themself isn't going to motivate them to do anything.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p0ecnw/be_supportive_of_people_dont_shame_them_into/", "title": "Be supportive of people, don't shame them into being the way you want them to be, and allow yourself to feel supported.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Fig-Longjumping", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 126, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628428118, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p0ecnw/be_supportive_of_people_dont_shame_them_into/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437500.0671597, "replies_charged": false}
