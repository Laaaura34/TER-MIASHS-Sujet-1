There were challenges both in colleges and life, not a lot of money, and some dreams.\n\nFast forward some years, I am obese, unfocused, lazy, and with enough money to live comfortably. I don't get challenges, rarely use my brain because my job is easy.\n\nI want to do a lot of things, but I just can't. Its not that I don't try. I just can't keep it up. I read all these posts, how to get healthy, stay focused, read books, and all those things. But when I start doing it, I just can't. I try to exercise, do it for some days and leave. I try to read books, then leave after some days.\n\nI don't know whats wrong with me. I have totally lost myself. All I want is become healthy, focused and how I was before.
