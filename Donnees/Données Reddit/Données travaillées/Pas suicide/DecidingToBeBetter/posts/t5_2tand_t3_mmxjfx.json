Recently I have opened up to a few upper management members at work because they came to me with general concern for my well-being. They have told me that what I'm going through is unhealthy for me (the anger, the tears, how I feel about myself at the end of the day) and that I need to think about it and make a change even if that means walking away. I don't know why it took others telling me how unhealthy it is before I actually noticed. I was content (which probably isn't the right word) with coming to work every day and just trying to make it through the day regardless of how it was affecting me and my home life. I'm finally thinking about the choices I need to make for myself and which one would be the best outcome. So thankful that people who genuinely care exist in my life.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mmxjfx/finally_decided_to_work_on_getting_myself_out_of/", "title": "Finally decided to work on getting myself out of an unhealthy situation.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MrsKHall", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617904821, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mmxjfx/finally_decided_to_work_on_getting_myself_out_of/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438448.2985654, "replies_charged": false}
