It\u2019s not like I enjoy the work or the customers.\n\nI don\u2019t really enjoy the people I work with either, don\u2019t get me wrong, I think they are fine enough as humans but when it boils down to overall appreciation that isn\u2019t much to go on.\n\nThey\u2019re the greedy type. It\u2019s not that they really mean to be but fate forces a hand. Bartenders and servers do nothing at all really, a crime I\u2019m often guilty of but I shrug it off. I wish I could explain why there is that sense of superiority that we all hold over support staff but it really is just how it is.\n\nMy job is this weird nebulous cousin that I hate but at the same time can\u2019t help but love. It\u2019s\u2019 annoying as all get out but there is a certain charm in the personalities it brings. I guess as is true with everything else, people are retardedly unaware of the good in their life.\n\nI wonder why that is. Not just in the precarious situation I currently find myself in, being broke, homeless, etc. Maybe it\u2019s these changes that make me really admire the people who don\u2019t take everything for granted. People that know they have it good even when they don\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019ve never had less and for some intangible reason never had more. I think I\u2019ve changed. That was never really my plan to begin with, but I didn\u2019t really have a plan at all. I just sort of winged it and hoped for the best.  And I think I got it.\n\nThere have only ever been a few times in my life that my constant habit of lying for no reason and only telling half truths have benefited me. I think this might be the best one though. I took something away from my stupidity this time, I actually learned something. \n\nI know now that no matter what happens I\u2019m going to be okay. It\u2019s bearing a lot on my friends and their help but that\u2019s something I did too, without knowing it. I can do this. I can be happy. \n\nI don\u2019t have any money, no bed, no sense of direction. But I do have one thing.\n\nI have hope.\n\nAnd for a long time that has been elusive. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m looking at this wrong and I\u2019m actually in trouble but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case.\n\nI think for the first time maybe ever I feel free.\n\nI feel like I can do anything.\n\nI feel happy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/4zncdj/the_little_things/", "title": "The little things.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Alfidtot", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1472195089, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/4zncdj/the_little_things/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435844.375433, "replies_charged": false}
