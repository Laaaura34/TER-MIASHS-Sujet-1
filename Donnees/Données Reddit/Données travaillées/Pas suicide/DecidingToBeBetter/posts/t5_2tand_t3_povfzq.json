I feel disgusted by myself.   \nI told the random guy online that I'd stab him. Wtf is wrong with me?  \nThis is not usually me, I don't know where these words came from inside me. It's my fault that I lost control of my emotions and yelled horrible things to someone I do not know.  \nI'm the kind guy to apologise fast, like minutes after I do something like this I'll apologise. But I didn't get the opportunity because I left straight after without thinking about what I just said.  \nIt's not who I am so I am going to be better.  \nI love the game and play it a lot but I've decided to not touch it again for a good amount of time.  \nI don't want to be toxic, there's just a lot that's getting under my skin in reality and I refuse to take my frustrations out on anyone anymore.\n\nI'm putting my foot down. I'm not going to stand for this behaviour.  \nDoes anyone have any advice regarding staying cool when playing games?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/povfzq/just_wished_death_on_a_random_person_in_a/", "title": "Just wished death on a random person in a computer game.
