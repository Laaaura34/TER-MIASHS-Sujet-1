I've been having depression and anxiety ever since last year so I've been working on it and still am and even though I'm feeling better i still have these moments of low moods and it goes away eventually but still idk what it is. I try to make myself happy but it doesn't last like for example;\n\nThis mood comes out of nowhere and i think lemme watch Seinfeld that'll cheer me up. 15 min go by i still feel the same. I go okay lemme watch better call sual or the wire, still feel bother by this low mood and it drives me insane cuz i just constantly try my best to get rid of it. Eventually it goes away for sum reason when i don't think about it or something but it's just really annoying. I get this low mood every 3 days or sumthin like that. \n\nI don't know if it's part of depression playing with me or not but I'm tired of these low moods affecting my time. I do my best to ignore it and it goes away but still why does it keep coming back? Do i do the same thing everyday and my body is telling me something?\n\nAny advice on this please?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m4aawk/i_sometimes_get_this_feeling_of_inadequacy_or/", "title": "I sometimes get this feeling of \"inadequacy\" or feel like \"giving up\".
