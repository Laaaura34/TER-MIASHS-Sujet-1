I do my best to be friendly. Nothing is enjoyable anymore, I can't get interested in anything anymore. I feel do depressed and hopeless. I was at doctor recently and I've started taking antidepressants and I hope it will help me. I can't have fun anymore. I find it hard to do anything, I can't focus, I am scared I will fail college. People don't respect me. Everything is boring.
