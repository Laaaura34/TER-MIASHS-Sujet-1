The energy investment can be high, and often we don't see sh\\*t for our efforts for a long time. \n\nThe best results are down the line, but we're wired to focus on the immediate outcomes. This can cause us to quit before we start to make a real impact. Motivation isn't some magic well we can keep drawing from. We need to view our actions with a longer-term lens to keep going. \n\nClimbing a mountain is done one step at a time. The key isn't to focus on the pain of each step, but why you climb in the first place.\n\nYour efforts are producing results. They may be tiny, but they're happening. Keep your eye on the future you want to create. \n\nThe view at the top of the mountain will be worth every step.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m440z8/deciding_to_be_better_isnt_easy_but_its_sure_as/", "title": "Deciding to be better isn't easy.
