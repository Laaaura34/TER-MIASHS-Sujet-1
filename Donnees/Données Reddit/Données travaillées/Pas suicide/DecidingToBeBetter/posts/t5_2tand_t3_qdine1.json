At the end of September, I had a breakdown, for the first time in my life, I ended up in a psych ward.  I stayed a week and came out with a renewed desire to be happy and healthy.  I am making so much progress!  I have a new therapist.  I am working on getting into a day therapy group that is supposed to be very intense.  I\u2019m taking my meds everyday.  Since I am home alone too much, I\u2019m working on getting out more so I\u2019m signed up to do volunteer work at a senior center starting next week.  I still have a long way to go but, for the first time in a long time, I feel hopeful about the future", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdine1/i_feel_so_much_better/", "title": "I feel so much better!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Sloth_grl", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 218, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634914497, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdine1/i_feel_so_much_better/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437063.8316662, "replies_charged": false}
