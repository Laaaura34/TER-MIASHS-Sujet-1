Picked it up in college as a social habit and it turned into a full blown nicotine addiction. About 5 years ago I switched to the juul because it doesn\u2019t have a smell and I thought would be a better alternative to smoking cigarettes. \n\nBecause of the odorless and smokeless feature of the juul I found myself juuling all day everyday. If I was awake I was sucking on my juul. The first thing I\u2019d do in the morning is hit the juul and it was the last thing I did before I went to bed. \n\nAt this point I was going through two pods a day. That is 1 pack of $20 juul pods every two days. That\u2019s a lot of money. \n\nMy boyfriend and I decided to quit the juul for our health and our wallets. \n\nI find myself anxious and irritated but I know this will pass. \n\nIf we successfully quit for a month without cheating we\u2019re gonna go all out on a Cajun seafood dinner. I\u2019m talking snow crab, shrimp, crawfish, Mac and cheese, hush puppies the whole 9 yards. \n\nWish me luck guys!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mknqpu/today_is_the_first_day_of_quitting_juuling/", "title": "Today is the first day of quitting juuling.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "deathbyblackhole", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1229, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617637656, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mknqpu/today_is_the_first_day_of_quitting_juuling/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437457.5198267, "replies_charged": false}
