Emotions are like the clouds in the sky. It comes and goes. The rays passing through these clouds are your willingness to take a chance in life. \n\nYou are the sun. There are days where the sky is gloomy and the rays don't make it pass through the clouds. This is when you allow your emotions to take control of your day. Just remember you are not your emotions. You are not the clouds. You are the sun.\n\nWhen you walk out to a clear blue sky with the sun beaming down, how does that make you feel? Without putting your feeling into words, describe it within yourself. You must try to live your life like these clear sunny days. Keep your mindset healthy and be aware when you see the clouds. One mustn't simply ignore these clouds. They will come and pass through your life but remember these emotions you feel today are not what makes you the person you are.
