It's basically that I don't care about  other people, just about myself. This doesn't mean I'm a horrible  person with no friends though, I help them out and they help me out, I  spend time with them and they spend time with me.\n\nWhat  bothers me is my motivation behind it, let's say I do a friend a favor  (like helping him move, picking him up from somewhere, etc. you get what  I mean) I don't do it because he is my friend and I really really like  him, I do it because if I do it, he will like me more, do me favors and  spend more time with me. In the end it's mutually beneficial, but I just  think my motivation is wrong. This doesn't sound too bad, but recently  we had a conversation about death and I thought I would be sad if any of  my friends died, but not because \"he's a great guy, he really shouldn't  have to go that early, his family would be devastated\", my reasoning is  I wouldn't get to hang out with him anymore, I wouldn't be able to  spend time with him anymore and so on. Only reasons that are centered  around me. I also don't miss people,\n\nHow can I change this? How can I be more empathetic?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/f8qdxj/iwtl_how_to_be_less_egocentric_and_truly_care/", "title": "IWTL how to be less egocentric and truly care about others", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Conisseur", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1582546575, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/f8qdxj/iwtl_how_to_be_less_egocentric_and_truly_care/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436520.4555979, "replies_charged": false}
