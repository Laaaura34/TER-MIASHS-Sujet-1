Its my 25th bday an nobody really knows because i have bday notifications disabled and i dont have so good friends that would remember the day.\n\nI made  best of it for myself :) visited my gf who was taking care of some special kids. I took my dogs to play with the kids and continued my journey ! (gf didint remember it too, but shes so busy working today so its fine. I dont think she meant it or anything)\n\nWent to eat alone in a good restaurant, full course ! Went to park with other dogs to give my dogs some hours of good play ! Now getting some beer chilling rest of the night. Gonna setup my hammock ! Its okay :) I know its hard on birthdays but you can make the day for yourself.\n\nI wish my parents would have called me but they are on holiday so i just  think they forgot.
