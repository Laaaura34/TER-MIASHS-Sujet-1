I hate the place I\u2019m in because I can\u2019t make a single good friend. Most of the people in my school are living in their own world with their own friends and stuff. I don\u2019t get why my driving school friends are gone. Why can\u2019t I make good friends, heck even any friend at all? Every single day I suffer in my high school. A girl bullied me because I jerked off once and asked if I was going to do it again. My \u201cfriends\u201d stopped her from making more insults about me but still. I just said \u201cok\u201d and kept my head down. I think it was because I felt bad about her backstory in a documented story my friend was making and she said that she felt worse about me jerking off. Why do people do this to me man? Furthermore, why am I like this? Why can\u2019t I just be normal for once? I\u2019m so sick of doing late work and not relaxing and sleeping. I hated it when I didn\u2019t get a 36 on the ACT. I don\u2019t get why I don\u2019t work on art and game development. I bent my iPad Pro recently and I hate my life. I don\u2019t get why I can\u2019t make any friends at school. I don\u2019t get why I can\u2019t feel loved by a girl or even loved by my friends. I\u2019m so sick and tired of not sleeping until 4AM and having late work to do. I can\u2019t take this anymore. I seriously can\u2019t.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1wyei/how_can_i_stop_these_thoughts/", "title": "How can I stop these thoughts?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Drblackcobra", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633442405, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1wyei/how_can_i_stop_these_thoughts/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438039.5999184, "replies_charged": false}
