Always overanalyzing every situation, taking things personally and being angry all the time. Ever since I started meditating and getting more in tune with myself, focusing on my emotions and learning to react differently, I've been a lot happier. Now looking back, it was so exhausting and soul sucking to allow anger to flourish, not to mention the toll it took on my health. So glad I'm finally working and focusing on me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/im568n/i_used_to_be_angry_all_the_time_now_i_focus_on_me/", "title": "I used to be angry all the time, now I focus on me.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MrsKHall", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 227, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1599177260, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/im568n/i_used_to_be_angry_all_the_time_now_i_focus_on_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436544.8829815, "replies_charged": false}
