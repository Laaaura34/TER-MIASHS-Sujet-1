Understanding what it takes to become who you want to be is just as important as carrying out those tasks that will guide you there. Nobody wants to be left behind in life, and becoming complacent with your current circumstances or who you are is setting you on a path that will limit your potential as an amazing person and entrepreneur. If you want to achieve more in life and evolve faster, these 5 steps will help you achieve massive success throughout the future.\n\nYou can become the person you want to be!\n \n1- Focus on contribution\nLiving a meaningful and fulfilling life is all about how much value you can deliver and bring into the lives of others. How much help are you to those in need, or even those who may not even need your help? Are you willing to help someone who could never repay you? By focusing on contribution, you are channeling every thought directly into how you can be of the most help to the people around you. In any given situation, you should be asking yourself 'what more can I do for this person?'.\n\nBanishing every sense of entitlement or the underlying feeling that someone owes you something is your first step. Decide to unconditionally help and serve others, going out of your way to make sure they are reaching their best. This may be so hard at first, but understanding that to live a fulfilling life is to help the world and the people in it is a truly eye opening experience. You start to experience the joy in every moment of life, every bit of gratitude that is given back to you and you feel a sense of real accomplishment from what you are doing.\n\nTrue entrepreneurs are working towards making the world a better place, by improving as many lives as possible as they can. They look for new and exciting opportunities to deliver more value into the world and strategize the most effective way to deliver the help that's needed. Everybody at some point in life is going to need help, whether it be financially, emotionally, physically. Be the type of person to focus on contribution over entitlement and prosper in the joy and accomplishment that will come with every second of helping others.\n\n \n\n2- Focus on outcome\nEffective entrepreneurs are always focusing on the outcome of their work. They're looking ten moves ahead and directly changing their actions according to the outcomes they want in life. This goes hand in hand with their focus on contribution, as many entrepreneurs are relentlessly looking for what impact their work will have on the world and in the lives of others.\n\nThe mentality for everything you are putting your time into should be, 'what outcome will this bring me in the future?'. Seek out what works the best and what doesn't and start scrapping the habits that aren't directly leading you to become the person you want to be. You need to have end goals in mind for every stage throughout your life. Don't be worried about changing these either. Life is about adapting to your circumstances and what you want in life one day may not always be the same the next day.\n\nJust stay focused on the outcome of every situation you put yourself into and link that to making your contribution to the world meaningful. Start cutting out the ineffective uses of your time and energy, achieve your goals and always look to achieve more that what one task will get you.\n \n\n \n3- Work at what's needed\nAt some point in your life I'm sure you've come across a situation where someone you know was focused on what had been requested of them and not what was actually needed. We face this situation everyday with ourselves. Is what we are doing in life really what's needed to become who we are or just what we've requested ourselves to do? Don't make the decision of only focusing your efforts on what's requested of you, or else you may never stand out.\n\nIndividuals who focus on what's really needed in a business or in life stand out from everyone else because they are achieving the results everybody desires, but nobody thinks is their job to achieve. So many people are focused on their entitlement and look to do the least amount of work possible. Effective entrepreneurs take this mentality and flip it. They look to do the most amount of work possible for the least amount of effort.\n\nThis doesn't mean they're lazy or are unproductive. It just means their time is important, and making sure every second of work counts towards the outcome. The people who are already solving the problems and taking the initiative to find those problems without being asked are the ones who achieve more and succeed faster. Become dedicated to solving more problems than you are asked to, focus on your contribution and the desired outcome of the situation.\n\n4- Think bigger than big\nEvery possibility in life can be taken one step further with the right imagination and creativity. Influential entrepreneurs are thinking bigger than their peers. They're seeing the limitless opportunities in every situation around them. They don't see the limitations of an idea that everybody else sees.\n\nBecome someone who is always searching for more in everything. Whether it's searching for better opportunities to take in your life, searching for the more qualities in someone that makes them amazing, searching for bigger and better things to achieve. Never limit your beliefs of what is possible because at some point, there will come a person who won't see the limits you're placing on everything.\n\nThe best way to think bigger is to immerse yourself in more creative outlets. Let you mind wander, take classes that test your creativity such as painting or sculpting. Read more fictional books. The only limits are the ones we place on ourselves and this goes for our ideas too. The only limits to the grandness of our ideas are the ones we place on them. Become a big thinker, and take every idea you have one step further. Make it one level better. Make yourself one bit better.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5- See your circumstances as temporary\nThe final key to unlocking a more fulfilling life that so many entrepreneurs are able to achieve is being able to see all your current circumstances as temporary. Realize that with the following four mindset changes, you will be able to change your circumstances. Where you are at this point is only the beginning of a journey of greatness. Realize that anything, with the right work ethic and right mentality can change. You can become better.\n\nEffective entrepreneurs are able to take themselves out of the mindset of living for what they have now. They want change and know that their current state won't be the last. Whether it's a brand new company you're launching, a new friendship, new ideas you're having, new experiences, new moments of living, none of these are set in stone. Everything in this life is temporary and realizing that to grow is to change your circumstances is powerful.\n\nNever define yourself as who you are today and always work towards becoming a better person. Don't let anything be forced upon you or think that nothing is possible to change. The final step to becoming an influential and effective entrepreneur is to realize you define every set of circumstances you want in life. Everything in your life is possible to change if you want it to change. Everything you desire or dream about can be yours, and it's up to you to make that happen and to work out how to make it happen.\n\nEntrepreneurs choose to do whatever it takes to create the lives that they want.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/4l49oi/developing_an_entrepreneurial_mindset_for_life/", "title": "Developing An Entrepreneurial Mindset For Life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "alphaambitions", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1464249044, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/4l49oi/developing_an_entrepreneurial_mindset_for_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437894.0670092, "replies_charged": false}
