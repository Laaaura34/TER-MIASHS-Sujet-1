I live in a pretty well off upper middle class family and I was never forced to get a job as a teen and I never needed to work so I didn\u2019t. I just focused on school. I\u2019ve actually had one part time job in my life and it was so minimal I hardly count it as experience. I have a worthless degree in anthropology and student loans that are frozen right now but my parents were helping me pay for. Been graduated for two years and still no career or jobs in sight. The pandemic obviously has made this more difficult than it already was. My parents are high risk. So I haven\u2019t gone anywhere in 5 months. I have no money to my name. \n\nIf you asked me what I want out of life I would say to have my own independent life. To have my own place so I can maybe someday pursue relationships again. That\u2019s the only way I\u2019ll be able to have a relationship again physically, moving out and being away from my high risk parents. Hate to say it but a lot of it is about sex if I\u2019m honest. But also just not wanting to rely on my parents anymore and getting away. \n\nThe problem is that this seems literally impossible. I can\u2019t live here and have a normal job. I would have to isolate myself for two weeks after every time I go out and work. Obviously this isn\u2019t feasible. So my only option is to find a remote job or have a remote career that would allow me to one day save up enough money to move out. In an insanely expensive southern cal city. It feels like even if I did this that it would take years to get this much money! And that I\u2019ll just end up being a virgin into my mid thirties or forties. \n\nI wasted so much time before the pandemic era. I should have planned my life out but I didn\u2019t. I was just taking the easy route and relying on my parents money. And here I am now facing the consequences. Basically I\u2019ll be middle aged before I have a normal adult life, if I ever do. This is so soul crushingly depressing to me. I feel like a complete failure. Embarrassed and pathetic. Self hatred. It\u2019s so depressing that I just try to forget about this reality. Somehow I\u2019ve not smoked weed in five months but I\u2019ll probably start again soon. I drown everything out with tv shows, video games, working out, sports, food, and music, the only stuff keeping me alive at this point.  But there\u2019s times when I\u2019m doing those things and I wonder \u201cis there more?\u201d\u201dis this all I\u2019m going to do until I fucking die?\u201d. I know I\u2019m privileged that I\u2019m not starving and that I\u2019m safe from the pandemic and not homeless but I still want my own life someday. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s just hopeless.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/isd355/looking_for_someone_to_try_and_give_me_hope_if/", "title": "Looking for someone to try and give me hope, if you dare.
