You\u2019re constantly moving, you\u2019re mind, your thoughts, your actions are going a million miles a minute probably replaying things you wish you did or should have done in the past. You see surviving should only be \u201cin the moment\u201d kind of reaction but in todays world most people are just trying to survive everyday. And it\u2019s painful, that\u2019s why we ease the pains with pills, booze, simple pleasures that will allow us to get more comfortable in surviving so we can rest. So stop resting, I mean a complete jumpstart back into what life felt like before the influence of drugs and temptation. Typically your Brain will balance itself out but that takes years and years, and we don\u2019t have that kind of time. So there\u2019s things we can do to speed it up. First of all, fight your battles and slay your demons. Do whatever you gotta do to kill that part of you that won\u2019t let go and I mean bury it and never think about it again. Whatever happened is the past, forget about it because it\u2019s forgot about you. Now stop trying to tackle everything at once, you\u2019re here for the marathon, not the sprint. Everyday do something that\u2019ll make you uncomfortable, something that makes your heart rate go up and down naturally. Take cold showers, be vulnerable to someone, take up an extreme sport or anything you deem edgy and gives you a spark of life you needed naturally. Pick up old hobbies, or reconnect with old friends, you\u2019ll need support through this. Not everyday you\u2019ll feel great or happy so force it if you have to, even on days where you feel like there\u2019s no point in getting out of bed, get out of bed and go.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfy5sc/let_me_help_you/", "title": "Let me help you", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "UncleVoid", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635220883, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfy5sc/let_me_help_you/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435227.2921965, "replies_charged": false}
