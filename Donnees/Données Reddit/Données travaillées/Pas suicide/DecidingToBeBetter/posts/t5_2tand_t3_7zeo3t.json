There's nothing glaringly wrong with me, per se, but I don't put in any extra effort.  My weight is fine, but I don't eat nutritious, life-giving foods.  I exercise sometimes, but I have no real routine or goals.  I go to work every day with no makeup and hair pulled back.  \n\nFor the longest time, I wondered, \"why bother?  Things are good enough as-is.\"  But, as I'm becoming more of an adult, I'm feeling like it's not enough.  Like I have this untapped potential I'm not using.  So, for the next month, I've challenged myself to act like I care, even though I don't right now.
