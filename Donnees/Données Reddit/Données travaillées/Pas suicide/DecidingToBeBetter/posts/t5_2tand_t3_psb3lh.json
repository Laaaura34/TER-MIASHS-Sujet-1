A few months ago I wanted to make a singing video but decided not to because I believe my voice is horrible. After months of being scared to sing in front of someone I finally decided to sing in front of my brother and he said I sounded great and should keep going my mom and a few other people have said the same things but I still don\u2019t believe it. I do vocal/ breathing exercises everyday and hope to finally sing in front of more people.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/psb3lh/why_cant_i_believe_it/", "title": "Why can\u2019t I believe it?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "True_Marionberry7630", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1632197180, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/psb3lh/why_cant_i_believe_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437298.517268, "replies_charged": false}
