Early morning, midday or afternoon UNLESS I\u2019m sick of being there from feeling sore or having to pee. I\u2019m wondering if anyone else has experienced and/or successfully addressed this issue? \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nHi guys, I\u2019m writing here cos I feel like my drive to solve this problem is seriously weaning. I know for a fact it has been holding me back from reaching my full potential in life. my efforts have also taken a hit from the combo of COVID quarantine and the lack of daylight in my area.\n\nHave any of you deal with this? Have you found any successful strategies? I wasn\u2019t expecting this post to be so long\u2014 thanks if you do read it. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nMy issue for years has been that I can\u2019t freaking pry myself from bed when needed. Initially, thought this was because of early mornings, but I have had the same issue if I have to be somewhere at 8am, 12pm or 3pm. I do have early shifts and find I actually enjoy mornings bc they\u2019re quiet and I feel like I\u2019ve accomplished so much by midday. They\u2019ve somewhat lost their allure in the dark winter and quarantine.  \n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to articulate\u2014 I feel like my brain is in a whole other realm when I wake. It\u2019s a tug of war between the want to be better and the comfort of avoidance. It seems like the most simple thing to me when I am feeling lucid, but far from it when time comes to actually doing it. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve ever had so much trouble with anything else in my life.\n\n**Why I do it (I think):**\n\n* I didn\u2019t grow up with any particular sleep routine to be honest. Only was forced out of bed for school, church or anything else my parents deemed important. I would stay up as late as I wanted if I said it was for school. Otherwise, I would stay in bed as long as possible. As I got older, my parents had less control over me and I stayed in bed more. \n* I wasn\u2019t exactly raised to self motivate or think for myself. I grew up with a pretty overbearing parent who often used comparison and disappointing others as reasons for action. Now that i have much more control over my life, I\u2019m frustrated that I\u2019m not finding success fixing any shortcomings from my upbringing.\n* I did not grow up with proper time management. It\u2019s rampant though my household and my personal responsibilities. finding sneaky ways to lie to myself to enable procrastination is also a thing for me. \n* I am depressed or recovering from depression not really sure what to call it but whatever. Sleeping/ chilling in bed longer (like a whole day or days at a time) is typical of my episodes. I have suspected I had adhd in the past year, but my doc didn\u2019t seem too into the idea of that rabbit hole. She dismissed it so I gathered I might\u2019ve just used the internet for confirmation bias? I dunno if it is worth pursuing. \n* One of my vices is escapism via sleep. I\u2019m 27 now, I think I realized I was doing this around 24-25. When I\u2019m not particularly in a depressive state, I find it hard to even break the habit I maintained while depressed. \n* I could be avoiding parts of life I don\u2019t want but I\u2019ve even had this be an issue for things I\u2019m excited to do. \n* i always feel tired and/ or low energy. I\u2019m assuming this is because of a lack of quality sleep. \n\n**Resources I have tried:** \n\n* Advice from my therapist: make a schedule/ plan (waking me just shuffles tasks later in the day or or gored tasks and gives up when it\u2019s too late), meditation before bed and waking up\n* Advice from my doctor: practicing sleep hygiene, avoiding caffeine \n* Advice from internet: take melatonin; use motivation from nice toiletries, food, etc to excite you to get out of bed\n* spoke to friends, nobody can really relate. they do encourage me when I talk about it, but I pretty much have the same disappointing news when they ask. \n\n**Things that have helped in the past, but not consistently and/or don\u2019t help anymore:**\n\n* Cutting down (or out) alcohol and pot. I find the former makes me anxious for a few days, the latter makes me sleep more/ more lazy. I avoid avoid it for the most part (specifically because of this) but admittedly have used either/ both after downplaying their impacts. I don\u2019t recognize it\u2019s happening until it\u2019s happening or after I emerge from the post substance fog. \n* Mediation\u2014 helps with being aware of thoughts \n* Knowing (external) repercussions \u2014 letting people down, losing job, it\u2019s officially last minute, note: its effect on me (ex: my health, my self esteem, $ wasted on last minute ubers to make up for lost time) don\u2019t seem to be enough of a repercussion for me. \n* Light alarm/ timed light/ loud alarm/ fading or soft sounding alarm\u2014 I snooze and go back tiger until absolute last min. Or just sleep with the light on (I can sleep in almost any setting tbh). \n* Exercise in the evenings\u2014 it seems to be the only time I\u2019ll actually do it so I went with it. Having a place to be a tu I\u2019ve in the gym helped with my motivation, but COVID. I\u2019m back to square one on that front now. \n* I sleep while listening to things. I live in a hectic household, so I\u2019ll put on a documentary or podcast or something to focus on. This sometimes leads to me browsing on my phone/ being distracted. \n* Sleeping masks definitely helped with sleep hygiene, but the getting out of bed problem persisted \n* Changing my environment: I\u2019m actually house sitting at the moment and am even more frustrated bc I\u2019m having the same issue even outside my household. It has worked in past when I don\u2019t want to expose my sleep Habits to someone else. \n* putting a clock/ alarm far away\u2014 I get up and turn it off or snooze and go back to bed\n* having someone call me\u2014 I answer and sound alive so they\u2019re impressed and then I go back to sleep\n* Drinking water first thing in the morning \n* Using a bring/ seasonal effective disorder lamp (yes, I\u2019ve even fallen asleep with one of them in my face wtf)\n\nDoes this seem like a discipline or motivation thing? Maybe I\u2019m suck in a victim/ non proactive/ lazy mentality? A brain thing? I\u2019m honestly at a loss. I\u2019ve found my morning self going SO far to undermine all the effort my lucid self puts in to set up an easier time leaving my bed. \n\nI sometimes think I am over complicating a simple part of everyday life and it\u2019s just a matter of \u201cdoing it\u201d. The problem is, why haven\u2019t I then??? And why have I been consciously struggling with it for so long? \n\n**\\*\\*where I think I could tangibly improve but maybe need a kick in the ass to do so?\\*\\***\n\nI have noticed in quarantine is that I\u2019ll wake up hours before I\u2019m supposed to be/ or wanted to be awake (3-4 am, planned for 7 or 6-7am, but planned for 9) and I feel somewhat in my right mind. i\u2019ll go back to sleep to get the extra sleep or without even looking at the time because it\u2019s still dark out. From there, I\u2019ll start another sleep cycle until 1, 2, 3 pm. Then I\u2019ll wake up late, feel stupid and then just stay in bed defeated. Or will maybe get out but feel bad the rest of the day. \n\nIf I do wake up shortly before when I\u2019m supposed to be up, I\u2019ll chill in bed or get distracted somehow (admittedly with my phone) and then fall asleep again. I thought about j just starting my day at whatever time I wake up. But again, enforcing something just \u201cfor me\u201d hasn\u2019t been successful for me much. I often go back to sleep telling myself I don\u2019t NEED to be up for any responsibilities and abandon any want for a functional schedule.\n\nI\u2019m desperate for anything at this point. If you read any of the above, THANKS. Pls let me know if you can relate and/or can help me out. \n\nMuch thanks", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkreke/frustration_re_sleep_habits_establishing_routines/", "title": "frustration re: sleep habits, establishing routines, action motivation", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throawybitvh", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613435500, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkreke/frustration_re_sleep_habits_establishing_routines/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438250.4336991, "replies_charged": false}
