Now that I have worked on  improving myself, my angry responses have mellowed out. But the question is... what is the appropriate response? My first instinct is to apologise, but my mom's response to that is \"don't apologise, I know you're gonna do it again\" which, fair point. I haven't yet got rid of all my bad habits so they are likely to repeat, I can't yet guarantee or promise they won't. I need to work on myself more first before making empty promises. \n\nBut then, after I refrain from apologising, my response to everything is \"okay\", \"alright\" which makes me seem like I don't care at all. I don't know how to respond so I just stand there while people call me out/tell me off and only respond with an occasional emotionless \"okay\". What else can I do in these moments?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mhc0wg/what_is_the_appropriate_response_to_someone_being/", "title": "What is the appropriate response to someone being angry at me/telling me off?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ZealousOil", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 9, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617214204, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mhc0wg/what_is_the_appropriate_response_to_someone_being/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435792.2868927, "replies_charged": false}
