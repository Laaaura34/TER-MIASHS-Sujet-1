I\u2019m a pretty open person, I typically share a lot of my experiences and thoughts because writing really is such an important part of my life and I am passionate about helping people, so merging the two always came naturally for me. \n\nThere came a point that I realized I was using this once cathartic tool (writing) as a crutch to define my worth through how well it was received. How many upvotes, how many likes, how much engagement, yadda yadda yadda. \n\nEventually it became so draining I knew I had to pull back and go within. This is a practice I come back to pretty frequently once I realize I\u2019m being drained by something that once really energized me. \n\nNothing is inherently good or inherently bad but we can use things as a way to move us forward or to feed our ego. I am still figuring out the balance. Even writing this I wonder if it\u2019s for you or for me? But usually when I come back after a long break, I\u2019m clear in my intentions. The inner work I did really helped clarify why I do what I do, how to notice when the intentions have an ulterior motive, and how to not take action when that\u2019s the case. I think I\u2019ll be doing this work for the rest of my life, but right now I feel grounded which is a big change of pace compared to the last few months. \n\nWhen you constantly deduct your worth based on someone else\u2019s definition, your life becomes void of its magic. I\u2019ve spent most of my life believing that if I didn\u2019t achieve what someone wanted me to, I was a failure, if my parents were disappointed in me, I wasn\u2019t worthy, if my boss didn\u2019t like the job I did, I sucked, if my friend was mad because I didn\u2019t give them the attention they needed, I was a horrible person, if my significant other didn\u2019t act like I was the best person in the world or got upset with me, I was absolutely undeserving of love, if someone wrote a negative comment or said I\u2019m wrong, then I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about and who the f am I to put anything out there: the list can keep going. \n\nThe common theme of these are based on someone else. If they xxx, I\u2019m not yyy. What if I finally change the narrative? What if there is no condition of my worthiness or if I\u2019m deserving of love? What if I just am, because I\u2019m here. What if you just are, because you are here? \n\nIt\u2019s time to stop thinking our worth is based on what we do, how well we do it, and how much we accomplish. We are not machines. We\u2019re humans having a human experience. Some people are good at things and others are good at something else. Sometimes accomplishing tasks takes skills that someone else accumulated over the years, and comparing yourself as a beginner to them does absolutely nothing but discourage us from taking action. Sometimes people are miserable in their own life that they use you as a way to get their own misery out. \n\nGrowing up, we could only relate outside circumstances to ourselves. My dad died, therefore everyone will leave me because I\u2019m not good enough. My mom is mad and it\u2019s because of me. We all do this, we\u2019re wired for it. And then when we grow up, that wiring is still there and we get impacted by all the things around us and think it\u2019s personal. It\u2019s not. \n\nNothing is personal unless you make it that way. If someone hates you, and you think you did something to deserve that hate, it\u2019s time to forgive yourself for not knowing better at the time you took that action and then strive to do better today. Beating yourself up does nothing but keep you acting in shame and perpetuates toxic behavior. \n\nIt\u2019s time to understand our worthiness exists independent of someone else. You cannot be defined. You\u2019re worthy. You\u2019re lovable. You\u2019re deserving. Period. And when you take action from that place, instead of one thinking you need to prove something to yourself or someone else, the whole world opens up. \n\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nIt\u2019s time to understand our worthiness exists independent of someone else.
