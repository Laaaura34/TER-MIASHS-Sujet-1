I am triggered by my backtalking and eye rolling kid, my ridiculously scattered boss, my outspoken husband and more.  I would love to have some advice from those who have found ways to be less sensitive.  \n\nSome background: I was bullied pretty mercilessly as a kid, always tried and try to be a peacemaker, have an instinctual verbal response rooted in being hellbent on harmony.  \n\nI've had major professional success, but this has held me back from effectively working with folks who have abrupt/dismissive/or challenging communication styles.  \n\nWhen my 11 year old is frustrated and rude, my reactions are hurt and bigger than is warranted to solve the problem.  \n\nI often think my husband is mad at me when he isn't.  \n\nI hear anger and frustration when they are not there or when they are present, but really not directed at me.  \n\nI want to decide to be better at this.  Anyone been here?  Tips?  Resources?  \n\nMany thanks!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3axcjt/triggered_bigtime_by_perceived_rudeness_and/", "title": "Triggered bigtime by perceived rudeness and disrespect", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "parentfolk", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 0, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1435128567, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3axcjt/triggered_bigtime_by_perceived_rudeness_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437150.103828, "replies_charged": false}
