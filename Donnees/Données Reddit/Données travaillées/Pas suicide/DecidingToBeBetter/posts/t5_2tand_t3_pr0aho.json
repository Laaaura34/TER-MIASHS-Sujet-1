I used to host a book club, but after covid, doing things through zoom wasn't the same. I've never been to a bar before and I guess I'll just see if I can 'make friends.' I'll update later tonight with how things went :)\n\nUpdate: It was 1000% worth it!! The bar was pretty full but I found a spot next to a blonde girl. After ordering a drink, I noticed she was beginning to go (and no one else was getting up with her). So I asked, \"Hey, are you here alone?\" And she said she was and that she was about to go to work across the street. We chatted for the next 10 mins. I learned where she was from, that she's only a year older than me, and like me, she didn't have any close friends here. She offered me her number and said she was open to meeting up again for drinks or to hang out. OMG. This was a Best Case scenario. I couldn't have gotten luckier. Had I sat anywhere else and I might have missed out on meeting her.
