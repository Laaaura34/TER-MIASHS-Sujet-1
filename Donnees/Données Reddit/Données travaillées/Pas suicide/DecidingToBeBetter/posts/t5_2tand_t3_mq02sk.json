I stay inside and decide that I don\u2019t want to grow up and tackle the outside world because it\u2019s scary and a fucked up place. \n\nHowever, this fucked up place has a lot of fucked up people. people who are hurting and people who hurt others, people who have lost those closest to them and struggle everyday, people who live on the streets because they have no where else to go, people killing themselves because they feel they have no one left. \n\nI can\u2019t replace what someone lost, I can\u2019t help those who decide they don\u2019t want help, I can\u2019t relate to those who struggle because I don\u2019t struggle myself, I can\u2019t be there for everyone, I can\u2019t help everyone.\n\nBut I\u2019m going to try\n\nI want to be a light to everyone I meet, I want to make a random persons day by complimenting them. I want to make someone smile. I want to make someone laugh so hard that they pee themselves. I want to be someone that people feel they can be comfortable around. I want the people who remember me to also remember the feeling they got when we interacted. I want those who know me and are hurting to know they can talk to me, and that I\u2019ll listen to them. \n\nI can\u2019t be a light that replaces or get rid of the darkness, but I want to shine so brightly that the darkness itself becomes brighter. \n\nI don\u2019t exactly know where to start, or how to do it, I have bad social skills and I\u2019m shy, but I don\u2019t want to lose my motivation and my reasoning, so I\u2019m not sure if this is the right subreddit but I plan on posting something every week. Something that shows my efforts towards my goal. I\u2019ll be going on a trip tomorrow and I think I\u2019ll start there, I don\u2019t talk to my family much, but I need to be better to them.\n\nWish me luck!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mq02sk/i_need_to_change_i_want_to_be_a_light_to_everyone/", "title": "I need to change, I want to be a light to everyone I meet", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Diggydog323", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2010, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618312334, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mq02sk/i_need_to_change_i_want_to_be_a_light_to_everyone/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436199.775187, "replies_charged": false}
