I would know this cause I've been in that pit of depression and I thought that I wouldn't be able to get out of it. I managed to find my happiness and I can say that it was totally worth the time and effort trying to get it. \n\nEveryone deserves happiness, but there will be times when it's not easy to attain. Different people lead different lives, some having it harder than others. But no matter who you are, where you're from, or what your situation is, it doesn't change the fact that you deserve to be happy.\n\nEven if you think that happiness is impossible for you to acquire, always remember that that isn't true. Never give up. Believe in yourself. And if there are people who are there to support you, do yourself a favor and let them; you can always return the favor by helping them out when they need it.\n\nI made something that might help those of you who are having trouble finding happiness. Hopefully it'll help (You don't have to click on it if you don't want to, I just hope this all helps).\n\n[https://youtu.be/UdXRGZTl3GI](https://youtu.be/UdXRGZTl3GI)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i77t64/for_those_who_are_having_a_tough_time_finding/", "title": "For those who are having a tough time finding happiness, don't give up.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "eXiLe117x", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1597076044, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i77t64/for_those_who_are_having_a_tough_time_finding/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436528.0113912, "replies_charged": false}
