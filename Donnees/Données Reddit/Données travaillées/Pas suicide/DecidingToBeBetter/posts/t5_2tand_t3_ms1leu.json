Does it get better? \n\nBest Regards\nStefan", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ms1leu/rarely_fell_comited_to_my_goals/", "title": "rarely fell comited to my goals", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Bl4ckG4ze", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618574202, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ms1leu/rarely_fell_comited_to_my_goals/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437982.6976655, "replies_charged": false}
