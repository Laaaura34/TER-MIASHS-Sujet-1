I have improved my habits of eating and exercising in the recent years and I\u2019m proud of it  but I\u2019ve been putting off the studying part.\nI\u2019ve got it all , I\u2019m a spoiled kid , I got easy into med school cause my parents being doctors payed for it all and lately I\u2019ve been searching why I wanna be a doctor. \n\nI crave certainty but having  wasted so much time looking for it ,it feels like there is no certainty more than I already have (which is plenty, I have a roof over my head food I\u2019m the table and a loving family and I lack the fucking gratitude to see jt )\n\nI\u2019m more entertained by today\u2019s youtubers and self help writers ive been consuming so much that I wanna be them but I don\u2019t have a foundation and I\u2019m not looking at what I\u2019ve got , the opportunity that a lot of students don\u2019t get. \n\nI\u2019ve been telling myself lately that maybe I don\u2019t value studying so much and so it\u2019s not the right career for me but as our values dictate out behaviours, when I look at how I pass my days,turns out I don\u2019t value shit. \n\nAll I do is take care of my sleep , eating , health and then surf the Internet to find one thing that suits me to be the turning point where I leave it all (medicine ) and turn out to be some Steve jobs or shit. \n\n\nEnough of this ,I can\u2019t live like this. I think I\u2019ll have to commit myself to it before I see the path clearing up for me.\n\nIt feels scary but it\u2019s better than being lazy. \n\nI am done looking at the hardworking kids around me and wondering how they sacrifice so much leisure , \"they must be special \".\n\nI am going all in.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pz4i28/i_am_done_being_a_thinker_and_from_now_im_a_doer/", "title": "I am done being a thinker and from now I\u2019m a doer.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Itshardtofindanametf", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 108, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633080918, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pz4i28/i_am_done_being_a_thinker_and_from_now_im_a_doer/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436255.4623656, "replies_charged": false}
