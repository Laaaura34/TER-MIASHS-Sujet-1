I\u2019m a very happy person, my \u201cdefault mode\u201d is happy and it takes a lot for me to feel a different way. That being said, since I am always happy a) I can\u2019t express why I am happy, I just feel it. This makes it hard for my boyfriend who depends a lot on verbal praise and recognition to feel loved in the relationship, and b) I never learned to deal with little things that I don\u2019t like because they don\u2019t make me unhappy until they pile up into something so much bigger that I just end up exploding. \nSo I am looking for a self-help book that can teach me how to recognize my emotions and how to express them constructively. Does anyone have any suggestions for me? I tried googling it but all the books that I could find were about emotional intelligence which I think is largely different than what I am looking for.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkxa36/books_on_how_to_improve_emotional_communication/", "title": "Books on how to improve emotional communication skills?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "98kathryn", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613454922, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkxa36/books_on_how_to_improve_emotional_communication/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438219.5109313, "replies_charged": false}
