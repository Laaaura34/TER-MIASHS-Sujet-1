Then I had my kids and as the years went on my mental health kept getting worse and worse. I've fought through depression and am diagnosed with Generalized anxiety disorder, Panic disorder, Agoraphobia, and OCD. Starting therapy a few years ago was the best decision ever because not only have I learned a truck load of coping skills, but I've also gained a little confidence. I'm still struggling, but today? Today I am proud of myself. I took the language arts test for the GED and I ROCKED it! I passed, and I'm so happy I want to cry. I thought I waited too long, that I'd fail because of it. I haven't been to school in years! I thought that my mental health destroyed any chances I had to do this. I'm scheduling to take the Social Studies test next! \n\nListen, it's NEVER too late. Never. Get out there and get what you want done, it doesn't matter if you're 31 or 61 or however old you are.
