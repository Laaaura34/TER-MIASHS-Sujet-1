A complete 180\u00b0 flip.\n\nMy mental health began to spiral out of control this year until the point it consumed me. Luckily I was able to recognize my signs and symptoms and had my boyfriend call 911 last night.\n\nThe ambulance arrived at approx. 12am and I was home, asleep in my bed with my family, by 130am. It was a perfect visit to the hospital and I left with everything I needed from them!!\n\nEvery single member of the hospital that I had contact with was the BEST of the BEST at my local hospital! I am beaming with confidence and excitement to live my life the way I want and need to. \n\nHaving a mental disability/disorder can slow down your plans - all the way until it will convince you that suicide is the only option. I NEVER want to lose my mental health battle and I hope to continue to inspire those around me to conquer any and all barriers in order to find THEIR BEST SELF \ud83e\udd0d\n\nTLDR: I am self diagnosed with Multiple Personality Disorder and I have all the resources I need to live a normal happy life.. I will post updates as needed so hopefully everyone can one day find their own inner peace \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb\n\nXoxo - Hayley", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jvbd9v/i_found_the_key_to_my_success_tldr_at_the_bottom/", "title": "I found the key to my success..
