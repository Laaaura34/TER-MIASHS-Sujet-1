But if anyone is interested in anything else I've got going on it's down below. Cheers to a sober October!\n\nBeen gearing up for this for about a month. Spent most of September eating like shit, smoking like a chimney, and drinking too much. This wasn't a last hoorah though. I was taking all of the things I enjoy(ed) and over indulging then focusing on just how awful those things made me feel. Primarily cigarettes and fried food made me feel the worst. I've quit a few times before and I know that mostly being bored is my biggest problem when quitting smoking. So I'm trying to keep busy by making vegan recipes that I haven't tried before. I'm not going vegan necessarily, but hoping that offsets that weight gain from not smoking. I'm also getting in exercise, I just walked 5 miles but I sweated like a ran the whole thing. \n\nI'll update as we go through the month maybe.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dc9a4i/i_didnt_smoke_yesterday_and_im_proud_of_myself/", "title": "I didn't smoke yesterday and I'm proud of myself.
