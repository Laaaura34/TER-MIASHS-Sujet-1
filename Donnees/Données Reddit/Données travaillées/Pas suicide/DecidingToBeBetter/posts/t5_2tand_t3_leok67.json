Everything else other than gaming are **tasks** \\- even hobbies, like playing the bass. Reading? Task. Bathing? Task. Talking to people? Task. Even when I am watching a good ass movie, in the back of my brain is like \"you know, instead, I could really be playing a game right now\".\n\nSo when I have a task ahead of me? I procrastinate. I neither play a game nor do the task - I just browse mindlessly through Reddit or YouTube.\n\nI really enjoy gaming, I don't wish to seize it completely. However, I want my brain to drawn itself completely into activities other than that.\n\nIf anyone who resonates with this could give some insight or advice I would be very grateful.
