I haven\u2019t had any friends (only 2 short term when I was younger in primary) and didn\u2019t make any in secondary or uni. I was bullied badly in school for the way I look (I\u2019m basically a horror as many people like to put it). It hurt me in school till I was about 16 but then I just became so cold and unemotional towards people, especially in sixth form and uni.\n\nI basically endeavoured the mindset of not giving a f*** about people, what they thought and how I acted. My motto was \u201cWell if I\u2019m ugly on the outside, might as well be ugly on the inside\u201d. Cringe, I know, but that is how I felt for many years and I felt it was valid.\n\nWithin that time, I was literally something else. People still attacked me for my exterior, but the things that I said back to some of them and others who didn\u2019t even provoke me was disgusting (proper cold an just terrible).and no amount of hurt within myself can excuse that. I got known as the angel of hell in my class and no one wanted to associate themselves with me. Before I felt sorry for myself, but now I just want to be better.\n\nI have no friends, only my mum and I want to make a fresh start. Get a good job, get plastic surgery and just be a nicer person. If anyone has any advice I would greatly appreciate it :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pm77dj/i_want_to_stop_being_a_mean_cold_btch/", "title": "I want to stop being a mean cold btch", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwawaygirlt19", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 107, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631365990, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pm77dj/i_want_to_stop_being_a_mean_cold_btch/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435340.462587, "replies_charged": false}
