The first session with the therapist was great and he helped me realize that the activities I do in isolation are losing their value to me because I\u2019ve neglected forming connections with people (he didn\u2019t tell me this, to my shock I found myself saying it out loud after he simply listened and asked me about my feelings). \n\nAnyways, four days a week I go to the gym after breakfast, maybe around 11am, same gym for years. There is this beautiful woman with such a cool vibe, like maybe she can skateboard. She is there maybe half the time I\u2019m there, we must have similar life schedules\u2014 I bet it\u2019s been at least a year of overlapping schedules where I frequently see her there. I\u2019ve never spoken to her because (1) I haven\u2019t been putting myself out there in a long time and (2) In general, I don\u2019t think women like being approached at the gym and (3) she might be around 5 years younger than me and that for sure makes me self conscious. \n\nAnyways, today we happen to cross paths in the gym and it went differently than ever before. the first thing that was different was I think after the realizations from therapy yesterday, my eyes weren\u2019t fixed on the floor by my feet as I walked, they were up and looking at the world. And much to my surprise, SHE initiated eye contact with ME and smiled! Now it could have been nothing, no intention of sending me signals what so ever, but I didn\u2019t really care. So she smiled and I stopped walking to yield to her as we were trying to pass each other in a narrow space in between machines, and when she smiled I didn\u2019t hesitate to speak and I smiled back and just said \u201creally cool hair\u201d, and ran my hand over the side of my head where she had shaved short her hair on the side of her head, like Natalie Dormer had done in hunger games. So She smiled again at me for speaking and then like a dork I gave her the cowabunga surfs-up hand gesture thing. To be honest I don\u2019t remember if she said anything back because I think I was blushing and I was too busy asking myself \u201cdid you just speak?!\u201d. \n\nAnd That was it. \nBut it was meaningful. \n\nIt felt like a test that popped up to see if I was going to take action on the realizations I had made in therapy, and I am very proud of myself for passing it! Maybe the high school me would have spoken in a situation like that but it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been that guy. (What happened to him?!)\n\nNow she may have just been being polite, most likely she was, she just smiled and looked at me because we both tried to use the same narrow walk way at the same time. But I don\u2019t even care, it showed me proof that I DO in fact crave more human interactions because this little blerb was indeed meaningful. It doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s interested or not, it matters how I behaved when I WAS interested.\n\nMaybe we\u2019ll never speak again. \nOr maybe we will but she won\u2019t think I\u2019m cute or she might be married, and it\u2019ll be nice that I\u2019ll make a platonic friend who is at the gym a lot when I am! \n\nEither way, I\u2019m good!\n\nBut if she reciprocates and says some sort of compliment to me next time we\u2019re both there, or if she flashes me the cowabunga in a playful way, I might have a fun little heart attack hahaha", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cciqb2/today_i_did_something_that_felt_really_good_for/", "title": "Today I did something that felt really good for my soul that I wouldn\u2019t have done if I hadn\u2019t gone to therapy for the first time yesterday.
