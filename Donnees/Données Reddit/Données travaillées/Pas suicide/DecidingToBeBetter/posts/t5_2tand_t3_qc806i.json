When I  started to get  little older she started   hitting me with shoes and  slippers on my arm until it got red.To this day , she gaslights ,  emotionally and verbally abuses me.\n\nHere's  the problem: I started hitting her.At first it was only retaliatory   and  in self defense , but she didn't stop , and soon enough it was me   who  started initiating the physical violence.I don't remember the   details of  exactly when and how , but logic tells me that because   violence and  abuse was normalised as I was growing up , and because my  family was dysfunctional, I started  hitting her without  realising how  messed up it was.I pushed her , sometime hit her in the head , sometimes  grabbed her arm.Everytime I would do  it , I would  promise myself  never again , but the next time she would start screaming and abusing me  verbally for no reason , I would lose my  shit.\n\nI  have been thinking about this constantly for days.On one hand , I was  definitely going through rough shit as a kid , living in a dysfunctional  family , in a chaotic and lonely household , and was abused myself , I  believe that is the reason why I became an abuser without even knowing  it.On the other hand , I can't stop feeling like I'm a monster , because  I became the abuser myself and worst of all , I hit my own mother.What I  did was terrible , the fact that I had a rough childhood doesn't make  it right.\n\nWhat can I do , how do I  reconcile these thoughts?I will get therapy ASAP but it is not  practically possible as of now and might not be for a while.I am open to  all suggestions , books , self help , anything.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qc806i/grew_up_in_an_abusive_environment_have_i_became/", "title": "Grew up in an abusive environment , have I became the abuser myself?I need advice.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwaway1298465", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634755871, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qc806i/grew_up_in_an_abusive_environment_have_i_became/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436705.5928545, "replies_charged": false}
