I just feel like I\u2019m different from others and see things differently, which isn\u2019t bad exactly. My mom used to tell me that I look fake when smiling so that could be part of the reason why I\u2019m like this. I look awkward when I force it. I\u2019d rather smile when I\u2019m genuinely happy, I\u2019m just reserved and introverted. Is this a valid opinion or should I actually try to smile and get good at it? The latter feels like I\u2019m changing myself for others, some people have commented on me not smiling in a well meaning way but it makes me feel bad about myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gzbbjz/i_dont_feel_comfortable_smiling_and_faking_it/", "title": "I don\u2019t feel comfortable smiling and \u201cfaking it\u201d", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "BigBossMan538", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1591660075, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gzbbjz/i_dont_feel_comfortable_smiling_and_faking_it/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435996.4488208, "replies_charged": false}
