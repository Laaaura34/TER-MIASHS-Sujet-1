I don't want to be 40/50 years old and look back with any regrets. I have multiple side projects going on on top of full-time work.\n\nSometimes, it can burn me out and I get too focused on work. I want to balance my time with my girlfriend and be there to support her, and provide her with the love that she deserves. She's amazing. But I must learn how to turn off work mode and put my full focus on her.\n\nI know the meaning of life is not all work, it's to love and experience life, experience the journey.\n\nAny tips? Anyone going/been through the same?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pm89om/how_do_i_24m_balance_being_very_ambitious_and/", "title": "How do I (24M) balance being very ambitious and being a great boyfriend who spends time with my partner?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "TakExplores", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 290, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631369985, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pm89om/how_do_i_24m_balance_being_very_ambitious_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435213.667152, "replies_charged": false}
