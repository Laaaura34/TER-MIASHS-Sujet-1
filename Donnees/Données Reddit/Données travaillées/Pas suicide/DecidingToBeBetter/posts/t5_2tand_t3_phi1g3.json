The major one was to quit playing video games all together.   \n\nI picked up a few new hobbies and interests to fill my time with productive things rather than just waste my life away. \n\nI started this online programming course with instructional videos and interactive tutorials.   It\u2019s 100 days of coding on udemy. Highly recommend.\n\nAfter just 3 days of coding, I managed to make this little text based choose your own adventure type game.  \n\nIt\u2019s loosely based on the end of Super Bowl 49.  Seahawks vs pats.\n\nIt\u2019s 3 \u201cstages\u201d. Each stage you are given a choice.   If you select the correct one, you proceed to the next scenario and need to make another choice.     If you choose wrong it\u2019s game over.   \n\nHint: at the end, never choose to pass over the middle and into the hands of malcom butler! (This happened in real life, the infamous \u201cINTERCEPTION AT THE GOAL LINE!\u201d  \n\n\nI\u2019m proud of my little game here.      It\u2019s simple but it\u2019s a great building block to something bigger!   I\u2019m just ecstatic that I built and coded a game from scratch and it actually works!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/phi1g3/i_stopped_wasting_my_time_playing_video_games_and/", "title": "I stopped wasting my time playing video games and now I\u2019m CREATING video games!!!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "tyler_durden2021", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 532, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630718205, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/phi1g3/i_stopped_wasting_my_time_playing_video_games_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437930.7367795, "replies_charged": false}
