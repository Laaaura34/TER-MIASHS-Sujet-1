With all the misery in this world and around me. Sadly I put myself in this, I\u2019ve no one to blame but myself. Cannabis, obscene mundane modern music, what\u2019s on tv, books, people from all walks of life including myself are temporary and in time we too shall cease to exist and turning to these things primarily for escape led to nothing but disappointment. I\u2019m done using such mediums and hopefully will keep crawling into this void hoping it\u2019ll be good or I shall perish leading to my demise in the process. \n\nAnother day, another night, another breath wasted. My thoughts and prayers go out to everyone struggling and to the people who\u2019re under siege and oppression from all around the world.
