The resentment affected every aspect of my life, including math. It affected my intelligence as well as my grades, it was awful. I hated it. I was fearful. My self-esteem was so poor. I was a nice kid, but eventually my classmates began to abuse my niceness. I started to feel sad, resentful, and alone. They started to bully me as well, by mocking me, calling me names, excluding me from things, belittling me, stealing my things, etc. My dad was right about them. I tried to please them. Instead, I became resentful and frustrated.\n\nIf any student asked me if they could borrow my pencils, hang out with them, or copy off my homework, I would always say yes. I couldn't say no. They stopped copying off my homework once I said no, because I had learned my lesson. Every time I attempted to stand up for myself, they would either avoid me, gaslight me, ignore me, or dismiss me. It was awful! They took complete advantage of me. I felt so used. Although I treated them nicely, I gradually began to resent them.\n\nThe awful sentiment lasted until August of this year. It started to take a toll on my health, both physically and mentally.\n\nEdit: I was resentful for 22 years, not 19.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ko4o1f/after_19_years_of_resentment_due_to_being_taken/", "title": "After 19 years of resentment due to being taken advantage of in school, I am learning to be social again.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "benderlax", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 18, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1609473945, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ko4o1f/after_19_years_of_resentment_due_to_being_taken/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435123.0701556, "replies_charged": false}
