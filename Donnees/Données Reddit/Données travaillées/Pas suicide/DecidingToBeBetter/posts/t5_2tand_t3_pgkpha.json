A year ago I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, I'm wicked overweight, and last month I was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.\n\nSo...things have gotten a bit out of control lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut yesterday I decided I wanted to turn things around, and bought a bike! I haven't had one for about 23 years (yikes), and I was super nervous about riding again after so long. But as they say, you never forget how to ride a bike! I took it out for about 40 minutes of casual pedaling to get a feel for it, and found it very enjoyable, and also a much better workout than just walking I think.\n\nI want to build up my strength and get to the point where I can ride my bike to and from work, which is kinda how I justified buying it, as bus fare saved would eventually pay for the bike!\n\nIt's a small victory in the grand scheme of things, but right now it feels like a big step and I'm super proud of myself for taking it!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pgkpha/bought_my_first_bike_as_an_adult_and_took_it_for/", "title": "bought my first bike as an adult and took it for a spin!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "The_Stickers", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 19, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630598246, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pgkpha/bought_my_first_bike_as_an_adult_and_took_it_for/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437499.6049733, "replies_charged": false}
