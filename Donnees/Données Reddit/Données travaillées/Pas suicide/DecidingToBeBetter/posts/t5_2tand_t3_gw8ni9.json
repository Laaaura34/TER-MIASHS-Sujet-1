I have spent the first three weeks like most others, seeing old friends and drinking. I have found that these times of uncertainty that we are experiencing, alongside with me not having anything to do make me feel unsettled and unfulfilled. I am looking for an  improvement in myself, but don't know where to begin. So now I ask the people of reddit:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you have any suggestions on how to begin a path of betterment? Some subjects that have caught my eye are writing, coding, self awareness, mental toughness, fitness and of course anything that you personally have found inspiring.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know its not very specific but the people of this sub seem to have the right idea!!
