Covid, winter, Parkinson's disease, a torn ACL and a cerebral spinal fluid leak kept me at home, unable to exercise, and really limiting my social life. \n\nMy best friend gave me a little care package to lift my spirits after surgery, including a large jar of lotion. \n\nWhat she didn't know is by the time I got that lotion, I was in a real bad place. Not taking care of my hygiene, not talking to anyone, not doing any household chores or hobbies. Just sitting in a chair waiting for the next day to start.I was in constant pain for months. Sleep was intermittent. \n\nI decided that jar of lotion would be the first one I finished-  ever. (I never really use it.)  If not for me, then for her. To use a thoughtful gift. This got me in the shower regularly. Changing my clothes, brushing my teeth, blow drying my hair. Today I finished that lotion. Tomorrow I'll start the other one she gave me.
