They tell you to wake up early, eat healthy, make choices to stop simple pleasures and bad habits, to one day hopefully live the dream you so desperately try to make a reality. \n\nI get it, I really do.\nSometimes you feel so alone your bed is the only comfort you can find in dark times. Maybe laying on the cold ground they call rock bottom is to much for you, you look up to see nothing. No hand to pick you up, nobody to hug you and tell you \u201cyou\u2019re alright\u201d. \nNo one is acknowledging the work you\u2019ve slaved to achieve, nobody is coming to save you..\n\nI GET IT. \nBut let me make sure you understand it, the day you decide to quit but you don\u2019t... You\u2019ll see more of yourself than you ever have. You\u2019ll feel more powerful than you could ever imagine, because one day you\u2019ll hit something that is much bigger than you, stronger than you. And no mental dedications can move this wall that has you at a complete stop, and in that moment you\u2019ll feel so defeated... but this wall doesn\u2019t know you can climb, and I promise you can climb. If you fall, fall forward so you can get up and keep fucking climbing that wall until you\u2019re screaming bloody marry, pain will subside but failure? It\u2019ll haunt you until it sees rose pedals on your grave... \n\nI believe in you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kljive/youre_tired_i_get_it/", "title": "You\u2019re tired..
