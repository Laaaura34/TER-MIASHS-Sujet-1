I\u2019ve been working a significant amount of overtime the past three weeks and will continue to work overtime until mid June. My paycheck is happy, but I am not.\n\nI have been neglecting my own well being for work and it\u2019s wearing on me a LOT. At my boss\u2019s suggestion, I took a personal day today for a mental health break. Problem is that I have a lot of house chores and errands to catch up on that I\u2019ve neglected to do over the past few weeks. Not super relaxing.\n\nMeditation hasn\u2019t helped. I can\u2019t do yoga or exercise a lot because of an injury I\u2019m dealing with. I don\u2019t have the energy to read or do much after working multiple 12-13 hour days.\n\nI absolutely adore my job and love all the projects I have going on, but it\u2019s becoming all consuming and I don\u2019t know how to \u201cturn it off.\u201d It\u2019s also my busiest time of year, so that\u2019s compounding things.\n\nTLDR: how the hell do I stop overworking myself?
