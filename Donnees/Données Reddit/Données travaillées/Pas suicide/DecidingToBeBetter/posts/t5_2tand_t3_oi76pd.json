I'll pick up activities/ skills that I want to learn and if I'm really REALLY invested in it, it can show development pretty rapidly and consistently.\n\nI've tried the guitar, new languages, art... and something I've always noticed is that every time I drop one thing to pick up another, I seem to lose all progress in my previous field.\n\nI'll get really good at art and then drop it for a few weeks to pursue a new language or something and when I come back to it, it's like my hands don't work right anymore. I still remember the rules, but it doesn't work on instinct like it use to before, and I feel like I'm starting from scratch again.\n\nI'm currently preparing for an exam that requires me to be adept at three very different subjects and the same problems are showing up again.\n\nAm I missing something fundamental in the learning process?
