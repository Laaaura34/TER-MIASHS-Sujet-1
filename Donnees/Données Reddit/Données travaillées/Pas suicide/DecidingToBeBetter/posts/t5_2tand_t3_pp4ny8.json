I made a whole pro con list and the cons are much longer than pros. Tbh his presence in my life has hurt my self esteem and mental health because of how he\u2019s treated me. He\u2019s never physically hurt me and tries his best to improve. But yesterday he went too far by talking he was embarrassed of me for having no money and that he believed I couldn\u2019t change and get another job. He\u2019s said much worse before, like name calling and uncalled anger over over very petty stuff. But the past few months he\u2019s been better but still his constant doubts and questioning of my value makes me feel horrible about myself. I had to leave him if I ever have a chance of feeling better. \n\nThe bad thing is I still deeply love him and he\u2019s so persistent. He was sobbing in front of me, begging me, saying he wanted to die. He was saying everything he could to try to change my mind. Everyone in my family dislikes him and so do my friends because he hurt me many times in the 11 months of our relationship. They are my rock in this situation. But still, it hurts so much. But logically I know it\u2019s what I need to regain my confidence and be happier. \n\nI know logically too that I shouldn\u2019t talk to him but I am. I promised that if he loves himself finally and gets better I would give him another chance because I\u2019ve seen him change. But I told him only a chance, only a maybe and we would restart dating very slowly. I only imagine this in a few years when we both have everything together. \n\nBut I don\u2019t know if I should even give him this chance.\n\nHe loves me more than anyone else. He talks about all these sweet things about me. But I made it clear that if ever wants me he needs to work on himself away from me since I need to work on myself too.  He tells me he can change and to an extent I believe it since he did get better before. Still I\u2019m doubtful that\u2019s why I tell him maybe.\n\nI\u2019m doubtful because I know how self centered he can be. If something doesn\u2019t go his way perfectly, he gets pissed and sometimes if he\u2019s mad enough at all the people around him, especially anyone close to him. He\u2019s a pessimist and I\u2019m optimistic and sometimes it feels like drained the life out of me with emotional instability. I told him I can\u2019t deal with it, it hurts me too much. And I don\u2019t know if the part of can actually change but I want to see him try. I want him better but it can\u2019t be me to deal with it when I have my own mental health to attend to. \n\nI need to take care of myself but I can\u2019t when I\u2019m with him. I know the break up was the right decision but the pain is horrible. I wish I could just say this too shall pass and move on. But I know need to feel the pain and embrace it. I know it may make me stronger but it\u2019s soo freakin hard. Especially a very empathetic person such as me telling a sobbing man that I need to leave in for a long time or perhaps forever. \n\nI just imagine him crying at home and it hurts. I don\u2019t want to think about it but I always empathize with anyone I talk to, especially more powerfully with people I\u2019m close to. I wish I didn\u2019t feel so much for people but I can\u2019t help it. I care too much. It actually sucks.\n\nI\u2019m 23 and he\u2019s 25 btw", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pp4ny8/i_broke_up_with_my_bf_but_its_difficult_to_cope/", "title": "I broke up with my bf but it\u2019s difficult to cope", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Jamjammimi", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 0, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631759779, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pp4ny8/i_broke_up_with_my_bf_but_its_difficult_to_cope/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437492.6714172, "replies_charged": false}
