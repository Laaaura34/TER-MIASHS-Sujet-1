I'm not proud of it, and I do wish someone educated me more about the world and social situations. I am mentally disabled, so social skills aren't my strong suit. I was a stupid, petty kid, and words cannot describe how much I regret the stuff I did. I was angry at people, because of how they didn't accept me for my disability. But now, I realise that I can't go about and be petty.\n\nI've matured a lot, and I've left behind my mentality of \"an eye for an eye\". But the guilt is overwhelming, and it eats me alive. I feel like I can't progress because of this guilt. I also get so paranoid about people finding out about all the petty shit I did back then. Its gotten so bad that I had to leave social media due to this paranoia.\n\nI just want to move on and be the best person I can be. I realise what I did was bad, and I want to leave it behind. But I feel like I'm stuck in the past because of this. \n\nSo how do I deal with the guilt? And how do I move on?\n\nThank you", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pij8qp/how_do_i_deal_with_the_guilt/", "title": "How do I deal with the guilt?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "callmedingus101", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630869086, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pij8qp/how_do_i_deal_with_the_guilt/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438222.9511042, "replies_charged": false}
