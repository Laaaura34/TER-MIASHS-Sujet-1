I\u2019m extremely superstitious (to the point of being completely unable to function sometimes lol) & one of my superstitions is that if I tell too many people the good things in my life, I\u2019ll lose the good things. Horrid. But for some reason my stupid little brain is telling me this is okay. I\u2019m not verbally speaking it & I don\u2019t know any of you, so it cancels out the superstition I guess. (TW: drugs, alcohol, suicidal thoughts)\n\nWhen COVID started & the lockdown happened, I was furloughed from my job. Wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal, except I was moving to a different state in a few months, so being furloughed meant I lost my job. Luckily I had plenty saved up, so I was fine to not get a job immediately after moving to one of the COVID hotspots in the US at the time. The problem, however, is that I\u2019d isolated myself for a literal year. Didn\u2019t leave the house. I was (& still am) TERRIFIED of COVID. Almost everyone I know has had it. Only saw my fianc\u00e9 & my roommates for a whole year. I\u2019m introverted as hell & have terrible social anxiety as it is, so all that did was exasperate those issues. You can definitely say I became pretty agoraphobic. \n\nIt\u2019s been a year and a half now. A year and a half of doing literally nothing bc I couldn\u2019t leave my house. I couldn\u2019t get a job bc I\u2019ve been too scared to speak to people. I couldn\u2019t make friends in my new town. Honestly, I can\u2019t even drive because I\u2019m terrified of driving (for non-COVID related reasons lol). I\u2019ve been 100% dependent on my fianc\u00e9. I\u2019ve slowly been working on it, leaving the house more, socializing with my fianc\u00e9 & roommates\u2019 friends. \n\nToday I signed up for a gym membership (honestly, not for physical reasons. For mental health reasons). Next week I start a class to become a certified recovery coach (I\u2019m 3 years in recovery from alcohol and cocaine\u2026. MAN did quarantine make that hard. I might not be able to make friends or get a job, but if there\u2019s one thing I can do, it\u2019s find a liquor store & a dealer). The following week I start college (again, for the third time. My first two times I was still an addict, so you can imagine how that ended). Next month I start a job as a recovery coach. I get to help people through their addictions the same way I helped myself through my own.\n\nI was ready to off myself this time last year. This is going to be a really long, really hard journey. I\u2019m already insanely anxious about everything I\u2019m doing. But for today\u2026. I feel like I\u2019m finally getting my life back.\n\nEdit to add: \nTL/DR: COVID made me agoraphobic. Have been unemployed & holed up in my house for at least a year. I decided enough is enough and joined a gym, am becoming a recovery coach, & going back to college.
