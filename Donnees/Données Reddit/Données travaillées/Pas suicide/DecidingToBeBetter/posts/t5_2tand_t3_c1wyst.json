It is my goal to help you Make Life Yours, so we are exploring happiness ... backed by science! Let me know what happiness means to you!\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# \u201cHappiness depends on ourselves.\u201d \u2013 Aristotle \n\nWe all have ideas about what happiness is and how to get it. Maybe it\u2019s driving the car with the windows rolled down, stereo up, and singing at the top of your lungs. Maybe happiness is something as simple as a good book or being comfortable to be who you truly are \u2026 deep inside. Ask yourself, \u201cwhat does happiness mean to me?\u201d Happiness depends on you; make life yours!\n\nI strive to be happy with everything I do. For me, this means exercising daily and being with the people I care for. But wouldn\u2019t it be nice to always be driven to a happier self? I would love to be the best I can be, as I\u2019m sure you would too, so I researched the simplest ways to start *now* \u2026 backed by science! Let\u2019s take a look:\n\n# 11 Hacks to Happiness\n\n**1) Exercise \u2013 20 Minutes Will Maximize Happiness**\n\nWhat happens with our bodies when we exercise is well-known \u2013 we build muscle and stamina over time. But when it comes to our brain, mind, and attitude, it isn\u2019t as clear. \n\nWell, it turns out exercise (even in small amounts) can make you happier!\n\nHere\u2019s How:\n\n1. It releases \u2018feel-good\u2019 chemicals in our brain\n2. It reduces stress\n3. It energizes you\n4. It\u2019s a confidence booster\n5. It fights insomnia\n\nThe University of Bristol [published a study](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1095783/People-exercise-work-days-happier-suffer-stress-productive.html) which analyzed the moods of participants after exercising. They found on exercise days people\u2019s moods improved greatly after the workout. 79 percent of the participants stated emotional improvements were better, and 74 percent said they could manage their workload better after a workout. \n\nWhat\u2019s best is only 20 minutes of exercise is enough to maximize happiness. In her book, *The First 20 Minutes,* Gretchen Reynolds uncovers you don\u2019t need to train like an Olympian to get the happiest results. A much smaller workout will get you to the peak.\n\n* *\u201cThe first 20 minutes of moving around, provide most of the health benefits. You get prolonged life, reduced disease risk \u2013 all of those things come in the first 20 minutes of being active.\u201d*\n\nI challenge you to challenge yourself! Get out early tomorrow morning and go for a run! You will be more energize and focused throughout the day, and when it comes time to sleep \u2026 well \u2026 you\u2019ll turn into a baby.\n\n**2) Spend Time in Nature \u2013 It Will Boost Positive Emotions**\n\nFrom camping deep in the woods to spending a day on the water, I never seem to get enough of the great outdoors. Thankfully, now I have an excuse to spend even more time in nature! Not only does it boost happiness, but it has numerous health benefits too.\n\nAccording to the University of East Anglia, the more [time spent in nature reduces the risk](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/07/180706102842.htm) of cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure, and stress. Working with 20 countries, researchers compare people with little access to nature to those who spent large amounts of time outdoors. The team found that spending time outside is linked to great health benefits. \n\n* *\u201cIn fact, one of the really interesting things we found is that exposure to \u2018greenspace\u2019 significantly reduces people's levels of salivary cortisol \u2013 a physiological marker of stress.\u201d \u2013 Caoimhe Twohig-Bennett*\n\nIn another study, conducted by Gregory Bratman of Stanford, [participant\u2019s emotional states were assessed](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204615000286) after taking a walk in a natural or urban setting. Those who walked in nature experienced less anxiety and more positive emotions compared to urban walkers. \n\nThe best thing about this happiness hack is how easy it is! In his book *The Happiness Advantage,* Shawn Anchor recommends spending at least 20 minutes in the fresh air:\n\n* *\u201cMaking time to go outside on a nice day also delivers a huge advantage; one study found that spending 20 minutes outside in good weather not only boosted positive mood but broadened thinking and improved working memory...\u201d* \n\nThis is good news for everyone who worries about changing their habits. You can fit this into your busy schedule \u2026 no problem! \n\nI challenge you to spend *at least* 20 minutes outside every day, rain or shine. Try being the first one up and going for a morning run. You can even hang a hammock and catch up on some missed reading! Happiness starts with yourself; make time for you.\n\n**3) Eat Healthy \u2013 The Proof is in The Vegetables** \n\nOur nutrition isn\u2019t limited to only affecting our bodies. In fact, it\u2019s been proven that a healthy diet boosts our mental health faster than physical health. \n\nIn [a study conducted](https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2014/10/fruit-and-veggies-pave-road-happiness) at the University of Queensland, researchers followed 12,000 people for two years. They analyzed whether the participants ate vegetables and fruits, how much they ate, and at what times. Then, the individual\u2019s life satisfaction was assessed. People who ate more fruits and vegetables per day had higher happiness and satisfaction levels than those who didn\u2019t! \n\n* *\"Eating fruit and vegetables apparently boosts our happiness far more quickly than it improves human health.\" \u2013 Redzo Mujcic (study co-author)*\n\nWhile this is certainly impressive, what\u2019s even more jaw-dropping is that nutrition has become an effective strategy for overcoming depression! \n\nA [trial conducted](https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/how-to-eat-your-way-to-happiness) at Deakin College measured the therapeutic impact of eating healthy. Felice Jacka worked with 67 people overcoming depression. Some of them were receiving psychotherapy, others were taking antidepressants, and a handful was using both. After 12 weeks, the people who received nutritional counseling were found to be significantly happier than those given social support throughout the day.\n\n* *\u201cUnprocessed diets higher in plant foods, healthy forms of protein, and fasts are associated with better mental health outcomes. We're increasingly understanding that the gut is really the driver of health, including mental health\u2026\u201d \u2013 Felice Jacka*\n\nWhether you need a little help getting out of bed in the morning, or putting a smile on your face, I challenge you to eat better! \n\nYou\u2019re probably asking \u201c[but what *should* I be eating](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/bs1y1s/eating_healthy_and_performing_better/)?\u201d I\u2019ve got you covered! Here are my top three favorite foods packed full of nutrients:\n\n1. **Blueberries**\n\n* Need some powerful antioxidants? Blueberries should be first on your list. This fruit is part of the \u201csuperfood\u201d group, along with goji berry and raspberry. Blueberries also help to improve memory and brain power; go tackle your day!\n\n2. **Spinach**\n\n* Spinach is loaded with healthy macronutrients. It has been shown these nutrients slow cognitive decline \u2013 during the day, and with age. Aiding in clear thinking, this can help you perform quicker and longer \u2026 and boost happiness.\n\n3. **Salmon**\n\n* This fish has an awesomely high omega-3 fatty acid content. This is great for improving memory and mental performance. Get to it. Boost your mood, your memory, and up your game!\n\n**4)** **Sleep More \u2013 You\u2019ll Be Less Negative**\n\nGetting a good night\u2019s sleep needs to be at the top of your to-do list. We all know that sleep helps our bodies and minds recover from the previous day. But what you might not have known is you\u2019ll be less sensitive to negative emotions!\n\nThink about the last time you woke up on the wrong side of the bed (not literally). You probably felt like a pin dropping would send you into a fury. \n\nFor me, this was last week; not even coffee, eggs, or bacon could cheer me up! The worst part was this affected my work, which then affected my sleep because I stayed up trying to finish everything. This cycle went on for three days before I got back to my rhythm. The good thing is I now know the trick to a positive attitude: get your damn sleep!\n\nIn [the BPS Research Digest](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2011/03/21/an-afternoon-nap-tunes-out-negative-emotions-tunes-in-positive-ones/), they cite a study which outlines how sleep affects your sense of negative emotions. Out of 36 participants, half took a nap in the afternoon after completing a task. Using facial recognition, it was found those who took the nap became less sensitive to negative emotions. It even enhanced their ratings of positive expressions!\n\nIn the book, *NutureShock*, Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman illustrate how sleep can affect your attitude:\n\n* *\u201cNegative stimuli get processed by the amygdala; positive memories get processed by the hippocampus. Sleep deprivation hits the hippocampus harder than the amygdala. The result is that sleep-deprived people fail to recall pleasant memories yet recall gloomy memories just fine.\u201d \u2013 Bronson*\n\nThe book goes on to cite a study in which college students were asked to memorize various words. The result? Participants memorized 81% of the words with negative connotations and only 31% of the words with positive connotations. Would you rather be thinking \u201ccancer,\u201d or \u201csunshine?\u201d\n\nThe lesson here is to make sure you get your ZZZ\u2019s in! Go ahead, use this as an excuse to take an afternoon nap, I know I will.\n\nI challenge you to create a nightly routine. An alarm for when you need to go to bed \u2013 not just for when you should get up. Escort electronics out of the room \u2026 hey, even try some meditation or an evening run!\n\n**5)** **Meditation \u2013 Focus Up, Fear and Anxiety Down**\n\nWhat CAN\u2019T meditation do? It already improves attention span, clarity, and focus. It can even improve your IQ! Well \u2026 it turns out it\u2019s powerful stuff because it can boost happiness for you too. \n\nNeuroscientist Sara Lazar [published a study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3004979/) showing how meditation increases your ability to deal with stress and discomfort. In fact, regular practice shrinks the amygdala \u2013 the portion of the brain responsible for fear and anxiety. Think about how much happier you\u2019d be without that discomfort! \n\nAs well, [a study published](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23724462) by the US National Library of Medicine shows how meditation affects cortisol levels in the body. Fun fact: cortisol is the hormone responsible for stress. Too much of it can lead to anxiety, mood swings, and sleep troubles. Out of 30 students tested each had shown a significant decrease of cortisol (AKA they were happier)! And this was only after four days!\n\nI used to be resistant to meditation. I\u2019d rather watch Frozen 10 times over with a group of 5th graders than sit in silence. \\**Shudder\\** But now, I\u2019ve been meditating consistently (20 minutes each morning) for the past four months. Here\u2019s where I saw differences:\n\n1. It helped boost my confidence\n2.  It helped me maintain focus throughout the day\n3. It made me more emotional \u2026 I used to be super closed off\n4. I now enjoy the little things in life way, way more\n5. My outlook on life is more positive and I feel happier!\n\nI challenge you to take this easy step, right now. Change the way you think and change the way you feel. Even if you are thinking \u201cthis is ridiculous I\u2019m already amazing\u2026\u201d just try it!\n\nThese are my favorite apps for practicing:\n\n* 1 Giant Mind\n* Headspace \n* The Mindfulness App\n\n**6)** **Practice Gratitude**\n\n* *\u201cGratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough.\u201d \u2013 Melodie Beatty*\n\nThis practice is super simple, and it will have a great effect on your outlook. Gratitude goes hand in hand with mindfulness. It helps you to focus on the present and appreciate what we have now, rather than obsessively wishing for more. \n\nIn 2003, Dr. Emmons of the University of California [published a study](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/images/application_uploads/Emmons-CountingBlessings.pdf) in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. 200 college students split into three groups and were asked to keep a journal on blessings, annoyances, or neutral events. After two weeks, those in the blessings group reported being more positive about their lives and more optimistic about the future. After 10 weeks they had fewer physical ailments and even spent more time exercising. Now that\u2019s a double-whammy for happiness!\n\nOther studies have explored how gratitude can improve relationships. For example, when analyzing groups of couples, gratitude helped improved their bonds. Those who expressed happiness for their partner felt more positive towards the other person. They also felt more comfortable expressing concerns. \n\nI challenge you to begin practicing gratitude today. Keep a journal and write down three things that are specific for that day. The best part about this is the days keep giving! I\u2019m always going back to my journal to see what happened last week or last month \u2026 it puts a smile on my face.\n\nHere are five ways (tried and tested by yours truly) you can become more grateful:\n\n1. Spend more time in nature \u2026 I find it calms me down\n2. Appreciate a friend \u2026 just because they\u2019re them\n3. Spend time with the ones you love \u2026 give them love too\n4. Commit one random act of kindness each day \u2026 even for a stranger\n5. Enjoy the little things in life \u2026 they\u2019re what really counts\n\n**7)** **Satisficing vs. Maximization \u2013 Better Results with Less Stress**\n\nThis is one of the most interesting topics I have come across while creating this piece.\n\nSatisficing is the concept of doing what\u2019s \u201cgood enough\u201d for the desired outcome, rather than doing the absolute best. It is the opposite of maximization, which means you only accept the best. \n\nLet me explain!\n\nThink about the last time you maximized on something. Maybe it was an essay, at the gym, or even cooking dinner for the family. It was probably stressful as hell because you were trying to get the *best* result out of the work you were doing. \n\nIn 2002, Dr. Barry Schwartz [published a study](http://www.wisebrain.org/media/Papers/maximizing.pdf) which analyzed happiness in both satisficers and maximizers. The results? Satisfiers are happier than maximizers. As well, they often maximize without even try to. \n\nFor example, when making a decision satisfiers will choose one that is good enough. The maximizers will search until they are certain their choice is best but continue to worry about the other options long after the choice has been made. \n\nHere\u2019s where the interesting part comes in \u2026 after a satisfier has made a decision, there is still room for improvement. This allows them to upgrade to a better option if the moment presents itself. Without trying to find the best option they\u2019ll end up with it anyway, and without the stress, a maximizer would have!\n\nThis is incredibly easy, and helpful to do today. If you tend to spend too much time analyzing options, I challenge you to let go of some expectations. Opt-in for the choice giving you the results that are *good enough* and keep a watchful eye for upgrades along the way. You\u2019ll find that you have less stress because you won\u2019t spend as much time worrying. You\u2019ll also be able to get your work done faster \u2026 leaving more time for fun in the sun!\n\n**8)** **Spend More Time with Who You Love \u2013 Relationships are Worth More Than Money**\n\n* *\u201cWe are happy when we have family, we are happy when we have friends and almost all the other things we think make us happy are actually just ways of getting more family and friends.\u201d* \u2013 Daniel Gilbert\n\nSo many of us think happiness comes from status and monetary reward. While these may bring a sense of fulfillment, they take away from what truly makes a happy life: our relationships. Personal relationships have the largest impact on your happiness \u2026 so spend more time with the ones you love!\n\nIf you can\u2019t be swayed from a monetary focus, what if I told you your relationships are worth more than an extra $100,000 a year? A study in the [Journal of Socio-Economics](https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2012/01/what-are-your-relationships-worth-in-dollars/#ixzz2b33s2ANx) states the following: \n\n* *\u201cUsing the British Household Panel Survey, I find that an increase in the level of social involvements is worth up to an extra \u00a385,000 ($108,000) a year in terms of life satisfaction. Actual changes in income, on the other hand, buy very little happiness.\u201d*\n\nRead that last line one more time \u2026 \u201cActual changes in income buy very little happiness.\u201d You can increase your income by massive amounts each year and *still* not achieve the happiness everyone craves. To put other life events in perspective, here is what the Journal valued them at:\n\n1. A happy marriage is worth $105,000 a year\\\\\n2. Seeing friends and family regularly is worth $98,000 a year\n\nThis is a helpful reminder that all of those \u201cpaths to happiness\u201d aren\u2019t as important as you think. Spend time in the present and spend time with family in friends. I challenge you to be happy now \u2026 don\u2019t wait to complete those paths to happiness.\n\n**9)** **Help Others \u2013 Give Back to Get Happy**\n\nHelping others is not limited to giving up time cleaning up the neighborhood or at a soup kitchen. In Shawn Anchor\u2019s book, he brings a twist to spending money called \u201cprosocial spending.\u201d\n\n* *\u201c...when researchers interviewed more than 150 people about their recent purchases, they found that money spent on activities\u2014such as concerts and group dinners out\u2014brought far more pleasure than material purchases like shoes, televisions, or expensive watches. Spending money on other people, called \u201cprosocial spending,\u201d also boosts happiness.\u201d* \n\nThe Journal of Happiness also [published a study](https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2011/04/is-there-a-way-to-create-a-positive-feedback/#ixzz2b2m2LMBe) exploring this concept:\n\n* *\u201cParticipants recalled a previous purchase made for either themselves or someone else and then reported their happiness. Afterward, participants chose whether to spend a monetary windfall on themselves or someone else.* *Participants assigned to recall a purchase made for someone else reported feeling significantly happier* *immediately after this recollection;* *most importantly, the happier participants felt, the more likely they were to choose to spend a windfall on someone else* *soon.\u201d* \n\nBut if you\u2019re like me, happy and broke \u2026 don\u2019t worry \u2026 spending time on others is as valuable as money. In his book *Authentic Happiness,* Martin Seligman says this:\n\n* *\u201cWe scientists have found that doing a kindness produces the single most reliable momentary increase in well-being of any exercise we have tested... Here is the exercise: find one wholly unexpected kind thing to do tomorrow and just do it. Notice what happens to your mood.\u201d*\n\nHere is your challenge! Find one kind thing to do tomorrow and just do it. After you master that, try volunteering:\n\n1. Volunteer at a local school \u2026 you can be a positive role model for a child\n2. Spend time at a senior center \u2026 you may learn from those who have traveled before you\n3. Fix and serve meals \u2026 you can help someone find their next meal, and offer a smile while you\u2019re at it\n\n**10)** **Just Be Yourself \u2013 Wear Your Own Shoes**\n\n* *\u201cHappiness flows easily and effortlessly when you just let yourself \u201cBe Yourself.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aMichael Fordyce*\n\nIf there is one thing out of this *entire* list to start doing now, it\u2019s this. Be happy with who you are. You don\u2019t need to \u201cbe accepted\u201d or try to fit into other\u2019s expectations. For that matter, you don\u2019t need to fit your own expectations to love yourself and be yourself. \n\nThink: who do you want to be in five years? No matter who you will be, you don\u2019t have to wait five years to be happy. If you love yourself now and enjoy the journey to your future self, you\u2019ll always be content. \n\nIf you be yourself today, amazing things will happen.\n\n* You will find your tribe. You\u2019ll be surrounded by people who love you for the real you and support your goals.\n* You will be trusted. People will feel secure in knowing you are who you say and act like you are.\n* You will be more confident. You won\u2019t need to worry about impressing people and changing who you are in certain scenarios.\n* You will be less stressed. There is no need to act differently in certain environments \u2026 it\u2019s so much easier to be yourself than to be fake all the time.\n* You will be happier. Your happiness is based upon your own ability to step into greatness while wearing your own shoes. \n\nLiving a life that shows who you truly are is the best way to happiness. What if you had to live someone else\u2019s life? We are in an amazing time where people can express themselves and be who they truly are. People will support you, there is something for everyone. \n\nUse this to your advantage. If you\u2019re wearing someone else\u2019s shoes \u2026 take them off and put yours on.\n\n**11)** **Organize Now and Set Goals for the Future \u2013 Find Your Purpose**\n\n* *\u201cIf you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to people or things.\u201d \u2013 Albert Einstein*\n\nHappiness and productivity are linked. \\**Cough Cough*\\* What a good reason to start making changes! \\**Cough*\\* \n\nHere are four reasons why the more productive you are, the happier you\u2019ll be:\n\n**1.** **Make a To-Do List \u2026 And Stick to It**\n\nThe more you accomplish, the better you will feel about yourself! Whether these tasks are big or small \u2026 it doesn\u2019t matter, just get \u2018er done.\n\nThe only key is finishing the task! When you scratch off a task from a job well done, your [brain releases dopamine](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mouse-man/200904/what-is-dopamine) and quite literally improves your mood. \n\n**2.** **Set Goals SMART Goals**\n\nMake sure your goals are SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relative, timely)! Setting these types of goals can give your self-esteem a real boost. \n\nNot only that but now you have something to look forward to! When you have a purpose, you will be happier to jump out of bed and tackle the challenges of life. \n\n**3.** **Manage Your Time Wisely**\n\nWhen you\u2019re on a productive streak, hitting a spot with nothing to do can be discouraging. The better you manage our time, the more productive your days will be.\n\nThe more productive your days \u2026 well \u2026 the happier you will be too!\n\n**4.** **Find Purpose in Your Productivity**\n\nProductivity is important, but it doesn\u2019t mean always being busy. Being busy means doing more and more things. Being productive means doing something with a purpose.\n\nWhat is it you want out of life? What are your goals? Answer these questions for yourself and align your productivity with them.\n\nAs illustrated by Einstein, true happiness can only be attained when you work for your passions and goals. I challenge you to review this list of happiness hacks. Make a list of what you want to try today and stick to it! Put these in your schedule and set some goals. Manage your time and make a productive leap towards happiness! Life is short. Make it count.\n\n# Key Takeaways \n\n**1.** **Take Care of Your Body**\n\n* You only get one body; take care of it. Exercise, eat well and make sure to relax. Remember, \u201chappiness depends on ourselves,\u201d so boost yourself up and give yourself power.\n\n**2. Respect Your Mind**\n\n* Your mind is the most valuable asset you have. Allow yourself a good night\u2019s rest to recover from a long day \u2013 you\u2019ll be less sensitive to negative emotions. Meditate to reduce your stress and anxiety. Practice gratitude to be happy with the present. And when you\u2019re faced with a decision, try satisficing, you\u2019ll end up maximizing results without the stress. \n\n**3. Cultivate Relationships**\n\n* Daniel Gilbert has a point when he says \u201c\u2026other things we think make us happy are actually just ways of getting more family and friends.\u201d Increase your social interactions, especially with the ones you love. And when you volunteer, remember, spending time on others is just as valuable as money.\n\n**4.** **Be Yourself**\n\n* If there\u2019s one thing to start doing today, it\u2019s being yourself. Living a life that shows exactly who you are is the fastest way to happiness. If you\u2019re wearing someone else\u2019s shoes, take them off and put yours on.\n\n**5.** **Be Powerful**\n\n* Here is your reason to start making changes: happiness is linked to productivity. True happiness can only be attained when you work for your passions and goals. Sure, we may all learn from reading, but to put something into practice \u2026 that is where real power comes from. Start today!\n\n# We want to be \u2013 so desperately \u2013 happy with ourselves because we are unique \u2026 we are free \u2026 and we are powerful.
