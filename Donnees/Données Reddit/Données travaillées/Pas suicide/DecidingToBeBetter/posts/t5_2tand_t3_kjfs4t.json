I\u2019m talking about household debt. The dishwasher ran but hasn\u2019t been emptied. The trash needs to be taken out but sits there. I found that when I accrue household chore debt it spirals into a negative feedback loop. Conversely, small debt payments lead to a virtuous circle of cleanliness.\n\nWhen there is a chore, particularly a one minute chore the time always is now to get it done. Don\u2019t wait and fall prey to household debt like I have!\n\nIt\u2019s a small change, and one I hope to maintain throughout 2021 and beyond.\n\nCheers to progress \ud83e\udd42", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kjfs4t/no_more_debt_not_the_kind_you_think/", "title": "No more debt (not the kind you think)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "rifleman209", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 32, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1608817966, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kjfs4t/no_more_debt_not_the_kind_you_think/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435912.6330059, "replies_charged": false}
