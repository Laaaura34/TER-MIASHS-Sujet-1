I developed a lot of doubts and insecurities about myself, after a year of therapy and lots of support I finally said fuck it and put all that behind me to look for a job . I landed an awesome position that pays pretty well hahahaha . I came to this subreddit to read about other people deciding to do better and all the advice really helped out. Thank you to everyone in this community for helping me through this time . I\u2019m ready to start my life and be the person I want to be!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of563p/finally_got_a_job/", "title": "Finally got a job!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "sailor_pp", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 659, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625608902, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of563p/finally_got_a_job/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436125.0667849, "replies_charged": false}
