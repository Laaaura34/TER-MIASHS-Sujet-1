I\u2019m not going to go into all my issues but basically life had me on my knees crying out to God for the past year.\n\nI\u2019m 25, I just finished college ( looking for a career job now ) , I\u2019m training for a marathon and triathlon, I love yoga, and I want to get into Jiu Jitsu. But during these hard times last year I cut off all my friends who I felt were holding me back from being who I wanted to be. These friends didn\u2019t go to college, talked down on others, and had very high egos. \n\nThe past year has been rough because my older brother who still lives at home is battling with a pill addiction for 10 years now, my family vibe isn\u2019t as great as it use to be, but I\u2019m still holding on and trying to pursue my goals in life. I know some people have it much worse, and come out stronger in the end. Why is it that some people can overcome very very hard things ? But my issues are well more less than there\u2019s and I\u2019m struggling with it so much ? What am I doing wrong?\n\nBasically my question is this, I\u2019ve been feeling super lonely while chasing my goals. I don\u2019t want to go out to parties, I feel like I just don\u2019t want to hangout with people who aren\u2019t pursuing to better themselves in life.  What do I do ?? Any advice to get me out of this lonely feeling ? Am I being too soft ?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jevhsu/overcoming_loneliness/", "title": "Overcoming loneliness?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "_justbreathe__", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1603218549, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jevhsu/overcoming_loneliness/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438268.4148226, "replies_charged": false}
