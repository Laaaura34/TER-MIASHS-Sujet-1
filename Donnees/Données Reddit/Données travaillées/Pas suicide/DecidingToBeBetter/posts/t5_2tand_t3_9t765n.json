Please share yours thoughts. Please do not make standard jokes on Procrastination. Help me to solve it. \n\n I am procrastinator. I have been taking Small steps to correct my behavior. One very common problem I see in myself that whenever I acheive something (most likely Small steps) I get complacent. It goes beyond procrastination- been like part of me. \n\nFor example- I had stopped smoking then started vaping from 24mg to went to 0 mg in six month. Then about a month of no vaping. I told my friends I stopped vaping then in next two days 3 days I find myself smoking again. Then moved to 6mg vaping and still at 6mg.\n\nExample #2- I did workout for a about one and half month. Then again talked to my friends that I have consistent for 6 days a week for about one and half month workout. And suddenly from last two weeks just went for workout one day. \n\nIt's like I want to share my joy of acheivement but as soon as I do, I become complacent.\n\nThere are many examples, workwise and everything. \n\nHelp me to understand and solve it.
