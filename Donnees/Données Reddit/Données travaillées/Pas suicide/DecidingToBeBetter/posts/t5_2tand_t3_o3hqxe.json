Wife cheated on me and so we decided to split after this pandemic. I try to see it as a new start but it\u2019s been hard. \n\nHowever.\nI\u2019ve been able to stay sober. \nI\u2019ve been able to stay in shape. So.\nAs a first step to get out of this dip, I decided to take two weeks off in August and go for a trip. Alone. But not to a lonely place. I need to meet new people, not go on a spiritual journey.\n\nI signed up to a bunch of group activities to force me out of the hotel room, and Im worried that I\u2019ll be the weird single guy in an ocean of happy couples but then again, being the single guy in an ocean of other singles would be weird too.\n\nI see this trip as a way to experience new things. Wish me luck!\n\nEdit: logged back on today and was very touched by the kind supportive comments. My anxiety is slowly being replaced by excitement.
