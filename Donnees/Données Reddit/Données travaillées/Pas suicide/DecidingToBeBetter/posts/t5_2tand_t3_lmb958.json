In my early 20's, I knew immediately lifestyle changes were going to be a must if I wanted to continue doing the activities I love, things like Weight Lifting and Surfing were put aside as I felt forced to focus on my healing. I tried everything under the sun and the only one that Ive benefited from at all is Foundation Training. I began with simple youtube tutorials and worked through a 30 day challenge, that was 5 years ago and in 2019 I received my Instructor Certification.\n\nI am offering one month of free coaching from me, where we develop the Mind & Body, through Foundation Training, Decompression Breathing, and Self Actualization. All I ask is that you come with an open mind and a willingness to commit in your life transformation!\n\nIf you are interested comment below or message me,\n\nCheers!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lmb958/freedom_seekers/", "title": "Freedom Seekers!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "breathemovelive", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613614659, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lmb958/freedom_seekers/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435920.4790184, "replies_charged": false}
