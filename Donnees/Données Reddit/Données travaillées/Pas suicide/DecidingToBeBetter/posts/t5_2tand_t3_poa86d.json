Once I used to find myself researching, reading about various subjects, but in recent years it is so rare, except some fields that I've been interested in for some time. There are few regular tabs everytime I open my browser, and I don't go outside to explore. I'm afraid this has made me stale. Consuming the same or just a little bir different content everyday, under the same titles, them being memes, video games etc. I think I need to go beyond those. \n\nAlso I think for inspiration to occur we need to become exposed to many different things, so they push us to think. Unfortunately I find myself lacking in that. Other than introspection I can't see when was the last time I had to sit and think throughly about something. It's almost as if I'm drugged.\n\nWhen we're stuck to our old ways, I don't think creativity or inspiration will ever stop by. So much knowledge exists on the internet, so many new things to explore, but I don't even sail beyond the coasts.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this? I want to use the internet better, I want to find some inspiration, some novelty as I'm stuck.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/poa86d/internet_use_inspiration_and_creativity/", "title": "Internet use, inspiration and creativity", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Kvkkz", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631649199, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/poa86d/internet_use_inspiration_and_creativity/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435994.903678, "replies_charged": false}
