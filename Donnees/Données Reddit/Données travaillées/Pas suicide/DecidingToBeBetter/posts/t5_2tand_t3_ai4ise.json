Remembering that you deserve better, and that feeling bad for the moment is whats going to make you better in the long run.\nThe point im trying to get across is that you should really reflect on your long term goals and give them time. If you dont have any long term goals start planning ahead, living without a direction is just wandering, and that\u2019s when we get lost. \nAll we can do today is to plant the seeds of tomorrow, and the only thing that will make the seeds sprout is time and consistency. \nIf you get down, get back up. If you feel low, stay low until youre back up. We all do mistakes, but learn to forgive yourself so that in the long term, you keep moving forward.\nMake sure you prioritize yourself and your goals above all else, because if you don\u2019t no one is gonna do that for you.\nNothing in life is permanent, people die everyday, and in the grand scheme of things, even the biggest event in your life is barely a drop in the ocean.\n\nRemind yourself of your long term goals even during hard times, because you deserve whats best for you.\n\nEDIT: im overwhelmed with the messages and responses, im glad that atleast someone got  something out of my post. I wish you the best luck in life no matter who you are or what your situation is, you got this.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ai4ise/you_deserve_the_life_youve_always_wanted/", "title": "You deserve the life you\u2019ve always wanted", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LowVoltur", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 974, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1548031582, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ai4ise/you_deserve_the_life_youve_always_wanted/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438145.5807579, "replies_charged": false}
