It manifests itself mainly in a form of world-weariness in which I consider practically all people to be idiots who are too stupid to see what is good for them. So, in the face of progressive imbalance between rich and poor, exploitation of the third world, climate crisis, discrimination against women, they still fall for some hucksters and populist brutes, let themselves be divided and so on.   \nRealistically I'm not much better than that. If you were to look at my lifestyle from the outside, you wouldn't see any difference from anyone else's, except perhaps a slightly less blatant consumerist lifestyle and a focus on organic food or second-hand articles.  But yeah its not like I am Mother Theresa and are working hard on improving anyones life.\n\nI already work a lot with mindfulness and meditation, for example, to counteract this, but it hasn't really helped so far. Does anyone else have similar thoughts and something that helps them?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oerrc5/how_do_i_lose_my_high_opinion_of_myself_it_only/", "title": "How do I lose my high opinion of myself?
