Shortly after graduated, I got laid off from my first job after 4 months. Luckily I found another job shorty, but got laid off again 8 months. I been laid off twice within a year of graduated and been told from the CTO of my previous company that i lack the technical competence to be a engineer. I fell into a deep depressed and tried to kill myself. Fortunately, I failed at killing myself. Since then, I gain a lot of weight and turned into alcohol. I gained 30 pounds and I feel like shit! Starting tomorrow I will start getting myself back into shape and start becoming more competent as a Engineer.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m4oazh/getting_my_life_back_on_track/", "title": "Getting my life back on track", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "uBoscuBo", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615697734, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m4oazh/getting_my_life_back_on_track/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436625.7041354, "replies_charged": false}
