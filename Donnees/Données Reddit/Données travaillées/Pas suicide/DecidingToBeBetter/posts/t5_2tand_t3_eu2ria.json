My goal is to get used to not drinking soda and restart excerising. With the over all goal to lose weight. I am currently overweight, weighing about 230 pounds. \n\nThis coming Monday will the first time in months since I used gym equipment. \nI'll repost once I lose 5 pounds. \n\nGoodluck to everyone else on your own goals.\n\n\nEdit: I mean two not take.\n\n\nEdit 2: Thank you everyone for the support. Also the reason I don't drink diet soda is because it taste terrible, plus it's not even any better then regular soda.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eu2ria/2_days_without_soda_and_4_days_of_at_least_take/", "title": "2 days without soda and 4 days of at least take hours of walking a day.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "RLDirewolf", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 604, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1580016940, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eu2ria/2_days_without_soda_and_4_days_of_at_least_take/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438248.5028229, "replies_charged": false}
