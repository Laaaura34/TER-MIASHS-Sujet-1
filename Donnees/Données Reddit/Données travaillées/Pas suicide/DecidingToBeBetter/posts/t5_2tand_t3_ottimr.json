Problem is, I am battling constant depression, anxiety, validation seeking, while being overworked and trying to do some physical work-out whenever possible, which, at the end of the day, leaves me incredibly tired. I am a barely functional being most of the time, and this is the reason I want to just switch careers (I am looking towards army, or battlefield medic...or to join the French Foreign Legion, and burn whatever I have 'built' so far, start a new life...the ideal situation), but in order to do that, I need some brain adjustments. I don't know whether a therapist or a life coach would help me readjust my brain/mindset. I do have a feeling that with a life coach, I'll pay a lot of money just to hear something copy-pasted from nearly all motivational videos on YouTube. \n\nAny ideas in this regard ?\nThanks in advance !", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ottimr/life_coach_vs_therapyst/", "title": "Life coach Vs therapyst", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "no_good_surgeon", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 15, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627547654, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ottimr/life_coach_vs_therapyst/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435084.0452678, "replies_charged": false}
