A bettering path; a path to be a better person and human being and I haven\u2019t hurt myself. It\u2019s not as mighty sounding as being able to say \u201cI haven\u2019t cut at all this year\u201d but I\u2019ve been self harming off and on with only weeks spread out at time before I end up relapsing, for 4 years. This is the first time I haven\u2019t cut myself for months on end and it feels so good.\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t expect so much love and congratulations(awards even?) from so many people. I will save this post and look at it whenever I have an urge and remind myself the of the random love I received today for only doing half a year. I thought that it was just the start of great feats to come,  but you guys make me feel so much stronger that I give myself credit for. I feel like I actually conquered a lot in half a year. I spent the day eating take out twice and watching my favorite shows. I did yoga and medicated twice. I\u2019ve been smiling from day start to day end.
