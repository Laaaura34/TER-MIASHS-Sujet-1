But last Saturday, I had an experience that was... kinda strange.\n\nMy brother-in-law and his fianc\u00e9e wanted to go to a sauna, my husband and I tagged along. I felt so uncomfortable I wanted to cry. I felt so ugly and it didn't even help that my husband patted my back and told me how beautiful I was.\n\nWhen we went to the sauna's swimming pool, I felt a lot better (don't know why). When we were home again, I thought: I want to improve my self-esteem.
