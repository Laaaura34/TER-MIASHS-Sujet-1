I\u2019m overweight, I haven\u2019t finished my degree, and I have never had a real relationship. Basically I have squandered a pretty privileged background and feel like I\u2019m fast approaching rock bottom. Despite several years of \u201ctaking action\u201d nothing has fundamentally changed.\n\nBut, for whatever reason something in my brain has clicked and I\u2019ve been doing some serious thinking the last few days.

It\u2019s gonna be a grind but mentally things honestly feel different compared to my previous attempts. Besides I\u2019ve got the time, 1000 days is long enough for even the smallest steps to kick in.\n\nGoing to keep the goals I have made to myself for now but I am going to commit to posting an update in a few months.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qh8e5y/starting_my_1000_day_project/", "title": "Starting my 1000 day project", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Another_Go_Then", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 15, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635373884, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qh8e5y/starting_my_1000_day_project/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437840.4610236, "replies_charged": false}
