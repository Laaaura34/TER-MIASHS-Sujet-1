I've attempted suicide and been saved by medical professionals. I've been diagnosed bipolar with severe depression. I have buried my head and my feelings with prescription and street drugs. I've watched my kids grow up through a fog. I have sabotaged relationships with people I love. Sabotaged careers. Sabotaged my life. \nI recently \"hit my rock bottom\". I got clean, but didn't feel at all serene. I had so much pain that I have never truly felt. So much guilt and shame that I cloaked myself in.\nI've really had an awakening. Working my steps in a 12 step program. Listening to some life changing podcasts. Reading some amazing books that is seems were written for me. I feel alive for the first time since I was a little kid. I feel reborn. Today is a new day and it is a gift. I've been leaking tears for two days now. It feels good. Not warm and fuzzy good. I still have pain and sadness in my life right now.  I'm grateful for it. It feels so freeing to let go of the past. To forgive myself and others. I don't know what the future holds for me. I'm ok with that as well. I want to be a better person today. I want to be a man I'm proud of. A partner and a dad I can be proud of. I am making that happen! \nFor the first time i can remember I am present in this moment and I am alive!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lc3jgb/rip_van_winkle_has_woken_up/", "title": "Rip Van Winkle has woken up", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "defeatismine", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1612400710, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lc3jgb/rip_van_winkle_has_woken_up/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436887.9966848, "replies_charged": false}
