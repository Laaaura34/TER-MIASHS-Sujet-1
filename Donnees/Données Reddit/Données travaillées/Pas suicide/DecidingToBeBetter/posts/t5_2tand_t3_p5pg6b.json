Through that fear, I kinda distance myself so that I don\u2019t get hurt\u2026 like a freaking animal shelter rescue dog or something.\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve learned that the more I focus on these fears, the more it kinda manifests into reality and becomes self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nSo, I want to do better in that part of my life. Trusting someone, trusting myself, letting go of the fears, etc\u2026\n\nI feel as though if I don\u2019t get this down, I will lose a lot of beautiful relationships with people that I genuinely care about.\n\nAny tips would be very much appreciated.
