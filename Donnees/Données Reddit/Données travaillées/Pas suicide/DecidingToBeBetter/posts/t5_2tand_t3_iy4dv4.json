Had a huge wake up call the first couple of weeks of the semester, and while my grades aren\u2019t perfect, I feel like I am relearning how to learn, if that makes any sense. I am so passionate about this subject (electrical engineering) and finally feel like some sort of \u201cswitch\u201d has gone off in my brain where I\u2019ve gone from wanting to do the bare minimum for myself and my life and in my coursework to actively trying to better myself. \n\nThis past weekend I spent probably 30-40 hours studying differential equations for a test today which I honest to god feel like I actually did okay on. This after giving up on differential equations two years ago because it seemed too hard. I almost cried sitting there looking at differential equations, and seeing how it can be used to model circuits for electrical engineering. I haven\u2019t been so interested in something since high school physics. \n\nMy depression has largely cleared up. I still have very bad anxiety and some intrusive thoughts, but I\u2019m working to manage those too. I realize now the anxiety will always be with me, and it\u2019s useless to try and fight it and make it go away. So now, I\u2019m trying to accept it in my head while sitting with it until it passes. It is really hard, but at least I\u2019m trying. \n\nTo get to the title of this post, I actually somehow managed to land an interview in a few days for a summer internship after taking the initiative to put my resume together and go to my uni\u2019s engineering job fair a couple days ago. I will actually be interviewing for a position with a large semiconductor processing company. \n\nWhile it might not seem like much, I feel like I\u2019m finally taking (baby) steps in the right direction. Perhaps the best part is, I realized while writing this that I hadn\u2019t thought of my ex girlfriend who destroyed my mental health in probably three or four days. \n\nIt may seem ridiculous, but it\u2019s not too late to take that step. I might not be making perfect grades, but I have found something I am willing to work 13-14 hours a day on. Nothing will stop me now I hope. I am at least extremely motivated. \n\nFor anyone who feels stuck, take an honest look at your life and ask what can change and if there are any steps you can take. If I can do it, you can too, I promise. For me, the first step was looking back and realizing that I used to love math and physics. Then, it was, well, I actually really like programming too. That turned into circuits and digital systems, and suddenly, I don\u2019t feel as bad about myself as before. \n\nI don\u2019t know what your process will look like, but I hope that it brings nothing but joy and success to your life. \n\nTLDR: two months ago I felt like a complete loser. In a few days I have an internship with a major company in a field that I love. If I take these steps, you can too, I promise :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iy4dv4/posted_on_here_two_or_three_months_ago_that_i_was/", "title": "Posted on here two or three months ago that I was going to try to be better.
