However after my break up, the only good thing I did was focus on my career and I'm in its last stage of completion. \n\nBut I drank (a lot), I smoked, never took care of my myself. Completely lost my looks, my charm, my confidence and the only good thing in my life was my career and alcohol (which was not) \nToday I met my ex accidentally when I was out. She looked great with her boyfriend. It broke me. \n\nIt broke me not because I still want her. But about how I took my time for granted. Looking at her was a slap in my face about how I let myself go during all these years. I simply forgot how to enjoy my life using the path of exercise, being healthy, meeting people, being happy feeling good about myself. But rather choose the evil path or addictions and laziness. Even now typing this I feel like complete shit. \n\nI make a promise to you all I'm getting off my addictions this instant. I know I will be financially secured in a few months, but I will gain my life back instead of feeling sorry for myself. I will make an update here in the next six months.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j0ocnw/this_story_may_give_you_a_lesson/", "title": "This story may give you a lesson.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Modern_monkcharlie", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1818, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1601199316, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j0ocnw/this_story_may_give_you_a_lesson/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435816.5596392, "replies_charged": false}
