Now living as an expatriate working in the United Arab Emirates for 6 years. Broken Family at the age of 10. Broken Family again at the age of 28 (Father's 2nd Marriage failed once again yep, just recently). Eldest among 5 boys, Heterosexual, Single (but currently in a  very healthy relationship), Graduated Major in Psychology but worked completely unrelated to the college major taken (now working setting up offshore and onshore companies). \n\nOutlets: Music, Video Game, Relationships. Personality as per Myers Briggs - I actually forgot what specifically but I love knowing more from different people, maybe that makes me extroverted?\n\nLifestyle (current): Wake Up-Cook-Work at Home-Eat Lunch (While Watching Community)-Resume Work at Home-Play Video Games / Play Music - Eat Dinner - Sleep - Repeat\n\nGoal: I just want to become a better human being. I miss the good ol jolly and optimistic me. I seem to have lost it after I got fired in my previous job. I recall having my previous boss calling me, too jolly yet too naive, that's why people don't want to work with me anymore. I lost my job in the same year. Now I'm working with the most hated person (the one who hurt my father) because I need work to live.\n\nHelp...
