I know a lot of us train to max out but wanted to share that a small jog is still beneficial and it doesn\u2019t have to be stop-max out each time.\n\nHere are some thoughts: \n\n- Motivation is like an energy we pump hard to give us that boost to push through targets. \n\n- Being active is not a short term goal but a life long lifestyle. It doesn\u2019t have to be stop or max-out at every session. \n\n- A candle wont last long when you burn at both ends.\n\n- You can afford the lighter session once in a while to change the rhythm and to let the mind relax a bit.
