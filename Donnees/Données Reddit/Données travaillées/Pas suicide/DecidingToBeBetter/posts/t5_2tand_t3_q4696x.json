I have autism, OCD, and probably depression. I also suffer with low confidence in many different areas such as my art skills and my ability to do other things. \n\nI'm currently 24 stone 2 pounds (338 lbs). I've been seeking help for a very long time for my obesity as I'm not sure if it's me being lazy or if it's an eating disorder like binge eating disorder. I emailed someone in London and they told me to get my local mental health team to give them a call. So, hopefully on Monday I will speak to my psychologist and he'll refer me to an eating disorder service in London! I'm no getting my hopes up completely, but I will try my best.\n\nAt my highest weight I was 25-stone (350 lbs), but my eardrum burst about a week ago and I lost a load of weight because I felt so nauseous.\n\nNext September  if my weight goes down and my mental health improves, I'll be going to college and then university! I'm only 22-years old, but I still would love to chase my dreams, even if I do fail. I enjoy drawing comics and cartoons.\n\nThank you reading.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4696x/im_morbidly_obese_this_time_next_year_i_hope_to/", "title": "I'm morbidly obese - this time next year I hope to be obese or less!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Beating-Hearts", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 402, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633725367, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4696x/im_morbidly_obese_this_time_next_year_i_hope_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436949.8809369, "replies_charged": false}
