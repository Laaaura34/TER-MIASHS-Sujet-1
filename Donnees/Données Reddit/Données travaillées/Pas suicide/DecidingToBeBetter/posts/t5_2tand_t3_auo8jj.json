I was lost in life with friends that I didn\u2019t feel anything genuine about let alone most things in life. After my experience with LSD, I had a huge realization that most of the things I was doing was for the sake of other people. I came to this college because someone said I should and I said why not. I make loose friendships just to have friends. I care too much about what other people think of me and this rush of realizing that I barely do anything for myself opened my eyes in a way they never have. I\u2019m trying to develop wants and passions but I have no clue what I want. Does anyone have advice for self development?
