I feel stuck in a boring routine where I wake up early, get ready for work, go to work and then come back, make dinner and sleep. I do go to the gym and go to dance every week but it's not enough. I want to feel more fulfilled, perhaps be engaged and motivated in a project or something but I don't know what. Any ideas of what to do?
