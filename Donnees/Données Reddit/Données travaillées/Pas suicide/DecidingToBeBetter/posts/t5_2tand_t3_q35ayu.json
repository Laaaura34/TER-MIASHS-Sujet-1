From little things like brushing my teeth, washing my face/hair to bigger things like making an appointment with the dmv to get new registration or to go to the eye doctor to pick up my contacts that just came in, unpack boxes from moving into an apartment six months ago.... \n\nIt's like I constantly have a huge list of things I should be doing in my head and it stresses me out so I just...ignore all of it.\n\nI'm just looking for some advice on how to be an adult and freaking get things done.\nAny advice would be appreciated. Or someone just saying that I'm not the only one struggling with this. Cause the people in my life seem to have their crap together and I don't know why it's so hard for me to do simple tasks like clean a couple of dishes that can't be run through the dishwasher.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q35ayu/i_suck_at_being_an_adult_please_help/", "title": "I suck at being an adult, please help", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Trapped-in-irony", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 196, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633598810, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q35ayu/i_suck_at_being_an_adult_please_help/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436952.182645, "replies_charged": false}
