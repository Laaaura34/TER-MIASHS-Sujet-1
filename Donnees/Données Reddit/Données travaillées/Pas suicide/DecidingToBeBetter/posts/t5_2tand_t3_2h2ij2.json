I do gymnastics (stretching, bends and some other exercises) and it really helps a lot. Gradually I find some nice and simple ways to improve my posture:\n\n* Stretching as already said, it helps to ease tension and to feel all your joints, muscles and their natural position;\n\n* To find the best position of your shoulders lift them as high as you can and pull them down vertically (hope it's understandable) - that's the place they are meant to be in;\n\n* There are lot of mucles that are meant to hold your spine straight - just remember about them and use them!\n\n* Barbell exercises turned out to give a very pleasant feeling in the shoulders, meaning that they don't bother me as if they are somehow incorrectly placed (otherwise it happens quite often).\n\nAny additions?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/2h2ij2/whats_your_secret_of_good_posture/", "title": "What's your secret of good posture?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "myhtcexplorer", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 31, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1411336377, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/2h2ij2/whats_your_secret_of_good_posture/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437723.2575097, "replies_charged": false}
