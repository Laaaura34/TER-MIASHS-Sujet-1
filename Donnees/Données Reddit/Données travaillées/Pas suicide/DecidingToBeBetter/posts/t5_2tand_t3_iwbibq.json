I used to play DOTA since i was in 2nd grade im incoming freshman college right now and one day i just woke up not feeling to play. Like even any kind of game i just dont feel doing them, then suddenly i picked up a book tried to read it didnt know that 1hr already passed and i enjoyed reading a book called think and grow rich already finished it and im consistently reading more books. I also do to do lists on my whiteboard which gives me a sense of accomplishment and makes me feel proud :D. Now whenever im bored i try to study mathematics, its my weakest subject and i want to be an engineer i guess? its kinda funny because i dont know what i want in life well maybe i do know which is to be real rich and help the less privileged but i dont know what course i really should take. and yes i do enjoy math but i really suck at it thats why im trying to study them and yes i sometimes get lazy but this is better than just playing dota the whole day and thats it and also I started running tho i also lift weights. ANYWAYS I HOPE Y'ALL HAVE A GOOD DAY / NIGHT ALL LOVE\n\ni think this was long XD", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iwbibq/suddenly_stopped_my_gaming_addiction/", "title": "Suddenly stopped my gaming addiction", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "calmedbeast", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1600597622, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iwbibq/suddenly_stopped_my_gaming_addiction/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437851.4739676, "replies_charged": false}
