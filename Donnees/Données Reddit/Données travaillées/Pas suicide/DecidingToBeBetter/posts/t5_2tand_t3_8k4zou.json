but it get more complicated...\n\ni live in the center of state, the most expensive area in the countrey. a small, fair one person apartment usually cost around 700$ a month and higher \\(somtimes the bills are included somtimes they are not\\) .\n\ni have my own expenses. i pay about 200$ for weed and 35$ for tobbaco. i try to lower those expenses, but its very hard to lower my smoking habbits when in such hard times... when ill finally be able to be relaxed for the long term i believe it wont be so difficult to lower those expenses to minimum. i need to buy food \\(150$\\) i go out somtimes \\(80$\\) and somtimes i buy stuff \\(100$\\). those are all just estimations, and converted to $ from my state corenncy so not very accurate... but to some up, the max expenses are seems to be around 1261$.\n\nmy parents agreed to help with extra 280$. witch gives me around 1370$ a month.\n\ni wat to move out, but still to be able save some money... and because of my disability, even if ill do finally find a good job for me, i still dont want to count on that. i want to be able to hold my head above water even in harder months that ill have no job.\n\nas far as job concerned, i lookng for one every day. im a resourceful person and have a lot to offer, but i also ave depression, panic attacks and pysical dissabiity and cronical pain. so its easy to understand. the job market isnt realy looking for me.\n\nim looking mostly for a job from home for a week now. there were some that called back, and i have a job interview next week. at least it seems that with enough investment, i can find somthing decant from my home.\n\nas far as moving conserend... im in a bit of a loop...\n\nmy parents giving me shit all day, but when i want to go a head and finaly do somthing about that, they telling me that ill lose all my money, that i wont be able to maintain the contract, the the debt will fall on them and ill back to theres house in a worst shape that i am now.\n\nwhen i ask wtf do they reccomend to do, they say ''get a job''. well heres the thing... getting a job and working for few months, may cool them away,and may give me more financal confidence. but with all this shit on my head, its may be much harder to focus on job right now, before moving and finally having my freedom... i also gonna need to narrow the apartment search are to the job area, and as more central it is the more expensive the apartment get...\n\nso...\n\nTLDR\n\nim a handicap. suffering from both pysical pain and depression and panic attacks.\n\ni have some money. i want to move out. but family treating me like shit and lowering my\n\nconfidence. i have no friend and feel lonely, and want to move to my own place, and start to get to know new\n\npeople. its very difficult to me to find a job, because my disabilties, i keep trying as hard as i can, but afraid to not hold up.\n\nthank you all very much for reading this.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8k4zou/im_lonely_i_have_no_help_from_the_family_i_have/", "title": "i'm lonely. i have no help from the family, i have no friends, and i struggle getting a job and moving to a new apartment [22M]", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "michaelovsky5", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1526569942, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8k4zou/im_lonely_i_have_no_help_from_the_family_i_have/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437870.1134262, "replies_charged": false}
