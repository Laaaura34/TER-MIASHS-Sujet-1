I didn't think it would be that bad for me, but the smell and the constant hassle of buying them and sometimes your lighter would be empty and your mood is ruined because you couldn't light a cigarette and all that stuff began to annoy me. \nThen I had jaw surgery on a Wednesday and my pack was empty the Friday before that. So I stopped. And I don't miss it, I really really don't.\nI'm glad that I can wear lipstick without worrying to smudge it and to smell good all the time too. I think I'm doing really well :)\n\nIt's not much, but the fact that I care enough about my health and myself in general is really new to me, so it's a big step for me. \n\nThank you for reading :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mdui8r/21_days_cigarette_free/", "title": "21 days cigarette free :)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "paintedthief", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 68, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616781752, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mdui8r/21_days_cigarette_free/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436157.4544783, "replies_charged": false}
