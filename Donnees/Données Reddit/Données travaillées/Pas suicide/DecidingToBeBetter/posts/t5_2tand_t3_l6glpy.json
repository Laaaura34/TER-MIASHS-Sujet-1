So this year I have a goal to be sober from weed. I\u2019ve been smoking since I was 16yrs old. I\u2019m not 23yrs. I just started a business and I feel like weed is really slowing down my growth. There are many reasons why I believe it would be beneficial for me to not smoke weed. I feel like I behave and think much better when I\u2019m sober. I\u2019m more active and ambitious when I don\u2019t smoke. Also, I\u2019m more focused and tend to be able to wake up earlier and easier when I don\u2019t smoke. The past couple weeks have been tough. So far the longest streak I\u2019ve had has been a week. When quitting, I get a sense of anxiety and depression during the first couple days. I really want to sober up for 90days or more. Ideally half of a year. My biggest challenge has been based on my surroundings. Everyone I know smokes weed so when they invite me it\u2019s has to pass on. I smoked yesterday after a 3day break. I plan on going on another streak. This time I want to do 2weeks. I won\u2019t like my surroundings dictate my choices. Starting today I\u2019ll be going strong for 2weeks or more(90days). Will keep you guys posted. I\u2019m glad I found this group!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l6glpy/i_want_to_quit_smoking_weed/", "title": "I want to Quit smoking weed", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Lifeis2confusing", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 21, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1611787471, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l6glpy/i_want_to_quit_smoking_weed/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435453.5196004, "replies_charged": false}
