When I have a day alone, I often don\u2019t know what to do with myself. Sometimes I end up doing the things I love with friends, but alone, such as hiking and exploring new places. But it never feels the same\u2026 it reminds me of a quote from Into The Wild: \u201chappiness is only real when shared with other people\u201d. \n\nI don\u2019t want this to be the case. I understand that I\u2019m slightly more extroverted, but I would love to feel true inner-peace with myself. I can tolerate a morning or evening alone - listening to music, reading, taking walks with a podcast, drinking coffee, appreciating nature. But never much longer. I have great ambitions in my life, to travel the world, welcome new experiences. But I don\u2019t want to rely on other people to accomplish these. Can I train myself to enjoy my own company, or will I always long for others to be with me?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o89ypg/how_do_i_learn_to_find_enjoyment_from_my_own/", "title": "How do I learn to find enjoyment from my own company?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "PolymerLilac", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624710946, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o89ypg/how_do_i_learn_to_find_enjoyment_from_my_own/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438332.9432952, "replies_charged": false}
