I just realized that drinking had become too easy and regular... work, get home, drink and repeat.  I had to change that routine.   I've tried limiting my intake but always would cave on the weekends. Not this time.\n\nThis is the first full week without having alcohol in a very long time for me. \n\nI feel great. \n \n\nEDIT: \nThank you all for the amazing love, care and support. It's so encouraging and powerful.   It definitely helps hearing from others. :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p9yf2k/went_a_whole_7_days_without_drinking/", "title": "Went a whole 7 days without drinking..", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MilkyView", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 656, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1629720249, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p9yf2k/went_a_whole_7_days_without_drinking/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436117.5150664, "replies_charged": false}
