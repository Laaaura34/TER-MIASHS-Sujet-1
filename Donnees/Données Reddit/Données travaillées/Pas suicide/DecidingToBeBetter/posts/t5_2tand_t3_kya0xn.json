I feel like I have wasted my life playing Videogames and wish I had of spent that time doing other things.\n\nI have been going through a existential crisis, worrying it might be too late and dwelling on lost, wasted time. My biggest regret is all those years gaming, I wish I had of gotten into other things like Photography and writing. When I was 19 I got into screenwriting and started writing scripts and at 22 I got into photography. Thing is years later I find that I am still really mediocre at both of those things and I see people that are young and better than me doing better work and I worry it might be too late.\n\nDuring my teenage years I also tried getting into Boxing, Judo and MMA but was awful at all three and stopped doing them. I have also stopped gaming, started r/stopgaming in 2019, almost want a whole year until Resident Evil 3 came out.\n\nBut yeah, TLDR: close to 26 years old and feel I\u2019m too old to get great at anything.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kya0xn/is_it_too_late_to_master_a_skilltalent_at_26/", "title": "Is it too late to Master a Skill/Talent at 26 years old", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "VisualPersona95", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1610764344, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kya0xn/is_it_too_late_to_master_a_skilltalent_at_26/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438188.6865563, "replies_charged": false}
