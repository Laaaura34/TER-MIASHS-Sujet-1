Currently just signed up for a 24hr membership and invested in a workout program for Olympic lifting. It\u2019s a 4 week beginner program. The gym and the beach are my happy places but motivation for going to the gym has been at a all time low. One thing I need to work on is consistency and organizing my workout. I go by myself so I tend to be a little easier on myself. I wish I had someone to go with so we could push each other. \n\nMy goals are to be more explosive, gain strength and balance. I\u2019m hoping with small goals and an actual program to follow I\u2019ll be more consistent. I\u2019ll post pics of progression beginning of each week just to keep track. This is me wanting to be better mentally and physically. Lifting and cardio is truly a mental game and I\u2019ve been losing that battle. I haven\u2019t felt good about myself, my self esteem and confidence have taken a toll from it. I\u2019ll take any advice or tips you guys have on staying consistent and organizing.
