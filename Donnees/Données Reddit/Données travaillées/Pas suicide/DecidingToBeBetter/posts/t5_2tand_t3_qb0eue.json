We are currently getting by ok. I work at Proctor and Gamble and make decent money ($21 hourly). I feel like given life circumstances this is a cap out for me with no additional career advancements. I know I can do more with myself. The problem is that I rent and moving with family is not a viable option. I live in walking distance to a college. Our incomes scrape by with a little extra cash. What is the best options to leave my current job and still maintain my living situation? I\u2019m not looking to live fancy while in school I just want to live in my same house while pursuing education. I want to fast track and dedicate as much time as possible into school to get it done. Are there scholarships for this? Loans? How will I maintain life? Looking for a degree in engineering by the way. I think it will be pretty fair for job opportunities.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qb0eue/is_quitting_my_job_to_attend_school_a_good_idea/", "title": "Is quitting my job to attend school a good idea?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Bootscootandboogey", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634605291, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qb0eue/is_quitting_my_job_to_attend_school_a_good_idea/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435069.1924121, "replies_charged": false}
