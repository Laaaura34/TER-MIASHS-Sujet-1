My social life was flourishing. Then, in december, the 2nd lockdown came and the gym closed, and i got into one of the worst depressive episodes of my life. I didnt exercise for 6 months straight, slept all day long, didnt eat, and i lost a lot of friends. Now the gym is open again, but all of my progress is gone (i got very skinny-fat visibly, lost a lot of muscle mass, and my strength and endurance are a joke) and i struggle with really bad social anxiety. I want to go back to how i was a year ago, but i honestly feel overwhelmed and dont know where to start. I also dont have a long term goal or motivation.\nAny tips on how to get started again and motivational ideas? (Documentaries, videos and books are welcome!)
