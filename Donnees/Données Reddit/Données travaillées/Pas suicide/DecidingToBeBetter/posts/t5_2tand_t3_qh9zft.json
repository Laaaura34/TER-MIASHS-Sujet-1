Somehow managed to get rid of all the bad habits I ever had without even noticing it, and now I just want to brag a bit because I\u2019m feeling very proud. \n\nQuit drinking alcohol at the beginning of 2019 after a terrible intoxication and hangover (never felt shittier in my entire life), then in the middle of 2020 quit consuming sugar and sweets in general (except for honey when sick and random chocolates when PMSing hard), and 20 days ago got bored with cigarettes and quit smoking after 10 years of doing it non-stop. Zero cravings, zero thoughts of getting back, and honestly zero stress about quitting. It feels like I just came back to my true self and I feel more alive than ever. \n\nI want to wish everyone on this sub good luck with whatever you try to accomplish.
