Immediately, I lost control at the sight of two grown people swearing and abusing my partner and called them out on it. I yelled at them for swearing at her and aggressively said that we were trying to help. Male dog owner got right in my face and continued screaming and yelling at me, so my reaction was to push him away and tell him not to speak to my partner like that.  \n\nAnother neighbour got between us (after German shepherd had run off) while we argued and it got a little physical. He tried kicking me, I pushed him away as he was in my face screaming. \nNow, I\u2019m 26 and strong, and he\u2019s potentially mid 50s and quite skinny. If it escalated, it would not have ended well for him physically, and it would not have ended well for me and my future. \n\nI understand that this is a highly charged situation and people tend to act irrationally. On both our parts, it wasn\u2019t handled well. I hate that it resulted in physical push and shove and I\u2019m so grateful it did not escalate. \n\nI have always been ready to get involved in confrontation if I don\u2019t feel something is justified, but this could be detrimental to my career. I have just accepted an offer in my dream career as a paramedic. After working so hard, I finally made it and I would hate for my job to be taken away because I couldn\u2019t control myself. \nI am fully aware that I will frequently find myself in situations like this during my career. So I\u2019m asking for any advice or help I can get on how to manage charged and stressful situations like this. \nTia", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/no76cg/need_to_maintain_control_so_i_dont_lose_my_dream/", "title": "Need to maintain control so I don\u2019t lose my dream career", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "11snake_eyes11", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622365177, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/no76cg/need_to_maintain_control_so_i_dont_lose_my_dream/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435790.9260423, "replies_charged": false}
