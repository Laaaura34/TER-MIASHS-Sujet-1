I\u2019ve let myself down so many times in the past, but I have to do better than this. This is not who I am. I am not a failure.\n\nI started smoking at around 21. Initially for fun, then a coping mechanism to suppress feelings and  eventually turned in to a habit to cure boredom & loneliness over the years. I\u2019ve probably spent the last 10 years stoned, I\u2019d guess I\u2019ve had approximately 2-3 months (if that) during that time I didn\u2019t smoke. Not to mention the money I have spent, sheesh..\n\nI need to make a change now, I should not have to cure boredom, combat loneliness or suppress thoughts & feelings this way. By my own standard, it\u2019s not acceptable to live my life this way and I want to do better. I need to be better.\n\nThis is day 2 of choosing to be in control. \n\nThis is day 2 of resetting my mind. \n\nThis is day 2 of deciding to do better.\n\nThis is day 2 of the rest of my life.\n\nThis is no walk in the park, I\u2019m just thankful it\u2019s not physical. I wish anybody starting any new journeys all the best.
