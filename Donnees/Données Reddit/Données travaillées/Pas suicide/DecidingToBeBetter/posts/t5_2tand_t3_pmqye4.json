Has anyone done something similar? Any tips on how to do it? Also would love to hear all the benefits to help motivate me. I want to live healthy both mentally and physically. I will also meditate and work out every possible day.\n\nEdit: I already succeeded in quitting Adderall, benzodiazepines, and porn for good(1 year clear) so I'm pretty confident that I will have the courage to do it.\n\nEdit2: As many said it was a horror. I was unable to do it and felt like shit so like you said I started to do one thing at a time. I stopped drinking alcohol, it's already 2 weeks. I stopped drinking coffee and decided to only drink one cup of tea everyday. Now I'm on day 2 of stopping smoking weed.
