Our parents are both hard workers (lower middle class), but shoved ridiculously high expectations on us to be perfect and present ourselves favorably to others. My dad would make me read business books and \u201cself help\u201d books and encouraged me (through screaming) not to go to college and start my own business. I\u2019m in college, and told myself I would work and grind so hard that I would be rich. I\u2019ve switched my major from conservation biology to a more \u201crealistic\u201d major to make money, and rarely see the people I care about. I believed I would work until I\u2019m rich and provide for my friends, which would justify it. This year was incredibly depressing. I suffer from burnout regularly. Recently I got a job cleaning for the summer between semesters. While I clean, I\u2019ve been listening to philosophy and those \u2018I don\u2019t dream of labor\u2019 videos. I made a new email for my YouTube so I wouldn\u2019t get my old recommendations, which were mainly negative. Spending time listening to other perspectives has totally opened my eyes. Now I\u2019m watching alternatives to capitalism, why hustle \u2018culture\u2019 is addictive and makes you depressed, and rediscovered my original passion for nature. The veal has been lifted and I can finally see the flaws in my logic. I\u2019m not helping my friends or family by ignoring them today and maybe helping them in the future with money. I\u2019m a slave to consumerism and working tirelessly for things I don\u2019t really care about. I don\u2019t want to waste my life working. I\u2019m going to add value to the world instead of just taking from it. I will work to meet my needs and spend more time on my passions and helping others and the environment in small ways, larger ways in the future.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nv7r3j/dont_want_to_be_rich_and_famous_anymore/", "title": "Don\u2019t want to be rich and famous anymore", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Previous_Werewolf_67", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 91, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623168691, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nv7r3j/dont_want_to_be_rich_and_famous_anymore/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436502.2092013, "replies_charged": false}
