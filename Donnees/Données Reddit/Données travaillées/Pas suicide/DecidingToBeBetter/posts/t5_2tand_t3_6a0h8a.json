What harm do I have in trying a post here anyway? So yeah, for the 805th time (just making a guess on the number) I'm deciding to do better.\n\nI'll finish organizing stuff that has remained in disarray since moving into this house 98 days ago. I'll finish updating an organized list of things I'd like to or need to do. I'll write at least one measly line of code for one of the apps I have been ostensibly working on for months or years so that I can get the ball rolling again and publish some more and better stuff in the near-ish future.\n\nAnd I'll hope that somehow posting this on Reddit (and in particular this subreddit) makes more of a difference than any of the other places I've said similar things in the past. I would much rather come to find out this works than continue being lousy myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/6a0h8a/805th_times_the_charm/", "title": "805th time's the charm?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "p2010t", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1494273147, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/6a0h8a/805th_times_the_charm/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435820.522786, "replies_charged": false}
