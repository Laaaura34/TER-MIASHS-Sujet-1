My guilty pleasure is eating fast food every so often. I\u2019ll admit I adore Taco Bell, Chic Fila, McDonalds, Buffalo Wild Wings etc. you name it. \n\nI\u2019m at a normal weight but really want to lose a few pounds and fell healthier in genera. The fast food is something I\u2019m looking to significantly cut from my diet\n\nI was having a bad day yesterday at work and was dying for the quick fix for dinner. When I\u2019m very stressed, the high sodium fast food is my go-to. I already had healthy dinner leftovers waiting at home for me. \n\nIt took every inch of me to not fall back into old habits and go to the drive through. However, I was disciplined enough to say no and choose to eat my healthy dinner at home.\n\nIt\u2019s small but I\u2019m very proud I did not cave and am sticking to my goals.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mupf4o/small_but_meaningful_act_of_discipline/", "title": "Small but meaningful act of discipline", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "HoolahMulah1995", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618922497, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mupf4o/small_but_meaningful_act_of_discipline/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437750.1825976, "replies_charged": false}
