I\u2019m tired of feeling like things are never a big deal and then putting off addressing them. \n\nI\u2019ve been on various antidepressants since I was 14 years old (OCD + Anxiety). I\u2019m now 28 and have never experienced life without them... I\u2019ve been feeling incredibly apathetic and complacent for far too long, never really showing any emotion or care, to the point that I felt like my personal and professional life were suffering. Nothing was ever a big deal to me, sometimes when it should have been. About a month and a bit ago my doctor and I started weaning myself off of them... I\u2019ll be honest, it\u2019s been a really difficult experience in my life however I am feeling committed to giving this shot. I want that level of care back. I want to be less apathetic... but when do I know if it\u2019s actually the medication causing me to feel this way or if it\u2019s just my personality? Two weeks in and I\u2019m worried I should have saw a big change by now and if I haven\u2019t, maybe I should get back on medication...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7fkb8n/does_anyone_have_any_tips_on_dealing_with_apathy/", "title": "Does anyone have any tips on dealing with apathy?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "sketeypetey", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1511667295, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7fkb8n/does_anyone_have_any_tips_on_dealing_with_apathy/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436092.2906024, "replies_charged": false}
