During this time I was doing really great with waking up at a good time, working out everyday, eating healthy, etc. but since then I moved to NYC and have been here for a year now. All of my good habits have gone down the drain and replaced with bad ones. I understand it\u2019s different now since I have a job and an apartment that I have to upkeep but I feel like I don\u2019t have time to take care of myself and when I do have time I would rather indulge in bad habits (sweets, TV, napping) instead of trying to get back into a good routine. \n\nI have felt like this for a while now and I always tell myself I need to make changes. I have tried writing my goals down and setting up a routine but I can\u2019t seem to get myself to stick with it. I guess it all comes down to I can\u2019t discipline myself and I need some form of motivation. I just don\u2019t know where or how to get it. I feel like i am stuck in an endless cycle of wanting to improve but still doing bad habits and getting disappointed with myself. \n\nI would appreciate any advice/tips. I hope I made sense!
