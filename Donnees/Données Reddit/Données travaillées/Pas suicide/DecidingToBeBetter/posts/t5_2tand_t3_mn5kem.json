Some of my actions have hurt people. For a while I\u2019ve been very selfish, hurtful and inconsiderate. I\u2019ve lost my family due to separation and I got no one else to blame but myself. I wish that I can turn back the time and slap myself and say stop being selfish, the world doesn\u2019t revolve around you!\n\nI\u2019ve had the wrong mentality on my definition of what a strong man should be. I was reactive instead of being thoughtful of my action. I was too proud, proud for the wrong reason. I\u2019ve learn about Christ on a young age, once upon a time I wanted to be a priest. But it\u2019s too late to be a priest now. I\u2019m not very religious anymore but I do believe in the teaching of Jesus. Sometimes I feel ashamed for praying because I don\u2019t deserve his blessing. \n\nTo make this short this is what I plan to do.\n\nBe grateful for the world we live in.\nBe grateful for my family. \nShow kindness and love to all human beings and creature.\nApologize to everyone I\u2019ve hurt on the past. This part make me realize how cowardly I am for not saying sorry.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mn5kem/ive_decide_to_do_better/", "title": "I\u2019ve decide to do better", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Plus-Mind-2995", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617928368, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mn5kem/ive_decide_to_do_better/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435584.3739254, "replies_charged": false}
