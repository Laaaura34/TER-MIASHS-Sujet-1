Its becouse im lazy pretty much all time on my phone talk with my mom rarely although i live with her(im 16). I feel how my classmates and my class friends feel akward when talking to me mostly becouse i fuck up with my lenguege im not english speaker btw and still in my naitive languege i fail with words and it feels so hurtful. I can't really feel confident when i have this incorect speaking every day its not that bad but when i try to speak like a flow i fuck up its annoying. Before nofap all this was even worse but i could escape my problems with pmo. Now that i cant i need to fix my problems. But honesly i dont know how at the moment i really feel empty maybe little bit depressed i don't know what to do. Im on day 4 on nofap. And although i can see my problems WAY better now i can't fix them.\n\n\n If anyone has some ideas ID LOVE TO HEAR THEM. This post might be to long but i writted it from my heart like a flow and im not native english speaker i hope you guys understand.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdk4m4/under_nofap_i_start_to_understand_that_im_not/", "title": "Under nofap i start to understand that I'm not appreciated", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "INEEDtoCHANGE5", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 94, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634918742, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdk4m4/under_nofap_i_start_to_understand_that_im_not/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436941.0789783, "replies_charged": false}
