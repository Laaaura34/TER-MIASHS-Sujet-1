Since then I've decided to work on certain aspects of my life like academics, physical well being and also emotional maturity (which I feel I heavily lack). Ive been trying to consistently journal but its too emotional demanding for me to sit down everyday and actually do it, I've noticed that whenever my parents question something I believe in strongly or some of my friends question my opinions or bring out faults in me I get  aggressively defensive I also feel like I'm dogmatic and I believe this leads to toxicity in relationships, friendships etc.  \n\nCan someone suggest something to get a grip over this or anything to do (journal more often, read etc. Or something). \n\n(Please do not judge me, I'm relying on the somewhat anonymity to reach out and talk about an uncomfortable topic.)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kmn0qi/can_someone_suggest_ways_of_getting_out_of_toxic/", "title": "Can someone suggest ways of getting out of Toxic emotional immaturity.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "yohaan_k", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1609276141, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kmn0qi/can_someone_suggest_ways_of_getting_out_of_toxic/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438466.4012303, "replies_charged": false}
