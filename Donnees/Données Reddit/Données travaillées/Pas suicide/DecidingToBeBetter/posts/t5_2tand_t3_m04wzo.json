I take offense easily and in arguments, I can\u2019t stop, I keep going until I overpower someone, especially my boyfriend and my family. \n\nIt\u2019s terrible and I always regret it after. I keep saying I will change and it lasts for a little but then not too long later, I roll back into my bad habits. It\u2019s like walking on eggshells around me. I want to have thicker skin, I want to be the chill girlfriend, I want to be kind and gentle. But I think I feel insecure deep down. Always on edge and ready to defend myself and fight. I\u2019m also extremely emotional. I feel so exhausted. Always getting cranked up, overreacting, then crying and apologizing for the way I was.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m04wzo/im_sensitive_and_i_have_a_temper/", "title": "I\u2019m sensitive and I have a temper", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "ouidansleciel", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615167841, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m04wzo/im_sensitive_and_i_have_a_temper/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435793.1011028, "replies_charged": false}
