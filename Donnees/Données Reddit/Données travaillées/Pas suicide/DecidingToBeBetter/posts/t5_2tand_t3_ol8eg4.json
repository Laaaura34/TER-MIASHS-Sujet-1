I\u2019ve been struggling with anxiety, rumination, self-comparison/body checking, and automatic negative thoughts and realized that I am able to \u201cdistract\u201d myself from these dangerous behaviors if there is structure (to a certain extent). However, since graduating college, it\u2019s been hard for me me to be disciplined, especially when my anxiety gets the best of me and ruins my day. I typically start my day with gratitude and my self-affirmations and a 10-min workout about 3-4 times a week. I also journal regularly and I\u2019m planning to get back into meditating and doing yoga. \n\nI\u2019m in the process of studying for a big exam, but can\u2019t seem to get more than 1-2 hours of work daily when ideally I\u2019d get 5-6 hours a day at the very least. I also spend way too much time on my phone (maybe that\u2019s contributing to my anxiety) and would like to cut down on that too. I limit my social media use (besides Reddit and YouTube) and that\u2019s helped. \n\nI\u2019ve also been dealing with feelings of loneliness. I\u2019ve joined the MeetUp app and went to an event (virtual) but am overwhelmed. \n\nI would love to get therapy but can\u2019t at the moment. \n\nAny suggestions about what to do would be greatly appreciated :) Thank you in advance.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ol8eg4/bundle_of_nerves/", "title": "Bundle of Nerves", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "throwawaytodayyyyt", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626405373, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ol8eg4/bundle_of_nerves/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435107.1819453, "replies_charged": false}
