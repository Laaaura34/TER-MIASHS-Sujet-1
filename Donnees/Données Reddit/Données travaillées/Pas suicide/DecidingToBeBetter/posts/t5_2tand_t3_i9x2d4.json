Every time I see hot guys on social media, I masturbate. My mind is so powerful I could imagine my guy friends fucking me.\n\nIt's been a week since my last masturbation. I want to extend this to a month. I hope I can do this.\n\nTo all people who are deciding to be better, I hope you find your motivation soon.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9x2d4/i_survived_a_week_without_masturbating/", "title": "I survived a week without masturbating.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "cagnacornea", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1597448615, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i9x2d4/i_survived_a_week_without_masturbating/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435607.5203657, "replies_charged": false}
