I paint, I write, I'm drawing a comic, I even do handcrafts sometimes and I'm currently keeping a diary of the current events. But every time I notice someone else doing something similar (such as the diary idea), I get the urge to drop everything and stop doing it, because there's no point in doing my own thing if it'll just look and feel like a cheap imitation of someone else's.\n\n How do I get over this? How do I stick to doing the things I do once I stop loving them when I realise it's not special? How do I stop being dependent on being \"special\" for something to have any worth at all? The world needs mediocre things and mediocre things still need makers, how do I make peace with being one?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fpdwms/finding_joy_in_what_youre_doing_despite_of_others/", "title": "Finding joy in what you're doing despite of others doing it better", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "takaperoinen-miete", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1585238124, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fpdwms/finding_joy_in_what_youre_doing_despite_of_others/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437305.145374, "replies_charged": false}
