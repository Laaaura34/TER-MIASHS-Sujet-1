I used to have a counselor but he was an intern and when his semester ended I didn't have a counselor anymore. Been a few months and since then I've fallen hard. ADHD is kicking my ass, gonna discuss different medication as well. I'm fucking tired. I don't want to fail anymore. I need to grow, I can't be in this shitty slump anymore. I feel like I'm bursting with anger. Like there's two sides of me, one being oppressed, and the other hell bent on ruining my life. I can't take this weakness anymore. I don't eat, I don't drink water, my gym sessions are super inconsistent, I don't even log my habits anymore. I have to get out of my own head and grow. I was working out everyday, waking up early everyday, sleeping Early everyday, working on my small business and doing school just a few months ago. Now I feel like I've hit the bottom of a very deep pit. I'm tired of it.
