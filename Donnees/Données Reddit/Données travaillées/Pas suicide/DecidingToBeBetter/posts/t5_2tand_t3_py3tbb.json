I just can\u2019t stop looking at what I\u2019ve done in the past few months, or rather haven\u2019t done, and being upset that I haven\u2019t achieved more. There are so many skills I wanted to learn but haven\u2019t improved upon. There is so much I want to do so I can start feeling like myself again but just can\u2019t find the motivation to start. And to top it all off I just can\u2019t help but compare myself to everyone around me or people I see on social media who are where I\u2019d like to be. I look at my art and my clothes and my body and my progress on learning Spanish and it just seems like I\u2019m so far behind where I should be by now. \nDoes anyone have any tips on finding the motivation or how to stop comparing yourself to others? Its really bumming me out and preventing me from actually progressing.
