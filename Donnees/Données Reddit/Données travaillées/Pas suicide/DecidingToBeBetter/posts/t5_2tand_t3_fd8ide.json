My closest friend, who I was never really that close with, had a baby about 3 weeks ago. I would see her 2-3 times a year, I felt like she understood me without having to really open up to her. We have an awkward friendship but I can tell we both wanted to be closer, I think I have this strange barrier that I\u2019m still trying to work on. \n\nShe\u2019s focusing on being a Mum right now, so even if I was able to go to her, I feel it\u2019s so petty and she\u2019s so stressed as it is. I also feel it\u2019s unfair that I\u2019ve never been there for her, hardly made plans or checked up on her; yet I expect her to be there for me the moment I need it, it\u2019s just not right.\n\nI think because I have been so lonely for so many years now, I feel nobody knows me. I don\u2019t have deep conversations anymore, I don\u2019t express myself anymore. The only person who could even grasp or possibly care about me is my ex of 5-6 years. We broke up about 3 years ago but he still had a mental hold of me up until about 6 months ago. \n\nHe has been the most unhealthy thing that has happened to me. There\u2019s a lot of history, and I\u2019m only now realising that there probably was some abuse there too, mental, physical, psychological. At the time I was so young and alone, so much in denial that I couldn\u2019t see what he was doing was wrong.\n\nThe last few times we spoke, it has been messy. It\u2019s been hard to put my foot down and really kick him out of my life for good. He sweeps in at the most loneliest moments and I do believe that he genuinely cares about me, but he brings forth so much pain. He doesn\u2019t realise that it\u2019s not healthy, but I feel like he does worry about me.\n\nWell today he messaged me, out of the blue. He asked to see how I\u2019m going and make sure everything is okay. I replied \u201cI told you not to talk to me\u201d. As lonely as I feel lately, as much as I needed to know somebody cared, I chose not to engage. This has really put me in an upset mood, but I know I\u2019m doing the right thing. I want some affection, I want somebody there.. but I shouldn\u2019t. I can\u2019t. \n\nIt may be small, it may be extremely hard, but I\u2019m very proud of myself. I\u2019m trying to stay positive. I\u2019m telling myself how fortunate and grateful I am for the fact I can read, I can read books and escape my reality. I\u2019m thankful for the person I am. I am strong(ish), I\u2019m just not ready to \u201cdo life\u201d but I\u2019m getting there.. very very slowly. I can see that I can do this, but I don\u2019t have to right now. It\u2019s okay to take my time.\n\ntl;dr: Manipulative ex is the only person who cares about me. Being so lonely, I am choosing not to respond to his messages as I know it will lead me back down the wrong path.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fd8ide/im_sorry_if_this_doesnt_belong_but_i_feel_proud/", "title": "I\u2019m sorry if this doesn\u2019t belong, but I feel proud of myself, even if it\u2019s just something small", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "idk2384729477", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 18, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1583300735, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fd8ide/im_sorry_if_this_doesnt_belong_but_i_feel_proud/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436644.6779914, "replies_charged": false}
