But still. \n\nI\u2019ve been unemployed for about 6 weeks now, and during these 6 weeks, I\u2019ve smoked quite a bit of weed. Much more than I used to smoke before I lost my job. Marijuana helped me cope with a lot of shit in my life, among which I can mention my being in the States alone, having moved here as an international student, and having depression and a few other fun diagnoses. \n\nIt\u2019s likely that one of the jobs I\u2019ve applied to will be offered to me, and employment is contingent on passing a urine test. I think I can pass it, when considering the timeline and my weight and consumption of pot. But I could have also decided to break the law and ask one of my friends to pee in a cup for me. I could have bought one of those crazy drinks that helps you pass a urine test. However, I decided to let go of weed, because it was also a hinder, however much it was helping me cope. It lulled me into a state of complacency, and it made it easier to push aside some of the plans that I had, plans that required effort and unfortunately some sacrifice. \n\nBut I decided to try to be better. I don\u2019t think that weed means you\u2019re trying to do worse per se, but for me, it came to mean that. I am writing this in the event that someone sees it and recognizes part of themselves, and hopefully has some words of support for me.
