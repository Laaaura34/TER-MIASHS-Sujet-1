Anyways, I came here in search of advice. I\u2019m a teenager with diagnosed ADHD, Autism, and Depression. I have little to no motivation to do anything with myself and get help, and I haven\u2019t seen my therapist who specializes in art therapy ever sense COVID started and I likely won\u2019t be seeing them anytime soon. \n Despite me being diagnosed with Autism and one of the main factors of seems to be having a large sense of empathy(from what my therapist told me) over time I\u2019vs found myself becoming more sadistic and less empathetic as time has gone on. I enjoy making people upset and causing others stress and anger. I have a horrible habit with lying, often making up stories about myself and my life. Anytime I do something wrong I immediately wrap myself in a lie to get out of it and avoid consequences. \n And as I mentioned before I keep making stories about myself, people rarely know the actual me and instead know this fictional version of myself that I keep playing into.\n I constantly change my personality depending on the person and people often notice this. I also tend to lose interest in people and things quickly. I can become obsessed with the specific item or person in a matter for days or even months and than completely loose interest in the said thing and drop it entirely.\n I\u2019ve also found myself terrified of going outside, I hate interacting with people in general and often time the closet I get to that is interacting with my friends on discord. I\u2019ve also have not been able to move on from a relationship I had over 3-4 years ago and I\u2019ve been obsessing over them even though we don\u2019t even talk anymore and I keep fantasizing about them(not in a inappropriate way). \n I struggle with hygiene & over-eating and struggle to get out of bed constantly but I have no motivation to get better and I have no idea on what to do.\n\nI need help and want to change but I have no idea where to start.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oneej3/i_seriously_need_help_long_post/", "title": "I seriously need help..
