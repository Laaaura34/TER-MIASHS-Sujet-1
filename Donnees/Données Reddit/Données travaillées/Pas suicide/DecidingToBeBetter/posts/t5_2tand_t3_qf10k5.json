I use a routine app called fabulous and for a while it helped me SO much! My first couple of weeks, I did so well, I had more energy and wasn't as affected by my depression, and it helped me fix my sleep schedule. I was even told I looked so much happier and healthier!\n\nThen my third week, I began falling short on these routines. It's really basic too, so I don't know why I can't stick with it? Drink water right when I get up, eat a healthy breakfast, and exercise for 5-10 minutes. I still drink water when I wake up, but nothing else has stuck with me.\n\nI can't imagine my adhd or depression help either...\nI just stress out and overthink so much, I don't know how to relax or know where to start. I feel like I have so much to do, yet I don't?\n\nJust... any advice at all.
