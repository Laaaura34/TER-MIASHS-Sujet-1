What if your job, weight, finances, and number of followers suddenly didn\u2019t say anything about you? What if you were good enough and those were optional side quests but there was nothing \u201cmissing\u201d about you that you needed to fix?\n\nI think many of us start with the premise of \u201cI\u2019ll be happy when I accomplish my goal.\u201d The problem is that the goal post constantly moves. We\u2019ve unconsciously decided that we\u2019ll never be happy, and these unfinished goals are excuses. \u201cI\u2019m unhappy because I\u2019m overweight. I\u2019m unhappy because of my relationship. I\u2019m unhappy because of my job.\u201d Well, at some point you\u2019re unhappy because you\u2019ve decided to be unhappy.\n\nI\u2019m being direct about this because I want to stop doing it. I\u2019ve worked incredibly hard and made a lot of progress in my life, but it is never enough. Always chasing something I don\u2019t have, and never happy until I get it. What would it feel like if this endless hamster wheel of unhappiness was over?\n\nLet\u2019s imagine what that feels like. Someone who had climbed the mountain or finished the race or crossed the last item off of their to-do list.\n\nThey would feel peace. The voice telling them to do X or Y would be silent - everything is done already. They would feel gratitude. Their hard work had probably earned them some comfort or blessings, which they would feel thankful for. They would be mindful, enjoying the moment and taking it in, now that they could catch their breath and not be rushing to and fro. They would soak in the little details of the moment. Their warm coffee in their hands, the softness of their chair. I think they would have little curiosities in the moment. Wonder what a duck was thinking as it paddled across a lake, or wonder where a plane had just come from that was soaring overhead. Add your own details to what someone would feel like if they had \u201cmade it.\u201d\n\nWho is to say we don\u2019t deserve that peace and gratitude and mindfulness now? Because most of the time I think we\u2019re the only ones telling that to ourselves. Maybe we internalized too much media that said you have to be rich or work 100 hours a week or have a six pack. Maybe we\u2019ve heard that narrative so much that we think it\u2019s our own. Maybe it\u2019s time to stop.\n\nYou are the only one who can decide what is important to you. But I do want YOU to decide. I want you to look closely at the script you\u2019re following right now and ask yourself if you wrote it or if society did. Because you can waste a lot of time putting off happiness chasing someone else\u2019s goals, and you might never get there. How would it feel if you were good enough right now? What emotions and peace would you feel? How relieved would you be?\n\nBecause if you would feel way better than you feel right now\u2026.then we need to investigate where you really stand. Life is really short. When today is over you cannot get it back.\n\nI\u2019m not saying we shouldn\u2019t strive to improve. Growth is good for people and accomplishing things feels great. But it\u2019s not a precondition for enjoying life. Happiness is not a reward you have to earn. If feeling \u201cgood enough\u201d is a stark contrast to how you typically frame life, then maybe that tells you it\u2019s time to stop waiting for the life someone else said you should want. Your life is here now. You can choose to accept where you are as worthwhile. You can choose to find meaning in the life you have and have gratitude for the things around you.\n\n\u201cGood enough\u201d doesn\u2019t have to be a fantasy. If you\u2019re the only person saying you\u2019re not \u2018there\u2019 yet then ask yourself why not. You can choose a better script to follow than the one society gave you. If you can\u2019t find peace where you are now then you won\u2019t find it you get where you\u2019re going.\n\n\\--------\n\nFurther Reading: If this post resonated with you then I think you\u2019d get a lot out of Awareness by Anthony De Mello. He does an incredible job of separating the labels and scripts we put on life from what is really important. His work really helped me inspect the sources of my anxiety and pain and demonstrated I was chasing the wrong things. I found a lot of peace when I started separating out the scripts society gave me vs the things I truly value. I think it could help you a lot too.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mj7160/how_would_you_feel_if_you_were_finally_good_enough/", "title": "How would you feel if you were finally \"good enough\"?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MattTheMentor", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617450680, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mj7160/how_would_you_feel_if_you_were_finally_good_enough/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435590.4273138, "replies_charged": false}
