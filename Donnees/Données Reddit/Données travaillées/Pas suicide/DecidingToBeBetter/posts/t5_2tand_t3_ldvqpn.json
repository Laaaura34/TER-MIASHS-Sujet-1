It starts with a deep analysis of the current situation. We need two points \u2013 A and B \u2013 to make a route to a successful and happy future. Let\u2019s start with a simple but very efficient tool to analyze the situation. It\u2019s called 5 \u201cwhys.\u201d\n\nThe tool originates from the Japanese philosophy of \u201clean production\u201d, but it is quite applicable for almost any situation. Let\u2019s imagine an entrepreneur by the name of John. When John launched his startup, he dreamt about a business empire. But he still has not more than eight employees and doesn\u2019t earn enough to feel safe.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause his business needs investments to develop and expand, but John hasn\u2019t invested. Why hasn\u2019t he invested? Because his company didn\u2019t make enough profit, but John was afraid of borrowing money from banks or investors. But why was he afraid of doing it? Because John didn\u2019t believe in his business himself. Why did he start this particular business? Because at that time, he was sure that it would be more comfortable. Why did he choose an easy way but not the right one? Because he had always done this way. Why did he always do this way? Because it is a part of his personality.\n\nNow it seems that we have the core problem of John\u2019s unsuccessfulness. If our imaginary John was honest with himself, he understands that it doesn\u2019t make any sense to solve his managerial tools. Psychological problems can\u2019t be fixed with economic means.\n\nIn this particular case, we needed 6 \u201cwhys\u201d to get to the real source of the problem. Sometimes we need less, sometimes more. The name of the method, \u201c5 Whys\u201d, doesn\u2019t indicate that exactly five steps are necessary to get the truth. The only strict rule is that one should keep asking \u201cwhy\u201d until it\u2019s done.\n\nFinding a \u201ccore problem\u201d, as Eliyahu Goldratt called it, is critically essential for choosing a solution. Your homework for this week is to select any undesirable thing in your life (such as \u2013 not having enough money, bad relationships at work, etc.) and try to find it. \n\nTo be continued.
