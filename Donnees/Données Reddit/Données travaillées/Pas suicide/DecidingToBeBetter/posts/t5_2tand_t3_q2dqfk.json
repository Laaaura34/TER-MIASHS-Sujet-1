I've read, and promoted, a whole host of the classics and moderns, from Aristotle to Zadie Smith. Many, many great books with great ideas and knowledge.\n\nBUT, let's be real here. Plato's Democracy isn't as useful as it used to be, Ayn Rand doesn't speak to today's world, and there are so many other books that have more historical significance than actual relevance.\n\nI want to put together a reading list for living a happy, healthy, prosperous life in the 21st century.

Bogle (economics)\n\nThe Four - Scott Galloway (business)\n\nThe Soul at Work - Franco Berardi (philosophy)\n\nZen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance - Robert Persig (philosophy)\n\nBreath: The New Science of a Lost Art - James Nestor (health)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave you got any others?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2dqfk/reading_list_for_the_21st_century/", "title": "Reading List for the 21st Century", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "MWilk1262", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633497386, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2dqfk/reading_list_for_the_21st_century/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437878.7311964, "replies_charged": false}
