And I do feel like I have been for the majority of my life despite all my hardships. I never intentionally try to cause conflict or confrontation and always try to do what\u2019s right. But the last few years have completely broken me and my spirit. How can I try so hard to avoid conflict only to be the bad guy every time? It became completely clear to me that I am the toxic person in my life when not a single person showed up to my birthday party this year except my bf who was already with me.\n\nOver the last few years, I\u2019ve lost 99% of my family for standing up for what\u2019s right, lost most of my friends for taking things too personally, am so close to losing my bf for not meeting my (mostly unrealistic expectations), and my daughter whose father has been involving her in custody issues and pitting her against me through lies (I don\u2019t dare involve her by speaking ill of her father so naturally I look bad to her since she doesn\u2019t hear my side of things). \n\nMy depression and anxiety have made me so bitter and angry and I project that. I am so unlucky in life with unfortunate events happening one after the other and now I dwell in it. I\u2019ve just come to accept my life will be a constant fight and nothing will ever come easy. My happiness has been stripped and I am one bad life event from becoming a full fledged Karen. \n\nI constantly think about killing myself, but I am too big of a wuss to do it because I\nam completely convinced that I\u2019d come back and have it way worse than the life I currently have. So I often pray for death so that it\u2019s not by my own hand all so I can exit this world without my daughter thinking of me as a coward.\n\nThis isn\u2019t me. At all. I hate who I\u2019ve become and that I have allowed my incredibly poor luck to win.\n\nI recently got on antidepressants, go to therapy, take time to myself, etc. and it just isn\u2019t enough. People can\u2019t handle being around me and I\u2019m losing people left and right.\n\nSomeone please help me end this cycle. My daughter needs me, but I desperately need to keep people around in order to feel motivated to stick around.\n\nI\u2019m going to bed but I will accept any and all constructive criticism. Please go easy on me. I\u2019m fragile.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5otq3/current_toxic_person_looking_for_advice_from/", "title": "Current toxic person looking for advice from former toxic people - please help me end this cycle", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "okitwasme2", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 28, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633929283, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5otq3/current_toxic_person_looking_for_advice_from/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436256.4720218, "replies_charged": false}
