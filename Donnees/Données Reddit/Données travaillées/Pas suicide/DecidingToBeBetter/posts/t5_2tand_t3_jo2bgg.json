Ever since then I\u2019ve been trying to make self improvement a priority and to make changes in my life where needed. Over the last several months I\u2019ve begun to realize that no matter what I do in my personal life, no matter what books I read or what affirmations I use or what steps I take to improve myself, it\u2019s all kinda useless if I\u2019m spending a majority of my time in a work place where I\u2019m miserable. So yesterday I quit my job. I have nothing in savings. No other job lined up. No back up plans or anything. And to be honest? I\u2019m not worried about it. At all. And I feel the most optimistic about my life and my future than I have in a really long time. I guess there\u2019s no point in me posting this really. Other than to get it off my chest. And to say that I\u2019ve finally realized that no job or money is worth it if my mental health is being sacrificed. So here\u2019s to new beginnings. And I wish everyone the utmost success in all their endeavors.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jo2bgg/new_beginnings/", "title": "New Beginnings", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Used-Dragonfruit-525", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1604515464, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jo2bgg/new_beginnings/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437613.5526693, "replies_charged": false}
