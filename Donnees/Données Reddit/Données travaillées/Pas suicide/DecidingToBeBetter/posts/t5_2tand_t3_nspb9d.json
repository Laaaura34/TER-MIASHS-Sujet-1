And since then, I have implemented the remedies and have been able to bring down sleeping time from 3 am to 12:30-1 am.\n\nHowever, My sems ended recently, through which, I basically didn't quite sleep and since then I think, my body is recuperating and making up for the sleep that was lost by falling asleep...anytime. \n\nI think that will pass in a few days but what I am worried about now is the wake up time. I sleep at 12:30 and wake up at 10 which is not at all ideal and I feel tired and heavy headed afterwards. How do I take care of this? \n\nAlarms dont seem to be working cause I can't hear them.
