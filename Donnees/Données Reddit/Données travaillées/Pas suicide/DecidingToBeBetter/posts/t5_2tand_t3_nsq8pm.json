Last year, only my mum and sister wished me a happy birthday, no one else remembered. I don\u2019t really want to acknowledge my birthdays because they usually just made me feel sad.\n\nThis year, I decided fuck that. I\u2019m taking the weekend off work and treating myself. Today I\u2019m going for steak and then a massage. Tomorrow I\u2019m going wakesurfing and paragliding. It\u2019s up to me and only me to make it happy and wholesome. Happy birthday me!\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for the birthday wishes, each and everyone of you!! This is probably the most i\u2019ve ever had. \n\nI also want to add that this is the first time in my adult life (since my teens, now in my 30\u2019s) that I have been completely tee total. 8 months ago I decided to quit cigarettes, weed, alcohol and caffeine over night and this is my first birthday celebrated clean. My life was a mess and something had to change. I\u2019m also an expat and have no friends or family anywhere near me. Things are already improving ten fold and I have high hopes for an even better birthday next year \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nsq8pm/spending_my_birthday_alone/", "title": "Spending my birthday alone", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Iridalken65", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1908, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622877991, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nsq8pm/spending_my_birthday_alone/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436761.7005796, "replies_charged": false}
