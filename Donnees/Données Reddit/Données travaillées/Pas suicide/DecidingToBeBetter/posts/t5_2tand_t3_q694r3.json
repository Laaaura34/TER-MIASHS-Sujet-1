I spent the last few years consumed by my very rigorous graduate program and felt that I didn't have the time to read anything. Reading is intellectually stimulating, makes you a more cultured individual (which is what I'm working on), and builds your vocabulary (which I'd like to work on).\n\nI'm working during the day but I thought to start, I'd focus on classic short stories and novella. I'm beginning my journey with O. Henry. I thought I'd cover all the short stories first and work my way up to longer novels.\n\nWhat do you all suggest? How else can I be a well-read and cultured person?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q694r3/i_have_decided_that_i_want_to_be_wellread_and/", "title": "I have decided that I want to be well-read and cultured.
