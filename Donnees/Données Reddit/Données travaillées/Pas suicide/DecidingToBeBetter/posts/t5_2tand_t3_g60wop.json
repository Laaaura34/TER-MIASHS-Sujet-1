I stopped a few months ago feeling I didn\u2019t need it anymore and I wish I hadn\u2019t. I\u2019ve had a difficult week mentally due to some events and the anxiety in the pit of my stomach has returned for the first time in forever. \n\nI meditated for the first time yesterday before work and it made me feel so resilient through my whole shift. Even when I got home I didn\u2019t go straight to take a nap and stayed up until (granted it was early) bed time. \n\nIt\u2019s gonna be okay.
