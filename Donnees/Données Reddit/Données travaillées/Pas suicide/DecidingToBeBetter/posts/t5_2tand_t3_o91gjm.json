I went from 190 to 170. I'm 5'3 so I'm still obese, but it's something.\n\nI don't have a lot of good in my life to feel happy about right now, so I just wanted to share at least one thing that feels okay. It gives me something to focus on and I think the future me will be happy that I did it, and the one person I would have wanted to share this with is gone now, so I'll just share it with all of you. \n\nI want to be better.
