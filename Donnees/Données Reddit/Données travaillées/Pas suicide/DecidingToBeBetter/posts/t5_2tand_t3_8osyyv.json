Is there any plan of action or whatever that you know of which can actually allow you to change your beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors? I've looked into pretty much every obvious thing I can think of and what I found is none of them really work. LSD worked really well for a short time when I was a kid\u2014I had an instant transformation from angry metalhead to an optimistic, loving person that totally lost interest in metal and negativity. But, other stuff like CBT, Buddhism, meditation, etc. is just a never-ending uphill battle with minor changes at best, and it's easy to fall back into pessimism and old behaviors even after years of trying seriously to work it.\n\n2. What are some good stories about \"the curse of thinking\"? I feel like it's a really old concept found in a lot of myths, etc. but I can't really think of anything. The closest I can think of is Prometheus trying to steal the fire from heaven and he ends up being punished for eternity as a result. And maybe Icarus who flew too close to the sun.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8osyyv/two_questions/", "title": "Two questions...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "NoMuddyFeet", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 21, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1528221478, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8osyyv/two_questions/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437181.8755774, "replies_charged": false}
