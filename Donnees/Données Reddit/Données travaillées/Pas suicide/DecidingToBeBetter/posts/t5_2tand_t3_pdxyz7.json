I am  19 years old  and my dream is to become a skilled artist. Ever since when I was young I am always passionate in art. Like I draw every single second and I found myself very excited and giggly while doing it. However, I lost my passion and motivation ever since I met my classmate who is highly skilled at art. His skills made me question myself because I was not good enough and found myself constantly comparing to him. That robbed my happiness in art ad I stopped doing it ever since. I became depressed after that. \n\nLater, I found myself kinda unsatisfied with my life. Little did I know I was hurting myself by not doing the thing that I love. It feels like there's a big hole in my heart. That is why I decided to get back to drawing. However, I felt like I'm too old for it. I frequently see young teenagers who make really good work and the people in my age can already produce professional pieces. That made me feel insecure both in my skills and in my age again. Besides I am attending college and I'm afraid that I wont be able  to do it regularly like I did back when I was in high school. \n\nGuys what should I do? I want to get back the passion that I once lost. Help the old dude out. \n\nP.S.
