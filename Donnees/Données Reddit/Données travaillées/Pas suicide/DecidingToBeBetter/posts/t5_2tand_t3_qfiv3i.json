It honestly feels disappointing when I\u2019m sure that I\u2019m much better mentally but my physical reality shows little to no change.\n\nSure, I no longer procrastinate, I get whatever needs to be done DONE, I have a healthy routine, etcetera. Although sometimes I just sit and wonder - isn\u2019t there more to life than this? To be fair, I\u2019m still stuck at home most of the time due to the pandemic, but even before the whole event I had wondered the same thing. Isn\u2019t there more to life than this? Nowadays I\u2019ve noticed I feel the desire to do something \u201cexciting\u201d, meaning something unexpected and spontaneous. But it still bothers me that I can\u2019t be content with the mundanity of daily life, or that I have everything I need yet I still feel so dissatisfied with how things are. \n\nI really hate routine. I hate repetitive tasks, not because they\u2019re hard, but because I just don\u2019t feel anything anymore. I\u2019ve been told that it\u2019s a bit weird to want things to change constantly, and I somehow understand why. It\u2019s just that although I\u2019d prefer to love structure, I\u2019m just so drawn to its opposite that it gets frustrating at times. I\u2019m at a point where I SHOULD be content (well, I suppose that point is relative to each person), it just doesn\u2019t make sense how I\u2019m so bored all the time to the point of allowing big changes to happen with little hesitation. \n\nI\u2019ve crossed out depression as a possibility, as I\u2019ve had it in the past but this is certainly not it. I suppose I\u2019m just having a sort of existential crisis, and I\u2019m considering the thought that maybe I just haven\u2019t thought of all the options on what I can possibly do with my time. I\u2019m heavily invested in self-improvement and anything related to it, but I feel as if there\u2019s a certain point where things just feel kind of.. numb? It\u2019s as if even though I\u2019m surely making progress, it doesn\u2019t feel monumental enough for me to get excited about it. At most I\u2019m happy for a single day, then the days after that I\u2019m completely neutral. Not happy, not sad, just in a perpetual state of \u201ceh\u201d. It\u2019s frustrating.\n\nIf anyone here has dealt with something similar and/or has advice regarding this, I\u2019d really appreciate your thoughts. \n\nThe second thing I would really like to hear some different views on (I feel like I\u2019m just too limited in my thinking) is this:\n\nSay you had two years of (pretty much) free time. What would you do with it? How would you make the best out of it, and what goals do you think you can achieve during this timeframe? And in general, how would you make life exciting during this period? What new things would you try, what opportunities are available?\n\nI\u2019d appreciate any input on this, thank you", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfiv3i/i_feel_like_im_stagnating_in_life_despite_making/", "title": "I feel like I\u2019m stagnating in life despite making big mental progress", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Amberthms", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 26, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635174668, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfiv3i/i_feel_like_im_stagnating_in_life_despite_making/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436694.0950415, "replies_charged": false}
