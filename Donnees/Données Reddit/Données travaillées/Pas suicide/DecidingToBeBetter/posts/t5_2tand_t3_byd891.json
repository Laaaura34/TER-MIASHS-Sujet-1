I'm really afraid of being picky not not being able to learn social skills when I move on to university after this summer. \n\nI kind of have friends but I'm usually pretty alone. I feel like people want to talk to me and people have also mentioned that I'm charming but I often don't peruse any type of relationships (platonic + romantic) because I fear that they will realize I'm socially inept. How can I ease myself into socializing regarding how I was raised? \n\nI'd also love to hear self help book recommendations too if you know of any that might help with this. \n\nThanks", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/byd891/sheltered_childhood/", "title": "Sheltered Childhood", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "orangetricycles", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1560031816, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/byd891/sheltered_childhood/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435841.7122357, "replies_charged": false}
