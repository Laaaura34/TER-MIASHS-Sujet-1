I\u2019m too ashamed to talk to anyone I know irl and I don\u2019t have the funds to go to therapy at the moment. \n\nA bit of background: I\u2019m 21 years old, slowly getting through college and very recently quit a job that was deteriorating my mental health. I have a bit of money saved up to where I can take my time finding a new job. I have decided to take this free time to really figure out what I want to do with my life, given my last career path has just turned sour. \n\nSaying I\u2019m indecisive is an understatement. \n\nI used to take pride in having lots of unique hobbies and interests. From athletics to music to cooking to art, I\u2019ve always had a passion to learn about everything. However, when I really think about my motives, it turns out \u201cpassion\u201d isn\u2019t really the right word. \n\nI have realized that associate my \u2018interests\u2019 with a certain lifestyle I think I would like to live. I don\u2019t think of the work it takes to get there, but I instead focus on a romanticized version of myself in that career path. And before you ask, yes, it\u2019s vanity. I want people to think I\u2019m intelligent, selfless, admirable, but most importantly, beautiful while doing XYZ job/career. For example, my thoughts might be: \u201cIf I became a singer, I would have so many people that would love me\u201d or \u201cIf I became a professional soccer player, I would have a really fit body\u201d or \u201cif I was a statistician, I would be considered very intelligent to the average person\u201d. It\u2019s as if I have ulterior motives for each potential career path, which is why when it actually comes down to starting down a path, I back out. My intentions are not genuine.\n\nI\u2019ve dropped out of college on three separate occasions, all of them having to do with my fear of not being able to commit to a certain career path. I\u2019ve also worked in a variety of different job types, none of which were fulfilling. My biggest fear is living a life in which I am not proud of, or that I find myself mentally checking out most of the time. I don\u2019t want to constantly be waiting for the weekend. And to achieve that, I know I need to chase my dreams, but what dreams are there to chase if my only objective in life was to be better than others? To be prettier, smarter, and more well rounded? And for what? It\u2019s not attainable and certainly not mentally healthy to measure ones success based on what other people have achieved. \n\nIt makes me wonder, if I didn\u2019t have all of these insecurities regarding my looks and my intelligence, what kind of person would I really be? It is as if I\u2019ve surrounded my whole identity around being pretty that I don\u2019t have any genuine personality, except for bitterness and jealousy when I see someone who is better than I am. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how to change my outlook, because right now it\u2019s pretty bleak. I can expand on or explain anything if needed, I know some words didn\u2019t express in exactly the way I wanted.
