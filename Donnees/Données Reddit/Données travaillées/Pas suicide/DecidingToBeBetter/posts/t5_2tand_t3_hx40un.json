Today we missed our project deadline and were forced to refund the clients' downpayment and waive the remaining balance. I've been coasting it and not fully dedicating my time to being a better manager; this is the result of my complacency. \n\nI want to move forward and be the responsible leader that my team deserves. I want to get us enough clients every month so that I'm not always struggling to pay my employees. I want to learn how to manage a project properly so we don't ever mess up like this again.\n\nI know there's no secret to being more responsible... it's just *doing it.* Why don't I ever have enough willpower to do what's necessary for building success? Am I depressed but just don't know it? Or am I just a lazy asshole that can't grow up?   \n\n\nI don't know folks, half-rant done, but I think I need some serious help.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hx40un/i_just_had_my_very_first_fuckup_as_a_team_leader/", "title": "I just had my very first fuck-up as a team leader.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "myopic_monkey", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 19, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1595605294, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hx40un/i_just_had_my_very_first_fuckup_as_a_team_leader/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436051.258427, "replies_charged": false}
