I didn\u2019t see it as a problem since I live alone and thought no one would see it. In reality that meant I was never open to spontaneously inviting people over since I knew it was a mess. Every time I cook I never say the job is over until the dishes are put away in the dish washer and the table and stove are cleaned. I take the trash out weekly and never leave wrappers or trash out. Any time I do laundry, I dump the clothes on my bed which means I can\u2019t sleep until they\u2019re gone. Once I started doing this routinely they became rituals and just make sense to do. I don\u2019t even think about it anymore and just do them. Try this yourself and start doing things you don\u2019t want to do but need to until it just becomes second nature.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mtkxva/i_decided_to_start_doing_chores_not_because_i/", "title": "I decided to start doing chores not because I wanted to but because I needed to.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "whiteknight69b", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 88, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1618778276, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mtkxva/i_decided_to_start_doing_chores_not_because_i/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437625.978218, "replies_charged": false}
