I have never had a dream job or aspired to achieve a successful carrier as per the society norms. Even when i was a kid (also now) I just had some hobbies to do like painting that i liked. But nothing like the sense of achieving a big thing or inventing new to the world. My long term goal has always been to be a better person for my family members and help them. In future I want to be a good father and husband. I'm just 20 now but still.\nPretty much every average life guy with a stable job and loving family would be the life I want to live. But after observing, I realize every one of my peers have high achieving goal like startups, luxury life, high paying job etc. Yeah I would like a high paying job too but not at the sacrifice of my other parts of my life- families, hobbies , health..\n\nThis comparison has led me to confusion whether is this what I want or I am just lying myself to avoid working hard?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/b5oao3/is_it_bad_if_i_just_want_to_live_a_simpleaverage/", "title": "Is it bad if I just want to live a simple/average life?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "arunkumartamil", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1553598171, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/b5oao3/is_it_bad_if_i_just_want_to_live_a_simpleaverage/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436641.8909802, "replies_charged": false}
