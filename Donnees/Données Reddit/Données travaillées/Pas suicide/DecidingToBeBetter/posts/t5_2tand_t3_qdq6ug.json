I don\u2019t know what it is but I feel so frustrated and outside myself. I don\u2019t want to talk to anyone. I don\u2019t want to separate myself from them either. I even feel a bit too dependent on my therapist and our weekly sessions\u2026 they\u2019re all that keeps me going and from falling apart because I know she\u2019ll be there for me next week. \n\nI don\u2019t want to have to feel like I need anyone, or that I even need to be absolutely dependent upon them. \n\nI guess deep down I really do want people to know about me, to care and to love me. Not everyone can (this I know already) but it\u2019s frustrating to even need that from one person\u2026. \n\nOn top of that, I\u2019m not on talking terms with my dad. I have little skills I\u2019ve developed. I don\u2019t know what or where to go next. This all feels so overwhelmingly scary. \n\nI want to go away and just be my own person, learn who she is, but I\u2019m afraid if I do that then I\u2019ll come back to worse off connections , or even worse \u2014 no one at all. It pains me because I gotta go my own way and I don\u2019t wanna be hurtful or disloyal to others but I don\u2019t wanna keep compromising myself either.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdq6ug/can_anyone_please_help_me_make_sense_of_this/", "title": "Can anyone please help me make sense of this?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "norweigan-wallflower", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634936494, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdq6ug/can_anyone_please_help_me_make_sense_of_this/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438204.7338312, "replies_charged": false}
