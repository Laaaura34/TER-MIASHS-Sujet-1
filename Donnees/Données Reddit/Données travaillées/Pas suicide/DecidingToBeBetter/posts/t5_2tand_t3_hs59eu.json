With the ~gift~ of social media its so easy to always be in everyone\u2019s business, too, and it feels like bait for people like me who just anxiously check on people.\n\nMy realization of my unhealthy habit happened in 2 phases.\nPhase 1: I was trying to avoid a group of people I thought were at the mall I was in, and was looking over my shoulders every 5 seconds worried about seeing them and my sister just turned to me and said, \u201cits like you *want* to be tortured by this! just stop looking, and mind your own business.\u201d it was a harsh reality check, but checked me nonetheless.\n\nPhase 2: I saw a sarcastic tik tok about someone basically saying the same message about how crucial minding your own business is. \n\nIt sounds simple, but now that I intentionally guide my thoughts to be more about my life, my reality, and my interests, so much has grown for me. I have the time and energy to tend to my passions and ideas and it just feels so good to finally say to myself, \u201chey, you dont *have* to care about what everyone is doing or feeling all the time. what am *I* doing?\u201d", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hs59eu/minding_my_own_business_has_brought_me_so_much/", "title": "Minding My Own Business Has Brought Me So Much Peace.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "star_pwr", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 838, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1594884322, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hs59eu/minding_my_own_business_has_brought_me_so_much/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436867.393569, "replies_charged": false}
