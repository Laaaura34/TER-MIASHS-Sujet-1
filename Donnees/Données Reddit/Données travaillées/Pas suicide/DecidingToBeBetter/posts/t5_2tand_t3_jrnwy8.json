But I held myself back because past experiences have taught me that one good day doesn\u2019t mean the next will be and if I wanted to continue moving forward on this road, I had to slow down and keep perspective so as not to sabotage the efforts I have made thus far. \n\nToday I do not feel as light, it\u2019s more difficult to feel as optimistic about everything but I will continue to take baby steps because this is a marathon, not a sprint.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jrnwy8/this_is_a_marathon_not_a_sprint/", "title": "This is a marathon, not a sprint.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Kismet023", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 15, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1605025279, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jrnwy8/this_is_a_marathon_not_a_sprint/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436406.8205662, "replies_charged": false}
