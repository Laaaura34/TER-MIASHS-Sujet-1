The type of person about whom I am talking is genuinely happy always, not just in interpersonal communications. It seems like a really radical way to live life. I think it must be something to do with practicing gratitude or some other type of mindset. It seems to be more of a world view than a personality trait.\n\nAnyways looking for a book on how to be like one of these people.\n\nThanks in advance!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8vncf/looking_for_a_book_on_happiness/", "title": "Looking for a book on happiness", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "dobrichunk37", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1620620020, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n8vncf/looking_for_a_book_on_happiness/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437060.867948, "replies_charged": false}
