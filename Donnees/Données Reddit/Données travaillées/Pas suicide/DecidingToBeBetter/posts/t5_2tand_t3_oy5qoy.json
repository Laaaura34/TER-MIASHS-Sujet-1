People tell me not to worry and that I should just chill out until the next semester for college starts but I honestly hate the feeling of getting nothing done. Up until recently, I had only been going on my phone, watching TV/YouTube all day, going out with my girlfriend, but not much else in between. \n\nThe only habit that I have consistently stuck to (and am glad to have done so) is weight training/running throughout the week. Other than that, have not been doing much else. I recently started journaling, meditating, reading, coloring and playing videogames again to fill up my time with things I like doing, but I want to know what are some things that I can do in my spare time that would help me out in the long run or be beneficial to me? Any and all advice is much appreciated ! :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oy5qoy/been_unemployed_since_the_end_of_may_what_are/", "title": "Been Unemployed Since the End of May.
