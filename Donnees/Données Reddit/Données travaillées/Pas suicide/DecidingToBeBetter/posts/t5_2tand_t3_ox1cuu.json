Tomorrow I'm going to speak to my doctor about anti depression meds to keep me regular so I can keep improving myself. I've been seeing a therapist and I've made a new friend, I'm going to keep trying to make more!\n\nAfter five years of crippling mental health issues I'm finally starting to improve and move forwards. I'm trying so god damn hard guys. I'm trying so hard I feel out of breath just thinking about how much I have/am pushing through.\n\nI think I might study psychology in the future, I'd really like to help other people struggling like I have. I feel like I'd fit well into this sort of role.\n\nHope everyones having a great day!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ox1cuu/im_trying_my_hardest_guys/", "title": "I'm trying my hardest guys", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "GorlarmiSalami", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 52, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627989616, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ox1cuu/im_trying_my_hardest_guys/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438199.6698442, "replies_charged": false}
