I didn't get the best grades, despite intuitively grasping the concepts in school without much difficulty. I was diagnosed with a mental health condition as a teenager, and have struggled with a substance problem for the last 10 years.\n\nThe state of the world, especially through the lens of reddit, is concerning to me right now, particularly with tonight's announcement of the Brazilian presidential election. People are becoming more divided, more extreme, and political (and racial, in my country) unrest are spiraling out of control.\n\nI don't have a Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, or any other social media profiles, except for reddit. Reddit's traditionally the place that I have gotten my news from, but the constant stream of headlines and op-eds and blog posts and every other form of political and social commentary has just gotten to be too much--particularly for someone who studied a social science, and hasn't let go of his love for that.\n\nSo I'm making a few changes:\n\n* Eat healthier (going to the store every week now (instead of never!) to buy healthy, wholesome food for the week);\n\n* Lose weight (25lbs is the goal, 10lbs down so far!);\n\n* Cut back (or quit) the substance that I use (this is a big one, and has actually contributed to the above);\n\n* Focus more on reading non-news sources (always been an avid reader, but I'm just going to stock my kindle with books and shut out the outside); and,\n\n* Make this reddit account to filter the toxicity. This is a platform that I use every.single.day., and I need to find a way to make it more wholesome. No hate subs, no politics, no spam, no anger. Just cute pictures of kittens, maybe some creepy images, and gifs of people doing dumb shit.\n\nI might pop back onto my \"main\" from time to time. I might not. I may forget about it, and about all the negativity and instability going on throughout the rest of reddit. I think that reddit has a great format for sharing content--I'm just hoping that this alt account will allow me to organize and see only the content that can help improve and maintain my mental state and ground myself in positivity and centeredness, not uncertainty and chaos.\n\nThanks for reading.
