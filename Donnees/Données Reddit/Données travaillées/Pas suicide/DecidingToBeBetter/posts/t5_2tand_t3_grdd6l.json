Between a whole pile of very scary health concerns with the baby, having a terrible two year old and general SAD depression, I just haven't been motivated to clean. It's been a real soar spot because I used to have the tidiest, cleanest home which was a major source of pride.  The final straw came when I was looking at new places to move to because I couldn't stand where I was. I was literally one step away from throwing in the towel on this home and just getting rid of it. Instead, I set the goal of emptying the dishwasher.  And then I filled it. Then I washed bottles.  I just kind of gained some momentum and tidied the kitchen, living room and playroom over 6 hours. It felt lovely. It FEELS lovely. \n\nNothing is clean yet, but I think I'll finish tidying the whole house tomorrow and then I'll start scrubbing the next day.  I'm guessing this whole process is going to take me a week. I still have to care for the kids and clean up the messes we will make along the way, but I'm optimistic we can do this.\n\nFirst step is a comfortable home. Second step will be starting running again? Who knows?
