It was a nightmare due to the overwork we had to do. I switched to study 2D animation because drawing is my passion. I want to become an illustrator. Not interested in animation.. I even hate it. But it is the only school that allows me to have a degree in illustration (since we learn a lot of things with drawing characters and landscape concept, etc.). There's 2 years left before I get my diploma. And having a job as an illustrator is not guaranteed at all.\n\nI might have a burn-out soon. I've always been against school system because it dishumanize us. Working more than 8 hours a day is difficult and depressing.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I should stop everything and just get a normal job with minimum salary and living a calm (happy?) life, or will I regret it? Atm, I study and work as a cashier at the same time.\n\nI'm exhausted and lost. I feel like we live in a generation were every young people live in constantly stress and anxiety due to our society.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8v937/should_i_give_up_my_studies_and_start_working_f23/", "title": "Should I give up my studies and start working?
