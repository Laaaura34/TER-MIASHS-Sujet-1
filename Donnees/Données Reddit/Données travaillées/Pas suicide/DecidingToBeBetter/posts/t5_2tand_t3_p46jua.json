I question everything, and I mean everything. For example, I don\u2019t have confidence in the fact that I need to brush my teeth or take a shower. It\u2019s hard to explain. I just feel like my mind\u2019s broken and I lost the ability to be certain of something. \n\nI\u2019ve been at rock bottom for a long time. I have little energy, but I do have enough to do the most basic things like take care of hygiene, go for a walk and adhere to a sleep schedule. I just can\u2019t convince myself to do these things at times. \n\nI\u2019ve been in this cycle of making small steps by adopting good habits for a few weeks \u2192 losing my conviction that I need to maintain these habits (because of overthinking or being very upset) \u2192 drop everything and proceed to feel like shit \u2192 try to make small steps again. \n\nI\u2019ve seen three therapists so far, but none of them could help me. I\u2019m going to keep trying my luck by seeing other therapists, but right now I think that the only person who can help me is me.
