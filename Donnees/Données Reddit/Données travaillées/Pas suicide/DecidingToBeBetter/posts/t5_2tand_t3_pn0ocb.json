However, in doing that, when it comes to acknowledging any small personal victories i feel like im just being lax/complacent and smug about the bare minimum if i were to celebrate them. I don't know how to differentiate between a significant achievement or just making amends for mistakes I shouldn't have made in the first place - which shouldn't warrant a victory dance imo. \ud83d\ude13 Where do i draw the line?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pn0ocb/struggling_with_celebrating_personal_victories/", "title": "Struggling with celebrating personal victories", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "The_Reluctant_Dragon", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631479243, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pn0ocb/struggling_with_celebrating_personal_victories/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436018.8801887, "replies_charged": false}
