I have lied, I have cheated, I have done things I would absolutely never want to confess to a stranger. My problem now, as I watch youtube video after video about being a better person, becoming charming, bubbly, and charismatic; I realize that I have a hurdle that I'm not sure how to handle. How in the world do you overcome the \"you\" that was? How do you become bigger and better than the monster that you were before?\n\nI'm reminded of it all the time. I flood emotionally when it happens and I almost lose my cool. I'm trying to be a better person now, and it seems, to me at least, that dwelling on what I was is only ok to a certain extent. I can't continually live in that prison. How do I:\n\na. Move forward with myself and\n\nb. What do I do when others shine such illuminating lights on how I used to be and how my actions were before?\n\nEspecially living with the people calling me out I'm struggling hard. I can see the best me I can be, but they are letting the shadows of my past enshroud me before I can even get out the door.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jgwjuf/how_do_you_outshine_your_mistakes/", "title": "How do you outshine your mistakes?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Brankemup", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1603489572, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jgwjuf/how_do_you_outshine_your_mistakes/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435823.6294832, "replies_charged": false}
