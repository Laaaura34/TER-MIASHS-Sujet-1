Stoics say, happy life is only achievable by living virtuous.    \n    \nSmoking doesn't fit into my virtues, so I'm quitting. Porn doesn't fit into my virtues so I'm quitting that too. I wasted too much time on trying to escape the real life. Today I'm starting the gym. Today I will continue meditating. Today is the first day of my future.    \n    \nBesides, there's no reason to escape from real life ; I got my own flat, I am graduating in two months, I got a sweet job that I can build my career on. Two months ago my break up was still fresh and it was painful to be all alone at home. But I managed to get used to it, and learned that loneliness is a state of mind. Also, I'm playing video games after work with my lads, so that's enough to relax.     \n    \nWhy would I try to escape from my real life when I can be indifferent to incidents that come along? I need to control my life to reach my goals. I know I'm not where I want to be and I feel like suffocating at times; but that's something I need to change. Thus; I need to control my own life.    \n    \nThank you for reading, let this be a declaration in front of thousands of people that I am deciding to be better. Whatever tries to keep me from doing so can fuck right off.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o5f13r/finally_standing_up_by_myself/", "title": "Finally standing up by myself.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "KayraTheNomad", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 43, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624338611, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o5f13r/finally_standing_up_by_myself/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438048.603845, "replies_charged": false}
