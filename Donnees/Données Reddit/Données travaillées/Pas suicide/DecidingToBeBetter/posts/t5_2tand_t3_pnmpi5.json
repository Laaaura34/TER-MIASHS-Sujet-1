I\u2019m letting them know that I can\u2019t continue being a part of it. I don\u2019t get paid much, if anything at all, but I enjoy the work. \n\nThe thing is, my mental health has been declining. Both my FT job and my side projects have been getting not-so-good quality work from me. Even my days off consist of anxiety and stress because of the things I still have to get done. It doesn\u2019t help that I WFH. I\u2019ve never enjoyed WFH. Home is supposed to be a space for me to relax and detach.\n\nIt\u2019s not healthy and something has got to give. So, I\u2019ve decided to let the group know that I can\u2019t be a part of it anymore. I need genuine me time. I can\u2019t make everything I enjoy into something that needs to be capitalized.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pnmpi5/learning_when_to_take_a_step_back/", "title": "Learning when to take a step back", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "pupusasandchill", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631561935, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pnmpi5/learning_when_to_take_a_step_back/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438042.1614707, "replies_charged": false}
