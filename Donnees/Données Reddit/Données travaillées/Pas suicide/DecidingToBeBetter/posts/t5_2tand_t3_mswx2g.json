I showed some of my work to a friend who gave it a genuine compliment. \n\nOut of sheer habit I immediately deflected with a joke at my own expense. He's a great friend so he told me I was wrong, and in this moment I realized that I didn't even actually believe what I said about my own work unlike my past selves.\n\nSo that's it, self-deprecating humour is donion rings. It's not \"cute\" when I do it, and it does nothing to improve my life or well-being. We're voting it out. Asta lasagna.
