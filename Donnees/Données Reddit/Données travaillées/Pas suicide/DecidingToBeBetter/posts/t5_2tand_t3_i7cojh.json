He is super strong, super knowledgeable in technical things.\n\nSometimes, when he \"orders\" me to do something, I could not find the guts to reject him even though he and I have the ranking position. One of the reason is because of his voice. His voice is intimidating and I am scared of his strength and temper.\n\nAnd, when I am talking to him, I feel very intimidated and my whole mind went blank. I could speak to him only when he start talking with me or when I know his mood is good. Even so, I could only speak in a very soft voice. I did not dare to open conversation with him.\n\nI tried many times to open conversation with him but many times also, he kind of don't listen to what I said. Then I will be scared if he is angry at me or not.\n\n\nSo my question is How to NOT feel intimidated by anyone including my Superiors at work and colleagues and girls? My Superior love to kind of bully me at work but don't dare to Bully the Confident colleague I told u about.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i7cojh/how_do_i_make_myself_not_being_intimidated_by/", "title": "How do I make myself not being intimidated by almost everyone around me?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "G4L_Mobile", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1597090705, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/i7cojh/how_do_i_make_myself_not_being_intimidated_by/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438273.5867922, "replies_charged": false}
