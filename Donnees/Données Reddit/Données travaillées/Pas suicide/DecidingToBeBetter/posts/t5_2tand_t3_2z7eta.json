Especially if you repeat this practice every day. So, don't.\n\nPlaying video games might be more appealing in the moment, but a quick work out will make you happier for a lifetime. \n\nAvoiding chores may make the night seem more delightful, but you will get stressed out and overwhelmed when they pile up. \n\nChoosing the path of least resistance for the present moment will make the road ahead a journey through hell. Daily small changes will lead to a walk in the park. \n\n\n\n\n- This is a note to self. I saved it in my notes and I see it every time I open my phone. I hope that I will be able to remind myself to see the big picture. Maybe it can help you guys, too. - ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/2z7eta/the_easy_way_is_so_much_more_difficult_than_the/", "title": "The \"easy\" way is so much more difficult than the \"hard\" way.
