I was fed up with feeling like an inmate in my own home, and wanted to get out of the house to travel and do what I really want. (I am responsible and financially independent) \n\nI booked my training ticket for a nice vacation but they don't know that I booked it. When I told them about it before, they wanted to be in every second of the trip and for me to pay for everything, yet they will probably try to control everything. \n\nThis is one of the biggest rebellious thing I had ever done and I know this will bring me happiness because I will be going to my dream location. \n\nI am very nervous to how they would react and what they would do. I'm also usually obedient so this is a big step for me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ov8b48/i_decided_to_fight_for_my_happiness/", "title": "I decided to fight for my happiness", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "smiley_rice", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627742375, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ov8b48/i_decided_to_fight_for_my_happiness/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437055.6888878, "replies_charged": false}
