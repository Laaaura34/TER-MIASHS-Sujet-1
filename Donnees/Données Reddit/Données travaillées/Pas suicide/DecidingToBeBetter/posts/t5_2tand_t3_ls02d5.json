So they pretended to be like everything was fine but fighting with each other and one time my mom stabbed my dad. We also had to escape sometimes because our dad was violent BPD drunk. I was also screamed at for throwing my mom\u2019s booze down the drain. \n\nThen my father died from cancer when I was 14 years old. I was also bullied at school for my religion and other stuff. \n\nThings started to looking up but then in 2017 my stepdad killed himself and I tried to revive him but couldn\u2019t. \nI had to go to a mental hospital. \n\nThen I was addicted to drugs and alcohol, also had a HORRIBLE anxiety and depression. \n\nThen at end of 2019 my brother didn\u2019t answer his phone. He had overdosed and died. \n\nNow it\u2019s 2021 and I\u2019m sober, I exercise, I meditate, I stretch, I do breathing exercises and cold showers and I listen to audiobooks. I got a new medication for my ADD, OCD and anxiety and depression. \n\nYesterday I realized I was dancing to music and I felt so good! \n\nThanks for reading.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ls02d5/the_moment_you_realize_youre_dancing_to_music/", "title": "The moment you realize you\u2019re dancing to music after a years & years of battling with depression and anxiety.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "PowerfulPrimate93", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 351, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614234479, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ls02d5/the_moment_you_realize_youre_dancing_to_music/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437299.5276628, "replies_charged": false}
