It still wouldn't matter.) \n\nGetting a job is a nightmare for me. No matter what I try to do or advice I get, nothing works. \n\nI have gone to 2 job training programs, been on many interviews, and applied for many jobs. \n\nI was super close to getting one job at a hotel because I got interviewed 2 times there and I knew some people that could help me. But I still didn't get the job. \n\nIt doesn't help that my family gives me crap for not having a job and call me lazy or just give me crap all the time. \n\nEverytime I see \"now hiring\" I just feel hopeless knowing that I won't get the job. \n\nI feel like people who look at me or hear my voice are thinking their is something wrong with me. I think it mostly has to do with my voice. \n\nI also tried to make a Youtube channel to earn money but my channel is not doing well either. \n\nI don't know what to do.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/poqbds/i_hate_looking_for_a_job_no_one_will_hire_me/", "title": "I hate looking for a job, no one will hire me.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Bill-Fusion", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 572, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631713158, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/poqbds/i_hate_looking_for_a_job_no_one_will_hire_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436956.978997, "replies_charged": false}
