I\u2019ve been studying since last year to take this exam, and hopefully, I\u2019ll pass and have a chance to enter college this year. I\u2019m nervous and excited because my old man helped me with the money for the test and I can\u2019t fail, I need the diploma for a better job so I can pay him haha Anyway, wish me luck Reddit and hope everyone is doing okay\n\nEDIT 1: OMG this exploded hahaha THANK YOU SO MUCH EVERYONE for your kind words and wishes, I just got back home, I\u2019ll try to answer everyone.\n\nJust quick notes: some of you mentioned GED, which I know because of *Shameless US* hahaha but I'm not from the US, I\u2019m from Mexico. Someone commented a TIL about the US high school diplomas, I\u2019m not informed about your education system for adults who want to finish school. In Mexico, there\u2019s two options to finish high school: taking the global test (CENEVAL) in one day which is the one that I took, or enroll in \u201copen high school\u201d which is around 24 exams BUT you take them when you want and you can repeat them if you fail or want a better grade. It takes around a year to finish and the exams occur during the weekends, so is a better fit for people who work. Either one gives you a high school diploma.\n\nFinally, I get my results on June 18th, so I\u2019ll update that day in another post :3", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mxzbkq/so_torrowow_is_the_big_day/", "title": "So torrowow is the big day", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SchattenJaggerD", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2168, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619319356, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mxzbkq/so_torrowow_is_the_big_day/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437445.9593823, "replies_charged": false}
