Then lockdown happened which gave me the huge advantage of not being at the pub, around friends who smoke, and all the other mental triggers.\n\nNow that people are starting to see each other again, I have been tempted in those moments where its sunny and friends are drinking beers in the park. But even then I have held on and committed to not letting myself slip up because it is never 'just one drag'.\n\nI honestly didn't think I had the willpower. Turns out I do and I'm so proud.\n\nWell done me :)\n\nEDIT: Thank you!
