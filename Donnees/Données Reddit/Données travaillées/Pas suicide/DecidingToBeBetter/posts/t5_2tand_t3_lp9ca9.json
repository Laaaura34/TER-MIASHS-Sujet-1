But personal finance is definitely a challenge. \n\nSo that\u2019s what ill be working. \nI decided that i\u2019ll focus in improving myself everyday. \n\nGonna first start by tracking my expenses everyday, and reading just 5 mins of personal finance everyday. \n\nOver time, this would be compound and hopefully ill get closer towards financial freedom. \n\nWish me luck!\n\n***\nReference\n[Original idea from this video: How to achieve financial freedom at young age](https://youtu.be/AmwbZ_9URs8)\n\n\n***\n\nIs anyone else doing something similar?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lp9ca9/i_decided_that_i_will_get_1_better_everyday_at/", "title": "I decided that I will get 1% better everyday at personal finance.
