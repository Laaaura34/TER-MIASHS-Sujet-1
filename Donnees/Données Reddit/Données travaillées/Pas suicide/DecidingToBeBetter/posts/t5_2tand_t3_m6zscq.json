In it, I was smiling, but I remember that day so well. \n\nI remember it because I fit into a size small shirt for one of the first times & I felt like I was finally worthy of being liked in some way, but I was also still clinging to hatred & self-loathing in many others. \n\nOn St Patty\u2019s Day in 2012 I went to the city for my first & last time for the parade. I constantly wondered if everyone I was with would think I was cool. The adderall & drinking help that feeling a lot though. The disordered eating made sure I didn\u2019t take up too much space. \n\nI looked at the picture and felt so much love for 2012 Erin because to feel sorry for her would just bring back old habitual ways of navigating for me. I see her. I see her struggles. I see her thought patterns and I feel compassion. I forgive her for not thinking she was worthy. I love her for everything she is going through internally. And most of all, I honor her & am grateful to her. \n\nI used to think that everything I did wasn\u2019t good enough. But I now see that the girl who was always searching for ways to love herself is the reason I am where I am now. I didn\u2019t know how to get to self-love at that moment, but I do now because I was curious enough to try different things and figure out they didn\u2019t work and maybe something else would. \n\nI didn\u2019t know that on that day, 9 years later, I would be a completely different person. I didn\u2019t know that the path I would take would lead me to self-discovery, forgiveness, compassion, and so much love. \n\nBut it did. \nAnd I am forever grateful for how far I\u2019ve come.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m6zscq/just_because_you_dont_know_where_youre_going/", "title": "Just because you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t get somewhere beautiful.
