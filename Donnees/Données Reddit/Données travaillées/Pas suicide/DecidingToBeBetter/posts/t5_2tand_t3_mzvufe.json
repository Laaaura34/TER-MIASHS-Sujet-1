If you are finding that difficult, here are 10 tips to help you get started.   \n \n\n1. You don\u2019t have to do your daily exercise in 1 go; you can spread it out throughout the day, such as 10 minutes in the morning, mid-day, and night.\n2. Find a gym buddy because a workout partner always helps in boosting your motivation and following through on targets.\n3. Transform your daily walks to be brisker. Say, you are walking to the grocery store; imagine you are late and speed it up a little.\n4. Thinking about having a meal; it is better to work out before eating! Go for a quick run before lunch.\n5. Allow technology to support your initiative. Getting a pedometer, an Apple Watch, or any device where you can track your progress could be helpful.\n6. Finding no time to work out? A great way to make time is to cut back on screen time and use that free space for your workout.\n7. Convert resting hours into a mini workout opportunity. For instance, pull up your desk to do your work standing, or do mini pull-ups while watching TV.\n8. Look into fitness classes in your local gym or find a nearby studio if you think the structure would help keep you going.\n9. Clear a daily time for your scheduled physical activity and add that to your calendar.\n10. Give yourself prizes for completing short-term goals!  \nr/Insumo", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mzvufe/easy_exercise_habit_tips_for_wellbeing_and/", "title": "Easy Exercise Habit Tips for Wellbeing and Positivity", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "InsumoApp", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619550029, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mzvufe/easy_exercise_habit_tips_for_wellbeing_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436273.3669171, "replies_charged": false}
