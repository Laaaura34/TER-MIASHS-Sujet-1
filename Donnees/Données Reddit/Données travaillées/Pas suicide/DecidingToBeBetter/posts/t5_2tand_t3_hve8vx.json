I was diagnosed with mild OCD and one of my compulsions includes very random and casual sex with strangers. I just couldn't resist. I hurt many people because I used them and had no regrets. I didn't care about their feelings, only about the pleasure. \n\nLast year I promised myself to become a better person. I focused on my personal and career goals. It was extremely hard, because first 8 weeks without sex was a huge torture for me. I couldn't focus, my body was shivering, I felt turned on most of the time.\n\nBut I did it. I started controlling my compulsion. It took time, but I'm feeling better now. I no longer feel anxious and can talk to men without having any dirty fantasies. I'm feeling free in some weird way.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hve8vx/365_days_without_casual_sex_helped_me_to_beat_my/", "title": "365 Days Without Casual Sex Helped Me To Beat My Sex Addiction", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "m4dw0r1d", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 123, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1595360465, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hve8vx/365_days_without_casual_sex_helped_me_to_beat_my/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437772.420207, "replies_charged": false}
