I didn't smoke weed today.\n\nSeems silly I know. 12 hours without smoking doesn't sound like much of an achievement when I write it down. But after telling myself \"Todays the day\" for months, it was finally happened.\n\nI won't bore you with the details of another depressed person leaning on addiction to cope and self-medicate. To be completely honest, even if shared my story  it isn't all that exciting. A privileged person in a privileged position giving up on a privileged life. \n\nNo dramatic fights, no shitty parents or exes. Just me, alone in my apartment, wrestling with who I 'm \"supposed to be\", who I became, and who I'm trying to be tomorrow.\n\nI suppose I wanted to share for the people who feel their problems aren't worth sharing. Its okay if your problems aren't loud and sexy. Its okay if they feel too small to share.\n\nYour progress is as real as your problems. Even if its small. Even if its just 12 hours.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lo4hxu/finally_it_was_today_not_tomorrow/", "title": "Finally it was today.
