I was wasting time on YouTube but then I called my Very good friend from college. Context- I rarely call people and most of the time even avoid the calls when I am sad and in my bad habits state. \nWe talked for about 3 hours. Discussed our problems and current life issues. It felt very good to call her. I realised whenever I am in that state of wasting time and procrastination I avoid meeting people or calling them or visiting some place. But getting into contact with reality, with people is very important to get one out of that loop. Being in isolation won't help to get out of that loop. After the call I studied for 2 and half hours. Still have a lot to study though. Looks like it's time for me to become a robot and study like crazy.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lzgyhy/day_21_of_167days_of_changing_my_bad_habits/", "title": "Day 21 of 167days of changing my bad habits.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "learner_55", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1615083464, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lzgyhy/day_21_of_167days_of_changing_my_bad_habits/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438004.767164, "replies_charged": false}
