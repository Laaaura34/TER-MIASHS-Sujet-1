I\u2019ve decided to do better and be better but how ?\n\nI wish I could take my own advice so bad. So many of us do. I\u2019m an addict of 41 years of age. On and off for the last 20 years. From Heroin to Ritalin. At this moment I\u2019m taking Kratom and a diazepam everyday. To some people that\u2019s not recovery, but without trying to justify or make an excuse ( on ssi for anxiety and depression) and the Kratom some how makes me not want opioids. ( people say it\u2019s an opioid) maybe it is, but it\u2019s not going to kill me.  Anyway my two vices. I\u2019m very proud of myself for how far I have come. I\u2019ve been inspired by so many people and things I have red in r/recovery ( other ones too don\u2019t want to mention, there\u2019s some strict rules on some pages about promoting others and I\u2019m just saying Reddit as a whole is a life saver. \n\nWith my recovery I don\u2019t know what to do.  I need to work out and exercise, eat right, fix up my hygiene and keep it consistent, but how do I make a to do list. \nSimple question I get it\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n\nI am just so overwhelmed now. I can\u2019t say how clean I am from the adderall, heroin, opioids etc. I have slipped in the last 3 month and took the way over prescribed stimulant or nootropic Modafinal. ( I see a huge potential problem with that\u2019s future and abuse ) \n\nHow do I make a to do list? I can\u2019t work or drive right now. I get a check once a month. After my divorce I\u2019m so blessed to say I moved back with my Mom. Better then being homeless I have no shame when it comes to this. \n\nI am on Netflix and Xbox way too much. Well basically that\u2019s all I do. That and I come on Reddit, twitch, messenger the \u201cnormals now\u201d \n\nI do have social anxiety really bad. I mean right now the thought of hanging out with someone I haven\u2019t seen in like 3 years sounds horrifying. Later tonight though or on other days it doesn\u2019t. I just can\u2019t get my priorities straight and I think maybe one person will be able to relate with me and possibly give me some feedback. It\u2019s like I\u2019m in recovery, but not living a sober life. \nI want to be a contributing member of society. I want to get back into school. I\u2019m really finding out who I am now. I was always SOMETHING, but now I\u2019m figuring out how to be somebody. \n\nSo many past mistakes I\u2019m still dealing with. Any help ?
