I\u2019ve lost all my friends, or isolated myself from all of them because after an acid trip or two i started seeing conversations differently and ANALYZE THE FUCK out of all of it, how i say things, or what to even say or what joke to make, it scrambles me. On top of that i don\u2019t do anything fun, i\u2019ve had people introduce me to things i like but i end up only ever doing it once and forgetting about it, such as physical activities or anything. Like i said i don\u2019t get to do anything fun except pay for bowling but the entire time i\u2019m wondering what to say to make it fun for the other person, i\u2019m literally always on edge. I can\u2019t make my girlfriend laugh anymore like when we first met because i\u2019ve forgotten what made her laugh and i change humor a lot for some reason. Ever since i was a kid i made people laugh in the classroom and it\u2019s what made me happy and when i can\u2019t it ruins my entire mood u til i can actually make someone laugh but i haven\u2019t had a deep laugh like those ones that turn your face red since i was a kid wit my dad or something. I never know what to talk about with people and makes me come across as extremely awkward. When i see my future i see it empty and my house being lonely and i know these thoughts lead to bad things but i can\u2019t help it. I used to hang out in groups of people but i\u2019ve since distanced myself from EVERYONE and just smokes weed in my room alone for months. Because when i\u2019m with friends i\u2019m the butt of jokes and don\u2019t know what to say to people and i was supposed to go to party tonight but i haven\u2019t seen anyone those people in like a year and i haven\u2019t nothing new to myself i haven no interests or fun parts to my personality. I usually just agree with people because they say something i agree with but i  was too focused on what to say or how to make that other person laugh. It\u2019s a horrible loop i cannot live with anymore. I steal stories from other people or google, i literally good everything or to reddit for all my problems. I can\u2019t remember what people tell me or anything interesting about them because my head is filled with all this garbage. I don\u2019t have any original jokes i steal them all from google and write them down in m phone because i can\u2019t remember those either. I try and use these jokes in my relationship with my girlfriend who now hates me as well as her father because i gave her covid. And as soon as somebodies mood changes i change and start being very insecure and everything worsens. Besides that i don\u2019t know where i\u2019m going in life my mothers an alcolhic 60 year old who\u2019s stuck at a minimum wage job wasting her life . i have no knowledge of the world or the ability to retain any info, i feel retarded most of the time and can\u2019t co tribute to conversations hardly. I get jealous when i hear other people conversing and having a good time because i can\u2019t. I get jealius when other people get a laugh from people and i can\u2019t freestyle regardless of the hours dedicated to it and speaking is just as bad. I don\u2019t know how to take control in bed and be dominant and it makes for an awkward time. i OBSESS OVER EVERYTHING AND IM TIRED OF IT. I\u2019m poot and don\u2019t know how to get money and i wish i could say i just want to do something that makes me happy and makes a difference in the world but i don\u2019t know what that is in me. I\u2019m a moron with money and did horrible in school and just showed up high everyday, i still haven\u2019t graduated and my girlfriend in college wants me to move out and figure out what to do in my life but i\u2019m so stuck, yet i waste every single day doing things i don\u2019t want to do and just being depressed. i end up obsessing over jokes and how to make people laugh. Just so they like me again, i it i end up forgetting how to be funny and forget jokes so i wrote them all down it\u2019s insane. and don\u2019t even get started with texting it\u2019s even worse and even more boring especially when i\u2019m getting bad vibes from that person. SOMEBODY PLASE HELP I CANNOT LIVE LIKE THIS. Sorry if typos my phone cannot handle all these words and is glitched.\n\n\nThank you all for the replies, i\u2019m going to go through them tonight when i\u2019m off work and reply to them all, I deeply appreciate it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p0byal/i_dont_see_myself_ever_being_happy/", "title": "I don\u2019t see myself ever being happy", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LooseToday110", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628416580, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p0byal/i_dont_see_myself_ever_being_happy/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436447.9349334, "replies_charged": false}
