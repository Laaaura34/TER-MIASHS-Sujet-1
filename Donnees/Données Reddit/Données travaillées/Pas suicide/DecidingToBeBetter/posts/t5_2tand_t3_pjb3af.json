I'd been thinking about leaving for a while now. Though recently it's become more clear that leaving is my only option. So when I got a job offer out of state I took it. Bought a bus ticket and last Saturday night I was on the bus headed for a new opportunity. I just made it here today! Getting settled in. Start work tomorrow morning. I'm pretty excited. Slightly scared also. Never been this far from home. I'm completely on my own.. I can feel that I need to change. Im soft. I'm too nice. I can tell if I don't harden up people are gonna take advantage of me. They've already tired a couple times. I'm learning. Adapting. Eventually I'll be a whole new person. Looking forward to this new life. A better me is just around the corner!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjb3af/left_home_for_better_life/", "title": "Left home for better life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lamp_hustler", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630970783, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjb3af/left_home_for_better_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435136.063797, "replies_charged": false}
