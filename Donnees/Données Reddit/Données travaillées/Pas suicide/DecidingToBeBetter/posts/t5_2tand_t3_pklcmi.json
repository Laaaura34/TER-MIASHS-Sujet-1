I was loving how I looked, how I felt. My mental health was better, my physical health was better. I lost 40 pounds in 9 months. \n\nThen covid happened. The gyms closed. My mental health went to shit. I stopped caring, I started taking SSRI\u2019s that made me gain a crazy amount of weight. My motivation was gone. \n\n2 weeks ago I finally decided I wanted to stop hating myself. I wanted to look in the mirror again and be able to call myself beautiful. \n\nMy weight has ALWAYS been a hard thing for me to love. I\u2019ve gained 20 pounds in the last year. \n\nWell for 2 weeks straight now I\u2019ve been back to working out every day. It unfortunately isn\u2019t powerlifting yet, and maybe not ever again. But it\u2019s something. I swim, walk, bike, do 20-30 minute all body workouts. \n\nI\u2019m trying to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I know the weight isn\u2019t going to come off overnight, but I\u2019m trying to keep my motivation. \n\n\n\nTLDR: I\u2019m finally trying to be at a healthy weight again by working out after a year away from the gym.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pklcmi/i_am_so_tired_of_looking_in_the_mirror_and_hating/", "title": "I am so tired of looking in the mirror and hating what I see", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lyssssa6", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1631142151, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pklcmi/i_am_so_tired_of_looking_in_the_mirror_and_hating/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435374.3553247, "replies_charged": false}
