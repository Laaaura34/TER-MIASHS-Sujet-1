Honestly being here has helped me to realize that my goal of \u201crunning every morning\u201d is nice but not currently realistic. It IS realistic for me to go on a slow, 10-15 minute walk each morning, just for me. So writing this from my walk, knowing y\u2019all are with me out here. Thanks.\n\nEdit: Wow, thanks guys! My first silver. Went on another walk again today when I woke up and saw you all cheering me on.
