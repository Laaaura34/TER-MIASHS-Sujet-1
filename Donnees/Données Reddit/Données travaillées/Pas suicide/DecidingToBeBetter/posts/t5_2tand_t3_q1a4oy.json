I do suffer from and am on meds for depression and anxiety, but like how does everyone keep up with their lives so well? When one part of life is going well (ie getting enough sleep) I\u2019m eating like shit, or if I\u2019m eating well I\u2019m not finding time to exercise\u2026or if I\u2019m doing all those things\u2026I have no time to rest and I get burnt out! It\u2019s a destructive cycle! How does one find balance and actually take care of themselves? This is so hard, one day I want to have kids with my boyfriend, but I feel like if I can\u2019t take care of myself\u2014- I can\u2019t take care of anyone else! :(", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1a4oy/how_do_i_keep_up/", "title": "How do I keep up?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "historywhiz63", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 15, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633368097, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1a4oy/how_do_i_keep_up/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435231.6024294, "replies_charged": false}
