Got a new job but wasn't qualified enough so I just left. From that moment, I started to think I was unable to do anything and depressed. I don't know why but I just disconnected from the society, not hanging out with friends, barely talking to my family members and just \"disappeared\" from everything. It's been like this for a year, started reading this sub few weeks ago and inspired from all of y'all dedication to be/become \"better\". I just wanted to ask few things from whoever reading this and willing to help,   \n1. How to talk to my friends? ( I mean without talking to them for like a year without reason, I think its weird to pop out of nowhere)   \n2. Want to enjoy life more but how? (I think I'm in a deep dark jungle now haha) \n\n3. Will the society welcome me back? (Just feeling anxious from everything at the moment) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading and feel free to comment anything about my current situation. \n\nSincerely,\n\nA-P-A", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q18fov/what_to_do_and_how_to_proceed_with_my_life/", "title": "What to do and how to proceed with my life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Alfonso-Pisani-Amour", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633363450, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q18fov/what_to_do_and_how_to_proceed_with_my_life/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438312.5997784, "replies_charged": false}
