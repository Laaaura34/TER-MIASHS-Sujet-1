But on my journey to self-fullness I realized that they weren\u2019t the problem; I was.\n\nBy trying to keep the peace in my relationships, I was overlooking the ways in which other people were taking advantage of me. I ignored their twisted priorities because I thought I should play nice all the time.\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that sometimes the better, more loving choice is the more uncomfortable, anxiety provoking one. Truly loving behavior calls for limits, boundaries, and saying no every once in a while.\n\nSome people will get upset with you or throw a tantrum like a two-year-old, but the cost of ignoring your boundaries is much greater than that. So stop thinking that keeping the peace is better for your relationships. The truth is it\u2019s much better to be honest and upfront.\"", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n0vant/i_am_a_recovering_peoplepleaser_the_below_article/", "title": "I am a Recovering People-Pleaser.
