I\u2019m a better parent now. I\u2019m a better person again. I feel good things again. My ptsd and trauma has taken a serious toll on myself and my life. \n\nThree months ago I was planning on eating a bottle of pills and greeting the big sleep, finally. I had completely given up my fight. I had completely lost the will to go on, therapy was my last attempt to find an escape from everything in my heart. And I am finding it. I\u2019m finally winning.\n\nEdit: I woke up to a jillion notifications wow thanks guys you are all really sweet and thank you so much for the kind words, Reddit has really become a safe and special place for me lately and I\u2019ve met some of the most wonderful, WONDERFUL people. :,) you\u2019re all the best, thank you for being you\n\nEdit: therapy has basically gently shown me where my lens is incorrect, it\u2019s helping me change my perspective and HOW I think and see people and value. It\u2019s arming me with emotional coping skills, it\u2019s helping me heal from many years of physical and emotional abuse by deconstructing the people and feelings behind it. As miss Tammy says, when you have this emotion you must sit down with it and pour it a cup of tea, you must explore it. Identify, accept, manage. And also the five basic needs have been taught to me as well. I\u2019m learning to fully and functionally handle my impulsions and explosive emotions and adhd complications without any meds and I\u2019m very lucky to have found the perfect lady to help me at just the second therapist I was switched to. I am fortunate to be a quick learner, she is merely placing the seeds in my lovely brain, and eventually the pieces click with me and I understand things a lot better. I can\u2019t say everyone will have this luck, but if you go in willing to change and willing to see your past mistakes and not repeat them then you will come out even stronger.\n\nBut the most important thing, yesterday is YESTERDAY: today is today. Today is where the growth begins and you can\u2019t focus on today if you live constantly in yesterday and fight or flight. Changing and growing is painful and hard, but if you face those hard parts you will come out on top. I have faith in each and every one of you. I believe now whole heartedly how much people can grow and change, don\u2019t give up on yourself and others\ud83d\udc96", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mwllvz/ive_been_in_therapy_for_two_months_now_and_my/", "title": "I\u2019ve been in therapy for two months now and my entire life has changed", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "whyamIonly5fttall", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1143, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619146272, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mwllvz/ive_been_in_therapy_for_two_months_now_and_my/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436614.9771845, "replies_charged": false}
