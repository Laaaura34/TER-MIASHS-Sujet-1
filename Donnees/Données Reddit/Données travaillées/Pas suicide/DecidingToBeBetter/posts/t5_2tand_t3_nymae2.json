That opportunity ended their contact with the temp agency, after a few more months I found myself back at the original warehouse. After a few months again they came to me with an offer to work under them instead of the temp agency, they offered me my currant rate of pay. I questioned why I wasn't getting a raise and they gave me some bs about how now I'll have benefits. I declined. My supervisor asked why and I told them because of the labor shortage in my area, I could easily do better. My supervisor immediately went to the head honcho, told them to do better because they can't afford to lose someone like me (I'm reliable, hard working, and competent. Finding someone competent is apparently very hard to do for some reason). The next day I was offered the same position but an extra $1.50/hour.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nymae2/knew_what_i_was_worth_and_asked_for_a_raise_i_got/", "title": "Knew what I was worth and asked for a raise.
