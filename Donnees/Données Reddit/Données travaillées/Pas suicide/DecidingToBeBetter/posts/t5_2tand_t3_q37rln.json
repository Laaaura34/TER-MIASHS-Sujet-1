I use to drink in my 20s, not every day. Somewhere in my 30a I just stopped, it wasn't hard either. But I noticed some things that were $39.99 for long time like Crown Royal 1.75L. Now it's like $43.99 or something.\n\nCompanies just want your money, that's all. Plus I like food a lot better. Even the soda 20oz are getting out of hand.\n\nIf it's not needed, save your money.  But I do honestly think if enough people were to start voting with their wallets, then maybe prices would come down at some point. Am I the only one?\n\n\nEdit 1: I might've confused people that I drink alot or I stopped because of the price increase. I stopped drinking because it just wasn't fun anymore and I like food a lot more. However other examples are PS5 games costing $10 more. Wait til the games go on sale, which a lot of people do anyway.\n\nI just think it's crazy the prices have gone up the way they have. I told my mom I'd make steaks one night, I should've checked the prices. I didn't chicken out, I bought a 2 pack of ribeyes for $29.02 and that was at Walmart.\n\nBut even candy is getting out of hand. Didn't a king size use to be $1?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q37rln/start_voting_with_your_wallet/", "title": "Start voting with your wallet.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "FlavoredButtHair", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 51, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633608853, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q37rln/start_voting_with_your_wallet/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436763.7088094, "replies_charged": false}
