I think here fits better.\n\n  \n\n\nThere was a relationship, and then there wasn't. That hurt for a long time. Then there was sex, with the same person, and that was fine and fun. They knew I still had feelings for them, and I was fool enough to forgive.\n\n  \n\n\nThen came the nasty messages, and that hurt too. Once the apology came, I once again forgave.\n\n  \n\n\nTwo nights ago, he's set to sleep with someone else. I asked him not to, rightly or wrongly. Now I'm the bad person, for having feelings.\n\n  \n\n\nI'm hurting badly, and I know it's my fault for being soft.
