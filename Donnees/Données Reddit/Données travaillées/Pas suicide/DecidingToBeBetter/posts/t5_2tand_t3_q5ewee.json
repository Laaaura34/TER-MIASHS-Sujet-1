So my bf and I broke up and in the process he told me I need to be more confident, love myself more. \n\nI don't know how to do that. I love others, i adore others, life is lived for others in my book and hopefully they do the same so i get some love too.. shouldn't it be like a corresponding act of love, respect, care etc between human beings (in different levels according to what relationship)? \n\nIf i Google it, they say ways to love yourself are: \"light up a candle, treat yourself, meditate, take care of your body, do daily affirmations..\" yeah, bruh, i do all that but still. \n\nHow does one truly develops confidence and self love, without being delusional or ending up being selfish?\n\nThank you", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ewee/loving_myself_but_how/", "title": "loving myself but HOW?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "rapashrapash", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 235, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633894152, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ewee/loving_myself_but_how/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436940.0411303, "replies_charged": false}
