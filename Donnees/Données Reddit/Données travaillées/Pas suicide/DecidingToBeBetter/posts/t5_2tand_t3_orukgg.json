Considering that I am a heavy drinker and I find it so difficult to get of from the carousell but I did it!   \n\n\nI've not felt so completed for years. The most significant change is my weight which has dropped from 106kg to 84kg. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know and I actually don't care if I'm gonna drink ever again. All I know is if i don't drink today I can do it again tomorrow. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for the attention. \n\nAll the best", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/orukgg/six_months_sober_today/", "title": "Six months sober today!", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Kleimps", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 200, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627288148, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/orukgg/six_months_sober_today/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436126.9936185, "replies_charged": false}
