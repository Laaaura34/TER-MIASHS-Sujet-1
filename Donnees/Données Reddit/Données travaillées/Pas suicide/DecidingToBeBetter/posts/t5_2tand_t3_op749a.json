It used to only be in regards to my schoolwork. I wouldn't study, wouldn't do my homework, and wouldn't try. It's been getting a lot worse lately\u2014 I went off my depression medication, I've started shoplifting, and I keep flirting and getting involved with people who I know are/will be terrible for me. I drink a lot more and I smoke way more weed than I used to. I got suspended from college a couple months ago, but my mom and my brother helped me a lot, and I wrote an appeal letter and was readmitted. I've failed both of them so badly since then. I don't even know how to approach this situation. I want to get better, but every time I try to, I always fail and immediately revert back to my self destructive ways. I'm not quite sure where I originally went wrong; I used to be gifted and smart. Now it's like that's barely even a memory of who I used to be. I can't seem to stop crying, and I can't sleep. The thought of my future terrifies and overwhelms me because I feel like such a failure.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/op749a/how_do_i_stop_my_self_destructive_behavior/", "title": "How do I stop my self destructive behavior?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Cornfritatta", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 66, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1626930077, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/op749a/how_do_i_stop_my_self_destructive_behavior/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436825.7099652, "replies_charged": false}
