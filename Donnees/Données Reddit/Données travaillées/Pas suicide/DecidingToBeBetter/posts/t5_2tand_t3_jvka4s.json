Since day I I\u2019ve been struggling to be motivated in school bc I don\u2019t really think I knew what I was getting into, but I just couldn\u2019t pass up a free Masters (public policy) in good conscience. \n\nBut I\u2019m failing on pretty much all cylinders. Despite unfortunate combo of imposter syndrome, burnout (I went full time, straight from undergrad), undiagnosed adhd and some other mild-to-moderate issues, I\u2019ve been able to get by with mostly B\u2019s and B+\u2019s (one A) thus far. but there\u2019s this *one freaking required class* that always starts off well n then I fuck up majorly mid semester n end up being about to bomb it, so I withdraw. This is my *third straight semester* of being in the same class, same position and I am humiliated. It\u2019s just endless frustration here. I don\u2019t want to be here. the ppl I\u2019ve met and the situations I\u2019ve been in as a result of moving for grad school have been great but I really resent the academic experience itself, especially since going remote. \n\nAnd my personal life seems impossible to manage. Everything is either inconsistent, shit, or consistently shit - the state of my room, my hygiene, my exercising, my ability to explore creative interests, my diet. I have nothing to be proud of besides staying alive and even that seems like a waste when I just let life pass me by. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m wasting my time in school and I\u2019m so ashamed of how little I\u2019m taking from an experience that was literally dropped in my lap. I\u2019m terrified of having to job hunt after this, especially because I KNOW I cannot do remote work indefinitely (n that\u2019s what it\u2019s looking like in the US). I\u2019m honestly lucky if I can compete for jobs, given my lack of experience and expertise. Im good at writing n working w/kids, & I\u2019m curious about a lot of fields that allow me to work w/my hands or explore diff modes of self help n self knowledge/expression. But everything requires more school and I\u2019m so burnt out from school. Plus it just makes me feel guilty from having done *so much school* and still having studied nothing that I actually love. \n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do. Even though the ppl in my corner say they\u2019re proud of me or try to keep me encouraged I\u2019m sure they\u2019re really judging me and wondering why I make my life so hard. Idek myself. I want to be happy and just have the freedom to do things that make me happy - learn to skate, learn instruments, read more, write more. I honestly don\u2019t care what kind of job I have to work through if I can at least hang my hat at the end of the day and not have deadlines and essays weighing on my psyche every waking moment. I just feel so trapped. I want to learn how to lock into a future focus that at least makes it seem worth it & keeps me motivated to try despite the fatigue.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jvka4s/a_21_yo_ball_of_shame_and_wasted_opportunity/", "title": "a 21 y/o ball of shame and wasted opportunity", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "StaleBlueBread", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1605578339, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jvka4s/a_21_yo_ball_of_shame_and_wasted_opportunity/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437851.0604517, "replies_charged": false}
