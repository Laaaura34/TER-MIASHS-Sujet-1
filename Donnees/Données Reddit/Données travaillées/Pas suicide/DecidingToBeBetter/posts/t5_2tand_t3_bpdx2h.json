However, yesterday I realized that there a couple of items I forgot to buy before embarking on this mission. \nAlso took a hard look at my life insurance policy and realized that i owe a couple of months. Nothing to worry about tho, I didn\u2019t give it much thought. \n\nFast forward to today, my rent invoice comes in and I\u2019m supposed to pay less than usual. Immediately my mind raced to the beauty aisle, I could almost feel the products in my hands! \n\nIn the midst of all the excitement in my head about the potential of buying these items, there was a quiet voice that reminding me of the balance on my policy. \nThere and then, I decided to transfer the money towards the policy & forget about the makeup I so dearly wanted! \n\nWhat I didn\u2019t expect was the immense pride I feel-I delayed gratification, ignored my \u201cvalid\u201d reasons for spending the money, and put the money towards a \u201cnon-urgent\u201d issue. \u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\n\nYo anyone that\u2019s on the journey towards becoming better, when faced with your desired action and the norm/bad habit, ACT.
