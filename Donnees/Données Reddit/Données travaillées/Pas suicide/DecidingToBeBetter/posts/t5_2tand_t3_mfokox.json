I feel like my emotions are getting out of hand sometimes. I'm trying to be nice, ask questions during conversations to show that I care about the stuff we're talking about, but recently it got harder for me to keep PMA.\n\nI'm having some family-related issues. Sometimes it's better, sometimes worse. There is not much I can do about it, no matter how much it hurts. I feel like because of that I can't focus on having fun and I'm getting mad much easier. \n\nI don't want my friends to deal with that part of me. How to stay positive in situations when you think can't be positive? \n\nI'm mad at myself for being sassy whenever for example I'm losing in a stupid video game... or even when someone shares a similar interest to mine and is hyped about something, it instantly puts me in \"sassy\" mode. I don't know how to describe it better...\n\nThanks for any advice in advance!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mfokox/how_to_stay_positive_and_treat_my_friends_better/", "title": "How to stay positive and treat my friends better?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Kany_", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 21, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617021181, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mfokox/how_to_stay_positive_and_treat_my_friends_better/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435107.911726, "replies_charged": false}
