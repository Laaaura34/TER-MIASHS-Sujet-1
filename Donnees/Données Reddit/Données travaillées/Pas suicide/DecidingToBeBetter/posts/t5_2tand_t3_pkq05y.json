Knowing that literally anything could change in a matter of seconds is anxiety inducing. Loss hurts. Change takes time and effort. And sometimes you just don\u2019t want to put in the effort anymore.

Despite all the pain you\u2019ve encountered, you found a way to survive. Maybe not in the healthiest of ways,  but the fact that you keep trying is really amazing. And I\u2019m proud of you.
