I listen to daily stoic and try to reflect on myself, my purpose and my life. I know I am one of those people who are emotionally aware but I want to be able to separate it especially when it comes to decisions. You don\u2018t always have to wait for that feeling of inspiration or motivation to get up every morning, all you have to do is just start and do it. Face the day, place in your journal a to do list. Be it small or big, it is still nice to have a goal. Also journalling has helped me sort out my emotions and helped me to express it in a healthy way rather than misdirecting it at people or an object, which usually gets me in to trouble. Being grateful and counting blessings is also helpful. I may not be where I want right now but I know I will get there. Daily awareness and improvement is better than none at all.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mb8p3r/journalling_setting_goals_and_selfreflection/", "title": "Journalling, setting goals and self-reflection", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "snowbearygirl12", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616482175, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mb8p3r/journalling_setting_goals_and_selfreflection/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435577.5328593, "replies_charged": false}
