I have a shitty job that is ruining my body physically; I rarely brush my teeth; I only shower when I have to go outside; I don't have a driver's license even though I applied twice and am currently on my second try and I barely study to take the written test... I don't clean the house, I'm just shut inside pratically all the time, even before the epidemic.\n\n\nWhat do I do... How do I find a purpose. I just feel like laying back on my bed and watch tv series or play video-games.\n\n\nI should have gone shopping today, but I have enough to make a shitty simple dinner, enough to keep me fed - just pasta and canned tuna. I don't even feel like getting up to do it, and I still need to do the dishes, clean the pan so I can cook the pasta.\n\n\nI can't get better on my own.
