I seem to have a high disgust/ sensory aversion to food or just be hyper sensitive and easily disturbed that I don't know if it's something that I can change. But I will say I'm proud of myself to have gotten through so much with it, and to also be trying to get food in so I could work out now too. Like when I look at what I'm lifting, and at other people, and then at myself and realize that I was still here even when I had issues even eating I was on top of the world because who would still show up like I do. \n\nThis idea has crossed my mind many times but if I could find a way to balance eating with people maybe I could begin to assimilate back into more meaningful connections with people. And because of the fear surrounding these issues, and the need to consume food I found that the only way for me was to isolate. \n\nThat does put me at a dead end though since it seems like I can only go into something long-term to work on this issue if it is even possible. \n\nAnyone relate or has ideas if recovery is possible and what it looks like?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n7y2hv/my_issues_with_eating_isolated_me_tw_eating/", "title": "My issues with eating isolated me TW: Eating Disorder", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Fabulous-Advantage", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1620506662, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n7y2hv/my_issues_with_eating_isolated_me_tw_eating/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435290.4785194, "replies_charged": false}
