It's more of an experiment, and it's for mainly for me.\n\nI'm finally going to give myself some proper credit,which is something I've been neglecting for a long time, and it shows.\n\nI've just finished running my 4km, at a respectable pace of 6:39m/km. I'm gradually trying to increase the distance, starting from 3km. My health is increasing greatly because of this. I have more stamina, a better figure, and an excellent blood pressure. I am doing this for my future self, which will thank me. My arms are stout as tree trunks from all those push-ups too. \n\nI can feel the resistance. As I'm writing this, I'm thinking. \"this is ridiculous. What's the point of writing this out.\" but I know there is a point to it. Baby steps. I'm moving forward. Let this be an inspiration to keep improving different parts of my life. Focus #1: become as witty and quick thinking as I can. I am capable, and I deserve it. I am comming closer and closer to my dream self and I encourage everyone to do the same. If you'd like some tips or anything else, feel free to hit me up! \n\nP. S. If anyone knows good subs for this kind of journaling, I'd be very grateful.
