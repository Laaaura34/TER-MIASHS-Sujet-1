For most of my life (I\u2019m 30 now) I had insatiable appetites for food. In general I was just addicted to a lot of things. Drinking, smoking. Marijuana/nicotine were prolific. But also the need for companionship and sexual fulfillment.\n\nIn 2019 I made a goal to quit smoking. I was done with marijuana for over a year, but I finally tackled nicotine. Took me several tries, but I hit 2.5 years. And then I hit a point where my eating habits were manageable. I realized it\u2019s okay to feel hungry\u2014 and that most important, that eating too much is what was making me crave other things (drinking, smoking) because it was causing such a hard dopamine crash and making me depressed.\n\nErgo, quitting one addiction helped me quit the rest. Smoking made me want to drink and eat. When I quit smoking, drinking became less appealing. After two years, I decided I was done with drinking. Well, my appetite felt more subdued. And now in the last two months, I\u2019ve replaced my time going out to the bars with cycling. And now my appetite feels more manageable. I\u2019m laying in bed at 1:30 AM hungry, but not that buzzed hungry where I\u2019m insatiable and am putting on my slippers to grab a happy meal.\n\nI\u2019m excited to see where this takes me. I haven\u2019t been living a clean life style ever since I hit my 20s. Now all I do that I consider \u201caddictive\u201d is video games, but I set aside time for it twice a week, and it\u2019s the last thing I do. Errands, family time, and personal exercise comes first. It\u2019s my reward for a long week.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjhwqr/i_feel_like_i_finally_getting_my_addictive/", "title": "I feel like I finally getting my addictive personality under control.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "JGWol", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 24, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630998113, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjhwqr/i_feel_like_i_finally_getting_my_addictive/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436711.535162, "replies_charged": false}
