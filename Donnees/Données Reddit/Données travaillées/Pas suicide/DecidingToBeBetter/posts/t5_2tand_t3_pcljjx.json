Feet are a little soar but not bad.  \n\nJust looked up and 5 miles is a little over 10,000 steps.  They also say 10k steps is what you should aim for everyday, so even if I lay on the coach all day, I still did it!! \n\nThe day is off to a great start.  Gonna have a healthy shake right now for breakfast, some chicken chili for lunch, and then I have fish defrosting right now for dinner that I\u2019m gonna pair with some roasted asparagus that I just found out this week that I absolutely love and it\u2019s delicious.
