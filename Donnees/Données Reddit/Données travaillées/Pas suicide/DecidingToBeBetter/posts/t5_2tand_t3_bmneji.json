We're blissful in our current state and culture, which quite frankly is pretty great. We have awesome food and festivals year-round. One thing I find concerning is that people here don't really seem to push themselves in any capacity to make something of themselves. My friend group sort of has this same mentality adopted as well. They're some of the best people in the world and I love them to death but I find myself being the only one trying to do things that better myself. I've been pretty successful with this overall with my physical activity and career but I feel like just being around people so complacent with themselves is hampering me more than if I was surrounded by people (even strangers) that are seeking to do awesome things with their lives. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIm more or less curious what you guys think and if anyone had a similar position where they found moving to another, more progressive city helped propel them forward.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bmneji/my_city_is_complacent_and_i_think_its_stifling_my/", "title": "My city is complacent and I think its stifling my potential", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "figgup", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1557426865, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bmneji/my_city_is_complacent_and_i_think_its_stifling_my/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435639.1635969, "replies_charged": false}
