Firstly with my time, I would like to take some time to give myself some self-care. If always been fond of this community and pondering if you have any suggestions on how to make that possible I would appreciate it. I've been journaling for a couple of years now and the past couple of months I've been logging fewer entries in it. Life has been crazy since lockdown eased. I don't want to mope around for 10 days. I would like to keep congnativly active and create a road map of how I can improve. I will probably read a lot when the fatigue and my cognitive ability comes back. \n\nSecondly, seeing as I'm alone for 10 days with my girlfriend out of town or anyone to talk to. I'd like to spark a few conversations with people on this sub. Talk about their habits trade advice and just converse as humans in a crazy world.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfbg4l/having_covid_and_bringing_my_life_to_a_standstill/", "title": "Having COVID and bringing my life to a standstill, I'd like to reflect and converse with people.
