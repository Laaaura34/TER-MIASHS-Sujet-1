It\u2019s a very bad problem for me and it\u2019s ruining my entire life. All day my head tells me what a piece of shit I am and that I deserve to die. My brain even finds a way to blame myself even the good things and the things that aren\u2019t my fault. I\u2019ve made a lot of decisions to be better lately, but among the most important ones is deciding to go to therapy. \n\nI\u2019ve been to therapy maybe 6 months and yesterday I finally said that I was proud of myself for doing something brave. It just slipped out, and it was the first time i\u2019ve ever said it\u2026 and the crazy part is I actually believe it ! I\u2019ve thought about dropping therapy a lot but the latest session was very memorable. I\u2019m far from healthy yet though. I\u2019m still trying to rise above my pain and get through my depression, but that single moment - the moment when I said I was proud of myself gave me so much more hope than I could ever muster internally. I sincerely hope to be healthy soon, since it feels I have wasted so much of my teenage years hating myself.
