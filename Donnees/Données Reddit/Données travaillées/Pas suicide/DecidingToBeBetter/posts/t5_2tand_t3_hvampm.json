I used to smoke it nightly and always felt like I needed to smoke to sleep. Well, turns out I sleep just fine and even better without it! I recently bought myself an Apple Watch to help track my workouts, and have been completing my goals and filling my rings daily! I\u2019ve never felt better, and more motivated to become my healthiest fittest self, and that includes taking a break from weed! I do drink alcohol, although not nightly, maybe 2 times a week when I see my friends and have a get together. Last night I did get drunk, and I am not proud of it because I feel guilty and feel like I shouldn\u2019t have gotten as drunk as I did. I wasn\u2019t even at a party, I was at my boyfriends house. I woke up with a foggy head, thankfully not sick though. I need to work on not binge drinking the nights I do drink. My friends want to double date on a patio and get drunk on Thursday, and I\u2019ve decided to not get hammered like I normally would. But besides that, I have not touched the joints I bought last week and I am very proud. One step at a time, little by little, I want to be better.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hvampm/ive_decided_to_take_a_break_from_marijuana_for_a/", "title": "Ive decided to take a break from marijuana for a while.
