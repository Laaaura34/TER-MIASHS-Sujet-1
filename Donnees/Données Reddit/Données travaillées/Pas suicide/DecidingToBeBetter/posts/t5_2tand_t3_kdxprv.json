Two years ago I was a mental wreck and dealing with my emotional/social issues was too hard for just me to do so I finally gritted it and started psychotherapy. The next week I confronted the fragility of my own lack of muscles/poor endurance and started working out three times a week. A couple months later I quit alcohol because it wasn't doing anything for me beyond making it seem like I fit in at 33 (I was never addicted). The next year I stopped bottling up the problems I was having with other people (except speaking to them with my therapist) and expressing them openly on social media to my friends. Two months ago I stopped \"scrolling\" Facebook. Today for the first time I took back control and started a Dextroamphetamine/Amphetamine regimen after years of thinking it was for people who gave up/used to control children.\n\nEvery decision begets yet another. If I never saw my original therapist all those years ago and decided to stick to it, I would have never have decided to get better and better. This year I will celebrate the end with my usual sparkling grape juice, bed on time and new things to look forward to. It is never too late to decide to be better.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kdxprv/two_years_ago_i_started_seeing_a_therapist_hit/", "title": "Two years ago I started seeing a therapist, hit the gym and quit alcohol.
