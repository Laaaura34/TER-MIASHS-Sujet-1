Without self-love there can be no self-respect, and without self-respect you will see no need to continually treat yourself as someone worthy of dignity and compassion. Please don't become a victim of the idea that you will only be worthy of respect once you have attained some distant version of your potential self. Such an approach will never yield satisfaction or joy because your ego will find endless ways to move the goalposts and to invent ever farther versions of you. \n\nThe notion of self-love is often reduced to its most superficial aspects \u2014 warm/fuzzy feelings, superficial mantras and affirmations, and pampering/treating yourself in ways that don't generate lasting changes in the way you perceive yourself. Don't get me wrong, these things can be important at the right time. However, I believe that the practice of self-love and self-respect demands something much more profound. It demands that you really look at yourself in your totality. It demands that you take the good with the bad. It demands an acceptance of the fact that healthy self-criticism is NOT the same as merciless self-loathing.\n\nAre you willing to accept that there is something inherently valuable about you? Are you willing to accept that there your being is fundamentally worthy of respect? Are you willing to accept that there is something undeniably worthy about you despite the many flaws you perceive in yourself? Are you willing to examine yourself objectively and to celebrate your successes (however small they might seem) instead of endlessly focussing on the so-called failures? \n\nSelf-improvement is a noble aim, but it must begin with an unshakeable respect for the thing/person that needs to be improved in the first place. In a certain sense, your potential self is already a part of you, and it must be honoured.\n\nSelf-love isn't for the weak. Self-love isn't a superficial virtue. Self-love isn't vanity. Self-love requires courage, critical observation, creativity, radical acceptance of the good and the bad within you, imagination, strength, and an ability to take difficult (but necessary) steps on a regular basis.\n\nI wish you good luck on your journey.
