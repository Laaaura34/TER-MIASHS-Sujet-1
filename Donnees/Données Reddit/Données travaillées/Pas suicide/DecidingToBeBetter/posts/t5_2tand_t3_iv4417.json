I'm only 20 years old, so I'm pretty young and I've found myself 2000 miles away from home in a state I've only read about.\n\nWhen I look at it from an outside perspective, I have the opportunity to start all over again in this new location. I have no previous ties to my home town and I have a stable income. Really, I have the world in my hands and I can choose to move in any direction I see fit. I've got the basics down, car and apartment, now I'm not sure what I want to do with myself. \n\nI want to make friends. I want to have fun. I want to see the city. I want to learn new skills. I want to develop the person I am. I am to make money. I want to take full advantage of this opportunity presented to me. \n\nSo, what would you guys do if you found yourself in a situation similar to mine? Young, Stable income, and tons of free time.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iv4417/how_to_i_take_full_advantage_of_my_situation/", "title": "How to I take full advantage of my situation?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "AirForceNerd", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1600427594, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iv4417/how_to_i_take_full_advantage_of_my_situation/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435134.427872, "replies_charged": false}
