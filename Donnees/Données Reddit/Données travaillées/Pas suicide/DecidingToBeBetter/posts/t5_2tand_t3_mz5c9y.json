I thought I had pretty thick skin and could deal with stuff but I think I was just numbing/distracting myself away from my issues. \n\nMy biggest one lately has been vaping. Any kind of stressful emotion rises? Hit the vape. Anxiety? Vape. Anger? Vape. Feeling lost? Vape. \n\nIt does the job quite well but left me really drained and numb without much energy to be very productive. I do also feel like it's hindering my ability to deal with these hard situations and I feel like an emotional teenager on the verge of a tantrum if I don't have it so that's not ideal.\n\nI noticed that through trying to quit these last few weeks I've been playing a lot more video games which was my old coping mechanism. There's also smoking weed/watching porn that's thrown in there but I mostly have quit the weed and the porn/masturbation is much less than before.\n\nI'm almost two days vape-free now and I'm making this post to organize my thoughts and remind myself why quitting these habits is so important if I want to become the person that I aspire to be.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mz5c9y/using_avoidance_to_cope_with_stressvaping_weed/", "title": "Using avoidance to cope with stress(vaping, weed, porn, video games, etc.)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "LethalShade", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 51, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1619464166, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mz5c9y/using_avoidance_to_cope_with_stressvaping_weed/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437232.5470846, "replies_charged": false}
