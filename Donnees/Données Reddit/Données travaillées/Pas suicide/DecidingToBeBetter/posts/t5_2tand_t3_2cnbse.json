I'm at risk of falling back on those changes now, and I could use some advice from others who have experience in dealing with the \"new you.\"\n\nEssentially, after a five year relationship my gf and I broke up, for reasons that aren't really important.  For the past three years of single life, I have learned new skills, learned more about who I was and what I liked.  I learned to love myself.  But I still ate unhealthily and drank somewhat excessively and smoke pot occasionally, under the assumption that I was just bored.\n\nWhat I am realizing now, after visiting this subreddit for some time and deciding to cut out the junk food, start exercising regularly, cut out the alcohol and pot, is that those are the things I always turned to when I was down.  I'm feeling really down right now and it's the first time in a very, very long time that I am fighting the urge to combat this depression with drugs and other junk.\n\nSo my question to you is, after deciding to be a better \"you,\" how to you stick to your guns when the going gets the hardest?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/2cnbse/what_do_you_guys_do_to_cheer_yourself_up/", "title": "What do you guys do to cheer yourself up?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "WhoahCanada", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 23, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1407203570, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/2cnbse/what_do_you_guys_do_to_cheer_yourself_up/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435893.2391741, "replies_charged": false}
