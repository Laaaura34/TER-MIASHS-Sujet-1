Know that you\u2019re not alone**\n\nWhen it comes to dealing with your insecurities, it\u2019s important to first understand that you\u2019re not the only person who deals with them. In fact, there isn\u2019t a person on earth who isn\u2019t insecure about something.\n\nThough physical appearance, monetary wealth or mental well-being can all play parts in dictating the severity of these insecurities, the key difference between a person who allows their insecurities to swallow them whole and a person who is generally self-assured is the methods in which each one manages them.\n\n**2. Instead of focussing purely on repressing the way you react to your insecurities, start considering the causes of them**\n\nMany people write off emotional reactions to their insecurities as simple anger management issues.\n\nIf you wish to prevent insecurities from having a debilitating impact on your life, you need to look beyond your emotional reactions to them, and instead, understand the root causes.\n\nRepressing your reaction to insecurity is a band-aid solution.\n\nIdentifying the source of your issue is the first step on the path to better self-assurance.\n\n**3. Seek counsel**\n\nIn order to help you understand the sources of your insecurities and look for ways to work through them, you may need to seek external counsel.\n\nSome of the best people to speak to about them include healthcare professionals, close family members and emotionally intelligent friends.\n\nOr, if you'd prefer to speak about them more anonymously to begin with, you can chat with like-minded individuals on Internet forums. Just pay no mind to the senseless trolls you will inevitably run into at some point.\n\n**4. Learn to accept that which is out of your control**\n\nMany people are insecure about something that is beyond their control, such as their height or their IQ.\n\nThe moment you can learn to accept that no amount of anger, resentment or bitterness will magically make you taller or smarter is the moment you can begin to live your life in a more carefree manner.\n\nOftentimes the traits you are insecure about aren\u2019t what hold you back, but rather your attitude towards them and your inability to accept them.\n\n**5. Recall your successes**\n\nInsecurities have a nasty habit of making you forget about your past successes and focus instead on your past failures.\n\nIf you can remember this during moments of weakness, it can help you to objectively realise that you're a lot more capable and talented than your insecurities are allowing you to believe.\n\n**6. Own up to them, thus removing the stigma for others**\n\nThe most admirable way to deal with your insecurities is by being honest about them.\n\nIf everyone had the strength and courage to do this, the ridiculous stigma which suggests that insecurities are signs of weakness would quickly be lost.\n\nPlus, let\u2019s be honest, if insecurities really are signs of weakness, then every person on earth is weak.\n\nDisclaimer: If your insecurities are truly destroying your self-esteem right now, then this may not be the best solution for you just yet.\n\n**7. Self-improve**\n\nSelf-improvement is another effective method for dealing with insecurities, be it through self-development, physical development or by channelling your insecure energy into something productive.\n\nSelf-improvement in other areas of your life will help you build the self-confidence necessary to leave you feeling silly about that which you were insecure about in the first place.\n\n**8. Know that those who purposely look to make you feel insecure are among the most insecure people of all**\n\nThere are certain people who will always go out of their way to try and bring you down. This can leave you feeling particularly insecure, which is ironic, because no-one is more insecure than a person who purposely looks to surface up insecurities in others.\n\nRealising this will help you to put things into perspective when you identify a situation in which someone is purposely doing this to you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mmfyyj/8_healthy_ways_to_deal_with_your_insecurities/", "title": "8 healthy ways to deal with your insecurities", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "menwithmanners", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1617841943, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mmfyyj/8_healthy_ways_to_deal_with_your_insecurities/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438449.6049933, "replies_charged": false}
