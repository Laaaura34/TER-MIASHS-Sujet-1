It is human nature to judge, but this is skewing me to view things inaccurately.  \n\nI decide to open my heart and observe more.  I want to understand rather than assume I know everything.  That is overconfidence.  And I don\u2019t want to be someone like that.\n\nHonestly, this seems really difficult to do.  I am currently reading \u201c12 Rules of Life\u201d by Jordan Peterson.  I want to do better and be more loving. \n\nHow did you become less judgmental?  Any thoughts and feedbacks are welcomed.
