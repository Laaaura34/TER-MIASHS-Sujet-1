But it was very peaceful and welcoming. It was nice to be around so many good hearted people who love you without even knowing you. So many smiles and welcoming arms. I felt awkward but I plan on going back next Sunday.\n\nEdit::: thank you all for the positive comments. I'm a little embarrassed to admit this but y'all had me teary eyed reading them. This is a stepping stone in my journey to a sober life and finding good hearted people to associate with. Someone mentioned volunteering and I'll be looking into that also.
