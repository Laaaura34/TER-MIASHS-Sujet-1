I don't want you guys to have any background because I want this new activity to be completely different than anything ive done before. This is a throwaway because no one I know in real life can find out. Im looking for something that i can focus on for 4 hours 5 days a week in the morning that is not working out, playing video games, reading. Anything else I'm all ears for: I'll try to try out any activity that i can right away. Since this is so important to me I've decided to incentivize. Whichever activity i decide to go with based on a suggestion DM me and we can discuss a suitable reward for giving me such an idea. The entire month of October i have dedicated to finding this. This may  sound dramatic but its so so important for me to figure this out. Im excited because at least i can try new things and ill be watching and updating this post as often as i can.
