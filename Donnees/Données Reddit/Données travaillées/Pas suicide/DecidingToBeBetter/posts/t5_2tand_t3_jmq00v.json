I know I can\u2019t sleep when I\u2019m cold and I have the privilege to sleep in a warm cozy bed with socks on when I\u2019m cold. I\u2019m also the type of person who wears big big scarf that goes up to my ears and makes me look like a minion. \nAs I was walking, I saw a homeless person sitting on ciment - he had a jacket, a hat and something to cover his legs. I came up to him and offered him my scarf. He politely declined saying he had a small scarf already and it was ok. I said: \u201cuse this as a blanket.\u201d\n\nHis eyes lit up and he put the scarf blanket over his legs.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jmq00v/i_gave_my_scarf_to_a_homeless_person/", "title": "I gave my scarf to a homeless person", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "pineandoak_", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 34, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1604332484, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jmq00v/i_gave_my_scarf_to_a_homeless_person/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437850.1284306, "replies_charged": false}
