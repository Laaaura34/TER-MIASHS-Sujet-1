I\u2019ve had cripplingly poor self image. I\u2019ve spent more time wallowing in self hatred and self pity than ever doing the things necessary to get better. \n\nI\u2019m deciding to be better. \n\nMy wife and me are currently separated and it\u2019s been a very very difficult time. Albeit I\u2019m doing well in terms of sobriety from my primary addiction and getting to at least 2 meetings a week, I\u2019ve put little to none dedication into repairing my marriage. I mean like- *really* repairing it. Not \u2018getting along\u2019 and avoiding doing things to rock the boat. Inevitably an argument broke out a couple of weeks ago between me and my wife and it just escalated out of no where. Next thing I know my wife has taken our 2 year old son and gone to stay with her mum, and I\u2019m on my own. Left with so much misery and self pity - \u2018I\u2019ve been getting better\u2019 blah blah blah. \n\nNo, fuck you self pity. You are no longer keeping me prisoner. \n\nI\u2019m going to make a video for my wife, not simply pleading for her to come back to me, but rather to initiate the love I have for her truly deep within me. In essence I\u2019m going to make the case that our marriage can be like Kintsugi- the art of repairing broken objects with gold and ultimately creating a much more beautiful and valuable item. \n\nI need to fight for this marriage with everything, because that\u2019s exactly what marriage ought to be. It\u2019s not simply a ride where I\u2019m taken somewhere and happiness is immediately granted. Nope. It needs to be worked with. It needs to be fought for. \n\nI don\u2019t think my wife is stupid. I don\u2019t think she chose to marry me 3 years ago out of a whim. She truly believed we would be happy together. I have not held up my end of the deal and my addictions have truly broken us. But I know I can fix this, and I\u2019m hopeful we can be much much happier for it. \n\nI truly love my wife. I adore our son. I want nothing more than for us to be a family.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jf5o6j/you_know_what_im_gonna_get_my_marriage_back_im/", "title": "You know what?
