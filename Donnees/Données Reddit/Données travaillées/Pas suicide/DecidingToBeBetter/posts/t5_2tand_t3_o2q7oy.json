Just try to feel the meaning of the words as you are saying them. \n\nFor example, if you're saying to yourself/thinking about the value that your bed has in your life, don't focus on trying too hard to feel the emotions or feelings of gratitude. \n\nFocus more on WHY you're grateful or appreciative of it, and the emotions will naturally follow. \n\nWhat value does it add to your life? What does it give you? Why do you enjoy it? These are the things to focus on. \n\nThe second tip is not trying to practice all the time. If you are at the beginning of your practice, set aside a certain amount of time in the day and do it then. \n\nLike anything, too much of it can be a bad thing. Trying to practice gratitude all the time will only interfere with your life and distract you more than add value to it. \n\nOnce you have a consistent practice, you will naturally begin noticing yourself having thoughts like these during your days and feeling more appreciative of yourself and your life. \n\nTip 3: If it feels hard at the start, or that you don't know what to think about, just remember that it can be literally anything. Big or small, significant or insignificant, it doesn't matter. \n\nJust follow the steps above, trust the process, and know that even just taking the time to stop and practice gratitude is a really positive thing, and you should feel proud of yourself. \n\nBonus: more tips on what to think about/how to have a gratitude practice \n\n\nKeep a Gratitude Journal. \n\nEstablish a daily practice in which you remind yourself of the gifts, grace, benefits, and good things you enjoy. Recalling moments of gratitude associated with ordinary events, your personal attributes, or valued people in your life gives you the potential to interweave a sustainable theme of gratefulness into your life. \n\nRemember the Bad. \n\nTo be grateful in your current state, it is helpful to remember the hard times that you once experienced. When you remember how difficult life used to be and how far you have come, you set up an explicit contrast in your mind, and this contrast is fertile ground for gratefulness. \n\nShare Your Gratitude with Others. \n\nResearch has found that expressing gratitude can strengthen relationships. So the next time your partner, friend or family member does something you appreciate, be sure to let them know. \n\nCome to Your Senses. \n\nThrough our senses\u2014the ability to touch, see, smell, taste, and hear\u2014we gain an appreciation of what it means to be human and of what an incredible miracle it is to be alive. Seen through the lens of gratitude, the human body is not only a miraculous construction, but also a gift. \n\nUse Visual Reminders. \n\nBecause the two primary obstacles to gratefulness are forgetfulness and a lack of mindful awareness, visual reminders can serve as cues to trigger thoughts of gratitude. Often times, the best visual reminders are other people. \n\nMake a Vow to Practice Gratitude. \n\nResearch shows that making an oath to perform a behavior increases the likelihood that the action will be executed. Therefore, write your own gratitude vow, which could be as simple as \u201cI vow to count my blessings each day,\u201d and post it somewhere where you will be reminded of it every day.\n\n\nThink Outside the Box. \n\nIf you want to make the most out of opportunities to flex your gratitude muscles, you must look creatively for new situations and circumstances in which to feel grateful.
