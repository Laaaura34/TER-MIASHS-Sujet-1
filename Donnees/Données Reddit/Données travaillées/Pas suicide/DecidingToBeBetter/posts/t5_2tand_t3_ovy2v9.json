After covid it's been more hard to meet people. He says that he lives his life just pushing through the days. Work and social media the whole day. He feels purposeless and totally demotivated. He says he's super lazy to do anything. I have been there too, but his case sounds somewhat different to me.\n\nHow can I help him? I mean I am confused as have never met anyone with absolutely no interests.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ovy2v9/what_should_a_person_with_no_interests_do/", "title": "What should a person with no interests do?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "poojab163", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 10, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1627844504, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ovy2v9/what_should_a_person_with_no_interests_do/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437984.7357147, "replies_charged": false}
