I have no one to talk to. \nI am miserable.\nFor last couple of years I've been feeling depressed. Lost interest in most of things. I feel like I lost myself.\nI have never been diagnosed because I can't afford therapy. \nI feel like I have nothing to lose anymore. I failed college, my parents don't have any expectations of me, I don't have friends...\nThat realisation weirdly gave me some motivation to don't give up on myself. \nI want to find myself again. I want to enjoy things like I used to. I want to be positive person like I was before.\nAnd now when it comes to making some action I get stuck. I've been reading posts here, google search, YouTube videos but I'm only getting more and more confused and I don't know what to do.\nWhere do I start? Can someone help me?
