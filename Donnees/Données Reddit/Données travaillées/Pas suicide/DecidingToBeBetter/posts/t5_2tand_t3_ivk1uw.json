People on social media are advertising their own companies and are making so much money. Meanwhile, I have absolutely no clue what to do with my life, and it's driving me insane. I feel like I'm constantly falling behind in life. I know that I should just get off social media if that's the case, but I don't know if that'll change anything. Turning off social media doesn't make young people less successful, anymore than not watching the news makes world events not happen. All I can think all day long while I'm trying my hardest to figure out what I should pursue as a passion is \"Why can't I just figure this out? If other people my age can, then I'm just lazy and wasting my potential!\" Thoughts like that hurt so much. It makes feel less motivated and inspired than before and I just feel like giving up on ever achieving anything worthwhile.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivk1uw/i_cant_stop_comparing_myself_to_others_and_its/", "title": "I Can't Stop Comparing Myself To Others And It's Hurting Me Mentally (19M)", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "pmdfan71", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 18, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1600482607, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivk1uw/i_cant_stop_comparing_myself_to_others_and_its/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438109.9506505, "replies_charged": false}
