But after seeing subreddits like r/DecidingToBeBetter , r/LoseIt and \nr/GetMotivated , the inspiration I read was infectious and I wanted to join these communities in hopes of being a better me. \n\nI've let myself go in my eyes- physically, mentally and emotionally. \nI feel like I was in such a good place that I became complacent. I put my guard down, relaxed and kicked my feet up too long that I forgot how to get back up. It's like I became an old boulder of a rock covered in moss.\n\nI don't know when it happened- I thought I had a proper hold on everything and was managing those negative thoughts that I thought I conquered while a teen. But I suppose those tiny thoughts- over a period of several years- slowly ate their way into huge garbage piles in my mind and became habits that have made me melancholy. I feel like I've lost my spark for life- where everything now feels so 'meh'.\n\nI recently read a post of a woman who saw herself going down the same health path as her Mom who passed and it alerted me. I am always saying I do not want to end up down that same path but- currently being at the highest weight of my life- I see that I've been lying to myself. Telling myself \"I'm fine, I'm fine.\" while sinking deeper to the bottom.\n\nI'm looking at myself and while I see that I'm not fine- I've now realized that I've been looking to others for answers and forgetting the strength that I used to hold. The strength I have to stand up and fight for myself, for my life, for bettering my state of mind and body. I want to change that- I need to change.\n\nSo- I went for a jog today and while it's not the first time- the previous times were with no effort. But today I pushed myself- sprinted twice in the way I used to when I was healthier. And while it was tough- it felt damn good. Like breaking out of a shell and being able to stretch again. \n\nI hope I can find that person that's been buried for so long and let their light shine in this world once more. \n\nI'm sorry this is so long. I hope journalling my thoughts here will get my engine started and inspire someone else to do the same. \n\nIf anyone has suggestions for other subreddits I should follow for inspiration and guidance I would love it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j3norx/this_is_my_first_post_after_officially_joining/", "title": "This is my first post after officially joining reddit 4 days ago. \ud83e\udd17", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "mars_0004", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1601611154, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j3norx/this_is_my_first_post_after_officially_joining/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436048.4500089, "replies_charged": false}
