I'm getting wordy myself now lol.\n\nBut I want to be a better person to both myself and my partner and I felt like reaching out to a community and see what people say.\n\nAppreciate the words of wisdom in advance.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ntimf2/trying_to_change_perspective/", "title": "Trying to change perspective.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Digitaladdiction9220", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 4, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1622974600, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ntimf2/trying_to_change_perspective/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437519.7971373, "replies_charged": false}
