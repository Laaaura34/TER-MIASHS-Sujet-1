I wanted to try to breakdown the 3 part cycle of motivation on my own, but now I need some feedback. My ultimate theory is this: \n\n**We naturally prefer minimal effort for large, positive, immediate rewards.** \n\nThe key words are **minimal** for effort, **large and positive** for rewards, and the one I'm struggling with is **immediate.** I know time has an impact on rewards, but my question is to exactly what degree? An insignificant, immediate reward isn't as good as a big, late reward. Ultimately, I want everything to be understood to the degree that it can be plugged into a formula that will tell us exactly how effective rewards will be relative to the effort.  \n\nReal world examples of all three components will fall on a scale within each. For example:\n\n**Effort scale**\n\n* Do it without thinking (heartbeat, breathing, blinking)\n* Have to be conscious of it, but it\u2019s super easy (bathroom)\n* Requires some skill, but it\u2019s no sweat (walking, reading)\n* Requires mental effort (math)\n* Requires physical effort (weightlifting)\n* Requires mental and physical effort (playing a sport)\n* Outside comfort zone (cold calling strangers, doing something others consider weird)\n\n**Time scale**\n\n* Paid in advance (contract for work)\n* Immediate consequence (heroin injection)\n* Not until retirement (compound interest)\n \n**Reward scale (negative to positive)**\n\n* Death\n* Physical pain (broken bone)\n* Emotional pain (fear, anxiety)\n* Physical discomfort (exhaustion, soreness)\n* Emotional discomfort (awkwardness, uncertainty, doubt)\n* Nothing\n* Pleasant physical feeling (orgasm, relaxation)\n* Pleasant emotional feeling (validation, accomplishment, congruence) \n* Got something useful (money, gifts, time)\n* Removal of something negative (stress relief, understanding)\n* Euphoria\n\nPlease chime in with everything and everything to improve this idea and the examples.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7zqnu0/help_me_flesh_out_this_idea/", "title": "Help me flesh out this idea...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "JihadDerp", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 2, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1519413706, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7zqnu0/help_me_flesh_out_this_idea/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436384.4895616, "replies_charged": false}
