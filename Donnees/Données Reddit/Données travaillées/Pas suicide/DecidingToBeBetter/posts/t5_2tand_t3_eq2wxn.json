I guess majority feels that way. \n\nI feel left behind tbh because I'm not traveling much. I sometimes wonder if I am pressured to travel? \n\n\nIt's kinda the same with feeling the need to go to bars but once I'm there then get home, i dont feel much satisfaction. \n\nI like traveling but the pressure to do so and the pressure to visit AS MANY AS possible... Is it even realistic??? Or is it the hype that comes from these traveling photos in instagram?\n\nI look at traveling as a once a year thing or at least twice. And i already consider that as luxury. But then again, I'm not so sure anymore. Traveling has become a necessity in social media i guess... \n\nWhat are your thoughts? I'm just unsure tbh. Part of me wants to drop a lot of expenses to save money for traveling but at the same time, i dont wanna cut down the quality of my daily living (like pinching pennies)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eq2wxn/is_traveling_a_necessity_confused_mindset/", "title": "Is traveling a necessity?
