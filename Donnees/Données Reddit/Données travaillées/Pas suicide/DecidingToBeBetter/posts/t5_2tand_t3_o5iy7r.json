I've been in therapy and it was usually either I accepted how things were or actually speak up about it. \n\nI've read about a lot of people who just decided to not let it affect them anymore and kept to themselves. I couldn't do it, I loved my parents. I really didn't want it to be that way so I mustered up the courage and tried despite the sayings that it won't do anything. \n\nI was afraid of how it was going to turn out because there was a chance of her taking it the wrong way and twisting my words wrong due to her sensitivity and older perspectives. At least that was the image I've painted of her over the years. But fortunately, it turned out all right. She actually listened to me and even apologized for how her actions over the years affected me as a person. \n\nI cried a lot, I feel really tired at the moment but I truly hope that this would be a huge key to helping me slowly feel better inside.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o5iy7r/maybe_ill_heal_a_bit_better_now/", "title": "Maybe I'll heal a bit better now.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "cheeselover15", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 84, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624354179, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o5iy7r/maybe_ill_heal_a_bit_better_now/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436616.7008858, "replies_charged": false}
