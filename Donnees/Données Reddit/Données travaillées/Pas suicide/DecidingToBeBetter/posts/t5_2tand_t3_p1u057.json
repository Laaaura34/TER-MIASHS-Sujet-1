The sunrise world was very very beautiful with fresh cool hair and beautiful what a reflection. Everything was perfect and yet I felt nothing. There was no wow feeling or amazed feeling even though everything was just perfect it's like something is missing I want to enjoy I want to feel happy and joyful but nothing.I don't know the last time I was actually actually actually happy. Relaxed and peaceful. I don't know last time I actually enjoyed something even if I think too hard I cannot remember. I guess with the pressure of building a career or future for future relationship had made me this way. I forgot enjoying. I guess with the tension of building future is the cause of this. \n\nAny advice?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p1u057/i_enjoy_absolute_nothing/", "title": "I enjoy ABSOLUTE nothing.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "hduehegvgg", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 8, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628616598, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p1u057/i_enjoy_absolute_nothing/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435381.5280602, "replies_charged": false}
