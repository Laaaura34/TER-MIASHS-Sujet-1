I'm not used to a lot of verbal or even emotional validation. My family doesn't give out much. It used to make me really sad before, but as I get older I understand a bit better that my parents didn't get that growing up and have a hard time giving it themselves - though they do try in small instances. Anyways, I've always craved the verbal and emotional validation that I'm doing a great job or that I should keep going when it's tough.\n\nSo at the halfway mark of the race, there was a big group of volunteers cheering us on, ringing bells and yelling a lot of motivating shit at us like \"YOU CAN DO IT! YOU'VE GOT THIS. IM SO PROUD OF YOU! WOOHOO!\" And it made me almost cry. I had to try really hard to hold the tears back in. I'm not sure if I needed to hear those words for my race or life in general, but it really touched me. Has anyone felt this way before too?\n\nEdit: Wow thank you for the wholesome award, kind redditor!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qaahcg/i_ran_my_first_10k_run_today_without_stopping_and/", "title": "I ran my first 10k run today (without stopping) and almost cried bc of the random people cheering us on", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "craqworld", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 132, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1634513762, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qaahcg/i_ran_my_first_10k_run_today_without_stopping_and/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435853.7293708, "replies_charged": false}
