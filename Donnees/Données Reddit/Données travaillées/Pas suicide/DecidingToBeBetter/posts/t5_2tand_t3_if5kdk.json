I\u2019ve always found it hard not to feel slighted by others\u2019 behaviours. I was very self-righteous. In order to lay off of this toxic way of thinking, I started becoming a lot more empathetic and compassionate towards people, their situations, and their stories. \n\nI started to take more responsibility for my own feelings. I try to rationalise that \u201cthis person did this thing because they are genuinely busy\u201d rather than \u201cthey\u2019re ignoring me, I must cut them\u201d (which had been my defence mechanism up until recently).\n\nBut I feel that now, I might be doing it to the extreme. Even if a guy I like isn\u2019t interested in me, and is stringing me along, I\u2019ll do the opposite - \u201che\u2019s only replying when it\u2019s convenient for him without considering my time or feelings\u201d becomes \u201cwell he didn\u2019t specify when he\u2019ll be less busy, but I know from what he said in the past that he\u2019s probably busy, so I\u2019ll give him space\u201d. \n\nHow to be able to take ownership of your feelings without accusing, blaming, or feeling personally slighted, but also not be pushed around or be taken advantage of?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/if5kdk/where_is_the_line_between_your_ego_dictating_your/", "title": "Where is the line between \u201cyour ego dictating your views almost to extremism / narcissism\u201c and \u201cbecoming a doormat\u201d?
