I gave her an easy way to just say 'no thanks' from the beginning. But she just couldn't. So we spent an hour going back and forth about pros and cons. Instead of her just saying \"I don't feel like it today, let's take a rain check some other time\". \nWtf is wrong, why is it so hard? We know each other so well, we're adults , we should be able to just be honest ! \n\nPeople - please, a shoutout, let's say the truth and how we feel. Let's make life simpler! <3\n\n... and of course, I'm gonna tell her the truth as well, and say I don't wanna do this stupid dance anymore. We're to smart for this \n\nPeace, love, harmony and truth to everyone out there \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/5pbgvd/i_just_spent_an_hour_texting_with_my_friend/", "title": "I just spent an hour texting with my friend whether we should go to this thing or not...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "youmeandmy", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1485017119, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/5pbgvd/i_just_spent_an_hour_texting_with_my_friend/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437143.3533125, "replies_charged": false}
