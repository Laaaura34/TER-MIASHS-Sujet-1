Idk maybe some bank bug error or something. So I cried over it because usually when I have a deposit and get the email saying \"deposit received\" which I did receive that means the deposit is there but this time the deposit didn't show up. I got flustered because I wanted to spend the money right away but I was confused on how to spend it if I don't know how much I'm spending because I can't see the balance. \n\nMost people would just wait for the balance to show up but not me I got stressed out and started to cry because I hate waiting for anything and any minor inconvenience makes me wanna cry.\n\nHow can I stop crying over the dumbest things? \n\nThis is not the only thing I cry over. It could be homework one day because I don't understand the question fast enough or or it could be something as simple as having to take another route because my favorite route is closed or something.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvb4uu/i_cry_over_things_i_shouldnt_be_crying_about_how/", "title": "I cry over things I shouldnt be crying about.
