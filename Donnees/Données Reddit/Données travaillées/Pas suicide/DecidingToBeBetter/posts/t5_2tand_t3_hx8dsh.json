I woke up and I asked myself \"What are you getting yourself for your birthday today? How can I treat myself today like I'm special?\"\n\nI brushed my teeth in the morning and thought, \"Instead of just the usual cleaning, I'm going to give myself an extra cleaning\". I busted out the baking soda to give myself whiter teeth today.\n\nI have been slacking on my face cleaning routine so I got all the stuff out and cleaned my face, lotion, the whole thing. I gave myself healthier skin today.\n\nI have also been slacking on working out. So I put on a 15 min morning workout video. I gave myself a metabolism boost and endorphins today! \n\nNow I'm looking at every \"chore\" I need to do and spinning it more positively. When I do the dishes later, I will give myself a clean kitchen. When I make a healthy lunch, I will give myself nutrition.\n\nIt would be really easy today to say I should treat myself with laziness and junk food, but that wouldn't REALLY make me feel good. So next time you think about something that seems like a chore, think about it like a gift and it might be easier to do \u2665", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hx8dsh/phrase_self_care_as_a_gift_to_yourself_instead_of/", "title": "Phrase self care as a gift to yourself instead of a chore", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "hyhy-alicia", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1602, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1595619163, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hx8dsh/phrase_self_care_as_a_gift_to_yourself_instead_of/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436826.2264886, "replies_charged": false}
