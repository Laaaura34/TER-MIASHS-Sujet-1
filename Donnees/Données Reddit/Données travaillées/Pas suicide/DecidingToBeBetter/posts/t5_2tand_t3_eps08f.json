If I mess up at work, I\u2019m a basket case re-evaluating my entire existence.  Making dinner last night with my boyfriend he tasked me with cutting the garlic bread since I never learned to cook and I ended up smushing it and halfway through I thought it looked so sad and I asked \u201cwhat am I doing?\u201d and put down the knife. He jumped in and showed me how to do it the right way and his came out looking fricken artistic next to my smooshes. \u201cI suck\u201d - Me. \u201cYou can\u2019t suck at something you don\u2019t know how to do, you just don\u2019t know how to do it. And you watch and learn. You practice.\u201d - Him. \n\nSometimes it frustrates me that I sit here and do all of this work on myself and I get mad about garlic bread and then my boyfriend comes through with the profound truth that\u2019s so aligned with what I try to learn and strive to achieve on the daily. He\u2019s never read an improvement book or spiritual book in his life. Meanwhile I study and take courses and read and write and expend so much (beautiful) energy on it. \n\nIt\u2019s becoming perfectly clear that I take life way too seriously all day every day. And I make myself miserable for no reason by doing it. I grew up in a very serious environment and death has followed me for most of my life. I get why I\u2019m serious. And I get why I got extremely mad when my mom who is the most fire-cracker tempered person would tell me to lighten up. \n\nBut it\u2019s time to lighten up. And I invite you to join me. \n\nLife is really hard sometimes. Stuff happens that I wouldn\u2019t wish upon anyone. I\u2019m not saying this is one size fits all advice and i realize I\u2019m very fortunate to live the life i live but I think so many people would benefit from lightening up. As a society, we are plagued. We\u2019re plagued with anxiety. We\u2019re plagued with depression. We\u2019re plagued with misery. And I think a lot of it is tied to the fact that we think we have to be perfect all the time and that it\u2019s not ok to screw up or to make a mistake or be spontaneous or to leave our comfort zone. Where\u2019s the fun? Where\u2019s the space for laughter? We only have one life here! Why does everything have to be so serious?! \n\nThere\u2019s a ton of expectations out there but what if we let go of some of them? Other people\u2019s expectations are not our problem or responsibility. Our own are though. And we\u2019re beating ourselves into the ground with them. What if we laughed at our screw ups? What if we said, \u201cok I tried my very best at this particular point in time, now I\u2019ll get up and try again with a little more experience.\u201d Why do we think mistakes are the end all be all? We\u2019re not screw ups because we made 1, 5, 20, 5000 mistakes. We\u2019re not screw ups because we let someone else down. We\u2019re human and this is a journey in which sometimes we do really well and sometimes we fall real hard. There\u2019s lessons in all of it. And it\u2019s beautiful (although not always pretty). \n\nSometimes we hurt people because we were hurt and didn\u2019t know how to deal with it. Let it go by acknowledging you did the best you could at any given point and work towards doing a little better. Stop carrying a guilt that does nothing but weigh you down. Apologize if you have the opportunity. And if you don\u2019t, say the apology out loud or write it out. Don\u2019t beat yourself up over and over for the same thing! We need to let go of the idea that our worth is based on what we\u2019ve done or how good we are at something or how much we have. we are inherently worthy.  We are worth something way beyond definitions or tangibles. As is everyone else. \n\nAnd a beautiful thing happens when we lighten up on ourselves. We lighten up on other people. We\u2019re kinder. We\u2019re loving. We\u2019re compassionate. What a world it would be if we didn\u2019t walk around trying to prove something. \n\nSo today I\u2019m not trying to prove anything. I\u2019m going to smile for no reason. I\u2019m going to laugh at my mistakes. I\u2019m going to focus my energy and attention on the joy instead of the places where i believe it\u2019s lacking. I\u2019m going to help my boyfriend cook dinner and probably mess it up again. And laugh. And keep going even if it\u2019s not pretty. And ask questions on how to cut an onion the best way because I still can\u2019t figure it out and it takes me about 25 minutes. And not get mad when it doesn\u2019t look as pretty as when my boyfriend does it. \n\nHope you all have a wonderful morning/day/evening. Whoever you may be. Wherever you may be. You deserve it. And remember: LIGHTEN UP :)!!\n\n___\nTL;DR\n\n\nThere\u2019s a ton of expectations out there but what if we let go of some of them?
