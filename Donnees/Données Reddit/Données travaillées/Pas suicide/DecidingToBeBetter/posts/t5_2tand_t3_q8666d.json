I used to self harm every day. I never thought that I would benefit from DBT - only when I actually started doing the work, it began to show a lot of improvement with my response to anger and anxiety. \n\nAnd then I discovered the TIPP skill. It's a distres tolerance skill. I use it whenever I'm extremely angry or feel like I'll self harm.\n\nI'll explain it here: \n\nT stands for temperature. You fill a basin with cold water and then dip your face in it for about 20 seconds. \n\nI stands for intense exercise. Although only do this if you're physically able. My therapist recommended jogging in place for a minute. I just do squats.\n\nP stands for paced breathing. I recommend finding a breathing guide on YouTube and following it.\n\nP stands for paired muscle relaxation. Essentially tense your muscles really hard and then relax them. Do it a few times.\n\nSo yeah, I hope this can help someone else who struggles with anger or self harm. It helped me avoid it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8666d/ever_since_i_started_dbt_i_havent_self_harmed/", "title": "Ever since I started DBT, I haven't self harmed almost at all.
