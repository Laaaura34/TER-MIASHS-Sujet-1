I can't always clear my mind and not think about taxes, my family, work, etc. And that's okay. I used to give up and get frustrated when my life's distractions interrupted my meditation. But I've learned that you don't ignore them, but rather embrace those interruptions and move along...breathing in, and then out. Breathe in-and out.\n\nI recently started meditating again after falling out of the habit years and years ago (4ish years now). Like.many that find or have found themselves in a similar situation, I allowed life and the business of my morning, afternoon, and evening to take over and not allow myself to \"just sit still.\"\n\nI found that a guided meditation has been really helpful with getting back into the practice. Im specifically using the Waking Up app on my phone which I am absolutely loving.\n\nIf you're interested in the practice, the Waking Up app has an excellent free introduction that I've listened to dozens of times.\n\nHope you all have the best day!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lw5o2b/meditation_and_the_purposeful_calm_breathing_that/", "title": "Meditation and the purposeful calm breathing that is requires has changed my life", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "skigrab", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 18, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1614701632, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lw5o2b/meditation_and_the_purposeful_calm_breathing_that/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435768.030096, "replies_charged": false}
