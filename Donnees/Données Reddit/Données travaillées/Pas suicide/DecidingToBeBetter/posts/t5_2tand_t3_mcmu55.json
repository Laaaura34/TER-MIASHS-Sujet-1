It's painful. Sometimes I can't sleep over it.\n\nI've realized that for some years now, yet I keep doing it without changing anything.\n\nAlways knew what to do and where to look for help, but never brought myself to do it until recently.\n\nYes I wasted some precious years not fullfilling anything, but I've decided I won't keep piling any more years on it.\n\nAt the very least, I'll give it an honest try. So I won't look back in a year and say that I did nothing.\n\nHopefully I'll write here again in the future, with something to show for it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mcmu55/i_dont_want_to_keep_regretting_the_past/", "title": "I don't want to keep regretting the past.", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "RumForrestRum", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 47, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616636890, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mcmu55/i_dont_want_to_keep_regretting_the_past/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436979.6200135, "replies_charged": false}
