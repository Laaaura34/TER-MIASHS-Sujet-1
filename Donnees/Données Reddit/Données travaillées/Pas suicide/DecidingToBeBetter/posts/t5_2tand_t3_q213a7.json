Meaning doing things when you're not in the mood, not feeling like it (which is all the time for me), and things which are necessary like learning, exercising, socialising etc and even before that, just basic life chores,etc.\n\nSo this is how my average day/night looks like since last 3-4 months. Scrolling through social media and videos, porn etc throughout the night, then sleep at 5am or 7am in the morning, wake up at noon or 2pm in the afternoon. And just lie in the bed and not get out, order food, and just pass time.\nThis is really bad and I want to break out of this cycle. \nPlease help me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q213a7/i_have_0_discipline_in_my_life_but_i_want_to/", "title": "I have 0 discipline in my life but I want to chnage", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "grungebroot", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 13, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1633454381, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q213a7/i_have_0_discipline_in_my_life_but_i_want_to/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438035.8231432, "replies_charged": false}
