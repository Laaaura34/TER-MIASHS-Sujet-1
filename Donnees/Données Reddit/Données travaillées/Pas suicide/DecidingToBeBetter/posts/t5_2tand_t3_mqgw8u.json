I feel like the last few years I have let myself become cold and sarcastic and kind of bitchy as a messed up defense mechanism, and I want to be a kinder and softer person in my life in general. The last few months have been going well-- I have an incredible boyfriend whom I adore, respect, and admire, I have a small but tight-knit and supportive group of friends, and academically and career-wise things are going well.\n\nI am going to a psychiatrist this week to better my mental health and formally seek treatment for long untreated ADHD. This, I hope, will help me with my relationship with my mother, which has been tense and difficult for many many years. I hope that when I get treatment, I will be able to maintain a healthy relationship with food and exercise, which I have tried and failed at working towards with my poor self-esteem, prepare better for undergrad graduation and take the LSAT.\n\nI am going to work on being more positive and happy, I want to be a light in the lives of others and in my own. I want to be happier. Thank you all for making this subreddit vibrant and alive and existing. We all have made mistakes in the past, and changing for the better is not only possible but necessary.
