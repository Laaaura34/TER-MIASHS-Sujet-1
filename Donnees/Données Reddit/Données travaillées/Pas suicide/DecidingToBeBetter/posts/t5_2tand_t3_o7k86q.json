I spent my teen years alone in my room while everyone else had fun, everyone else is prettier than me, does more things than me, is happier than me. I'm so jealous of seeing people having fun. I immediately assume bad things about beautiful people because I'm jealous. But I recognize that it's jealousy and apologize in my head for thinking that. But I hate it. I hate that people my age are better than me. Especially seeing people younger than me be successful hurts. I'm 19 and I've done nothing. I'm ugly and boring and never had any friends. \n\nI don't act jealous or hateful, I'm nice and friendly to everyone but in my head I hate them even though I try so hard not to think that because they deserve the good things they have. I used to just be genuinely nice instead of a fake bitch but the older I get the more I realize that I've really never done anything and I hate myself and everyone else for it. How do I stop letting this turn me resentful and bitter? I don't want to some day be a lonely angry 30 year old who yells at McDonald's workers for service being slow.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o7k86q/how_do_i_stop_jealousy_turning_me_bitter/", "title": "How do I stop jealousy turning me bitter?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "lebsbean", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 6, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1624613111, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o7k86q/how_do_i_stop_jealousy_turning_me_bitter/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435401.0771892, "replies_charged": false}
