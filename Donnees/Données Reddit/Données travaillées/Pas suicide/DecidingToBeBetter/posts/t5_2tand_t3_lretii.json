I learned to never speak, I learned to never engage with others, I learned to reject the things that made me happy for fear I would continue to be ridiculed for them.\u00a0 I learned to not do things I wanted or enjoyed because I learned that I was worthless so anything but only benefited me was a waste of time.\u00a0 I learned sharing anything I liked just proved to the people around me I was an idiot, so I learned to keep it all to myself for fear of being further rejected.\u00a0\n\nI've been trying to undo these thoughts but it's hard because I don't know what to replace them with and... to be honest, I still believe it.\u00a0 I also have no choice but to be around someone who continues to push these ideas on me. So I get reminded of them often.\n\nI was told recently that I needed to learn how to forgive myself. I like the idea but I'm having trouble figuring out what that means and how to do it.\u00a0\n\nWhat does it mean to forgive yourself?
