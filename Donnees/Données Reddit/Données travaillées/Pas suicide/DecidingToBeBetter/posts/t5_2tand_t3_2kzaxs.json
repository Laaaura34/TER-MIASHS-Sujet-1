The app offers bite-sized activities and lessons that over time help people develop their personality, character and soft-skills. The app consists of tracks in different areas of self-improvement (such as willpower, self-esteem and happiness) that the user can go through to get a better understanding of the area and make real changes in their lives.\n\nIt's not ready yet but at the moment we're testing a few approaches and we're looking for people who are interested in using the app and keen to get involved. At the moment we're simulating the app experience via email - if you're interested, I'd be happy to tell you more!\n\n\nJust to be clear, the app is not ready yet but I'm testing the concept with a mailing list prototype before we start building it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/2kzaxs/selfimprovement_app_looking_for_betatesters/", "title": "Self-improvement app - looking for beta-testers", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Goodlifefound", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 57, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1414854355, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/2kzaxs/selfimprovement_app_looking_for_betatesters/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438301.5344908, "replies_charged": false}
