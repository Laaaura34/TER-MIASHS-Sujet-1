Part of my job as a volunteer is making phone calls on a regular basis because a great deal of these individuals have been locked in quarantine for six or more months, and need basic human interaction.\n\nBut today I had a conversation with a woman who was/is truly struggling with this quarantine. The first thing she told me when I answered the phone was how stressed out she was and she started crying. She talked about how financially, mentally, physically, and emotionally drained she is and how she\u2019s lost so many people she loves to COVID. I emphasized as best as I could with her and just listened to everything she had to say. I must\u2019ve been on the phone for a solid 45 minutes before we finally parted. \n\nShe told me I had made her day a little better and a little less stressful, and I really can\u2019t put into words just how fulfilling that was to hear. I can\u2019t wait to continue volunteering and helping out my local community.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k66dta/volunteer_work_is_so_fulfilling/", "title": "Volunteer Work is So Fulfilling", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "aglassofmerlot", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 80, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1607030061, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k66dta/volunteer_work_is_so_fulfilling/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436698.3251607, "replies_charged": false}
