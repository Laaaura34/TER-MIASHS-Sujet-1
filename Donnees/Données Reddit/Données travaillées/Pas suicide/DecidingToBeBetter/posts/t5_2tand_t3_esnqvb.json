The worst are the dishonest things. I'm a dishonest and disrespectful. But I don't want to hurt anyone. Im terribly organized and my brain just doesn't retain shit right. Trying to fix these things has been a battle with my self since kindergarten. Endless hurdles worse everytime, no support, and no progress.\n\nBut I'm done with that. I have values, I have a motivation, I have love, potential, and dreams like everyone else.\n\nI will be good. In my heart I am good. I will help people.\n\nI know who I am. And no foreign and intrusive illness can change that.\n\nBy tmrw I will regret this. I will be back to doubting everything I say here. But I know this stuff.\n\nI deserve love, I deserve to be good. And people around me deserve me being good.\n\nThe question is what do I do. Where do I go?
