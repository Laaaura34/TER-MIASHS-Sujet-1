Through telehealth, I made the dive and got prescribed antidepressants yesterday. I have bad social anxiety and a fear of doctors, so this has stood in my way. I have been trying to listen to podcasts, self-help books, and journal... to help myself as much as I am capable of. I have been depressed for the past decade (I\u2019m 25), and I\u2019m ready to try some new avenues.\n\nMy boyfriend and I are planning on moving across the country in August and I\u2019m quitting my (boring, uninteresting) job soon. I don\u2019t know if I want to change industries or what I plan to do, but I plan on trying new things until happiness comes to me.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0loiv/i_am_done_being_depressed_and_anxious/", "title": "I am done being depressed and anxious", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "idunnogirl7", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 16, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623783173, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0loiv/i_am_done_being_depressed_and_anxious/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436711.1253347, "replies_charged": false}
