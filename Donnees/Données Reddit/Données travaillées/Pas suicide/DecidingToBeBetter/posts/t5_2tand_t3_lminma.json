One noticeable effect is that I have almost zero appetite so I've been trying to workout more to take care of that problem. \n\nThis is actually really huge to me considering I've been addicted to all three of these things since high school (I'm 21 now). Saved around $100 in just these four days so I'm excited to see where this goes.\n\nEdit 1: thank you for my first silver stranger!! Also I'll be updating in a few weeks :)\n\nEdit 2: 12 days later and I'm happy to say I'm still weed and nicotine free! I did unfortunately relapse once with porn but I got right back on track and now I'm sitting at a week PMO free. I genuinely feel a lot happier now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lminma/decided_to_quit_porn_weed_and_nicotine_all_cold/", "title": "Decided to quit porn, weed and nicotine all cold turkey at the same time...", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "yuhman457", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1585, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1613639826, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lminma/decided_to_quit_porn_weed_and_nicotine_all_cold/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437464.143386, "replies_charged": false}
