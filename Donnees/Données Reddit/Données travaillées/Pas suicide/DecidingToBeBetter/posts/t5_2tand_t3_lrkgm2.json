S. You can see on my Instagram about this project and also the highlights on IG for some lovely feedback I've received from recent recipients. My IG is www.instagram.com/TheGeekAndTheBeast \n\nP. P. S in Feb I sent out nearly 70 cards with little gifts (stickers, colouring pages, etc) I don't think I've written that much since I was at school \ud83d\ude02", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lrkgm2/want_a_card_of_positivity_in_the_post_uk_to_ww/", "title": "Want a card of positivity in the post?
