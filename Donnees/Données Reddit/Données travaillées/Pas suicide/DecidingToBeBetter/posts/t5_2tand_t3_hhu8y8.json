Other people prefer utility; a garden full of vegetable beds overflowing with herbs and produce. Some want something natural; they get joy from the birds and bees visiting their wildflowers. Some prefer something low-maintenance; they pour gravel and pick out a few potted cacti.\n\nThese are just a few examples of lives worth living. None of these are wrong, and none of these are necessarily right. Authenticity is extremely important. If you've poured gravel, but yearn for vegetable beds, you've got work to do.\n\nAnd don't get confused - there will always be work. Your garden will never be 'complete'. It is a temporal thing that changes with the seasons. It requires nutrients and upkeep. If you let invasive weeds take root, they will spread. Bit by bit, your garden will lose integrity, and it will bring you less joy.\n\nSo, be sure to select what goes into your garden. Prune it, weed it, feed it. It's a precious gift that's yours to curate.
