I've been trying to meditate so I can 1) \"unfocus\" for once and (2) try to calm myself down when anxiety is running high.\n\nI know meditation takes time to see the benefits, but I'm not lying when I say I totally suck at it.  I started off meditating by trying to stay focused on my breath for as long as I could without getting anxious (because boredom is my biggest fear apparently), and I last for around 8 minutes.  But those 8 minutes are full of so many random thoughts because of ADHD:  I'll be counting the seconds of inhaling one moment, and then the next I'll have some random thought like what needs to be added to the grocery list/calendar or something that I need to do later. Rinse repeat for every 1 or 2 inhales/exhales.\n\nHow do I treat these thoughts?  I know you're not supposed to shut them down completely, but  instead acknowledge then move on back to breathing, but how?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfnd5u/how_do_you_stay_focused_on_breathing_during/", "title": "How do you stay focused on breathing during meditation?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "UnpaidNewscast", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1635187289, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfnd5u/how_do_you_stay_focused_on_breathing_during/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435771.67841, "replies_charged": false}
