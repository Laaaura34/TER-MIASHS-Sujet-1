That means quit ALL drugs , change my sleep schedule , exercise everyday except Saturday and Sunday , get more sunshine , spend more time off my phone , make new friends , follow better examples , change my thought process and look at things from a different perspective as well . I have ocd and negative thoughts tend to bring me down since I hold on to those (I don\u2019t know why . It\u2019s exhausting for me and it stops me from doing other things . I want better friends at high school but I\u2019m quite shy and can hardly speak up for myself . It\u2019s going to be a challenge but I\u2019m going to give it a shot . Breaking bad habits and getting comfortable with being UNcomfortable is something I need to get used to . Waking up early , doing something I don\u2019t want to do (productive wise) . It\u2019s going to be hard / challenging but it\u2019s better for me you know ? If anyone wants to chat please hit me up ! I\u2019m more than willing to talk with you :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p9jrs5/17_years_old_my_names_jesse_trying_to_turn_my/", "title": "17 years old .
