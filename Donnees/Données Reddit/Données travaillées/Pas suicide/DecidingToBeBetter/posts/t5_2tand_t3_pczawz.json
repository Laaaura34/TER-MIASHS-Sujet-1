I immediately got slammed with internship prep and advanced core classes and whatever else you could think of. Everything is becoming \"real\". I became overwhelmed by all of this and am having serious thoughts of dropping out (for the 2nd time). All of this \"real\" talk of actually getting hired made me realize that I really have no interest in my major, that I would rather be doing other things aside from the more traditional path of internships and obtaining a job. This should be an exciting time, but I feel awful and like I'm not in the right place.\n\nI was thinking about moving to the mountains and becoming a ski bum for a season or two, go and work some places that truly interest me, and go and try new things cause who knows what I'll like. I feel like my time is limited even though I'm still relatively young. I probably only feel this way because many people graduate at the age of 22-23. \n\nI feel lost again but might as well just take a gap year doing stuff I know I love instead of grinding out stuff I know isn't for me or trying to stick with college.\n\nAny advice is appreciated,\n\nThank you", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pczawz/23_and_might_drop_out_of_school_again/", "title": "23 and might drop out of school again", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "JdaPimp", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1630109163, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pczawz/23_and_might_drop_out_of_school_again/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435079.2764294, "replies_charged": false}
