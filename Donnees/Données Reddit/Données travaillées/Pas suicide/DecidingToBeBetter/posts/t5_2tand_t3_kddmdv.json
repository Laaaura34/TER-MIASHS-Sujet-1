I think it can be beneficial to a lot of people for multiple reasons, but for me what was just harmless smoking before bed, turned into smoking multiple times a day. It really wasn\u2019t healthy. Weed had made my depression and anxiety worse without me even realizing it. Anytime I got high I just wanted to lay in bed and waste away, stuff myself with bad food, and just sit on my phone. It eventually took ahold of my diet, and I developed eating disorders. I felt like I had become a lifeless zombie.\n\n It wasn\u2019t until my second trip to the hospital a week ago when the doctors told me that I have CHS. (Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome) I had already been doing my own research and figured I was suffering from it, due to months of vomiting. While I was hooked up to the IV and my dad was sitting in the chair staring at me, I had made the decision to be better. No more wasting my life away. No more hospital visits. No more brain fog, and questioning why I feel the way I do. No more weed. \n\n It\u2019s been a week without it, and I feel amazing. Today was the best day I have had in months. My relationships with others are already starting to improve as I\u2019ve become more extroverted again. And since I haven\u2019t been getting high and distracting myself, I\u2019ve been able to properly manage taking care of myself and being able to eat more than just a few bites of food. My nausea, headaches, and body aches went away. I truly haven\u2019t felt this good in my body for so long, it feels like seeing an old friend again. I even got a job interview this Saturday for my dream job! I\u2019m more creative, I got back into drawing and playing music. I\u2019m more content with life. I know it\u2019s only been a week, but this just makes me so hopeful for the future and only how much better it will get. I just wanted to share this here in case anyone needs a sign to get sober or to change your life for the better.
