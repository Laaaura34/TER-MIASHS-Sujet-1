And carefully listen to their stories and problems ,try to be helpful when giving advice \nI know maybe I mixed up some things together and my english is not that good, but I try my best,\n\nAnd the last point is \n- avoid backbiting your beloved ones , the one who listens to you is the one who take your words to the other person, if you saw something terrible of a person, go and tell them to make it right, and of course  tell them when you are alone and don\u2019t make fun of them when people around , people love the ones to correct them seriously and worry about them .\nThanks for reading just wanted to share some thoughts .", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p4eqpr/attitude_with_others/", "title": "Attitude with others !", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Dana_J900", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1628970374, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p4eqpr/attitude_with_others/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635436833.0787692, "replies_charged": false}
