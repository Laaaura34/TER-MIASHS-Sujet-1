This morning, my family decided that my brother and I should learn to drive. My brother has some experience, while I am new to this.\n\nTheoretical seminars will take place at 2:00 pm from July 20 to 22, so in preparation for these, the reception of my student permit, and eventually, practical driving training and tests to receive a full driver's license, I received two safety manuals, one for basic safety and one for advanced safety. Time allowing, I set a plan before July 20 that I will allot two hours in the afternoon to studying driving safety from the basic manual, and if willing, the advanced manual.\n\nI know I am new to this, hence my fears that I wouldn't be a good driver, but I hope everything negative about my perceptions on driving will set aside.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/obgbio/starting_to_learn_driving_and_getting_over_my/", "title": "Starting to learn driving and getting over my fear that I'm not good enough to drive", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "RedBomber785", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 7, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1625123105, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/obgbio/starting_to_learn_driving_and_getting_over_my/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435088.3187122, "replies_charged": false}
