Mainly it seems I watch them in order to point out what I am not doing, in order to push  some motivation out of the slump im in. So im wondering do I stop watching shows all together and read books or do I just watch education ones that don\u2019t cause me to focus so much on what im not doing? I often have a problem looking at what others are always doing right in life vs what I am doing wrong. Now I would see it as beneficial, except I'm not beginning actions that show changed behaviours. Instead I just stay into how pathetic I am, a pity party is not a good thing. I need to wake up. So I guess posting here helps with that, thanks if you read, stay safe and enjoy your life fully.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jwv3x6/implementing_small_changes_for_my_weak_mindset/", "title": "Implementing small changes for my weak mindset", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Crippledmomentum45", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 3, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1605756475, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jwv3x6/implementing_small_changes_for_my_weak_mindset/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435482.3849704, "replies_charged": false}
