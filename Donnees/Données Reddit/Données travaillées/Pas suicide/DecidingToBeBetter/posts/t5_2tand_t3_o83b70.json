I wake up at 4:30 AM(I am a morning person and can't stay awake after 11PM) I start studying with full motivation and I actually do 4 hours of studying, I exercise for 15 minutes and then around 11AM my motivation goes down again , I start playing Valorant and I masturbate everytime I have nothing to do. I have no motivation to watch my classes(they are recorded lectures) and I feel guilty everday and I think about it at night and the cycle continues. I have 5 months before my entrance exams and I want to work my ass off and surpass my limits, Is there any way that I can break out of this cycle?
