Is there a lot of suck in your life? If life had suck coupon cards would you be 9/10 of the way to a free lawn mower? Good, then you and I have something in common.\n\nI\u2019ve done a bunch of empirical research (read: repeating the same mistakes over and over again) on what to do when life gets shitty. It looks we have two options:\n\nOption 1: The self centered egotistical entitled asshat\n\nThis option mostly revolves around abdicating responsibility for our destiny and blaming the rest of the world for our situation. We bitch about how we\u2019re the victim, it\u2019s not our fault, and life isn\u2019t fair.\n\nHonestly I\u2019ve tried this approach A LOT, and I\u2019ve gotten absolute whiskey dick results with it. Now, life is NOT fair, that part is true. But bitching about it didn\u2019t fix a damn thing. So what about Strategy 2?\n\nOption 2: The ambivalent opportunist\n\nThis option is basically Samwise the gamgee. Kind of a fugly hobbit who doesn\u2019t give up. My bestie is getting hunted by demon wraiths? I only get supporting character role even though I\u2019m doing all the work? No great sex scenes with hot elves? Aight, well I might as well save the universe anywhere because I need to live here.\n\nSee that last part? Decidedly productive without any resentment for the cards dealt. That\u2019s important. Like that\u2019s the only part of this post to pay attention to (the rest is me allegorically masturbating under the influence of greek white wine and Tool\u2019s latest album on replay).  You really can take the piss out of life. You can decide to act in your best interest regardless of the cards life gives you. We should all be more like the fugly hobbit.\n\nTo be frank, any other option makes no sense at all. Like venting is probably good. It\u2019s nice that we can let it all go once in a while. Good friends will listen and bad friends will put up with it if we buy them drinks. But there comes a point where that\u2019s not helpful any more. There comes a point where YOU HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR OWN LIFE. There comes a point where no one is listening and you can either make your life better or choose stagnation.\n\nThe jokes are over now. This is your life. Life is not fair and we don\u2019t know what will happen when we die. But you\u2019re here now. Life has given you some cards. Maybe they\u2019re fuck all worth of a hand, but it\u2019s your hand. You can decide what to do with them. Maybe you\u2019ll try to make the best of it just so you have a better tomorrow. Maybe you\u2019ll decide to heal some old wounds just because they are there and you don\u2019t want to limp anymore. Maybe you\u2019ll make your life better for you and that\u2019s the only reason you need.\n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s best for you. I don\u2019t know what pain you\u2019ve been through. But I know that every adversity is a decision on what you want out of life. You can complain if you want to. Or you can make the best of these shitty cards in your hand. It sucks they aren\u2019t better. But it\u2019s up to you. You can do your best or you can bitch about it. What\u2019s it gonna be?\n\n**Further Reading:** If this post resonated with you I think you should read *Meditations* by Marcus Aurilius. He\u2019s basically calling himself out like this and it\u2019s comforting to know even a Roman Emperor had to work on his insecurities, anxieties, and bitching about his problems too much.
