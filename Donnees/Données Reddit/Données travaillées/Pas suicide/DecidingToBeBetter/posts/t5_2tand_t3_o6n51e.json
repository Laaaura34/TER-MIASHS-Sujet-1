I always had to find someone new to get over the last one, then I\u2019d get heartbroken again, and so the cycle continued. Romantic relationships have always made me feel disempowered. I\u2019d fall for them, then they\u2019d leave me for someone else. \n\nHaven\u2019t had sex in 2 years, and I\u2019m still so angry at the last one who left me for someone else. I want to learn to be happy on my own. I try to use my time well, and have great hobbies. I have a good support system and am thankful for the people I have in my life. They\u2019re all certain that I\u2019m great and that I\u2019ll definitely find someone someday. But I just feel so bad. Like a dark shadow is constantly hanging over me, even when I accomplish things or do things that I love. I\u2019m in therapy too. \n\nIdk what to do.
