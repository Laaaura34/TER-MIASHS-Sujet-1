I was a constant smoker of weed (an every day occurrence, multiple times a day if not all day long). I would smoke during my work days and on my breaks, then come home and continue smoking (mostly dabs and THC carts but also the occasional flower).\n\nA few months ago, I had a scary experience happen after taking four huge hits off of a coworkers cart at work. Nothing felt real and I started getting very paranoid. It went away after my high wore off, so I wasn\u2019t too worried about it having to do with the manic side of my bipolar disorder. It didn\u2019t happen every time I smoked weed so I just shrugged it off as being a one time thing but boy was I wrong. It started happening more frequently and even started happening when I hadn\u2019t smoked at all. It all came to a head about a week ago now when I had another scary experience happen (when I hadn\u2019t smoked any weed for two days straight). \n\nIt was nighttime and I was trying to fall asleep but couldn\u2019t due to closed-eye visuals (mainly geometric patterns) I would get every time I shut my eyes to go to bed. I would look over at my boyfriend\u2019s face and all of his facial features would disappear. I would look in the corner of the room and the door would start to disappear. I got so scared I started crying and my boyfriend had to turn on several lights in order to calm me down. It was then in that moment of pure terror that I decided to go into the bathroom and take one of the pills from my medication bottle. It was in that moment of complete and utter fear that I decided to stop smoking weed for the time being until I get back on my feet.\n\nAs of right now, I am 9 days clean from smoking weed and have been back on my meds for 8 days now. I guess what I\u2019m trying to get at is that for a long time, I was in denial about needing my meds because of feeling like I could handle what I was going through on my own. I now realize that needing medication isn\u2019t something to be ashamed or embarrassed about. If you or someone you know is in the same position I was, please don\u2019t be ashamed of needing that extra something (medication) to help you/them live your/their life. And please, for the love of God, do NOT discourage anyone from doing something (as long as it\u2019s safe and healthy) they believe will help them in the long run. \ud83d\ude0a", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nxufa1/decided_to_go_back_on_my_meds_and_stop_smoking/", "title": "Decided to go back on my meds and stop smoking weed for the time being", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "GoldenDog1112", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 12, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1623458145, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nxufa1/decided_to_go_back_on_my_meds_and_stop_smoking/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435800.65939, "replies_charged": false}
