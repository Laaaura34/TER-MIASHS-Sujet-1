I\u2019m looking for advice because I cannot seem to change the way I am and I 10/10 recognise it\u2019s wrong. For example, girl I have been on a date or two with is going on dates with other guys which is absolutely fair because she is single and trying to find the right person, yet I cannot seem to help myself but be incredibly jealous. I of course do not say anything but it\u2019s definitely jealousy in my head which then just leads to me being sad. \n\nIn addition, most people that know me know me as this really calm, patient person who wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly, which to some extent is true, I wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone. But inside I\u2019m genuinely angry and bitter a lot of the time and I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s led me to be depressed, I\u2019m constantly either angry or sad. Stuff that just shouldn\u2019t annoy me sets me off internally, I never vocalise it or show it but inside I\u2019m 100% fuming. \n\nNot entirely sure what to do to be honest, I had a look in the sidebar for anger or jealousy subreddits but I couldn\u2019t see any! If anyone has any advice or suggestions as to how I can somehow change my way of thinking I\u2019d appreciate it!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mf81cq/any_advice_for_someone_whos_well_aware_that_they/", "title": "Any advice for someone who\u2019s well aware that they feel bitter/angry and jealous a lot?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "Insulifting", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 5, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616959925, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mf81cq/any_advice_for_someone_whos_well_aware_that_they/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635438395.098565, "replies_charged": false}
