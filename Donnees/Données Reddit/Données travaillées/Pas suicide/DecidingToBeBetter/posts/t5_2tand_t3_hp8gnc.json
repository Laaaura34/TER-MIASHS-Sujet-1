Food tastes better when you're high, but when you're always high then that state of high-eating just becomes your new normal, and when you stop getting high then you stop getting hungry and food just doesn't taste like anything. \n\nNicotine suppresses appetites, and many people end up gaining a lot of weight after quitting smoking. \n\nIn my my new scientific study with a sample size of me, it turns out that the loss of appetite from quitting weed far outweighs the increase in eating from quitting nicotine. I have been living off one or two small meals a day for weeks now (I actually stopped my weed intake with a new job I started a month ago on days I worked, but still smoked on my days off, but ran out completely earlier this week). \n\nOn the plus side I'm fat enough to never feel faint or tired from this lack of food and am down like 10 pounds in the last month. Not to mention the overnight improvement in my breathing. Don't worry though I know the lack of food isn't great but I've been around the block with weight management so I'll be riding this wave for as long as I can. \n\nCheers", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hp8gnc/three_days_of_no_nicotine_or_marijuana_just_raw/", "title": "Three days of no nicotine or marijuana, just raw dogging reality out here", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "--COMMUNIST--", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 1967, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1594466798, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hp8gnc/three_days_of_no_nicotine_or_marijuana_just_raw/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435876.5499935, "replies_charged": false}
