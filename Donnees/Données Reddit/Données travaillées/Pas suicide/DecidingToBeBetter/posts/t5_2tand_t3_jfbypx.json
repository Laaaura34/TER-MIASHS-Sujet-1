Over the last couple of years I have had some success with sobriety. However this time feels way different and I am very close to the 1 year mark! November 2019 I was in the hospital for two days from an allergic reaction to the flu shot of all things. During my hospital stay I thought about my future and what I was actually doing in my life. It was during this time that I most probably solidified my idea of prolonged sobriety. As soon as I was released from the hospital I went to my city's vocational training center to see what skills were available for future employment. I hated to my soul my current job at that time. I was a \"box kicker\" a \"grunt\" and got zero joy out of my job. I discovered the welding trade. I just completed my 7th week of welding school. AND I LOVE IT!!! The future is looking very bright now and it all started with putting down the drink.
