I\u2019ve been a long time lurker here, and this is my first time posting. I\u2019ve decided to go ahead and take a much needed technology break. I\u2019m constantly upset every Sunday when I see how much time per day I log onto my phone, so I\u2019m finally doing something about it. I\u2019m only going to be using my phone to send texts, make calls, and watch resourceful/educational videos relating to what I\u2019m studying in college. I know that I have many amazing ideas and thoughts, but never seem to capitalize on them as I distract myself from completion. This extra time I\u2019m making for myself will surely help me improve and see more results from my efforts.\n\nI just thought I\u2019d post this here to keep myself accountable. I truly wish anyone who reads this the best, and know that you can do anything you set your mind to! Much love, many blessings, and high vibrations.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/me0cmw/taking_a_much_needed_technology_break/", "title": "Taking a much needed technology break", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "PlanetEarthCitizen", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 11, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1616798337, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/me0cmw/taking_a_much_needed_technology_break/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435588.2758136, "replies_charged": false}
