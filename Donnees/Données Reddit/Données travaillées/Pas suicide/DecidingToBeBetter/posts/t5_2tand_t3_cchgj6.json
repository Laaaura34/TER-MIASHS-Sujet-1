I want to learn how to be more grateful for what I already have and stop always wanting more. I know that I'm so insanely privileged and lucky already, to live in a nice house and go to a very good school and have amazing friends. But I'm never satisfied. I keep wanting more friends, more money, more things etc. In a way, I guess it could be good because I keep trying to improve, but sometimes I wish I could just be happy with I already have.\n\nPlease give me tips on ways to change my mindset or things to read/videos to watch that help!
