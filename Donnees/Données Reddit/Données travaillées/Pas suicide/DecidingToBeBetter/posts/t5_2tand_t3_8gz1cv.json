I have my dream job working with my best friends. Overall I like who I am as a person and I'm constantly trying to improve and help others on their journey. \n\nI've done a lot of reflection over the past year. I've dug deep into behaviors and patterns I developed as a child and I'm in the process of rewiring my brain to change the behaviors. I've found that once you get really deep into the personal development world it's hard to find the next thing to help you level up. It seems like there's three levels and I'm stuck on level two. \n\nI'm looking for some tactical tips to level up. I love experimenting so I'm open to trying new things. For example, I talk to strangers to learn more about human behavior, to challenge conversation skills, to learn more about storytelling. \n\nDoes anyone here have some experiments to try?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8gz1cv/what_are_some_experiments_i_can_try_to_help_me/", "title": "what are some experiments I can try to help me level up?", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "haleyunscripted", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 14, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1525438710, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8gz1cv/what_are_some_experiments_i_can_try_to_help_me/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635437863.0395823, "replies_charged": false}
