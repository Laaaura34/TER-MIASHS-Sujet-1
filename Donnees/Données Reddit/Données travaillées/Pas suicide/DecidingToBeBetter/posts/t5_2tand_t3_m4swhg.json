This always happens. I rarely finish whatever I'm reading because in the middle of it I start imagining how great I'd look referencing this stuff in real life. \n\nI don't wish to be like this. Is this a sign that I'm vain or shallow, and that I probably shouldn't be involved in social issues like this because I want to flex rather than understand?\n\nI want to be the kind of person who reads something, researches upon it, writes something about it and then see some contrary opinions. But I can\u2019t. My mind just launches into imaginary dialogues with people where I can show how stupid they are or how smart I am. That\u2019s kind of the only reason I read anything, be it philosophy or sociology or psychology. When I read something that\u2019s actually valuable but I can\u2019t show off (course books would be a good example), I\u2019m just not interested in it. I don\u2019t wanna learn, I wanna show I\u2019m a genius. \n\nI need to be better.
