Share what you\u2019re proud of! Let the achievements of others push you to better yourself. \n\nWe all go through our own ups and downs, but sometimes we can\u2019t seem to get climb out of that hole. Depression is not something that goes away like the cold, it stays with us. Sometimes we can fight it and show it who\u2019s boss, but sometimes we get so low that it feel we\u2019re stuck under a dark cloud. This is nothing to be ashamed of, as you are not alone! \n\nI\u2019m making this post for those that are looking for advice, for those that are willing to give advice and help others, and more importantly, to share the small accomplishments we do on a daily basis. It\u2019s the small accomplishments that can really get us to think clearly and climb out of the holes we are in.\n\nIf you are sad, and need someone to talk to, let us know what you\u2019re going through. We redditors love to help each other out, so please reach out for help. We may not be able to solve your problems or have all of the answers, but I can assure you that you are not fighting this alone. If you show up, we\u2019ll bring the shovels and snacks. Let\u2019s dig you out of that hole you\u2019re in, together. \n\nWelcome to the climb to a healthy mind, we\u2019re glad you could join us :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jxam80/tell_us_something_that_youre_proud_of_yourself/", "title": "Tell us something that you\u2019re proud of yourself for doing!
