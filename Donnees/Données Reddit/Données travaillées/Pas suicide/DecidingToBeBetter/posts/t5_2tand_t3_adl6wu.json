I start out with two tabs - scrolling through my Reddit homepage for a few minutes with youtube for background music. Then youtube presents me a fine assortment of videos, and who am I to not oblige? I say to myself, 'It's okay, only a five-minute video'. 'I have time, it's just another six-minute video'. 'Just this small video'... 'Oh shit! It's dinner time'. Don't need a black hole to experience relativity of time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen I decided to make one change. One little change.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI tend to watch random videos on youtube, why not watch/listen to something good? For a start, I began listening to productivity videos, like Thomas Frank, while doing chores. It was a small change, but it fulfilled the urge of listening to something on youtube. This way I don't have to drain my willpower to overcome that urge. And as a plus, listening to thought-provoking content mostly prevents me from watching a chain of videos and urges me to do actual work. Once this initial resistance is overcome, things start to go smoothly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been trying this for a week or so, and have found it really helpful. I'm hoping to introduce similar tweaks to other unhealthy habits too.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/adl6wu/using_procrastination_to_my_advantage/", "title": "Using procrastination to my advantage", "social_network": "reddit", "user": "SidSidderSiddest", "subreddit": "DecidingToBeBetter", "subreddit_path": "r/DecidingToBeBetter/", "up_vote": 29, "down_vote": 0, "creation": 1546889303, "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/adl6wu/using_procrastination_to_my_advantage/", "nsfw": false, "first_save": 1635435155.824616, "replies_charged": false}
