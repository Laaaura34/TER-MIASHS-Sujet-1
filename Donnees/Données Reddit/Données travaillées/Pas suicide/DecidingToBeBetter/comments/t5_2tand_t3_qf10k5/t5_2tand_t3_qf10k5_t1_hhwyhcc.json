Dont put so much pressure on yourself. I\u2019ve been trying to exercise regularly for years now. Still can\u2019t do it. \n\nTry focusing on one thing at a time instead of doing all of them at the same time.\n\nAlso, celebrate small wins. Drinking water when you get up is still a win. It\u2019s one thing off your to-do list. When you\u2019re sure that habit has stuck, add another to it like exercising for 5 to 10 minutes a day. The exercise can be something as simple as going for a walk. \n\nBe gentle with yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qf10k5/falling_short_on_routines_any_advicehelp/hhwyhcc/"}
