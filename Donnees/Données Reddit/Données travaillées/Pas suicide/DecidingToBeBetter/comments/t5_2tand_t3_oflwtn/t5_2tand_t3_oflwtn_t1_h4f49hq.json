I\u2019ve tried a lot of different things and feel the only thing that really makes sense is finding a way to enjoy the present moment. You can\u2019t control anything else. For me meditation, yoga, music, travel and helping others are all paths to this. I\u2019m sure there are many more.\n\nEDIT for OP: major props on your weight loss. I hope you can congratulate yourself on this and literally just be proud of how far you\u2019ve come. It\u2019s ok to give yourself a mental break to stop striving nonstop!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oflwtn/how_to_accept_that_feeling_good_is_possible/h4f49hq/"}
