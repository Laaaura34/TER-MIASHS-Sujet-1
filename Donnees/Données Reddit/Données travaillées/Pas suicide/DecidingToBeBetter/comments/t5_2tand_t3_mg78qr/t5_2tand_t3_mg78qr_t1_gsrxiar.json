I've felt in the past like your option 1 was an option for me, too, usually because of stress at school and home, and it sucked. I still feel that way sometimes, and it makes it even harder to manage my daily life as it is normally, but I'm much better at managing those feelings after living with them for some time. As far as for what you should do, I think you're limiting your viewpoint of what your options are. Life is, honestly, completely full of things that will come up and surprise you in ways that you never expected. Whatever happens, you're going to be okay as long as you take care of yourself. Maybe I'm just talking in circles, or maybe I'm doing a bad job of making how I think NOT sound like idealistic bullshit, but I hope some of it helps. Take care of yourself, do your best, and be a good person. That's all the world can ask of you. It sounds like your parents' expectations are playing a large role in how you're feeling. I don't know the ins and outs of your situation, so I'm not going to tell you what to feel in regards to them, but its my opinion that a parent's number one job is to support you through whatever life throws at you until you're ready to stand on your own feet. If theyre putting pressure on you in a way that just brings you down, then they're in the wrong. Just my two cents. Like I said, I hope something I've said gives you some peace of mind, my friend.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mg78qr/is_there_a_way_to_keep_goin_from_this_situation/gsrxiar/"}
