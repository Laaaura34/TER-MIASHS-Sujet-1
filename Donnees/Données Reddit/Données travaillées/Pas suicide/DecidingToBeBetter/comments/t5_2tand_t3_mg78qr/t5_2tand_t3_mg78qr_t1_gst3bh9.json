There's nothing wrong with asking for help when life is tough. I know in the past, I was reluctant to do the same, because I compared myself to my classmates and felt that if they weren't getting extra help, I didn't deserve it, because I should be able to perform at the same level, or better than them, but the truth of the matter is that things like this happen more often than people like to admit, and I'm certain there are other students that are getting help due to whatever they've got going on. Thing is, we're never going to find out who it is because a teacher isn't going to broadcast it to the whole class. So it just seems like everyone else is doing fine, perpetuating the negative thoughts. \n\nNow, I've done a LOT of assuming about your thought processes here, in that I'm assuming that they're similar to how I've thought in the past, and still feel sometimes. If I've just completely gone in the wrong direction with it, then I apologize, but regardless, I maintain that it's probably worth it to contact your teachers. I wish you the best, friend.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mg78qr/is_there_a_way_to_keep_goin_from_this_situation/gst3bh9/"}
