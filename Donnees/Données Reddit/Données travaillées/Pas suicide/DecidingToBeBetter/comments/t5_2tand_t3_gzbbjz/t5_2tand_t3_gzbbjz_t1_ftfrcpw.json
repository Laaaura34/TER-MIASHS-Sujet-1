It would infuriate me hearing people be nice and joking around with people they have told me they didn't like because i felt being fake was only doing the other person a disservice but with me being on what i would consider a high horse looking back i do feel bad telling people the truth about how i felt about them. What i have learned from lost opportunities and general feedback from my friends and family is to try and be the least 'fake' as you can and just avoid the people who make you feel like you have to be fake around them. For me this involves politely saying hi to people and continuing my work or leaving if i dont want to talk to them at all since i feel i have a very low threshold for bullshit haha", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gzbbjz/i_dont_feel_comfortable_smiling_and_faking_it/ftfrcpw/"}
