LOTS !!! (i mean LOTS) of women have gone from receiving no male attention to receiving tons, not knowing how to handle it, and then living in constant fear of losing it. remind yourself that male attention centered around appearance isn\u2019t always good, and your life is full of other beautiful and fulfilling things. \n\nsorry i wrote so much. i\u2019m a 24 year old and i felt your situation very deeply. you are not alone, sooooo many women feel these same things. i would advise listening to mia khalifas interview on call her daddy. i don\u2019t particularly like that podcast but mia has a beautiful story that has a lot of similarities to yours. it may give you some peace. i hope you take good care of yourself and remember no one suffers alone!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/obd5t4/19_yr_old_girl_who_began_receiving_attention_from/h5coqtj/"}
