For me reading is what started this process of positive reinforcement. One thing I will say about reading is that its not just about the knowledge you get from the books, its about hearing things you already know said in a different way and hopefully that gives you the push you need to make a change or take action. Also partially why I have decided to start the youtube channel. I don't have anything new to say about these things so on the surface level it feels pointless to say it, but maybe the way I deliver the message can be useful to some people.\n\nI also find for me that all of these habits sort of feed into each other. When my diet is good my sleeping is better my work outs are better I'm able to focus more, and when one of them fails they all suffer (diet is usually the one that makes everything crumble a bit.)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k0z61w/update_i_posted_my_commitment_to_be_better_2/gdocoef/"}
