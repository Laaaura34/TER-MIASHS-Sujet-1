I mean it doesn't have to be as morbid as dying either. Maybe a month from now something will happen at work or in a relationship that gives you less energy to work on your own improvements. You never really know what sort of interruptions to your life there are going to be in the future, the only thing you know is that there will be something and when it does come you are going to regret not doing a better job of things when it was easier.\n\nEdit: Oh and to answer regarding the treatment, Ritalin is what I'm using. It's the only treatment I've ever tried but its always worked quite well for me so never felt the need to try others.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k0z61w/update_i_posted_my_commitment_to_be_better_2/gdod1e5/"}
