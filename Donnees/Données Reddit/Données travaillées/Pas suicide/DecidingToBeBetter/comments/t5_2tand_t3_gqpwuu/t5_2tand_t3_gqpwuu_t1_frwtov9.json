I vividly remember standing in the middle of London and thinking that everyone was looking so normal when I felt such fear - with no cause. It was surreal. What helped most was knowing it was gonna happen, that it was temporary and caused by meds, nothing real. That allowed me to be patient and just wait it out. Plus, talking honestly to my friends; I received so much more support than I expected. Lots more people have been on antidepressants than I ever suspected.\n\nHonestly, Setraline (antidepressant) has changed my life and I wish I had been on it for years already. I feel so much better and am able to cope, even be successful in life. I never wanna stop taking them.\n\nPS: if you do go on meds, don't skip a day. I was surprised by how much withdrawal messed me up... I felt effects after 6 hours and I felt awful.
