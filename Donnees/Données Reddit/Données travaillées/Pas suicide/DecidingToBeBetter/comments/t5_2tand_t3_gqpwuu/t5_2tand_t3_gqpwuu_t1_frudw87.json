If these meds don't work for you, keep trying different ones. It can take a while to find a good one/dosage. Watch out for mixing them with alcohol and the nasty possibility of suicidal thoughts as a side effect. \n\nI'm proud of you for taking this major step to get help. That's often the hardest part. You're a great father. \n\nSidenote if you're ever worried about anyone on Reddit there is a button on their page you can click which is intended to help them get support. It sends a list of resources and offers support for yourself as well, and tips to help talk to those crisis.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gqpwuu/update_one_upvote_and_ill_admit_myself_to_the/frudw87/"}
