But it is a process, figuring out what works for you.\n\nSome meds take weeks to really start to feel the effects. Some just *don\u2019t* work well for people - I\u2019ve been on a medication that works really well for many people with minimal side effects- but it made me much worse. Went back to the doctor and was like \u201cI want off, now\u201d. Walked out of there with a new prescription and a sense of relief.\n\n\nDon\u2019t lose hope if the first thing you try doesn\u2019t work :) \n\nIt will get better, and over time you will get better at recognising the lies that depression weaves around you, and with suitable medication you may find that the power it once had over you suddenly seems feeble in comparison to your inner strength.\n\nAlways happy to chat about my experiences if you want to PM :) Diagnosed at age 11 so got some years under my belt ;D", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gqpwuu/update_one_upvote_and_ill_admit_myself_to_the/frwtn8u/"}
