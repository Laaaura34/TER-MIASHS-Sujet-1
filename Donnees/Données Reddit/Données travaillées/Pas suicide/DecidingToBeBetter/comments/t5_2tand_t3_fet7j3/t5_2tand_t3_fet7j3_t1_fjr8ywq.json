I mean if or when you feel comfortbale and confident enough for in person treatment, its my best recommendation to you. But there are theraputic books as well. Just like therapy in person with a psychologist, only wth a book. Of course both book authors (which are themselves psychiatrists / psychologiats / etc....) and psychologists recommend in person treatment, but therapy books are really fucking good way of therapy. and if youre scared of face to face talk, books might be perfect for you.\n\nIts a real theraputic method called bibliotherapy:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliotherapy\n\nbest of luck <3\n\nalso I na recommend real therqpy with a psychologist - BUT ONLINE - Less embarassing, more comfortbale. you cnaconsult on forums with spychologists and also ask for therapy books!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fet7j3/except_for_therapy_too_scared_to_go_does_anyone/fjr8ywq/"}
