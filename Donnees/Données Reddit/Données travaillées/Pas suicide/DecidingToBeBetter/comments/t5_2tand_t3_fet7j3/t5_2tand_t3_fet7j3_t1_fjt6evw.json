(Lighting a candle and looking at it for a couple of minutes is a decent one.)\n\n- Get really interested in something, so you have an effective mental side route, and a way of practicing with strong emotions.  \n\n(Sports teams and theatre are both great for that emotional escape.  However, if you\u2019re really focused on life goals, picking a productivity guru like David Allen to start watching can be helpful.)\n\nTo support yourself:\n\n- Pick avoidance options you\u2019re cool with.  \n(You may want to refill a water bottle, or put a few things away, or write yourself a few notes. )\nThe goal is to shake off the fight-flight-freeze urge for a minute, and do something more helpful.  \n\n- Plan to give yourself low stimulation times for recovery:\n(Going for a walk someplace fairly quiet can work especially well for this, gently physical tasks like cooking and gardening are good too.)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fet7j3/except_for_therapy_too_scared_to_go_does_anyone/fjt6evw/"}
