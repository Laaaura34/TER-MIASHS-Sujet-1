Its too easy to not hold yourself accountable and not having someone to identify and call out your BS means you might not be able to recognize the patterns in your thoughts/behaviors.\n\nPlease also reach out to friends and family who can help support you. They might be able to provide the support structure to help get you into therapy.\n\nYou gotta put 100% of your will towards getting to therapy cause this isnt something you'll get over yourself. Cause if you cant heal yourself to get to a therapist, you aren't really healing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fet7j3/except_for_therapy_too_scared_to_go_does_anyone/fjt4yz1/"}
