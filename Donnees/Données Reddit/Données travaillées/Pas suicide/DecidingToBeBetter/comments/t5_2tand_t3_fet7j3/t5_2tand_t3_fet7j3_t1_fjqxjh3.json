Creating interpersonal connections can be difficult for anyone with a mental health problem, I can\u2019t imagine how difficult it is for someone with APD. That being said, it may be beneficial to start with therapy.\n\nHear me out. This person is someone you would be guaranteed to be able to talk to. They would be guaranteed to do their best to help you. It\u2019ll be difficult at first. You need to find a therapist that you click with, that you feel comfortable with, and that takes work. It takes effort to try and talk about what you\u2019re feeling, and it takes time to find the person who seems best for you.\n\nTackling this problem won\u2019t be easy, and theres nothing you can read or watch that will magically cure you. It takes real effort to get the help you need, and the longer you discount it the longer you prolong the problem. \n\nPlease, for yourself, get the help you need. There\u2019s no shame in it. There\u2019s nothing you need to fear so much.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fet7j3/except_for_therapy_too_scared_to_go_does_anyone/fjqxjh3/"}
