Perhaps write a time-line out but don't put in dates, just stages. Write out the story of the next chapter of your life.  Pay off debt before you move out for instance.  You want to try to live somewhere new? Take a trip to a few cities and do some activities there. Don't expect to move somewhere you haven't visited a few times. I suspect you have difficulty connecting to others? One thing that can improve this is helping people in need. Volunteer at a place that helps people.  For instance delivering groceries to shut ins is a great opportunity to see how kindness improves people's lives and many of these people need conversation as much as they need food. The other volunteers will also be the kinds of people who care for others. Great role models.  A great idea would be to volunteer with an organization that is all over the country.  You could contact places in other cities,  visit,  help, meet people and while delivering you can get an idea of what it's like to live there. You will be talking to people who know the city well and it's a great conversation starter. Also don't think your life has to be like others. You get to form your own good life. Things will happen for you differently than for others and that's fine. In fact it gives you a great perspective on things so when your ready you will have seen lots of examples of what you want and don't want in your life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o9q1kj/seriously_behind_in_life_would_appreciate_some/h3clul2/"}
