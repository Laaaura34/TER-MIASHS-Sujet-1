Best choice of my life by far! It helps to not look at the negativity of twitter and for me I found smaller community from places like twitch joined a small community discord and made some friends that way!  \n\n\n2. When you think you have the money research and find a place that's right for you! Even a small apartment will work! Having your own space makes you more independent and motivated to do your best!  \n\n\n3. Idk if your parents would allow it but my pet cat helped me! When I felt like I was nothing I cried into my cats shoulder and they purred and snuggled me :D  \n\n\n(I dont know if these will work for you but I hope they help!)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o9q1kj/seriously_behind_in_life_would_appreciate_some/h3dwt00/"}
