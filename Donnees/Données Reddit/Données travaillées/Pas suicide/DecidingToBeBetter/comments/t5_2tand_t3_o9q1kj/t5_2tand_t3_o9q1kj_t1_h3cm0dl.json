I have to say, you are making a way bigger deal out of every single thing on this list than they really are. I was a virgin until I was 23, and I had the same fear that I would die one. But I\u2019m honestly happy that I was more mature and capable of dealing with the emotions involved (especially as a woman) than I would have been if I was 15.\n\nI lived with my parents until I was 26, and I saved a ton of money doing it! I also became friends with my parents, which I\u2019m totally not ashamed to admit. It gave us an opportunity to get to know each other on a different level.\n\nEveryone\u2019s in debt, man. Especially people in their 20\u2019s. And 30\u2019s. And 40\u2019s.\n\nYou\u2019re already more traveled than most people. If you want to travel more, start a separate bank account and set up a direct deposit from your paychecks of a certain amount that goes directly into that account, which is specifically set aside for travel.\n\nMaking friends as an adult is hard, but it does happen. In 2015 I was in a serious relationship but had no other friends. It was the most alone I ever felt, and I thought I\u2019d never have a friend group again. I am shy when I meet new people, and I\u2019m an introvert by nature, so I don\u2019t make friends easily. But now I have a really close knit group of friends that I can\u2019t even imagine life without (and my relationship is over). Let these things happen organically. But also, pursue your interests and you will meet people. Join a fitness club (there\u2019s one in my city that does the little workout stations in the public park), check online for classifieds looking for people to jam with, or better yet, go to Guitar Center and strike up conversation with someone looking for advice on what guitar to buy.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this. You\u2019re gonna get your D wet, I promise \ud83d\ude02", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o9q1kj/seriously_behind_in_life_would_appreciate_some/h3cm0dl/"}
