I struggle with interpersonal relationships so I value this a lot. He said he won't speak to me again if I name-called. But yes, his comment still doesn't sit right with me. He later acknowledged that it wasn't nice of him. I don't know if his comment was necessarily consciously intended to hurt, but it was definitely tactless and that was its result. I'll pay more attention to how he behaves when it's time to acknowledge his own part in something.
