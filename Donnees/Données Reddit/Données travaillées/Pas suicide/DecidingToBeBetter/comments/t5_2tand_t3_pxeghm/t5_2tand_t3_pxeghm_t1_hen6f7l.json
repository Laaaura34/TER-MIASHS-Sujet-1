He then let his frustration out regarding your lack of acknowledgement in a super mean way. He wanted to hurt you with the ex comment. He wanted you to feel less than her. So, he was being a petty bastard. I\u2019m not justifying your actions, because you\u2019re right, name calling doesn\u2019t belong in a healthy relationship. But neither does 1) Saying you understand and you\u2019re not upset, when you really are upset 2) Making an ex seem better than a current SO 3) him threatening to never speak to you again when you call out his shitty behavior. The reason you felt badly about this interaction is because he had malicious intent behind it, and you felt that. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking the time to step back and see where you went wrong in this disagreement, but I really hope he is giving you and your relationship the same respect.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxeghm/i_namecalled_my_boyfriend_how_do_i_make_sure_i/hen6f7l/"}
