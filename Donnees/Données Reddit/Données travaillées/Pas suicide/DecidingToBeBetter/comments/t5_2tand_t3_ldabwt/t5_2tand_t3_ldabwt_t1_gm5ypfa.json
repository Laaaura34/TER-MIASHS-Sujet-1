The options were to use a product with silicone or cooking oil!! My original plan was to go to Sally\u2019s to buy this product called Wave nouveau that I used years ago, it had quite a bit of silicone in it. I have curly hair and I remembered it used to give me a gheri curl look!! Lol. Which is why I stopped using it of course \ud83d\ude0c. But I figured in this situation it would be helpful. However, I spent most of the day procrastinating and did not make it to the store in time. Soo I tried the oil, and it worked!! It gave that same slick feel to the hair without absorbing. Which kept my hair from being dry while brushing. I was soo surprised that it worked!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ldabwt/combed_my_hair_after_2_years/gm5ypfa/"}
