I am a girl with really thick hair that gets super matted at the nape of my neck and I have a pro tip for how to deal with it: shave off that underlayer into a triangle (or similar) shaped undercut. I\u2019m serious. you can make it visible/edgy or completely invisible if you want. my hairdresser suggested it years ago and it\u2019s changed my life. no more matting, my hair curls nicer because it\u2019s all in the same-ish curl pattern (no weird straight matted hair underneath) and it makes it easier to exist in the summer. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ldabwt/combed_my_hair_after_2_years/gm84y99/"}
