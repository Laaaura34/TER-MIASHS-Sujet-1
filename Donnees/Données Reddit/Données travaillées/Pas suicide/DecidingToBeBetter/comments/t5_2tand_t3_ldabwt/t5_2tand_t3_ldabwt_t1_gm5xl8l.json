Literally. Kept my thick, easily tangled hair in a bun for two years. This was one of the ways my depression expressed itself. Anyway I thought about cutting it but gave the comb a shot. Lol the hair shedding animal reference is an understatement. But I\u2019ve been rocking braids ever since and have been more consistent in caring for my hair. I\u2019m proud of you for taking the energy and time to care for yourself. I still struggle with self care / hygiene but I like to remind myself that I deserve to feel okay as a result of better hygiene actions. And After said action, i thank myself. I.e., doesn\u2019t want to brush teeth, reminds myself that clean teeth feel good to me, proceeds to brush teeth, smiles because teeth are clean, then I say thank you. You know what I say back?? Of course love, you deserve to feel clean. \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ldabwt/combed_my_hair_after_2_years/gm5xl8l/"}
