Super proud of you! \n\nOut of pure curiosity- how did your scalp feel during that time? Were you ever in any pain/discomfort? \n\nDid you ever just wash it but not comb it? \n\nDid anyone in your life (family/work) ever comment about the state of it? \n\nHow does your scalp feel now? \n\nI'm super proud of you, not only for doing this tedious task, but for making and going to your doctor's appointment, in the first place. :) \n\nTake care!\n\n^Godspeed!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ldabwt/combed_my_hair_after_2_years/gm5s3ge/"}
