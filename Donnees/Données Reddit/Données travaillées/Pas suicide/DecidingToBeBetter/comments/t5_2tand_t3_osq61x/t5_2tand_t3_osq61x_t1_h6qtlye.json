This example literally just happened. She came over we agreed to have a discussion I let her talk for around 15 minutes uninterrupted. I heard what her problems were I acknowledged them I admitted my wrong doings and apologized. Then, just like every time I try to express my feelings (negative ones or at least perceived negative) are usually get an average of 5 to 8 words out of my mouth before she immediately pops up out of whatever seat she\u2019s in and she just shuts me down. Refusing to listen and more often than not will literally just leave. And I\u2019m not even talking about like major issues. There\u2019s no cheating going on or anything like that it\u2019s literally just me saying \u201cOK you did this two days ago and this is how it made me feel\u201d but 99.9% of the time all I can get out is the \u201cyou did this part\u201d. Then what eventually happens is I get shut down multiple times over the course of a few weeks and the problem doesn\u2019t go away it just gets stuffed in the pressure cooker until it blows the lid off. So I explained everything to her before writing this in a text message because she got up and left but she has me blocked so she\u2019s not even gonna be able to see what I wrote. I absolutely appreciate you guys taking time out of your day to read this and shoot me some advice it means more than you\u2019ll know.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/osq61x/lost_and_confused/h6qtlye/"}
