I also have depression, anxiety, and mild adhd (inattentive). \n\nI also notice you have the same negative self talk like I do. I have decided just this past week to start turning this ship around by working on being kinder to myself, not allowing name calling, and making a big deal out of the tiny efforts I do make. I saw a post on another sub about this and they had a great way of putting it, \u201cimagine you had a person that followed you around all day long and said those things in your ear, they would be an abuser\u201d \n\nI found an app that has been helping. It\u2019s called \u201cI am\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s positive affirmations (I know I hated the sound of it too) and short statements that you can have sent to you as a notification banner throughout the day. I see one pop up, and repeat it to myself a few times. I think it\u2019s already been helping. Maybe that could help you as well!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjd1mf/how_to_fix_extreme_laziness_brought_on_from/hbx8jla/"}
