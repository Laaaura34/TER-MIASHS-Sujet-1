I just had to make very slight incremental changes and start there. There's famous phrase - \"How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.\" Don't try to swallow too much all at once and try to immediately be the high-achiever you were before. Take time, put effort in (even if it's just the tiniest bit), and don't beat yourself up if you mess up. These slow changes will eventually make a difference and you'll find yourself getting back to who you were before. At least, that's been my personal experience.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjd1mf/how_to_fix_extreme_laziness_brought_on_from/hbwjpwp/"}
