I am in exactly the same situation and desperately need to take control of my life and my health.  I\u2019m starting to work on my diet first.  I am about 35 pounds overweight which is a lot since I\u2019m only 5\u20192\u201d and small framed.  I don\u2019t eat but when I do it\u2019s junk and I just sit on the couch all day. I have had two mini strokes and I\u2019m on meds for high cholesterol, high blood pressure, depression and anxiety.  I am starting to feel like proper, healthy eating is going to be the key for me.  I can\u2019t let myself backslide though.  After my first stroke, I lost 15 pounds and then my husband complained about the food that I was making and I stopped cooking healthy foods altogether.  Supposedly it was \u201cto make him happy\u201d but I feel like I wanted to blame him for my laziness.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjd1mf/how_to_fix_extreme_laziness_brought_on_from/hbxfxci/"}
