Back when I was doing very poorly, the routine started as get up, go to my boyfriend's place and come back home around noon. That was pretty much it. In the afternoon I would just lay around and watch movies. \n\nSlowly but surely I stacked different habits on top of it. I walked home from my boyfriend's place and I passed by the supermarket to buy groceries to make dinner.\n\nThen I started going to the bakery before going to my boyfriend's and I did laundry every Tuesday and Friday.\n\nNow 3 years later I have a routine of exercise, work, cleaning, running errands, etc. It really starts by putting in place a routine of activities that you actually like and give you some dopamine. Even if it's something like going to Gamestop every day to check out new games if video games are your thing (just an example).", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjd1mf/how_to_fix_extreme_laziness_brought_on_from/hbwpcix/"}
