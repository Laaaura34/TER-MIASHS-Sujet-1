I used to feel pretty competent, maybe even good at my work! Time goes on and I kinda became that idiot coworker who asks the same questions day after day. My manager gave me a bunch of responsibility, and I just kinda burnt out, had a mental break and straight up left the state with my wonderful SO. \n\nIve been working from home self employed and it's just so hard to do even the basics. Groceries?? Nooo.. you have to go out for that and it's a lot of work to get dressed properly. (We end up ordering them online). \n\nMaking food? I know we just bought groceries but none of this really makes anything that sounds good right now. (Order food) \n\nDMV? Straight up forget it. We moved in November and I am just now getting our VERY expired car registered...and only because we need it for a road trip soon. \n\nI still need to get my self employed stuff taken care of too - it just feels like sooo much, even when it's really not. \n\nI'm sorry, this isn't really helpful but I do want to let you know you aren't alone. It feels awful. \n\nThere are some days that end up being productive, but I'm not exactly sure what leads into that type of mood. (The house must be cleaned as a baseline, otherwise I will be thinking about how I need to clean the house all day. While nothing else gets done Hah.) \n\nAlso, if you can - a to do list helps some times! If I can wake up, get my shower in a d get a to do list for the day, I'll usually get at least something done. (Although making the list is horribly inconsistent)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjd1mf/how_to_fix_extreme_laziness_brought_on_from/hbw1dpa/"}
