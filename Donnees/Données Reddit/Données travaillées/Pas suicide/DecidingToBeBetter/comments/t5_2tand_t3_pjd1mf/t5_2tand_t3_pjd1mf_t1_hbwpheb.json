But I can talk myself into taking a lovely walk that I know I\u2019ll enjoy, and make myself a nice coffee to take with me, and pick an audiobook or podcast to listen to on the way. \n\nI can\u2019t force myself to eat a healthy meal. But I can think about food I enjoy eating, plan a meal that tastes great and will make me feel good after I eat it (focussing on my body feeling good after eating something helps me make healthier choices) and I can put some fun music on in the kitchen while I make it. \n\nI can\u2019t force myself to do my work. But I can think about how great it feels to get up from my desk having completed a task, filled with satisfaction and relief, and knowing that I\u2019ve done something today that benefits my team and our business. I can try and make it as fun as possible, and I can set up my desk to be aesthetically pleasing so that I don\u2019t hate sitting there. I can have snacks in my desk drawer - something to look forward to between tasks. (Granted that last one is a blend of intrinsic and extrinsic motivators, but it\u2019s WORK so\u2026 y\u2019know. \ud83d\ude02)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjd1mf/how_to_fix_extreme_laziness_brought_on_from/hbwpheb/"}
