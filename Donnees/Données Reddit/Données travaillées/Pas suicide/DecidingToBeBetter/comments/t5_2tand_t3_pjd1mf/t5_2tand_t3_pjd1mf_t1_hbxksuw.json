Mine were umbrella drinks, cupcakes, kitties with hats on, fall leaves. Just whatever. But start small. I started with just one task. Assigned it a color scheme. If I shower that I could use a sticker. Put it on the calendar I tacked to the fridge. Once I got about 2 weeks in of decent sticker use (meaning I wasn\u2019t skipping showers) (and it took me more than 2 weeks to get to that point), I upped the ante. More tasks, (easy task, like doing a hobby, not using Reddit, calling my mom) and watching the calendar full up with cute little stickers that made me feel happy to look at, and at the same time accomplished. I kept gradually adding tasks I enjoyed, and a few I didn\u2019t.  (I did have to draw out my own calendar to accommodate the stickers, but that was down the line). Once I was using almost all my stickers for about 3 months, I was feeling like the little things weren\u2019t so daunting anymore.  Putting off doing the dishes and not earning that sticker slowly became less desirable. And then my head was more clear when the dishes were actually done anyway. (This is recent for me, I\u2019ve been off stickers since the beginning of August) but I\u2019ve also been taking care of myself and my responsibilities relatively unprompted). My alcohol consumption is wayyy down, as is my Reddit use. I have a skincare routine now and I\u2019m reading books like crazy. So it worked for me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjd1mf/how_to_fix_extreme_laziness_brought_on_from/hbxksuw/"}
