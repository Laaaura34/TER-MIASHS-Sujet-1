I'm just a teenager talking, you'll probably think that I am just a kid who knows nothing, and you're probably right about that. You want to change, right? That's a good thing. I don't want to pity you, but you shouldn't do any drastic actions. You said that you don't have any masculine traits, so what if you start working out? Sticking to it for a timespan of like 3-6 months will tone your muscles, and build them up. If you'll workout at a gym, there's a high possibility of you finding some new friends, because gym dudes are nice, if you'll workout, your self-esteem will also rise, and you shouldn't be afraid that people will judge you there, because you have come there to change for the better. If you'll workout for a long period of time, people will see your changes, approach you more, and you'll find a girfriend eventually. I don't really know what to say about the other stuff, but yeah. If you'll want to talk with a stupid kid, message me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bqlcrk/i_just_want_to_pull_all_my_fucking_hair_out_i/eo5l2we/"}
