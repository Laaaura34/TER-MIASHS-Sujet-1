Getting up at 5AM isn't inherently a good thing, nor is it necessarily better than getting up at 7AM, or 9AM, or any time. It's just a time. \n\nWhat matters is choosing the time that allows you to prioritize the things you want to do. For me, this meant getting up early, in part because it meant I wasn't up late with the potential to make decisions I was trying to avoid (like alcohol). I'm also more productive in the morning, and I cannot get things done in the evening/after work. But you may be the opposite, in which case you'd be setting yourself up for failure by trying to force this \"healthy\" morning routine when it really doesn't suit your goals.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oo5svf/major_life_decision_decided_to_wake_up_at_5am/h5xc809/"}
