First few days the body will resist so taking it easy but the plan is gradually falling in love with this new habit. \n\nI'm moving away from constantly having negative emotions(regret, shame, guilt) and replacing them with positive(love, respect and pride)ones towards myself. \n\nOne day at a time. One hour in a day. That's my mantra now.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oo5svf/major_life_decision_decided_to_wake_up_at_5am/h5xw9dk/"}
