Certainly embarrassing for him as well; plus guilt of screwing up & fear of being blamed.  \nYou just gotta laugh, be generous, forgive, and be willing to laugh at yourself when it goes the other way.  Now you've got a funny story for your friends!  Just make sure it's \"laugh with,\" not \"laugh at.\"  \nWe've all screwed up from time to time, isn't it nice if people forgive, laugh & move on, unphased?  We don't need a blame culture in our personal relationships.  And it didn't happen the other way so you'll still hit your Thurs app't, so that's good.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/osnhs6/husband_said_he_made_my_730am_appointment_for/h6rppfh/"}
