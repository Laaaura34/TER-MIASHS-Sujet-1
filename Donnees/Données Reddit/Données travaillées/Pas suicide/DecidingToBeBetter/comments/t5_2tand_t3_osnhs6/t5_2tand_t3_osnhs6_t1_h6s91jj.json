It\u2019s very easy to get riled up and assign blame but that\u2019s not a useful response. \n\nJust a heads up that my Drs and dentists, in fact virtually every professional appt I have, has the option to receive 24hr advance reminders via Text. They have been a lifesaver for our super busy household, great backup for when I forget to note something on the calendar. I hope you can find care and get your dentist sorted for the correct day!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/osnhs6/husband_said_he_made_my_730am_appointment_for/h6s91jj/"}
