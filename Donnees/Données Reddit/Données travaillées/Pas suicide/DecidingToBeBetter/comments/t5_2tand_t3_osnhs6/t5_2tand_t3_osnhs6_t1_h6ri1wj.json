If she detects a hint of negativity, she jumps into defense mode first to protect herself. For example, if we go to a restaurant she suggested and the place is closed... she'll immediately start blaming the app, or blaming Google. She feels the need to deflect any blame so to possibly avoid me getting mad at her. \n\nI know that's because of my anger in the past. I've worked on my anger a lot since then and I don't get angry over things out of her control... but her constant deflecting and not accepting responsibility for what she got wrong then becomes the source of my ire. \n\nI then get mad at her blaming other people/things, and try to explain to her WHY I'm frustrated. However, she keeps thinking I'm mad at the mistake because that's all she's trying to defend herself against. She also blames me for getting mad right away at the restaurant being closed... even if it didn't bother me.\n\nWe then get in the cycle of arguing about what we're even mad about. And never addressing the problem because we're both too busy defending ourselves. \n\nIf you don't mind, do you have any advice for me to handle this situation? I know I SHOULD just be calm and explain things to her... but she already has her guard up and won't listen.
