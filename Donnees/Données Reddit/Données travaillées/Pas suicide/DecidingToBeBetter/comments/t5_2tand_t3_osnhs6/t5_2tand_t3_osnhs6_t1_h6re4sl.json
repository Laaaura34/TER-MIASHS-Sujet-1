In no way am I saying this is your fault, I just wanted to give you some insight into what might be on the other side. I think learning tools (and practicing them in a low-risk setting to build the habit in a higher-stake situation) to help cut through that anger when it comes up may be helpful too.. it's hard to completely avoid getting into that headspace if that's what the default is. It's really great that you recognize what happens when you get mad, I've seen like a... toxic stalemate kind of thing in my own & friends' relationships because neither side budges on their self-awareness so it just gets swept under the rug brewing. It's a good sign that you're passed that hurdle :)\n\nNever heard of that Karpman drama triangle, gonna look it up!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/osnhs6/husband_said_he_made_my_730am_appointment_for/h6re4sl/"}
