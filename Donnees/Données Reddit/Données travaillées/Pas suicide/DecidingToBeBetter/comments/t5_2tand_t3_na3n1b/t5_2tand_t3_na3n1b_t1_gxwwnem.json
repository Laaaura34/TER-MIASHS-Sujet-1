Going thru the exact same thing right now. I had my wisdoms pulled 4 years ago and it went way better than expected. Told myself okay now I will start going. Well it\u2019s been 4 years. And now I\u2019m having pain and issues. I have scheduled my appointment which is in 2 weeks with a new dentist who specializes in dental phobia. They actually offer a free consult just to discuss the phobia, learn about them and the office and what they can do. I\u2019m super nervous but I\u2019m ready to finally get this taken care of and hopefully I can then actually go every 6 months! That will be a dream to get to that point. Good luck to you!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/na3n1b/first_dental_appointment_in_four_years_could_use/gxwwnem/"}
