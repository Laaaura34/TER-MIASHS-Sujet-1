I'm so happy you're doing that for yourself and I hope everything goes well for you \u2665 It's so scary to take that step, especially when you have severe phobia and/or have had a lot of traumatic dentist experiences but it's worth it in the end to be able to live pain free.\n\nI feel like this is something I could have written like 15 years ago, so I really empathize with you. I had a lot of traumatic experiences going to the dentist as a kid and into adulthood, and it scared me so much, I stopped going when I got to college. But I didn't take care of my teeth and I also drank a shit ton of soda back then, so my teeth started rotting and falling apart in my mouth. I got to a similar point you did where the pain just got to be too much. \n\nThankfully, I found a really kind dentist who worked with me over a couple years to get all the work done. I'm going on about 5 years now that I haven't needed any major work or had any cavities! And I'm not petrified of the dentist anymore, even if I do need a filling or something else. It's more just an annoyance and discomfort than outright terror and anxiety. \n\nGood luck and here's to taking that first step! \ud83e\udd42", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/na3n1b/first_dental_appointment_in_four_years_could_use/gxsbb47/"}
