Hope your appointment went well! I'm sure it was nerve racking but you probably did fantastic. Its not so bad and you're taking the steps you need to care for yourself and that's what matters. I just went today too after 10+ years of having not gone. I have two cavities and I need a super deep cleaning of my teeth as it's effecting my gums. \n\nKeep on going and just keep taking care of yourself.
