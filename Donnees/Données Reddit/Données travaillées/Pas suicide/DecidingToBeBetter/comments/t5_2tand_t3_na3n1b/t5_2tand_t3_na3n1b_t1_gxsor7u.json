My dentist tried to convince me that wouldn't happen, and I was steadfastly hyper-worried that it would. Eventually he promised me that even if it did happen it was no big deal, I'd get a temporary bridge that day and wouldn't run around with a huge hole in my mouth.\n\nThat somehow got me into the chair. And, he was right, my teeth didn't fall out.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/na3n1b/first_dental_appointment_in_four_years_could_use/gxsor7u/"}
