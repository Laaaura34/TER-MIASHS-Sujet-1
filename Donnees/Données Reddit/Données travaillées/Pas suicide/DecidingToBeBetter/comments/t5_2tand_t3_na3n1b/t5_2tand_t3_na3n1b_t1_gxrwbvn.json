Weirdly, the dentist is the only medical place I don\u2019t really get nervous about going. The gyno? Total panic. Getting blood test results back? The worst. Eye doctor? Hate it. \n\nBut the dentist? I\u2019m totally fine with it. I\u2019ve always felt like getting my teeth cleaned was the most low-stakes medical thing possible. It\u2019s almost like the medical equivalent of changing your tire. The doctor feels like major engine work for me, if you know what I mean. \n\nIf you go every 6 months and they find a tiny cavity, it\u2019s wayyyy easier to fix than if you skip years and need more work done. It\u2019s so easy to nip a small cavity in the bud vs. needing a root canal years later. \n\nI know the dentist is stressful for you, but maybe looking at it this way will help.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/na3n1b/first_dental_appointment_in_four_years_could_use/gxrwbvn/"}
