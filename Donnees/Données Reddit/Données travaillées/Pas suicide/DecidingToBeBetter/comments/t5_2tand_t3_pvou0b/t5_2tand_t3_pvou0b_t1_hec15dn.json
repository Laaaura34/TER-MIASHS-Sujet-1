I used to \"feel\" for him so instead of telling him my concerns to help us both grow together in a rel, i wouldn't bec i don't want to hurt him which he expressed before; he verbalized that it feels like plucking: that going out of his box / norms is \"changing\" him and he isn't just like that and no matter how much we \"discuss\" to possibly try, he would for some time, get complacent and revert. A cycle.\n\nSo later on I realized after giving much thought, that maybe this statement is right, that I might just be asking the wrong person to see past the point of surface level and look further.
