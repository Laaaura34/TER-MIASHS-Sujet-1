I understand your frustration because I also had friends who seemed to have it all and I would get annoyed at how hard my life was compared to theirs. This isn\u2019t a good mindset to have with friends so I stopped talking to them and I\u2019m in s better place than ever because I\u2019m\nFocusing on my own bag and my own life. Life doesn\u2019t get easier and it\u2019s not always fair. At the end of the day if you can accomplish your goals all on your own, that\u2019s something to be proud of.
