He wants her, and wants the new person not to have her. \n\nEnvy doesn\u2019t have to be negative. I see this as more \u201cI want an opportunity/car/ pretty girlfriend TOO. Envy can be a form of admiration. \n\nSo, in your case, I would try to make friends with her.  See what techniques she\u2019s using that you can adopt to improve your own situation. \n\nTell her you admire her because of xyz. She\u2019ll likely be flattered and willing to give you advice. \n\nAnd if it turns out that her only advantage was all in who she knows\u2026. Truly befriending her may lead you to knowing them too. \n\nHope this helps\n\nSara", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ogi98f/dealing_with_jealousy/h4j8vwz/"}
