That was such a heartwarming answer to be honest. I actually did put some space between us. I don't ask her to hang out as much and I spend time with people who are like me. I got invited to a party and unfortunately, since I don't know them, I felt pretty uncomfortable and awkward. But it still felt so much better than being with her. I was with people who don't talk about money or how great their lives are. They talk about their real struggles and don't pretend to live a perfect life. \n\nAlso, at my internship, I spent time with a guy who was struggling to stay in budget for food. That was such a humbling experience in my opinion. I didn't feel the pressure to eat expensive meals. I was eating below budget because I tried to adjust to his preferences. I felt almost free. For a few days, I stopped having that negative perception that I'm so worse off than my other friends. And came to the realisation that some people are struggling as much as me or even more. And that made me so grateful. \n\nSince I'm an international student in Paris without many friends, I'm trying to socialise more and expand my social group. That's something I'm grateful for. \n\nThank you for making me realise that :) you're awesome !", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ogi98f/dealing_with_jealousy/h4u5w17/"}
