Perhaps there's a flaw in your thinking that results in you not helping yourself. Perhaps you feel in control if you don't help yourself, perhaps it's a self defense mechanism to avoid facing difficulties in your life (you can't fail or make mistakes if you don't even try or set yourself up so you can't even try). I'm shooting in the dark here of course.\n\nBefore you try out SSRIs, I'd recommend you to sort out your sleep routine, because bad or inadequate sleep will wreck you, if you haven't slept well even for a day, you'll accomplish less, you'll make more mistakes, you'll more easily give into cravings, negative thoughts. It is the foundation of your mental health. Without getting enough sleep, you don't give yourself a fighting chance and I don't see how SSRIs would help here, but you know your situation.Perhaps identify what you can change with your sleep routine, what causes you to sleep bad and change them one by one, go step by step and most importantly don't stress over getting enough sleep too much because that will also prevent you to relax when you need to. There are lots of techniques to help you relax too. Dedicate a week to focus only on sleep and try to keep up the routine you established. Meditate, exercise, go out into the sun at least for a few minutes each day. Sleep is important, yo and you can take steps to improve it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pszlay/getting_out_of_my_own_way_and_following_through/hdtvkyk/"}
