It\u2019s true that it can make the smallest things feel like way too much, and thus exhaust you. It\u2019s true that a depressed body is physiologically different. At the same time however, there\u2019s a little part of it that  is just in the mind. \n\nI really understood this when rounds of different anti depressants just made me worse. I got to thinking that what was considered my normal depression wasn\u2019t actually all that bad by comparison, and knowing that helped me manage it so much better. \n\nSometimes a slight shift in perspective is all we need. Doesn\u2019t make the problems go away, but it helps in tackling them. There will be ups and downs, and congrats on knowing how to manage it better!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jvuv8u/doing_well_and_my_friends_are_in_disbelief/gcmxyke/"}
