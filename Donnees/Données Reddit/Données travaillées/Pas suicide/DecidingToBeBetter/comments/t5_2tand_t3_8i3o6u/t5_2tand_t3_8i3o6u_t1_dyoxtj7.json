I feel like that's the way to pay this one back. It's really got me interested in coding again.\n\nStarted paying for Spotify this year\\- I like it ad free and I guess I should be paying something back to the musicians. \\(I used to think that I could do it by going out to watch them play live but then I had a family.\\) But Spotify is a centralized system and they just gone and listed on the stockmarket...\n\nHonestly I think the right thing to do is to invest in distributed systems where you can. They are the future as they deliver best value to the user. \n\nAnyhow, point is: I agree with you that you can't cheat life/ karma\\- there's no getting away with it\\- \\(all a bit Crime and Punishment I reckon\\). You will pay for what you use \\- one way or another. I say just get it over with and pay what you owe up front if you can\\- the advertising/ corporate propaganda model is not a good one at all.
