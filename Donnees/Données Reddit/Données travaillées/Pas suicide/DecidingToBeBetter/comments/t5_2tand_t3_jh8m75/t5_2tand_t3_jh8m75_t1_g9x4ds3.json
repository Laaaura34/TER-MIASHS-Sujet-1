But they are important. We need to do them to get the most out of life. And just feeling scared or nervous about the pain doesn't mean you can't walk through the door.\n\nHave you ever been really tired at the end of a workout when you had one more set left? Or been nervous about clicking send on an important email? But it was something you had to do, so you did it anyway. You've done things that were scary before. Fear does not have to stop you from doing important things. So do it scared.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jh8m75/stop_telling_yourself_you_dont_need_therapy/g9x4ds3/"}
