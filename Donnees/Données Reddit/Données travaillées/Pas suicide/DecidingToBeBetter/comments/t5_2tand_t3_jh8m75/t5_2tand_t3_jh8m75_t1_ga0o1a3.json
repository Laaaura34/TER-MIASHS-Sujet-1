I had 3 different therapists. Didn\u2019t care for the experience and found it superficial.\n\nI find greater satisfaction in reflecting personally on my own problems. If it\u2019s a greater issue then I will talk to those close to me. Talking to a stranger about my intimate details does nothing for me, I did open up with the therapist. At the end, I knew this person didn\u2019t really know me and would never understand. It was it\u2019s a waster of time and money for me. Maybe like you said I didn\u2019t bond with the therapists, but the whole experience was just something I didn\u2019t like.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jh8m75/stop_telling_yourself_you_dont_need_therapy/ga0o1a3/"}
