You have a choice to suffer stupidly by going back to your old ways or you can face your suffering, open your chest up to the world and take it the fuck on. Suffer with dignity since you will suffer no matter what. Suffering with dignity and and with your morality intact will at least have the potential for you to have a happy, fulfilling and meaningful life. That is your best shot, to make wise choices and keep your sobriety. If you go back to drug use or alcohol you will suffer stupidly and be in a much worse place then you are now, far worse. You're still young and so you can still start at the beginning. \n\nYou should read or buy some good self help audio books. I would buy \"Unfu** yourself\" by Gary John Bishop. Get it on audio and listen to that over and over. Set some goals for yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nsawab/i_decided_to_be_better_and_now_i_see/h0lhknr/"}
