My lack of sociability has driven me to cynicism and negative personality to keep myself up, and that is also the byproduct of my dad's ill treatment of me.\n\nI need to break out of the \"Dad will punish me if I do not do what he says\" nonsense and prove he is wrong so I can be a better person in the end. Maybe my comment would be better off as an independent post, but I am in a similar phase to your past self.\n\nLastly, yesterday, my dad scorned me for not preparing ahead of time for my college course, but after a discussion with my mom, the only thing that has to be dealt with as of now is that I have to pass and finish the course so I can get a degree.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oz0ljk/a_healthier_happier_and_lighter_version_of_myself/h80gkea/"}
