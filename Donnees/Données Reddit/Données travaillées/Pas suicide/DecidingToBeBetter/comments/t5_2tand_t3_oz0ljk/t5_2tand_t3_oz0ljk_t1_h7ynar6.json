Such an exciting time for you and with the positivity you carry,  it will only get better. We often find exactly what we\u2019re looking for, good or bad! Keep looking for all those good things. People often present in a manner that we expect to see. Look for the very best in others as well as in yourself. If by chance you don\u2019t get it, you didn\u2019t waste any time on being negative and carrying unwanted feelings around so you lost nothing for expecting the best. Be blessed!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oz0ljk/a_healthier_happier_and_lighter_version_of_myself/h7ynar6/"}
