I am a very emotional person but I really tried my hardest to focus on the reality of the situation that we have grown apart, he did not treat me well at all at the end nor did he have my best intentions in mind either. I could have romanticize the situation thinking that he needed time/space to \"find himself\" and \"wait\" for him to come back to me but really? He used me for self gratification and liked to feel wanted/needed while he did whatever he wanted. I told myself, if he really had cared, he wouldn't have done those things that would hurt me.\n\nIt came to a point where it really felt so soul destructive to be like this and had to view myself as an external person, a friend, like I was my own child and I needed to do what was best for me, to leave and not look back. I messed up quite a few times but once you get to say \"no\" and take back your power, it is so self empowering.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oz0ljk/a_healthier_happier_and_lighter_version_of_myself/h7yimj3/"}
