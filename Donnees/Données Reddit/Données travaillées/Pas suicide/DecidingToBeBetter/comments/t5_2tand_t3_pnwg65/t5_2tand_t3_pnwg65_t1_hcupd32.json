(read it anyway, there's a lot more to this and it being explained in full will get you on board with this fully)\n\nthe example he gives is being required to do ONE push-up a day. since it is so laughably easy to do (3 seconds, almost no effort) the barrier for entry is almost non-existent. the thing is though once you're in position to do push-ups and have already done one....it's VERY easy to do a few more. so often you exceed your goals just by getting over the \"getting started hump\"\n\n\"it's better to have embarrassing goals but impressive results than impressive goals and embarrassing results\"", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pnwg65/why_is_is_to_hard_for_me_to_take_care_of_myself/hcupd32/"}
