Have a little card on your bathroom mirror that reminds you. \n\nHave some checklists/days of the week - Monday means bike ride, Tuesday is yoga, Wed is walk, Thursday is paint. Sunday is cook ahead for the week. \n\nThe capitalist world doesn't really want you to take care of yourself. They want you to be dissatisfied, so you buy stuff you don't need. \n\nSet an alarm to go to bed. Every night, phone says \"start winding down\" at 9:30 so you can be in bed, trying to sleep at 10, if you have to wake up at 6. Give yourself a chance at 8 hours, you won't always get it, but you will never get it if you don't give yourself the chance.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pnwg65/why_is_is_to_hard_for_me_to_take_care_of_myself/hctravu/"}
