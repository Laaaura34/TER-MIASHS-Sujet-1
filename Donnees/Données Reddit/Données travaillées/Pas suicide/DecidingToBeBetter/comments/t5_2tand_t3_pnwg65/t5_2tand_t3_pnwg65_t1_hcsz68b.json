Part Of your brain is hard-wired to keep you safe in the cave. What that means is it want you to exert zero effort. It does not want you to work out it does not want you to meditate or do any of the things that take effort. So you just need to manage that side of your brain. It\u2019s almost like parenting yourself. Also, what if it\u2019s OK that it feels really hard? What if the payoff is worth doing hard things?? \n\nMost importantly don\u2019t beat yourself up for not following through, that\u2019s only because you have a human brain. Nothing is wrong with you, at all. You just need to experiment with different ways to manage your mind and start taking action even though it feels hard.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pnwg65/why_is_is_to_hard_for_me_to_take_care_of_myself/hcsz68b/"}
