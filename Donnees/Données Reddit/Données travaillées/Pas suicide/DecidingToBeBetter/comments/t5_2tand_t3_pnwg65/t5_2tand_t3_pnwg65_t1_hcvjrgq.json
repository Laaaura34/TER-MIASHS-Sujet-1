Plus each human is unique from all others who have ever existed, that is over 100 Billion people.  So that gives us amazing value because each of us is very rare and completely unique, with huge inherent  self worth, even worthy of healthy self adoration. \n\nThe other component needed for self love is a willingness to extend yourself because you are worth it\u2014-far be it from me to attempt a definition of love, so I paraphrase ideas from Scott Packs definition: a type of acceptance that is willing to stretch and be extended to nurture spiritual growth, knowing that is a never ending process and always knowing that you are simply worth it. \n\nI know that is a bit nebulous, but that is the nature of love: a willingness to extend oneself toward spiritual growth because you are uniquely worth it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pnwg65/why_is_is_to_hard_for_me_to_take_care_of_myself/hcvjrgq/"}
