For me, it was my baby brother that I often thought of during my dark moments. When I would think about hurting myself, I'd ask myself: what would I do if I hear my baby brother wanting to do this horrible thing to himself? What will I say/do to keep him from doing that thing?\n\nWhen I would beat myself up over a minor hiccup like, say, I broke something, my first reaction would be to start berating myself for being so stupid, careless, etc. Then I'd remember the abovementioned advice, and it would instantly make me stop because I would NEVER speak to my brother or someone I love in that manner. Then I'll do the hard work of trying to talk to myself as though I was someone I loved.\n\nIt took me a while to get that very lesson. A lot of forcing it at first. But I eventually got it.
