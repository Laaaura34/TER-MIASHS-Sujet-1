Working out, eating well, doing the things, sometimes all that feels impossible or just like  so much effort. Depression is a tricky bitch. Like the things that will help you manage and eventually get rid of the Depression are the things the Depression stops you from doing. It is hard. \n\nSome tricks that work for me to fight it. \n\n1. The 1 min rule. Aka you can do anything for one minute. If I don't feel like cleaning my home I say I'll pick stuff up for one minute. Often times after a minute I keep going but even if I don't it's still a bit cleaner. \n\n2. Journal. Stream of consciousness into paper, blog, whatever.\n\n3. Do the next right thing. Don't think about how much there is to do. Just think about the one thing. \n\nThat last one has been said a million different ways cause it is the hardest to internalize.\n\n4. Call someone and talk it out. Verbalize your feelings, it really does help.  This one might be the hardest, it makes you vulnerable but that's important for healing. \n\nDepression sucks.
