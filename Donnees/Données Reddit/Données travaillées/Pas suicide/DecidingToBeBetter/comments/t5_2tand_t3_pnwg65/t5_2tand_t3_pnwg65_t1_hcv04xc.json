If I have nothing to look forward to, I start to fall into the shlump. I just broke back out of it this week with a sort of diet and fitness reset. In a few weeks I have a wedding to go to, and we all decided to go as a group of women instead of bringing our partners. We're all staying in an airbnb together, and that helped me kick my funk a bit. I started getting bored with the gym (i live the gym) and eating not great all the time. Even our home cooked meals were sugary and fatty (unhealthy fats). Yesterday I started back on green juice in the morning, a small morning workout, two more healthy meals plus a protein smoothie, and an evening workout after work. I told myself no breaks for 14 days, and then I can have a fun coffee and whatever big meal I decide to ball out on. \n\nI also started implementing a \"10 minute rule\". You know that moment where you're just sitting scrolling on your phone, and then realize you went down a massive rabbit hole? Put down your phone and do something productive for at least 10 minutes. You can do anything for 10 minutes, and you can do A LOT in 10 minutes! I cleaned my bathroom this morning in less than 10. Try to do it once a day. When your area is clean, you feel more clarity. And if you have an overwhelming cluttered or dirty room, set a timer for 10 minutes and slowly hack away at it throughout the day or the week. A therapist gave me that advice, and it helps a lot.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pnwg65/why_is_is_to_hard_for_me_to_take_care_of_myself/hcv04xc/"}
