Even if I was making 100k, I would still be frugal. I don't care about having the best tech or expensive clothes. I've had the same phone for over 2 years, and I buy new clothes only when the clothes I have are finally faded/falling apart from washing them for many years. I also only go out once a month, and I usually meal prep every week so I don't have to buy lunch everyday", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvitbm/i_feel_like_such_a_man_child/hecy1e5/"}
