I think it is important not to be too hard on yourself, because it is natural (as you noted) to have a sense of self-preservation that causes at least some selfishness.  So, I think it is important to strike a balance, but what has worked for me is recognizing that I have a lifetime of habits of thinking about myself.  I spend most of the day thinking about the things I need and want, while contemplating how I can go about satisfying these wants and needs (whether on my own or with the assistance of others).  \n\nSelfish thoughts are not bad, but they are a habit.  So, what I continue to work on is replacing selfish thoughts with empathetic thoughts.  For example, when I pass someone on the street, or even see a fictional character, I try to think about the things they might be going through and how those things might make them feel.  The biggest challenge is simply remembering to do this, so it helps to just set up an \"empathy\" time every day where you just think about people and strangers for a period of 10 minutes or so.  Over time, this doesn't necessarily become a habit that replaces selfish thoughts, but it does become easier and more natural.  Even better, if you find yourself in that thought pattern of vulnerability like you mentioned, you can also call on your thought empathy exercises to create a substitute pattern.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hov3gt/i_want_to_be_less_self_centeredselfish/fxknswq/"}
