My parents support me financially and it\u2019s not easy to have jobs in this pandemic (still pretty bad where I am) with only a high school degree that actually pay enough for a roof over my head and food in my stomach.\n\nRealistically?

Worst-case scenario, I\u2018ll be a useless 25-year-old with a useless degree.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that we don\u2019t have student debts here, thank God for that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ow41nr/how_can_i_be_openminded_about_premed/h7if508/"}
