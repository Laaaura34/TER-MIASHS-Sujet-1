I'm sorry. Do you think staying will make you eventually want it? I say get out asap if you're unhappy. You might be stuck in a kind of \"lost time cost\" fallacy. You still have time to change your major and do something you want. I say do it before you're any further into something that makes you miserable. There are lots of high paying jobs in other fields. You'll find something :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ow41nr/how_can_i_be_openminded_about_premed/h7dpm1t/"}
