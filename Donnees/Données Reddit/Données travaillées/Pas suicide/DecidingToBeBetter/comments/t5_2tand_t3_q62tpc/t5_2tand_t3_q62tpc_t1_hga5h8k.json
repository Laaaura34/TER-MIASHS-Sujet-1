I am making a list and trying to sort it out right now.  It certainly helps when I can see my thoughts written out.                                                                I taught pre-school age kids years ago and always felt comfortable in the classroom.  I had been giving serious consideration the past few months to going back to do my Masters in Elementary Ed so I could do student teaching.  Oddly enough, an enrollment counselor from the school I graduated from in 2018 called me last week and said they have a new program for students with the same degree as myself to come back for one semester and complete student teaching.  I may just take them up on the offer.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q62tpc/how_do_i_stop_being_so_wishywashy/hga5h8k/"}
