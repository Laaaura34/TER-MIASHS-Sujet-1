Demon possession really does hit the nail on the head. Feeling drained but human is always a million times better than feeling empty and ashamed. The more time you put between yourself and the drug the more it loses all it's power. Who you are is not what you did while the meth was holding you hostage. Just never ever allow yourself to look back. If you know people who are still using you have to cut ties with them, not out of not caring about them but because you can't take care of yourself with them. To me that's one of the biggest factors in relapse. Never talk about it with people who do it, never be around people who are doing it. After several several years it won't bother you but it will take a long time to not have the drug tempting you. Bad days are gonna happen and this is why it's important to stay away from anyone or any place that can make those bad days harder to get through sober.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oe0n7f/40_days_clean_from_meth/h44uzg1/"}
