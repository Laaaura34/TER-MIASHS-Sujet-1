I'm in a similar situation, just starting using about two years ago and I've lost so much in that short time.  My partner, my career,  most of my friends, my credit score. Basically everything Ive spent the last decade of my life building and working toward.  Trying to accept that I'm now HIV+ has been my latest struggle.   \n\n\nCongrats on where you are today.  It really gives me hope that it's possible that this nightmare can end. It's a special kind of insanity.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oe0n7f/40_days_clean_from_meth/h4vqfrp/"}
