That said, I was on Elvanse \u2013 Vyvanse in the States, or lisdexamfetamine, to use the chemical nomenclature. It's much, much weaker than meth, so I was shocked that my tolerance to that rendered meth practically inert to me.   \n\nWhat you say about ecstasy is very true. I think it's a misconception, at least nowadays, that 'ecstasy' means MDMA. It doesn't. Most of the time it's all manner of research chemicals, and I suspect meth is often used because it's cheap. You say \"supposed to be ecstasy\" - I would say it _was_ ecstasy, and you were just mistaken in thinking that ecstasy pills are _supposed to contain MDMA_.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oe0n7f/40_days_clean_from_meth/h45caw9/"}
