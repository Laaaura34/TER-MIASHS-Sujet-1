Keep those sheets clean n fresh. A coolish room and heavy blankets, if u can. Make sure ya showered n teeth are clean before bed. Put that phone away unless it's jus for relaxing music. Read books, stimulate that brain naturally. \n\nAnd if u really believe u won't get to sleep, get up. Find somewhere to chill for a short while till ur ready to try again. \n\nNo coffee after midday and no energy drinks at all has helped me too. \n\nAlso, get up at the same time no matter what time u went to sleep. Ur brain needs a routine. U cannot control when u fall asleep (yet). But u can control when u get up. \n\nIts all about taking control of urself, ur thoughts and ur life. \n\nCamomile tea and melatonin are my nightly routine, as i have quit pot as well. \n\nAlso, this is jus my personal experience. We each take, and quit drugs for our own reasons. Take what everyone is saying here as jus advice, by being truly honest with urself you will do this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oe0n7f/40_days_clean_from_meth/h479rlu/"}
