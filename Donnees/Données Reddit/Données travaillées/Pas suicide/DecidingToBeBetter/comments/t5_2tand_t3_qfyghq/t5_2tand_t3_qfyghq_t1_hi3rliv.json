Sounds like exactly what was happening to me before I got diagnosed with ADHD. \n\nAnd just fyi - yes, it\u2019s scary to go and get tested, its frustrating to fail at tests designed to make you fail, and sometimes it feels weird to get classified as having a \u201cdisability\u201d. \n\nBut ADHD doesn\u2019t mean you are dumb. It doesn\u2019t make you a genius either - all it means is that your brain isn\u2019t making enough dopamine and norepinephrine (among some other things). \n\nBut yea, all I want to say is that for all the stigma you or others might have to getting diagnosed or checked for ADHD, it\u2019s worth the visit.\n\nTrust me, It\u2019s amazing to be able to sit down at your work and actually *do* it, or get to things without procrastinating.
