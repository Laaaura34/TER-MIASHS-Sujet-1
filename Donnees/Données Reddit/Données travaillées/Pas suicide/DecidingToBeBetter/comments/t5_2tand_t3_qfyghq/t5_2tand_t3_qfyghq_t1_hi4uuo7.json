It has been a problem for me for most of my life. Quite sure I don't have ADHD, particularly as I live with someone who does. I tried all of the techniques and motivaions etc, some of it worked a bit if I was lucky. The biggest change for me took place recently when I finally realised that I procrastinate when I don't understand what I'm doing.\n\nThis seems obvious in hindsight BUT because I now know this, I can ask myself 'what is it that I don't understand?' or 'what do I need to do in order to understand and feel like I can progress?'. This has changed so much for me. I still procrastinate a little, especially when I feel lazy, but now instead of internetting for 30 minutes, I admit to myself I don't know what is going on so I break my giant reason to procrastinate into little achievable tasks.\n\nYou don't understand subject x, so who can you speak to who does understand it? What can you do to get your head around it? Youtube has a lot of content from people who take pleasure in breaking down complex information into easy to understand pieces with examples. Make yourself a list on the bits you don't understand for one of the classes/subjects you're working on and start from there. And remember, studying (at college level, in my experience) isn't always about memorising. Sometimes you need to identify the principles of what they are saying/working on.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfyghq/all_i_do_is_procrastinate_and_when_i_try_to_study/hi4uuo7/"}
