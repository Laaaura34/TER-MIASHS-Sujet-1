(I actually don't care if I study late or early, if im not in the mood then I wont study) i think its ok to procastinate if thats how you get productive as long as you wont hassle your groupmates (if it comes to groupworks)\n\nI turn off my WIFI on my gadgets (ipad, laptop) and put my phone away as far as I can. I also uninstall my social media when I have exams coming up. I dont personally use pomodoro technique because im a slow learner and I feel pressured to learn a topic within a time frame so yup, do what makes you comfortable.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfyghq/all_i_do_is_procrastinate_and_when_i_try_to_study/hi4w0lx/"}
