I did well in school so it was never recognized. Self medicated with marijuana for a long long time, it didn't become debilitating until I quit for a few months, kind of forcing me to realize what was happening in my brain. Definitely a weird thing to go and do and accept about yourself, but fuck, did it make a difference. I feel like myself again. Messy and cluttered house turned into a reorganized nice place to have people over, hobbies I've given up are interesting again, I've done things I've always wanted to do, but for some reason made an excuse not to. It made doing the boring things like cleaning and studying so so much more bearable. However, it is not a cure, but just a tool that can help you, that's important to remember.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfyghq/all_i_do_is_procrastinate_and_when_i_try_to_study/hi6sf5f/"}
