Hey, I want to get minimum an 8 in the next exam, okey, that is a goal, now how are you going to attain it? well, I am going to spend three hours a day studying for that exam, but I am a lazy person, so I am going to set an alarm for 15 minutes and see whether I can study for 15 minutes straight for the GOAL I want to attain. If you are not able to spend 15 minutes straight studying, try 5 or 10. Set yourself humble goals, and go little by little claiming more and more. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfyghq/all_i_do_is_procrastinate_and_when_i_try_to_study/hi59tdz/"}
