For me it's the same as working out. When you first start, you're gonna be tired. As you progress, you'll find that your stamina has increased far beyond what it used to be and you can sustain much more activity for longer periods of time. \n\nThis principal is very interesting when applied most work that we want to do. Like making music for example. Do you have any idea how many pages of music Mozart must've wrote in his life time? It's gotta be some ridiculous amount. But did he start off being able to write many pages of music a day? No, of course not. He started not even knowing how to write music, then he was able to write a song, then he was able to make a symphony, then he wrote so many pages of symphonys, concertos, sonatas, etc. that his music has become truely timeless. \n\nPoint being, if you stick to something, you have no idea how efficient you could be at it. At least 100 times more efficient than you are now. Think about what you wanna get done. Yes, if you engage something, you're going to be able to engage in more of it. And if you really like doing it, whatever it is, you can get WAY better than you could possibly imagine.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/alcx24/advice_improve_your_life_by_engaging_deeper_never/efegijt/"}
