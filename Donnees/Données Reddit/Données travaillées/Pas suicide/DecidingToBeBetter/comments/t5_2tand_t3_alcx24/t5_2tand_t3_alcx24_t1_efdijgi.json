Not too long ago, I was in a rut. I took a year off from college after getting out of the Navy to help my parents start up their business, and then went to being a 32 year old man living with his parents working at McDonald's. I blamed them for not pushing hard enough with the business and forcing me to find work elsewhere to make ends meet. But I realized that even if the business had succeeded, I still wouldn't be happy because I wasn't doing what I really wanted. I wanted to go back to Japan. I missed it too much and it was affecting my performance in every other area of my life. I then decided that if I was serious about it, I should save up for it proper and I moved in with my brother to save money and to help him out around the house\u00a0post surgery. So now I'm applying to a college in Tokyo and saving up for the plane ticket and living expenses until the GI Bill kicks in.\u00a0", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/alcx24/advice_improve_your_life_by_engaging_deeper_never/efdijgi/"}
