No matter when, no matter how, I feel I will always choose to do good, going against it feels like betraying myself.\n\nI hold my honor high, and I would rather punch in your face than stab you in the back, even if you hate me for it.\n\nI would live for a woman that holds me true in her heart, not die, dying is effortless, but I would, if asked by her to do by her side, live every single joy and torment this life has until my children throw dirt upon my casket.\n\nAnd I would rather die than to betray a friend.\n\nBut what I do appreaciate about myself the most is how I do it, do what? IT. Whatever challenge I faced I overcame not with smarts, nor strength, nor charm, nor intellect, but with faith and a stubborn determination that compells me to go forward until I can no more.\n\nWhenever I quitted, whenever I resigned, I did out of exhaustion, and not out of fear, I never did anything without even trying my best.
