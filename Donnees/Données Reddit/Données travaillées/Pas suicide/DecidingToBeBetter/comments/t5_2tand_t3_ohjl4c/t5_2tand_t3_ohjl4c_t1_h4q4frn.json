Jesus christ. And if you're in support of that, you can fuck off. \n\nI'll judge people for actively supporting those that post sexual content that wasn't agreed upon by the person in the videos/pictures - that isn't just a \"sexual preference\", that's an actual crime and it hurts so many people. \n\nConsensual porn (aka people consentually being in bdsm & bondage porn with the intentions of posting it for people to see - which I never even commented on, wtf lol) is not equal to REVENGE PORN. It's really not that hard to understand.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ohjl4c/decided_to_quit_consuming_porn_and_start_becoming/h4q4frn/"}
