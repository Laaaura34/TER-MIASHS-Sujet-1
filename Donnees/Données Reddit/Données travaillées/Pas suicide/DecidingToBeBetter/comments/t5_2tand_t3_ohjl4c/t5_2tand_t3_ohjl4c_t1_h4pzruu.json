Everyone's against murder, but to be explicitly against snuff films is weird, since very few real ones exist on the internet. I don't know how prevalent \"real\" porn of the categories you're talking about is. And I doubt you do either.\n\nTo dedicate yourself in any capacity to a set of problems you don't actually know the magnitude of is strange. Perhaps real revenge porn is nearly as (un)common as real snuff.\n\nThis is something about American culture that I never understood. (I don't know if you're American, but you sound like one). Reacting agressively to threats you don't understand, or worse, threats that are not even common in any form -- like 9/11 and terrorism. I thought we could do better.
