Most states have laws regarding the act that punishes those who upload these images of previous sexual partners without their consent, so it is starting to become somewhat \"less\" of an issue (especially with American culture becoming more accepting of sexual expression through sources like OF for example) but it's still very much here.\n\nI'm not necessarily disagreeing with you on the unknown factor of some of it. There definitely is a very real curtain that covers much of the erotic industry to give the content a realistic \"feel\" to it (i.e. r*pe porn, voyeurism porn, etc) and like I said, definitely not kink-shaming. I have no problem with people being into porn and the different subsets of erotica, nor am I trying to \"white knight\" myself; but there is certain stuff that should be viewed as \"nah, that's fucked up\", and in my case, that legitimate revenge porn in the case I stated above.\n\nI think the analogy and comparison you're making is somewhat apples to oranges.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ohjl4c/decided_to_quit_consuming_porn_and_start_becoming/h4q1diu/"}
