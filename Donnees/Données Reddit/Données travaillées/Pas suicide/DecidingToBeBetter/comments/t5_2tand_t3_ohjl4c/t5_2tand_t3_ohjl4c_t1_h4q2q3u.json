I know that it\u2019s hard, especially if you\u2019re used to view it regularly. It\u2019s bothering that you can\u2019t tell if the p0rn you\u2019re consuming is consensual or not and I think that\u2019s an important point to remember. Especially revenge p0rn makes my stomach hurt.. I am glad to hear that you want to be an ally \ud83d\ude0a I think you can do all of the options you mentioned to spread awareness. If you\u2019d like more information on that I\u2019d happily help you as well.
