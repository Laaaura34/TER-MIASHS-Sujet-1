You're definitely right, and while it wasn't something I view necessarily \"regularly\" (maybe one or twice a month, if that), I notice that I became more comfortable to the idea of viewing. It evolved passed the \"taboo\" or \"amateur\" nature of it, to something I began normalizing. I don't think there is anything wrong with curiosity into taboo material (outside of super illegal shit like CP, obviously), but it's when the idea of the material becomes normalized or status quo that is an indication of a bigger issue. I'm just glad I had that awaking on my own accord, and not by \"getting caught\" by my partner or a similar intervention-like situation. I've been really open to her.too about my struggles and feelings regarding it, and God, has she been incredibly supportive and nonjudgmental during this. Sometimes I truly think I don't deserve her, but I'm rambling now haha.\n\nBut I'd love to get more information on the resources available regarding the subject, if possible! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ohjl4c/decided_to_quit_consuming_porn_and_start_becoming/h4q686y/"}
