If it\u2019s not fun, put it all away in the cupboard for a while, don\u2019t force yourself to do it. Also, this is a weird ass year and our brains are processing a lot of new information. It\u2019s no surprise that you want to veg with tv instead of knitting. I go through cycles of several months being totally inspired about one aspect of my hobby, then there\u2019s a break where I feel like I\u2019ve lost my mojo, then I find another aspect of my hobby most appealing and I\u2019m off down that rabbit hole with glee. The social media expectation of people doing the same hobby year in year out is from niche marketing rather than how an individual human enjoys a hobby. I hope you can put it all aside and relax for a while until you come across something that inspires you to get back into a project or game.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hzf738/what_to_do_when_you_feel_no_joy_in_your_hobbies/fziygj4/"}
