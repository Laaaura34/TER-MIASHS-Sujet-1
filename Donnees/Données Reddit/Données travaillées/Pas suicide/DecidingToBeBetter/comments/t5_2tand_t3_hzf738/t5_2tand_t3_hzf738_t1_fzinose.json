Taking a break from your hobbies can be good to get you re-inspired to get into them again. Some hobbies I've just decided to let go rather than hanging on to them because they've been a part of my life for years.\n\nLike exercising and photography. Both of these hobbies were significant for a large portion of my life, but within the last few years, they've lacked their luster. I just kind of decided one day that maybe I'll pick them back up, but for now if the desire isn't there, I need to stop stressing myself out feeling like I need to keep doing them.\n\nSo something I decided to pick back up was PC gaming. I haven't played in over 10 years and it's been so fun! I'm also getting into new leisure sports, like tennis, with my husband. \n\nI guess my point is that maybe you could try new things you've been wanting to do and see how that works. like gardening, learning an instrument, art, or a different style of video games.
