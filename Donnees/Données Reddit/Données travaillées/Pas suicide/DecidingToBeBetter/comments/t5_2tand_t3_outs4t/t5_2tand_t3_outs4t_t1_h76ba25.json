Day by day you will start finding parts of your life to cut out, reshape, and reinsert like an artist creating a sculpture or an engineer designing a complex system.  It will feel like you're making no progress, but when you look back over your year, or two years, you'll realize you've become a completely different- maybe better- person.  You'll say goodbye to old habits, develop some new ones, maybe find a love interest.  You'll be creating the beginning of the type of person you will become for the next 10 years or so.  It's a good thing, this ennui.  It will focus you, if you let it.  You'll realize potential you maybe were told you didnt have as a child.\n\nPlus, hangovers start really sucking around this age, which may have something to do with it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/outs4t/i_do_not_have_any_porpuse/h76ba25/"}
