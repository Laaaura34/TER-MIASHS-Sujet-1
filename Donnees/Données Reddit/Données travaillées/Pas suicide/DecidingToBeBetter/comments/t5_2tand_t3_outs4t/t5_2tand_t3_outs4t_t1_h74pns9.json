Why not just pick?\n\nIts like being in a candy store, but you don't have any preference or favorites at all. \n\nMight as well pick a random item and see if you like it. Then do so until you find something worthwhile.  \n\n\nI'm 26. I'm in finance, with a job, etc. \n\nI still study coding, I am tempted to try learning the violin but I'm too busy with work, classes, and learning Swedish because...I just wanted to learn a new language. \n\n\nNot all who wonder are lost. But getting lost in a purpose is a wonderful thing.\n\nThe key is to finish. Don't just start something. Think about a process from one stage to another of the activity you choose, and the idea is that if you still feel like pursuing said activity once you reached a milestone, continue until the next milestone. \n\nIf not, change activity or goal. \n\nBut finish at least one milestone once you started.
