Be bad at things for a bit.  Try a silly skill.  Itll come in handy later.\n\nI learned to dig ditches as a kid.  Cam in real handy when my wife wanted a garden.  I built on that skill to dig better ditches more efficiently when we needed to surround our house with 2 feet of gravel to keep rats from tunneling underneath.\n\nI learned the violin as a kid.  That taught me the value of precision and working towards a perfection you'll never achieve.  It also got me a high I'll never describe adequately. I built on that high to inspire my younger daughter, who is now a competitive gymnast.\n\nA humble beginning is built on firm ground, and upon which can be built a great house, filled with everything you could want.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/outs4t/i_do_not_have_any_porpuse/h76br5v/"}
