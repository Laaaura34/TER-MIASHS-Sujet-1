Say I start out at 50/50 studying/breaktime but then as time go I can change the proportions so I do more work. It\u2019s important I dont remove entertainment time but increase the work time. :) try and let me know how it goes.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ax7xqg/hooked_to_entertainment/eigwgyj/"}
