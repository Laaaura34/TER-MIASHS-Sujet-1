Realizing that you\u2019re forgetting about someone who put you through hell feels like escaping their grasp at long last, like that person is so far beneath you that your entire conscious mind has unshackled from them. It\u2019s a powerful feeling and I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re at this place in your healing.
