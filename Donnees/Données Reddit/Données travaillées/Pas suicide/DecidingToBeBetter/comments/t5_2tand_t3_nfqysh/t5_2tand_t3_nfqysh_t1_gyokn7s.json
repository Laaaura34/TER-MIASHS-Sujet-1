I found going on vacations and seeing new things and talking to new people to be very helpful. It gave me a reminder that there still are good people in the world and hope that I could find safety and happiness again.\n\nI had to go to Trauma therapy for help and we eventually did EMDR therapy which was critical to helping me. It was amazing. I had really bad PTSD after my trauma and I would ruminate, relive, and have nightmares about the trauma very severely. I became depressed too because I felt like I didn\u2019t know how to trust new people anymore. And I had a very bad time sleeping because of the nightmares so they worsened my symptoms. \n\nI picked up the hobby of going hiking to take pictures of flowers during my toughest time. Have something for my mind to focus on and having new things that involved all my senses helped too. There was always birds on my hikes too that I took pictures of and listened to their singing. And going to all those new hikes and places reminded me that there is so much more of the world I haven\u2019t seen. I didn\u2019t like flowers much before... but now I love them because I can really focus in on them and notice all their details and how peaceful and relaxed they made me feel.\n\nAlso the books The Body Keeps the Score and The Emotionally Abusive relationship helped me a lot. \n\nI started yoga again, meditate more consistently, and now get massages every one in a while. It\u2019s helps a lot. Learning to relax your body helps you relax your mind too. \n\nI hope you continue to find what gives you hope and joy.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nfqysh/i_forgot_about_my_abusive_ex_for_a_whole_weekend/gyokn7s/"}
