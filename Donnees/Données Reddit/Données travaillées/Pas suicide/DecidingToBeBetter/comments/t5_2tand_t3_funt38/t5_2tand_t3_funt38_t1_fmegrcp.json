I overate to comfort myself, not out of hunger. I've been being judged and convicted on my gluttony. I understand why gluttony is wrong and how it deprives others but I don't care enough to share. \n\nThat void you're feeling is meant to be filled with a genuine desire to take care of others. That is supposes to be our fullfilment but you can't get fullfilled by loving others if you don't have a geuine desire to. The bible is your guide to obtaining a loving heart.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/funt38/fulfilment_other_than_food/fmegrcp/"}
