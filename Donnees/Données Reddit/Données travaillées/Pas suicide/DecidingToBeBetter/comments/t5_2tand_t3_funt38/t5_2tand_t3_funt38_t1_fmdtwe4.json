I've been bringing intuitive eating into my life for the past year, and some other ways I've found to fulfill myself are: \n\n* **Staying hydrated!** This is a big one! Since I'm usually coding or working on projects, I sometimes just forget to drink water and wonder why I feel like all the life and soul has drained out of me.\n* **Taking stretch breaks!** I used to grab a snack every time I got up for a break, or felt like procrastinating a focus-intensive task. Now, instead, I've started setting a timer to get up and stretch, or sit in the sun or play some music for my plants!\n* **Learning wholesome recipes.** Food is not the enemy. Although we can label food as \"good\" or \"bad\" internally, most things are fine to eat as long as we eat them in the right portion, or until we really feel full. Looking up new recipes and wholesome ingredients to include in my meals has been so helpful in teaching me that I really enjoy food when I take the time to savor the cooking process, and what I'm eating! Highly recommend [Sadia Badiei's extremely informative blog, Pick Up Limes](https://www.pickuplimes.com/) if you're looking for some new recipes, or intuitive eating tips!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/funt38/fulfilment_other_than_food/fmdtwe4/"}
