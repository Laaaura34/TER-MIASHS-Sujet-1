It\u2019s been a lifetime of soft drinks and I want to replace with something healthy. I understand moderation but for me , I went cold turkey and so far so good. One big motivation is that I sometimes get gout which is very painful. I looked up potential causes to review them and sugar/fructose sugar can be one of them.\n\nSo weight is coming off with getting rid of the soft drinks, I\u2019ll have to start walking soon to keep weight coming off ....if I cave in for sugar ..well it\u2019s all kinds of food but I\u2019ll drink a small regular Gatorade. \n\nI\u2019m drinking green tea for any heart benefits and I\u2019m not a morning person , it helps to wake me up a little bit.\n\nFor the OP,  good luck ! My soft drinks were certainly an addiction and I\u2019m a little ashamed of drinking 3-4 cokes a day if not more.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eu2ria/2_days_without_soda_and_4_days_of_at_least_take/ffo6sap/"}
