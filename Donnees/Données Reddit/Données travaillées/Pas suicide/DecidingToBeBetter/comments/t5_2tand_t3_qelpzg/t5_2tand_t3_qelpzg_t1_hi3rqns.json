The grip of opioids is a strong one, and if I were in your shoes I would prioritize doing what I can to break that grip permanently. \n\nThere is a plant called Iboga that is not often used within the US that is thought to completely re-wire the brain addiction to opioids. The drug it produces is called Ibogaine. This drug is NOT harmless, and carries with it its own set of risks. It has the possibility to stress your heart while you are on it, for example - so Ideally you would want to pursue this through a treatment center, under the supervision of a doctor if you can. \n\nI lost my best friend to opioid addiction 10 years ago. Wish I knew about this then. \n\nIn terms of making change one thing you need to accept is the concept of discipline. Life changes do not happen overnight, and again this is part of re-wiring your brain; from short term gratification to long term gratification - which is much more rewarding and grants perpetual happiness. You will need to make a schedule of the things you want to do, and embrace it; force yourself to adhere to it, via discipline. This is very hard in the beginning. Changes like this do not come easily, and you will need to stick to it for a while (~3 months) before you mentally really start to enjoy it and commit to it naturally. \n\nTLDR: Opiods can end your life way too early. Ibogaine is worth exploring and potentially using under medical supervision. Discipline is the key tool to change your life.
