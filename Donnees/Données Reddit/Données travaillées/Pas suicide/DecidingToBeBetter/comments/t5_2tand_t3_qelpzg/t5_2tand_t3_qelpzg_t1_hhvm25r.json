I have gone on and off meditation for years now. There have been times when I have continued the practice for a while and have finally started feeling something \"different\" only to let go. When I have come back to it (even after having experienced the feeling before and knowing what it is), initially I have been unable to sit still for more than a few moments. As a few comments here mention, everything about this is a marathon. You have to be in it for the long haul. It will get difficult. Don't try everything at once, and know that there will be ups and downs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCaveat: I am certainly not an expert. I cannot give you a definitive answer. I am sharing my own observations and experience with the hope that it can help you.
