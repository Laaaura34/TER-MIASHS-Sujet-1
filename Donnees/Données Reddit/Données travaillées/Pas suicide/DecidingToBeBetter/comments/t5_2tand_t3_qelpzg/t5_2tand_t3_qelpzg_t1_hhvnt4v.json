The next problem you would encounter is to continue the momentum. Follow-up. A reminder of some sort to stick with your goal. That's when you know you need a friend to help you remind and motivate you to keep yourself focused on your goal.\n\nJust make sure that this friend you'll get yourself to help you stick with you\u2014through thick and thin, would be someone that would influence **you** to \"carry your own weight\" rather than **them** \"carrying your weight\" for you. Or else you'll not change the way you both **want and need** for yourself.\n\nP.S. I am 23 yrs old currently (turning 24 this year) have depression/moderate to severe anxiety/constant suicidal ideation and I suspect that I've got ADHD too. I am pretty much open to my college friends (not to all tho) about my shit. I failed a lot of friendships/relationships due to many factors. Some of my unresolved trauma still affects me in such a way that it impedes me from creating meaningful relationships with other people (and kinda affects my work perf. too now). But I don't regret it too much now. Failure is part of growing. And I'm happy to know how to take care of myself today and in the next years of my life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qelpzg/i_am_22_and_wasted_much_of_my_youth_what_should_i/hhvnt4v/"}
