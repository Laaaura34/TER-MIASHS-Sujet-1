Delete old bookmarks and clear passwords so it's harder to log in. Personally, I'd change your backgrounds and layouts too to increase the newness of it all. \n\nMake yourself some goals, look at where you want to be in 5 years. Now break those goals down and ask how you can work toward them now. If you want to be a homeowner, start with budgeting and fixing any credit issues. If you want to compete in triathlons, save for a bike to train on. \n\nCreate a schedule for yourself, include working out, maintaining relationships with friends and family, chores, therapy, school and work (as applicable), and downtime. Contact the relevant people and let them know. \"Hey dad, I was thinking it would be nice if we have a chat or dinner together on Sunday nights, does that work for you?\" And \"yes, hello, I'd like to see about an intake to see a therapist. I'm free on Tuesdays or Thursdays in the morning.\"\n\nThat downtime. Don't waste it. Leave your devices somewhere else and listen to what you're drawn or driven to, besides internet time sucks. Maybe it'll be writing, drawing, bike repair, inventing, cooking, whatever. That's your soul searching. Once you find your thing or things, you can allow yourself to use devices to find resources to follow it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qelpzg/i_am_22_and_wasted_much_of_my_youth_what_should_i/hhv2z4o/"}
