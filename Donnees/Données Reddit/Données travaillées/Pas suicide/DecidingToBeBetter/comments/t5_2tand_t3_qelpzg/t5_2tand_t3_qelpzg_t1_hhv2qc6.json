But I was in a pretty bad place when I met my wife 20 years ago. Using daily and working part time at night in restaurants and sleeping most of the day away. Once I met her I got serious about college and getting a career. I was 28 and haven\u2019t looked back. I was already trying to stop and change when I met her but she really helped me speed up (no pun intended) the healing process. Now I have 2 degrees and a job that pays well.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qelpzg/i_am_22_and_wasted_much_of_my_youth_what_should_i/hhv2qc6/"}
