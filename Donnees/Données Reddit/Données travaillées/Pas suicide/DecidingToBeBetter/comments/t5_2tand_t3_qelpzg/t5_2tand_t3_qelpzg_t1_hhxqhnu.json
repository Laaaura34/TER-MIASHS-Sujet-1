By us, by the Grace that has kept you in this life. And while your love for your parents might be the catalyst to beginning a new journey for yourself, the most important thing to remember is that you deserve a life of peace and health, love and safety for YOU - not for them. You are worthy of their love, and so much more. It sounds like you may not feel that way, but please have compassion for yourself. You have not wasted your youth. You are on this journey, just like us all. Just focus on right now, this minute. And then the next. And make each one count. And if there\u2019s a shitty minute, let it fall into the past without lingering on it. Holding space and love for you, you can do this. I know you can and I believe in you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qelpzg/i_am_22_and_wasted_much_of_my_youth_what_should_i/hhxqhnu/"}
