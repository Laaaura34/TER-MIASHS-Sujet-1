I felt that my childhood was wasted also. I wasn\u2019t allowed to be a child so I turned to drugs and alcohol trying to chase whatever childhood I could have in my teenage years. But the thing is, im never gonna get that time back. And neither are you. Those years are gone. But that doesn\u2019t mean they were wasted. They brought you here didn\u2019t they? All those years of hardship brought you here to this moment, where you can change your life for the better. But the thing is, you can\u2019t replace one vice with another. Because as long as you\u2019re still looking for something to help you escape reality, you\u2019re never gonna find JOY in reality. I can\u2019t tell you what to do from here. But I can tell you that even having the desire to get better is an accomplishment. I think you should check into a rehab to help you kick those drugs, you can\u2019t do it alone, trust me I didn\u2019t. And the sooner you get started, the more time you\u2019ll have to find things in life that bring you joy. I\u2019m still depressed and I take meds to help me deal with the shit in my head. But I\u2019ve come so far in a year and a half. I still have moments where I question if any of it was worth it, but I also have days where I convince myself to get up and go to a party and I have a great time! Like I said, I can\u2019t tell you where to go from here. But here\u2019s what you can expect. It\u2019s gonna be so fucking hard. You\u2019re gonna have days where you wish for death because it\u2019s easier than this. You\u2019re gonna have days where you relapse, but those days don\u2019t mean you\u2019re not in recovery. U know what those days tell you? Those days tell you that you\u2019re working so hard to change the way your brain clings to negativity and you\u2019re WINNING. In those moments, ur brain fights back because it doesn\u2019t like change. Our brains like to form habits and stick to them, because changing is hard. It\u2019s so fucking hard. But I can\u2019t even describe in words just how worth it it is to be able to genuinely enjoy waking up in the morning, the simple happiness of being able to go the gym and do basic things like brush your teeth without it being a constant battle. You\u2019ve wasted nothing, because those years taught you a valuable lesson. And now it\u2019s up to you to decide what to do with it. We can\u2019t give you an answer, we can\u2019t show you a path to take. YOU have to forge one on your own, because this is YOUR recovery, and no one else\u2019s \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qelpzg/i_am_22_and_wasted_much_of_my_youth_what_should_i/hhzuort/"}
