She's licensed to diagnose and is the first of half a dozen to see me weekly and diagnose and actually refer me to COMCARE. It's the first time ever I've been met with this. She is an addiction counselor as well. I'll finally be able to see a psychiatrist and am trying to get a psychologist, but it's hard where I live.\n\nThank you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qelpzg/i_am_22_and_wasted_much_of_my_youth_what_should_i/hhxkhiy/"}
