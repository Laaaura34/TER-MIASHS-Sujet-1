You said you want to do this for your parents and your dad deserves to be proud of you - don\u2019t worry about them. Worry about YOU. YOU deserve to be happy and loved by yourself. Trust me, when you do this, the love and joy will overflow onto your dad. You\u2019re young and have much youth left, I\u2019m wondering if maybe you focus on your healing right now rather than diving into work and school. You mentioned meditation and that works WONDERS. How to do it? Just do it, it gets easier each time you show up to meditate. Reach out to the resources you have for mental health, professionals, apps, whatever you can get your hands on that will help you. You\u2019ve gone through a lot and I feel that your drug usage is a result of trying to numb the pain that is there. You need to dive deep into that pain and work through it. It\u2019s going to be messy but that can be beautiful. Once you start healing, I\u2019d start trying to build life then. You\u2019ll have a story and have your hard work to heal to back you up and people will see your drive. Wishing you nothing but healing love and light", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qelpzg/i_am_22_and_wasted_much_of_my_youth_what_should_i/hhxhv82/"}
