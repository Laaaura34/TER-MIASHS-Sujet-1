We spent years with doctors and medication, for him nothing really worked until he started doing meditation on his own. I always recommend the headspace app which he started with, because I think it's free but there are other free apps out there too. I think he learned that all of the misdirection he suffered with in life could be managed if he learned to manage his thoughts. I wish I could be more help but I will just say this, that everything you posted in your post is really just a story you are telling about yourself and in reality all of your behaviors are not ultimately who you are.
