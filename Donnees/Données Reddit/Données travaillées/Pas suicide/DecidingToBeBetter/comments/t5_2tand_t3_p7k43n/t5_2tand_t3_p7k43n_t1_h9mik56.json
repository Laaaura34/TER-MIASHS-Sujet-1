Then forgive yourself again.  Make a promise to never do it again and stick to it. You are remorseful for what you did. That is the first and biggest step. Many justify the pain they caused.\n\nTaking your life would hurt so many more people.  It would only make what you did so much worse and make you smaller. You are bigger than that.\n\nFind a way to redeem yourself. Learn to talk about it openly so it prevents others from hurting others. \n\nWatch the movie Gandhi. There is a very, very powerful scene in there where during a war, a Hindu man revenge killed a Muslim child because a Muslim had killed his son. He consults with Gandhi in how he can ever forgive himself as he keeps remembering the terrible pain he caused through his anger and pain. He cannot forgive himself and could no longer sleep at night.\n\nGandhi replied: There is a way out of this hell. Find a child who lost his parents in this war. Make sure he is a Muslim, raise and love him as your son and make sure that you raise him as a Muslim\u2026. \n\nI never forgot this scene. And it is a true story. It moved me to tears\u2026\n\nSee, whatever you did, sincerely apologize to whom you need to apologize if you still can. Then make sure you use this burden you carry on your shoulder to do much greater good than the pain you caused\u2026. I promise you, one day you will be able to look in the mirror and be proud\u2026 Turn this powerful lesson into a mountain of good.\n\nI hope this offers you a light at the end of the tunnel you have been in. I am rooting for you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p7k43n/is_there_truly_redemption_for_the_worst_of_us/h9mik56/"}
