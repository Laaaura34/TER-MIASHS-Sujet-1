I know I'm just an internet stranger, but please know, YOU MATTER. I am so happy for your successes, happy you are still here with us, and your niece sounds adorable! It is very heartwarming that she is what got your heart feeling less sad and more hopeful. That first attempt to share with family can be so scary...and it can be tough to find the right therapist...I'm so glad you're on a good track! And thank you for sharing your story, it helps those of us who struggle with depression also, to read a positive story like yours. Thank you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k3ua6h/celebrating_a_whole_year_of_no_intrusive_thoughts/ge5m6dn/"}
