Supplement yourself with good sources of energy. I used to smoke and drink copious amounts every day and it sucked quitting but you're already passed the worst part. Fatigue just lingers for a while. \n\nIf you need to drink caffeine just do it without going overboard. I've also used kratom pretty much every time I quit some other vice. Good little energy and mood booster. Again, just don't go overboard and get your body overly dependent on it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pxj5gw/quit_weed_and_alcohol_and_have_huge_fatigue_and/heo39wj/"}
