Or soon.  I\u2019ll be 37 soon, and I am horrified to think what alcohol has already cost me.  Some of it, I\u2019m certain I have lost from alcohol.  Some things, I\u2019m not sure if they were ever mine, or if alcohol took them from me.  Or if I will truly never attain them.\n\nBut the uncertainty is the hardest part.  To imagine what I could have been, have what I might have had, who I may have lost, all because I didn\u2019t put forth anything even approaching my best effort\u2026.  Frankly, it\u2019s hard to forgive myself.  \n\nAnd really, I am fine.  My life isn\u2019t a disaster.  But there are things, hobbies, potential, time, her\u2026..  Sometimes it sickens me.  I am typing this laying on my couch with breakthrough Covid, and I\u2019ve decided to not drink for a month.  I\u2019ve done two months before and they were some of the happiest months of my life, despite the troubles I had been going through at the time.  I may just quit for good this time.\n\nYou\u2019re 22.  You could drink and be fine, not let it get out of hand.  It\u2019s not a death sentence, it\u2019s not certain to ruin your life.  But at least consider giving yourself a chance at your best life.  Don\u2019t be like me and wonder if you\u2019ll ever be able to forgive yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pywy9a/1460_days_have_passed/hexq1mb/"}
