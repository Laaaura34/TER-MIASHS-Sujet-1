If you put all these pieces together what will you become? What do you want to become?\n\nI think your goal should be linked to your purpose and be more about what do you want to become in the future. Then you can line up all your actions, choose which ones are aligning to your goal and start working through a process to complete them.\n\nIt was interesting to see that you wanted to write and do Photoshop. What do you write about, what do you edit? Do these align to something long-term or inspiring?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fuyn9z/soft_reboot/fmfwu0b/"}
