A couple of options here I can throw out for your consideration.  \n\n\n1. Keep pursuing your education in computers(imo, software if you can do it).  When you are ready to get a job find one that butts up against your other passions.  Love being outdoors?  Maybe find a company like AllTrails which would have you code for outdoors stuff.  You could look into startups that are working on ways to help the environment.  \n2. Keep pursuing computers and pursue your passions in your free time and see if you can eventually turn those into a way to make money.  This lets you have the stability of a well paying job and a potential option of doing what you love if things work out.  This could be combined with step #1.\n3. Pursue computers but learn how to be a financial guru so that you can retire very early(like your 30s) and pursue things that drive you without the requisite that they need to make money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to ditch computers than maybe look into being a park ranger. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pgoees/losing_passion_for_the_one_thing_everyone_knows/hbdc7e7/"}
