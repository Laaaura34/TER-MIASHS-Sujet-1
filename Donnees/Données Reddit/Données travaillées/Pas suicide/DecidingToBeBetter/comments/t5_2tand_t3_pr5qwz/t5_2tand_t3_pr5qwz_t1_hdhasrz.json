I know that it seems intimidating but it really isn't! I entered university in 2018 after switching majors and I was in a multitude of friendship groups. First off, you need to accept that there is nothing wrong with your personality, and it doesn't hurt to put yourself in different social situations. I met people from my own residence, then eventually different people in my program. I'm naturally chatty however, I found it easier when you know one really social friend because they'd introduce you to a lot of their friends. I made friends by joining different clubs (though I didn't last long in them lol) and eventually you learn quickly if you and another person will mesh. I made lecture friends forcibly just in case. I understand the difficulty in making friends, my folks taught me how carry conversation with their friends but it's not the same. \n\nThe best tip I can give you is just try to put yourself out there. E.g. during an icebreaker, if you notice you have a commonality with someone, follow it up with a question or a compliment.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pr5qwz/how_can_i_develop_social_skills_that_will_get_me/hdhasrz/"}
