It's about letting them know that they don't *have* to do anything specific to deserve that kind of appreciation and that you're grateful to have them on their most unremarkable days for absolutely no reason other than that they're there with you. \n\nI mean, thanking your partner for doing thoughtful things is just common sense and an occasional \"Thank you for being here with me\" is not a substitute for human decency. It's assumed that they already get acknowledged for specific things that they're amazing at, but the point is to make it very clear that they don't always have to earn it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lwtrrj/if_youre_currently_lucky_enough_to_have_a_partner/gpnmnpn/"}
