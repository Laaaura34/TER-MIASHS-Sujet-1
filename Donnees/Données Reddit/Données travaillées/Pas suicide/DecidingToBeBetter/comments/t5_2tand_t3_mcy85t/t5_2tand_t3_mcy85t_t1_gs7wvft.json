Your belief is \"people who break stuff are stupid, lazy and incompetent. They've ruined my calm\". It is from this belief that your anger emerges, and because your anger paints somebody as to \"blame\", your anger is directional - it is directed at the person you belive is to blame.\n\nI am aware you *know* that these things aren't true, but you do believe them. Humans are very poor at comprehending their own motivations - they regularly mistake \"what they know is logical\" for \"what they believe\", and are sometimes not even capable of realizing that these things can vary.\n\nA person who believes \"things break, it is no one's fault\" is not *maintaining* their calm, they are calm by virtue of not having beliefs about the situation. A person who believes \"broken stuff is funny\" will find the situation humourous. A person who believes \"everything will break anyway so what is the point of having stuff\" will find the situational grimly depressing.\n\nYou are not angry by nature. You are angry where your beliefs paint somebody as having wronged you, and you are calm where your beliefs paint nobody as being to blame. Another way in which humans are abysmal at comprehending themselves is that they try to produce an overall \"category\" such as \"I am angry\" or \"I am calm\", rather than recognising that they have no consistent \"self\", and actually have many situational specific-selves dictated by their beliefs.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mcy85t/husband_spilled_nail_polish_all_over_our/gs7wvft/"}
