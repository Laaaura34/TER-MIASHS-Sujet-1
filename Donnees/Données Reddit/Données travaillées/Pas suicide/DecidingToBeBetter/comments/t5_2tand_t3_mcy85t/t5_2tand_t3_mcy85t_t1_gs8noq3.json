As someone who also got yelled at for breaking stuff etc growing up it\u2019s just nice to know that we don\u2019t have to live that life and we can make a different reality for our kids. My younger sister still lives at home and every time she breaks stuff or makes a mess my parent yells etc but when she comes to me and tells me first I tell her it\u2019s fine bc in reality it doesn\u2019t really matter. They are material objects and nobody yells at the parent when they break stuff and I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t like if they did so why parents do this to their kids is beyond me \ud83d\ude44.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mcy85t/husband_spilled_nail_polish_all_over_our/gs8noq3/"}
