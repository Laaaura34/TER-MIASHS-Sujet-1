Not to say they are bad. It's just a positive change you have made. Good on you. We can't control much in this world. We can't control sickness or what people say to us or getting hit by a car, etc, etc.  But what we can control are our reactions. Reactions to everyday life, good and bad.     It always surprises me how many people don't seem to utilize any control and scream or fight with such a short fuse. They are basically emotionally adrift in the world, not in control of the only thing they could ever really be: themselves.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mcy85t/husband_spilled_nail_polish_all_over_our/gs6gtb7/"}
