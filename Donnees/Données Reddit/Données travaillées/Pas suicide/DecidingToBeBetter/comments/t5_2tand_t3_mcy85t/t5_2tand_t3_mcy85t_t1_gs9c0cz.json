It doesn't even need to be big, she's blaming everyone.  Today she criticized us for being late and when I mentioned that I was trying to get her to move earlier she blamed me for not doing a good enough job of making her move .  Anger is just a standard response, and I hate that I'm starting to do it as well.\n\nBut it's so important to remember, and especially important to teach our kids, that this isn't right.  We shouldn't have to go through life lurching from one blow up over a simple offense to the next.  I commend you and your husband for being better!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mcy85t/husband_spilled_nail_polish_all_over_our/gs9c0cz/"}
