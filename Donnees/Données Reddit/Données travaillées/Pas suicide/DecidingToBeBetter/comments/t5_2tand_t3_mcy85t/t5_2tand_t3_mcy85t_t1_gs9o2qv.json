I hate how Reddit always jumps to \u201cdump them\u201d, but I\u2019ve dated guys in the past that brought me down as a person (made me worse). When I was with them, it was so hard to ever balance my anger. With my current relationship, the opposite is true. The goodness in my partner has rubbed off on me. Do you want to spend your life with someone that rubs off on you in a negative way? That question is extremely important to me now that I have experienced better. I hope that isn\u2019t too preach!
