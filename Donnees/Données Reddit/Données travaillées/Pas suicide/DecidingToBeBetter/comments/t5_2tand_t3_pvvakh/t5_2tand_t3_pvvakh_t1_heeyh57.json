I've got schizoaffective bipolar. I take antipsychotics, which help regulate a lot of things but also target my manic symptoms, which were heightened by dopamine addictive activities. I definitely don't think my case is typical but I thought I had ADHD prior to being diagnosed, turns out most of that was the bipolar symptoms and every other major issue I was having because of schizophrenia. Medication has worked for me so far, been treated for 4 months now!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvvakh/i_overcome_my_dopamine_addiction_everything_is/heeyh57/"}
