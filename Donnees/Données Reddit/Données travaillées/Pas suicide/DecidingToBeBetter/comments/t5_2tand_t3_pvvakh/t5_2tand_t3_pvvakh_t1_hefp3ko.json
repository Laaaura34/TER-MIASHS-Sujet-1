Sometimes I hyper focus to the point of obsession. Other times I'll tell myself \"oh I've been wanting to do this and have free... What's that over there\". I may want and enjoying doing something and have tons of free time but simply doing it still might take 3 or 4 weeks because I keep getting distracted. \n\nIt's super frustrating because I'll realize I did it be like \"Crap I got distracted again\" go back to what I was supposed to be doing but before I can get back... be distracted again.\n\n> I will say I have also been in therapy alongside my psychiatric treatment\n\nI had wondered about this. I don't just want to get drugged up and kicked out the door, I have personal stuff I need to work through but I've been worried if I go to a psychologist I wont get medication I may need and if i go to a psychiatrist I may not get the emotional/mental help I need. I wasn't sure if going to both was a thing. Does your insurance company cover doing both?\n\n>Also, it didn't fix everything\n\nThanks for clarifying. I've been trying to temper my expectations as I don't think it'll be a miracle. I am however just hoping for something that makes it feel like I have some more control/tools so I feel like I can actually change my life and am not doomed by my own brain sabotaging me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvvakh/i_overcome_my_dopamine_addiction_everything_is/hefp3ko/"}
