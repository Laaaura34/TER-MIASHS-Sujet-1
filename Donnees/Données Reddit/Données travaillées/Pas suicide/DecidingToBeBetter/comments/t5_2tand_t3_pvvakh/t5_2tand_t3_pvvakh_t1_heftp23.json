Some people able to have it moderation, but not me. My \"all or nothing mentality\" makes me jerk off my dopamine receptors on the highest level. But if you can handle it, so it nothing bad. Like eating in McDonalds or KFC 2-3 times a day is bad, but eating tasty natural burger once a 1-2 week that was made in your local burger restaurant is ok.\n\nHow to understand is it a \"dopamine activity\"? You have a huge craving to it and it is never enough. You have short period of pleasure and you want more. If you ever been in casino you know what I mean.\n\nIt is easy to stop when you eat boiled chicken with rice and vegetables but what about cheesy pizza or doughnuts? It is easy to stop after sex with one person you love but what about porn? Is it easy to stop when you scrolling feed in Instagram or FB? Some types of behavior like attention seeking is a dopamine too. New information is a dopamine, that's why so many people are addicted to news. Even right now people gave me upvotes and I feel some dopamine, so right now I'm going to have a walk, maybe run in the park to stop jerking off my receptors.\n\nKing of dopamine is cocaine. Rush of pleasure for short period of time and then you feel like shit.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvvakh/i_overcome_my_dopamine_addiction_everything_is/heftp23/"}
