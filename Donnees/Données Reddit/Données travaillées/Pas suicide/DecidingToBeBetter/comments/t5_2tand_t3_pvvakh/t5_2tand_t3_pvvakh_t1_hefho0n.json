I think the treatment of my manic symptoms, which effectively helped me stop mentally bouncing off the walls and eventually crashing, has been the biggest help.  I hope you get the answers you're looking for and some effective treatments! I will say I have also been in therapy alongside my psychiatric treatment, this has been super important to kind of take stock of any changes I am experiencing, positive and negative, from an unbiased perspective. Also, it didn't fix everything, I went cold turkey on social media for a while and cut my screen time from 7-8 hours a day to around 1-2 hours for my phone to prevent doom scrolling. It is tough, it sucks, but the results are so worth it. Now I basically only use reddit, because I like to give advice and it feels like a positive form of dopamine feeding.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvvakh/i_overcome_my_dopamine_addiction_everything_is/hefho0n/"}
