I do pay some portion but not nearly as much as private treatments. When I had my first psych evaluation I had a private therapist and I actually dropped her services because the school required me to see an on-campus therapist that would communicate directly to my psychiatrist due to the nature of my diagnosis. I think schizophrenia scares people so that\u2019s why that requirement exists, but it has worked out because my therapist with the school is actually a much better therapist! \n\nYes, its important to manage your expectations. Medication doesn\u2019t fix the broken leg, it gives you the crutches to move around while it heals. Or like, medication is a life jacket so you don\u2019t have to swim against the current without any help.
