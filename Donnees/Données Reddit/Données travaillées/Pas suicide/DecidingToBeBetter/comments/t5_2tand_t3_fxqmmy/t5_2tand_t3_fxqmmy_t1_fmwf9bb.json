You only mention it twice and actually spend more time talking about goals than destiny itself. It would be a much better written piece if you bothered to define the terms, *what does destiny actually mean the way you're using it*. I can tell by the way you've written, what you seem to be implying is that destiny are those activities you are fated to always enjoy, destiny are the things that you need in order to feel fulfilled. And that is *not* the definition of destiny that most people are used to.\n\nIt would be much more helpful if you revised this piece to better define what certain terms mean, because as it is, this piece just left me feeling confused and I had to re-read it in order to understand what you meant. \"Goals\" and \"destiny\" both need to be made more clear what you mean by them, and what distinctly separates the two. I think you have a decent lesson here, that you should build your goals around what activities make you happy, rather than more abstract things like money. However, overall I don't think you communicated your point very well. But it's still interesting to read things like this and gain a new perspective!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fxqmmy/life_strategy_is_not_about_goals_it_is_about/fmwf9bb/"}
