A pack a day for 10 years is huge. And then quitting from there is a big thing. So congratulations for that. For me, the reminder that how tough it was to quit, really helps me everytime I even think of a cigarette. I mean, the reminder of the shivering hands, dehydrated mouth, etc (withdrawal symptoms basically) really stop me from even taking a drag. I really hope you're able to cut out the cheat days as well. All the best :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ofd5sp/i_can_finally_call_myself_a_non_smoker/h4dmws6/"}
