You know, lockdown only made things tough for all of us I guess. Plus, I can imagine how Canadian winter can make you crave cigarettes more.. haha! But you're almost 7 months through. That's REALLY COMMENDABLE!! And you know apart from the poisons, our lifestyles are so fucked up. I mean my job needs me to stare at a computer screen all day, and before I know it I am bent like a banana while working. So, I have begun exercising actively now and I'm hoping that it helps cure my posture and keep it in check. I'm really happy for you that you're able to improve your life on multiple levels. So, congrats on that. Here's hoping for the best to both of us :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ofd5sp/i_can_finally_call_myself_a_non_smoker/h4dky30/"}
