For me, I think the lockdown helped because socialising was restricted, so I sort of used that to my advantage. I really hope you're able to pull it off as well. If you need any help, you can always DM me. Congratulations for taking the step, and all the best for your quitting journey. Trust me, your future self will thank you :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ofd5sp/i_can_finally_call_myself_a_non_smoker/h4ceq3y/"}
