The key to having a peace of mind is to be aware rather than judge.  Through observing, we come to an understanding and it\u2019s this that overcomes our fears and judgments.  It\u2019s not about labeling thoughts as positive or negative, but merely observing and being aware that the mind is producing thoughts.  This is known as the present moment.  It\u2019s what you\u2019re doing which is thinking.  The next time you start labeling or judging things, be mindful of the activity you\u2019re engaging in the moment and that should bring your awareness and attention back to reality and turn off the mental chatter.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/orodsv/damn_you_my_mind/h6jma8b/"}
