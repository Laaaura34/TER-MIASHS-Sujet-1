Ask these questions: Are they just being homophobic? Why are they accepting your relationship but not your wedding? Would you like them to come? Does their presence mean a lot to you? (Also do you feel like they would cause drama at the wedding if they came? Because if yes, then its not a great idea). If they still won't come then thats on them for missing their beautiful daughter's amazing wedding. I'm sorry you're dealing with this, that must suck. I'm sure they'll come along eventually, but at the same time you shouldn't suffer just because they are taking forever to accept that you're gay and getting married. You do you and time will tell.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/odg5xy/parents_dont_want_to_attend_my_wedding_because/h41i8gr/"}
