He missed the best wedding in the world.  You know who didn\u2019t? Me, my husband, our closest friends, and the family that wanted to be there and celebrate with us.  Years later he\u2019s come around but I\u2019m only left with pity that he didn\u2019t get to be part of it.  We were, and are fine.  You be will be too.
