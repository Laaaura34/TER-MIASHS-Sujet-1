It saddens my mom heart to think others could still not love and accept their children for who they are. \n\nOn to your question... Would you consider streaming the wedding for more people than just your parents? If you are going to be streaming it for others, I don\u2019t think you should penalize those who really want to attend but can\u2019t since it\u2019s far. But if you would just be streaming it for them, I would not go out of your way to do so.\n\nCongratulations, and I hope the two of you have a wonderful, happy life together \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/odg5xy/parents_dont_want_to_attend_my_wedding_because/h41h134/"}
