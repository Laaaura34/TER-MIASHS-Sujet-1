He just came out a couple years ago and just moved in with his partner. I am so so happy for both of them and so happy he found someone! \n\nAlso, I know he had a hard time coming out and still struggle with what it means to be gay from some people's perspectives.   His Dad and I were very religious when he was growing up and his Dad passed before he knew.  \n\nI guess my advice would be to let your parents be where they are in their journey and keep loudly & proudly living your life.  Actually, I'd say it'll work in your favor they're not coming.   Parents who don't get their way tend to cause drama.  This way, you can do things exactly as you two want and you're not going to have your parents loosing it at the wedding and creating a scene.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/odg5xy/parents_dont_want_to_attend_my_wedding_because/h41b5gr/"}
