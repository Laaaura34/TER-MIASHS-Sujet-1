If they don't want to go then they won't want to watch a stream, don't bend over backwards for them. My parents were borderline about whether they'd come to my wedding, the whole family had to work on them and they did in the end, just about.\n\nI'm still figuring out how to do this myself, but there comes a point where you need to live your life. That doesn't mean you don't respect your parents, you can still respect and love them. If there are parts of your life that they can't accept, then, well, you can't change people, so just do what's right for you and let them get on with their lives.\n\nIf they show an interest in your wedding, arrange to stream it. If they don't, then don't. Offer photos and if they don't want them, then fine. You won't be a bad person.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/odg5xy/parents_dont_want_to_attend_my_wedding_because/h40r1vu/"}
