It sounds like it's coming almost solely from spite and it's likely only going to make the relationship worse. As long as it isn't going to be a lot of effort and doesn't take away from your special day, I'd recommend being the bigger person by streaming it. If they watch it, they're probably not going to be the only ones and it might just help them understand your relationship better by giving them a glimpse into how happy you are with your partner.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/odg5xy/parents_dont_want_to_attend_my_wedding_because/h4141qe/"}
