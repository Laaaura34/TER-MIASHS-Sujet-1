This is how dysfunction with families crosses to the next generation. I would ask for my parents to extend their blessing for my marriage. Whether they provide the blessing or not at this time I wiukd send a large flower arrangement to my parents on my wedding day with a note saying I wanted them to know I am thanking them today for all they sacrificed over my youth. That action of live and respect by the OP is a much different story to tell her child someday than if OP says how they punished my parents for their inability to support OP on her wedding day.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/odg5xy/parents_dont_want_to_attend_my_wedding_because/h41sy1b/"}
