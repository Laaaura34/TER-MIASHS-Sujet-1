A lot of people end up inhereting their family's negative traits, so noticing them is a good first step to becoming a better person yourself. You can ask yourself, who do I judge? In what ways do I protect myself from realizing my faults (like accusing people i have bullied of being attention seeking)? You seem lovely OP and i am not saying you are like them at all, its just a way to take a negative situation back into a place where you have control. You can only take responsibility for yourself. \n\nCongratulations on your engagement OP!! You and your partner deserve every good thing in this World!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/odg5xy/parents_dont_want_to_attend_my_wedding_because/h40psui/"}
