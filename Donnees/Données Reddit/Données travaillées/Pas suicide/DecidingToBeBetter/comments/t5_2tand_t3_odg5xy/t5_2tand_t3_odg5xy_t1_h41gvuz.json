This is amazing what you are doing! You are setting a course for your future to sustain a stable, loving, healthy, and authentic life! \nBut you are also beginning a life with someone else. It would be wonderful to join your old life and the people in it, with your new life and the people in that, however, you can\u2019t force it. Hopefully your family will come around and accept who you are and love your wife like their own, but it may not happen\u2014that\u2019s okay! Your focus should be about you and her and your life together. Period. \nI think you should still stream your wedding as a symbol of your love and commitment between you and your wife and anyone else who sees it. Who knows, your parents might sneak a peak and change their minds about your union! Good luck!
