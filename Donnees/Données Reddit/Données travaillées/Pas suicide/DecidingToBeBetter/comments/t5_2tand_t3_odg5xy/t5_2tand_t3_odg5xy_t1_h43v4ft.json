I\u2019m sorry your parents aren\u2019t accepting of your sexuality and won\u2019t be honest with you. If your parents being at your wedding is something that is important to you, I suggest giving them a call and explaining to them what it means for you to have your parents there. That way you can say you did everything you could and the rest falls on them. Congratulations on finding someone you love and are going to marry, wishing you and your partner the best. \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/odg5xy/parents_dont_want_to_attend_my_wedding_because/h43v4ft/"}
