He's an awesome young man, kind, clever, hard working and a million other things that would make anyone proud to know him. His now long term partner is also a wonderful (and handsome!) guy, so I'm happy for them both, but hate the fact the road was made harder than it needed to be.\nI always hope that wonderful people such as yourselves know that there is love for you in the hearts of people you'll never meet. They want the best for you, want you to be happy, find your tribe, fly your flag and be appreciated for more than which gender you choose to kiss when you get home from work.\nI know it's hard when you want the approval of your parents and that may come with time, but if it doesn't, blaze a trail of kindness anyway and have a beautiful marriage.\nRemember to share some wedding photos with us, so we can all tell you how stunning you both look! I'm not the only one here that will cheer you on\ud83d\ude18", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/odg5xy/parents_dont_want_to_attend_my_wedding_because/h415bly/"}
