I guess you could refuse to show it if they come around, but I personally don't see the point if you want them to regret missing the day. \n\nSharing the photos vs denying them is just another flavor of the same medicine at that point. \n\n\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/odg5xy/parents_dont_want_to_attend_my_wedding_because/h41z7x8/"}
