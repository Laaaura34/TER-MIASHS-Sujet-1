I had a similar situation with my GF and my family. I kept my foot down for 2 years until they finally realized they were being fed lies from other family members. Biggest thing I learned in all of it is, you make your own family, never accept anyone who will tell you they do not accept your decision to get married to your partner and be happy. They do not respect you or your happiness so make your own life what you want my friend trust me life is so much more stress free once you take out the toxic people. I hope you find everything you are looking for in this life and many blessings to you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/odg5xy/parents_dont_want_to_attend_my_wedding_because/h432ccg/"}
