I have had the joy of realizing that. I was chasing goals all my life that are not worth it. Being happy and doing the things you love are so much more worth it then the things you own or the things you accomplished. Love the proces towards reaching a goal. Otherwise you will loose interest after reaching it. \nWhy run a marathon when you don\u2019t like running. \n\nBut I don\u2019t totally agree on the relationship part. While a single relationship is not that important. Relationships are important for your joy and happiness. Studies show that being in meaningful close relationships will improve the quality and length of life.\n\nLove your message. Spread the joy and love in life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/li1pk6/youre_going_to_realize_it_one_daythat_happiness/gn27jc8/"}
