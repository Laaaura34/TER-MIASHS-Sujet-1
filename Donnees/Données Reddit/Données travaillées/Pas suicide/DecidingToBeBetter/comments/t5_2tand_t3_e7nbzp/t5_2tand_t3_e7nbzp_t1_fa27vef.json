I started at 14. I wish I could take back every one I'd ever smoked (but if you really asked me I'd say some (underlined...) were worth it.)). 6 months is an incredible fight, because that's what it comes down to, and being proud of that is a great tool to help you keep it up.\n\nThat's what helped me quit recently. Just simply telling people I didn't smoke assisted the venture I was going through. You did the right thing posting here I believe (fully believe mind you). It's never going to be easy mind you, but you have taken a good stance for success. \n\nEvery time you want to smoke tell yourself it's time to do something. Wash the dishes, fold some laundry. Just don't do what you would normally do while smoking. For me, what made me start again was needing time to myself. That's what made me go back on my word. Wanting that extra bit of comfort. \n\nYou're on a mission and 6 months is something to be very proud of. I'm personally inspired by this random post that could be written by any random person with any random intention. But instead it was you. With your very specific intention and individuality. If that doesn't corroborate your good idea and some stranger motivated to quit alongside you in silence doesn't help you on your quest... the only thing left is you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/e7nbzp/today_is_6_months_off_cigarettes/fa27vef/"}
