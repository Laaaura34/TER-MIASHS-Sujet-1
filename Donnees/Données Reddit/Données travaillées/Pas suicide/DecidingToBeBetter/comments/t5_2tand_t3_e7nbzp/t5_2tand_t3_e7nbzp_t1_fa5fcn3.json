Congratulations on making the choice to stop smoking.\n\nMy dad has been in ICU for 25+ days after open heart surgery & lungs are his biggest issue. Doctors keep mentioning it\u2019s due to his smoking which damaged his lungs over time.\n\nBecause of his damaged lungs he is having hard time breathing and that is leading to high blood pressure which leads to everything else. So yes cigarettes does kill. \n\nIf he wasn\u2019t smoking he would of been home recovering instead of battling it in ICU.\n\nPlease don\u2019t start smoking.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/e7nbzp/today_is_6_months_off_cigarettes/fa5fcn3/"}
