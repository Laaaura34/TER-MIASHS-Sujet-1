As mentioned in *The Easy-Peasy Method for Quitting Porn*, the cold turkey attitude ('porn diets') only lead to frustration and relapse. Simply quitting masturbation is easy compared to putting in the work to develop a healthy relationship to one's body and sexual health, or, God forbid, unlearning misogynistic attitudes towards women. The amount of Nofap acolytes who use it to try and attract women (because some mistaken belief about, I don't know, testosterone or whatever) is sickening. No mental fortitude or will there, just self-flaggelation, mortification of the flesh without prayer and grace.\n\nClearly it isn't working for this young lad, who's seeing a massive decline in their mental health.\n\nProbably because pubescent males are full of sexual energy that needs to be expended.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdk4m4/under_nofap_i_start_to_understand_that_im_not/hhoucfq/"}
