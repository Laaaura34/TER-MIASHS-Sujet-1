We become used to certain thought patterns in the same way we develop muscle memory. You have to catch yourself when you\u2019re berating yourself, overthinking, focusing on the negative, or having self-harmful thoughts, and force yourself to think the OPPOSITE of what you\u2019re so comfortable telling yourself (look up cognitive distortions, it describes all the ways that your mind can twist reality into seeming so fucked). \n\nIt\u2019s uncomfortable because you have internalized that you don\u2019t deserve to be happy and fulfilled. When you say to yourself things like \u201cI am enough,\u201d \u201cI deserve happiness,\u201d and \u201cI can be better,\u201d it\u2019s like doing a new exercise. It\u2019s uncomfortable, painful even, and you won\u2019t be good at it. It takes practice (and the right medication if that\u2019s what you need) but you CAN do it. Even if you don\u2019t believe it yet, you will. Everything you are feeling right now is temporary, this is one of the many valleys in life but you will have your peaks even if you can\u2019t see them now. Practice self care, practice positivity, and it will get easier and easier.\n\nAs for the guilt, let it go. You can\u2019t support anyone else if you can\u2019t support yourself, and that\u2019s okay. The people who love you will understand. It\u2019s okay to need help. And if you love your parents which I\u2019m sure you do, use that as your motivation. Get better so that you can be the son/daughter you know you can be, for them if not for yourself. That\u2019s how you can truly help them. \n\nThis may be a little dark but it\u2019s the only way I was able to convince myself that I no longer wanted to die; Imagine you have just failed a suicide attempt. You wake up in the hospital, sick from the overdose, cold from the water you almost drowned in, or like me, covered from head to toe in burns, scrapes, blood, and asphalt. You\u2019re immediately hit with overwhelming guilt and sadness as you turn your head to see your father embracing your mother as she weeps. They are feeling upset, terrified, sad, but more than anything, relieved. They come to your side as your eyes well up with tears. You can\u2019t believe you actually almost did it. \n\nYou almost did the unthinkable, and I don\u2019t mean killing yourself, I mean you almost chose to leave everything and everyone you have ever and will ever love behind. You almost made those closest to you suffer on this earth and deal with the trauma of losing someone as important to them as you. It starts to hurt and I don\u2019t mean physically. You\u2019re bawling now, your parents are bawling. Your phone is blowing up with friends, other family members, even acquaintances who just want to know if you\u2019re alright. Your best friend bursts in the room and you fucking lose it. \u201cHow could I do this to them? I love them so much. How did I end up here in the darkest of places\u201d you think but all you can manage to cry out is \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d over and over and over again. But the thing is, no matter how many times you apologize or try to explain how fucked up you are, everyone says the same thing: \u201cit\u2019s okay.\u201d \n\nAs more people come to see you during your physical recovery, you begin to realize how much you actually matter, because why else would these people you thought you could leave behind come and see you? The guilt is still there but it gets better, because you realize that the only way you could possibly show your love and appreciation is to make sure that you never ever end up in that place again. They say \u201cit\u2019s okay\u201d because you are still on this earth and still have so many places to go, people to meet, goals to achieve, and that\u2019s all it really takes. You can show those people you care about them too by caring about yourself again.  They will love you even more than they already do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dvlf9e/take_control_of_your_life_and_decide_to_be_better/f7g153r/"}
