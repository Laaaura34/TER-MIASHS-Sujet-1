Remind yourself that everybody fails often, you just need to try again. Some people have more talent in an area so they might seem like they never fail, but everyone does.\n\nI think most of what you asked about comes in time, with experience.

Fail, then try again ;)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/htzlp8/18_years_old_never_developed_life_skills_where_do/fyk3lgz/"}
