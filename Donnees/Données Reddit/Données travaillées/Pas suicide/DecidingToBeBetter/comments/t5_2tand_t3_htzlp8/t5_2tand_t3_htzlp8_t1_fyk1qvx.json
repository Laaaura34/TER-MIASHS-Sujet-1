Read read read other people's posts and triumphs and struggles. Don't skip it because it's not entertaining Or you don't think it's efficiently helpful to you personally or because there's something more fun you'd rather do. Become inspired. Post here about specific problems you're facing at the moment.\n\nOne of the most helpful things you can do is break your tasks into smaller chunks. \"I want to do better at school\" might mean \"I need to make myself focus and manage my time better\", but that needs to be broken down, into tiny actionable steps. Identify what you need to improve, think on what causes issues there, break those issues down and try a few ways to fix it until you have it under control. Then, onto the next issue to correct\n\nSee you around here I hope", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/htzlp8/18_years_old_never_developed_life_skills_where_do/fyk1qvx/"}
