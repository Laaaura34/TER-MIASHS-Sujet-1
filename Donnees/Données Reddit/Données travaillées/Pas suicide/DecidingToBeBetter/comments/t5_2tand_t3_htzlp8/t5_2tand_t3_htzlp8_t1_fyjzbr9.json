I belive the most important thing is to keep in mind your own potential, and be aware of the greater things you want to achive. It will help you to overcome the difficult things once they arrive. \n\nOtherwise, i think that starting with small things and evolving them slowly is an easy task, fe: if you want to do things that aren't immediately pleasureable, such as cleaning the entire house, begin with your own bedroom. Accomplishing small tasks will show you the joy that only hard work gives, plus you will avoid feeling overwhelmed by complex orders, and get frustrated quickly.
