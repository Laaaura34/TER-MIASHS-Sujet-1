It all comes down to willpower in the end, I also feel alone a lot of the time, and I've grown to accept it. Not watching porn makes me feel more comfortable in general, whereas watching it instills shame into me wherever I go. All I can suggest is to weigh the pros and cons, and visit NoFap while you're at it; they have a great community and can give you more solid advice than I can. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m5g9ky/today_marks_one_month_without_nicotine_or_weed/gr2a8uz/"}
