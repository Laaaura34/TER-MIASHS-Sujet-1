Sorry about that, it was definitely a problem. The questionnaire has been now updated. Some questions in section 5 have now been disabled for females (and our scoring logic for females updated accordingly). Also the wording of a few other questions has been updated to be suitable for females too. \n\nOur intention is not to be for males only. We are interested to hear if you have any ideas how to continue make it better for females.
