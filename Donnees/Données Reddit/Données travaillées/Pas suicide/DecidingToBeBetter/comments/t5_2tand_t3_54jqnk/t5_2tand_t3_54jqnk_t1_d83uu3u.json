The most unsuitable questions for females are now fixed. We are also open to other ideas how to make our scale better for females.\n\nThe depression items in our test use PHQ-9 depression scale questions. We don't use Beck's BDI-II. In addition to it's reliability, one reason for us using PHQ-9 is that its usage is not restricted (unlike BDI-II that is heavily copyrighted and requires even fee for using it).\n\n\"The copyright for the PHQ-9 was formerly held with Pfizer, who provided the educational grant for Drs Spitzer, Williams and Kroenke who originally designed it. This is no longer the case and no permission is required to reproduce, translate, display or distribute the PHQ-9.\" source: http://patient.info/doctor/patient-health-questionnaire-phq-9 \n\nSome other questions/sections are created completely by us and will likely get better and more accurate over time. We are open to new  question/section etc ideas as well.\n\nThanks for pointing out that bad \"wording\" in some cases within the result report (and potentially the questionnaire). We'll improve it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/54jqnk/with_this_inventory_you_can_test_your_mental_and/d83uu3u/"}
