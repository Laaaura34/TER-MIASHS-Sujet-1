This shows a major gender bias and kinda discredits the survey as a whole from me. If they forgot my genitals/that people with other genitals still masturbate, I'm not likely to care about or trust their opinion on any health related issue.\n\n* I feel like there's nothing accounting for just not having a real-life sexual partner or potential partner in in the last 30 days. This led to a higher porn/masturbation score and a higher sexual health score (which, from what I can make of the labels, I got because of a 'low libido')\n\n* On the results page, there was a bunch of jumbled text that appeared to be from the survey's code itself.
