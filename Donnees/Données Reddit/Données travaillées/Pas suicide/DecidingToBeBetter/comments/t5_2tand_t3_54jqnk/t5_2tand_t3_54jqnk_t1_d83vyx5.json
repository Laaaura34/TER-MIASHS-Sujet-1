I'll adress each of your 4 points:\n\n1: Our intention with the bodyweight question (including answer choice \"Underweight or anorectic\" was to merely address the actual bodyweight regardless of whether or not it's a result of anorexia nervosa/EDNOS/suppressed appetite. However, we might have misused the word 'anorectic' since our intention was to merely describe someone who is very thin. Perhaps changing that answer choice from \"Underweight or anorectic\" to \"Underweight\" would make it better. Also your comment made us consider later adding actual eating disorder questions into the questionnaire. What do you think? \n\n2: Yes there definitely was a gender bias in that first online version of the questionnaire. We have now updated several questions in the Sexual Health and Porn sections to make the questionnaire more suitable for females (some changes are only visible after you select \"gender=female\"). There are not anymore questions that require females to have a penis to answer. We would also like to hear other suggestions how to make the questionnaire better for females.\n\n3: Hmm do you mean that not recently having a partner may (temporarily) lead into more porn usage and masturbation and therefore higher Sexual health problems score? Do you have any suggestions how to solve this problem?\n\n4: Oh sorry about that and good to know. In our testing we didn't see such text anymore but apparently some slipped in at least in some answering scenarios. We'll try to work on that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/54jqnk/with_this_inventory_you_can_test_your_mental_and/d83vyx5/"}
