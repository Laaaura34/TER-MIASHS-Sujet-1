Both my grandfathers had type 2 diabetes.  My parents smoked.  My dad also drank heavily (a functioning alcoholic), had heart disease, and died of lung cancer.  My mother had multiple sclerosis.  My siblings and I grew up eating the crappy standard American diet.\n\nMy oldest brother was the family hippie and was very into healthy diet and lifestyle. \n\nI followed in his footsteps and embraced eating healthy food and exercising.  I\u2019ve done this consistently for over 40 years. \n\nMy other 2 siblings (a sister and another brother)have not.\n\nThey are both overweight (my sister is obese), and my other brother also has Type 2 diabetes with a lot of complications.\n\nCorrelation is not causation, and my experience is anecdotal.  But I am convinced that my diet and lifestyle have played a major role in saving me from the health problems that my siblings have.\n\nOver time, consistency in diet and exercise has paid huge benefits for me.  It can for you too.  \n\nYou are starting on a journey to much better health.  Congratulations to you  for realizing that.  :-)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nzmzyr/gonna_eat_healthier_not_to_lose_weight_but_to/h1rdxc2/"}
