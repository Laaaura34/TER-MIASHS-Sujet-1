I still eat white rice as a side for meals but not every day and not a lot, I eat it because it's an affordable side my parent gets.\n\nAnd like I said in the post i give myself one day a week to eat food that isn't nutritious like salty snacks and sweets and the sort.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nzmzyr/gonna_eat_healthier_not_to_lose_weight_but_to/h1s1bvl/"}
