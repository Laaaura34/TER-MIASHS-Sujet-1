When We had our first kid I came up with a mantra (call and response) that I\u2019ve said with my kids (nearly) every day since. Every day. \n\nI came up with it for a variety of reasons I wanted to make sure my kids saw that work isn\u2019t inherently a chore, but something to be pumped to get to do.  Because I wanted to remind everyone (including me) that the emotion you bring plays a role in how you engage with everything/everyone. And it just sounds cool. \n\nI had a really bad string of days at work and was really struggling one morning a couple of months ago. My year old looked at me and shouted the question I always ask them. I answered with t\n\u201cTheir\u201d Line. He knew I needed the pep talk I try and give them every day. That was the best affirmation  ever.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bt3ay3/something_ive_noticed_that_has_truly_increased/eovg8u4/"}
