You have lost so much but you are still you. It takes a while to process all that loss. Be kind to yourself if you can't reach your \"scheduled habits\". Tomorrow is another day. \n\nI like to use lists, not to schedule so much as to remind myself what needs to be done and then I let myself pick and choose what I can handle on any given day. I am retired and when I first retired it was difficult to \"schedule\" my time because it was always done pretty much for me. When working,  your breaks, your lunch, your meetings, your workload they all create an informal schedule that you adapt to over time.  What really helped me during the pandemic was volunteering. It was only 1 or 2 days a week and only for a couple of hours, but it got me out, around people and it was a consistent commitment that I enjoyed! Things are opening up here in the US and hopefully elsewhere. Please consider volunteering if you can.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mwcqd3/i_will_start_getting_better_now_this_is_how_i/gvhhdh4/"}
