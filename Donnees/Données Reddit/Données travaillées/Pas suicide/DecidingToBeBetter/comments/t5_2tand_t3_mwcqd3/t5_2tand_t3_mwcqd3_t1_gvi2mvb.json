And yes it was a bad time, and I will take my time for it and be kind for myself! Getting up and moving again is also good for me and if I balance it with time for myself - time to relax and recharge - then I think I can start flourishing again. Or, rather, to flourish for the first time in my life.\n\nWill look into volunteering, great to read that it helped you out so much! :)\n\nI have done my hours today. I did some chores in the home. I cooked an egg and an avocado. I ran in the forest, meditated there while watching the stars and the moon. I ran back home. I made a fire and read a book about stoicism at the fire and meditated there. Two hours of productive time total.\n\nYou see, my definition of \"productive time\" is rather broad. But it's anything that moves me forward in an area that I have not taken care of: not only the professional, but also the financial, physical, emotional, mental and material/organizational sides of my life. So, I count making and eating a healthy meal as productive time, as well as writing about traumatic events, as well as learning new skills for work or doing actual work.\n\nNow, it's time to sleep. Good night!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mwcqd3/i_will_start_getting_better_now_this_is_how_i/gvi2mvb/"}
