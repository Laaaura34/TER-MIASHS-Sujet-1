I have a lot of shame for what happened when I was 15.\n\nIm 13 years later now. Sometimes it still feels like yesterday.\n\nI try not to judge my former self. I try to be nice to myself and see it as bad coping habits due to mental distress. I wasnt living, I was surviving.\nI thank my former self for doing what it had to do to survive and remind myself Im not the same person anymore. Surviver me did what it had to do to cope with what was going on.\n\nI dont know what it is exactly what youre feeling guilty over. But at 14-15, you were so young. I doubt it was fully your fault these things happened. There must be a deeper cause.\n\nInner child work really helped me. Maybe this could help you too.\n\nGoodluck, sending strength!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pij8qp/how_do_i_deal_with_the_guilt/hbq3c2g/"}
