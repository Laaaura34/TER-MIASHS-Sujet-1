It has its downsides, but i now have more personalized interactions. If someone wants to invite me to a party or share a photo, they text me individually.  I recently reconnected with my childhood best friend for this reason. She had a baby and started texting me pictures. We started talking about other things and catching up, now we talk daily. This never wouldve happened if i was just liking photos on social media. \n\nI only use reddit now. Mostly for asking for help, helping, or showing others with similar interests things i like (r/succulents, r/houseplants, etc), looking at cat, dog, and cute animal videos (duh), and following other subreddits on the garbage reality tv shows i watch (r/bigbrother, r/bravorealhousewives). \n\nI started to feel like social media was making me see some friends as needy, attention seekers... getting just the right pose for pictures, with the right caption, at \u201chip\u201d places. Or worse, when people are selling stuff via social media, it really made me want to avoid them in real life - since generally these types of things reek of pyramid schemes.\n\nIf i make a new friend, they have to get to know me for me rather than lurking around my facebook or instagram and forming an opinion based on my posts and who my friends are. \n\nGood on you for doing what feels right for you!
