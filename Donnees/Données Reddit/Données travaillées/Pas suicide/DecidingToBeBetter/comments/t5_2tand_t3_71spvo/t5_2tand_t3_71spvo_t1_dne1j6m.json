Now I wouldn't have too much of a problem if it was JUST for talking with people, but that's not the case at all. Excuse my ignorance if I state something incorrect, but I feel that social media is mainly used just to boost your own ego and for advertisers to make money. It's even worse when they design the apps/sites to be so addictive, that you just spend hours and hours going down useless rabbit hole after useless rabbit hole, when you could be getting work done. It's absolutely infuriating to me whenever I spend more than 15 minutes a day just staring at useless stimulation. I just feel like a slave to my phone. \n\nI barely ever even post, but like I said, I feel the need to keep these shitty apps on my phone because all of my friends use them as well. I wonder if I can convince them to just text me whenever they want to talk, but I don't want to come off as a hard-ass when I ask them.
