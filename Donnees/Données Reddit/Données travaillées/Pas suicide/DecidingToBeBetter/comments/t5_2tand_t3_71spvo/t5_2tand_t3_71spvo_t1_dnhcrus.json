I guess I would say maybe plan your posts while offline - having a picture or idea what you want to convey, then get online and make it happen. Once you've made a post, you're done and can get on with your day. Maybe ritualize it - like during lunch hour you post something - package it in a specific time slot with a specific purpose, so it's less about browsing and comparing and more about goal / mission based. There can be a lot of pride in sharing work. I make little silly montage videos of my year and travel and such and I share them and get joy out of people commenting and such - nothing wrong with that, but I try to post with purpose.
