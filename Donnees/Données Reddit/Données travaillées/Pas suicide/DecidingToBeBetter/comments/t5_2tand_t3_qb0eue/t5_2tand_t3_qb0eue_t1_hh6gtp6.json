If you don't then quitting to go to school is a shitty idea.  If you do know then it would mean researching whether you actually need a degree.  For example, you don't really need a degree to do most things in IT or graphics/video design.  You just need to be able to show you can do the work which means you could do an online tradeschool or something part time while keeping your job and it would be a fraction of the cost.\n\nIf you do need to go to college then I would try to do a cost benefit analysis.  Basically how much money would college cost in total(counting student loan interest), how much money you would lose by not working and how much you think you would make at your new career.  Compare that to if you just kept working and you have some hard numbers to think on.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qb0eue/is_quitting_my_job_to_attend_school_a_good_idea/hh6gtp6/"}
