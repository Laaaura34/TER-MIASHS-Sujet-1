Also, the other career that i'm studying is near of where i'm living right now, and doesn't help if i'm wanting to be on a healthier town / city.\n\nTherefore, being not too commited on it makes me question if i really like it, and while i love it there's the spiral of feeling that one doesn't like it although it's not really certain i think.\n\nEdit: When i refer of being not really commited it's mostly procrastination, but i think you understood", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m0yhhe/problems_with_selfworth_and_selfsteem_want_to/gqbmtl6/"}
