Caffeine is ridiculously hard for me and nicotine is even worse. If they weren\u2019t cheap and legal there would be so much crime for them it\u2019s crazy. For me, matcha is a good way to ease out of caffeine. Get it in bulk on amazon. You\u2019ll at least still be able to function. I\u2019ve quit cigarettes so many times. Cold turkey twice, once for three years. I smoked one, got sick, bought a pack the very next day. Now if I wind up smoking I just get patches. Get all the other nicotine out of your house, get the smell out, same with your car. Destroy any cigs you have before you go to bed, wash all the smell off of you. Wake up and put a patch on right away. Use kt tape over it so it won\u2019t come off no matter what. Then if you even see somebody smoking walk the other way. I won\u2019t even  look at you or acknowledge someone with a cigarette. It gets easy over time, and at first you won\u2019t know what to do with yourself. You\u2019ll have a lot of energy right away. Definitely start a physical hobby, like hiking.  I recommend getting the caffeine under control first. Take the money you were spending and invest it in the s&p500 through an IRA. You\u2019re going to be rich now, lol.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q40wr2/severe_cocaine_addiction/hfyz4v3/"}
