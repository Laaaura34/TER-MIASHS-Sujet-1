IMO, drug abuse/addiction is a response to untreated trauma, mental illness and/or grief. Please look into therapy. Many will recommend AA/NA/12 step groups, and while those groups have helped many, SMART Recovery is my preferred recovery community to recommend to people (many in my family of origin struggle with addiction). It's secular and skill-based. \n\nPlease take care of yourself. I'm rooting for you!
