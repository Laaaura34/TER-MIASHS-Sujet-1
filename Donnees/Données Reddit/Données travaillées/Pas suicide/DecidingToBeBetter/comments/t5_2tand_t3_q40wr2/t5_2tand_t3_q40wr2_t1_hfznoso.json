While all your \u201ceasy comedown\u201d jargon may be useful in some scenarios it\u2019s not what this person needs right now. Your original reply is honestly pretty dismissive and a bit rude. You\u2019re not accounting for the possibility that this person may be self medicating to deal with past trauma or that they may just be genetically wired to be more susceptible to raging addictive qualities. If you\u2019ve always been able to lightly dabble with these substances without falling off the deep end then maybe you\u2019re not as informed and smart as you think you are when it comes to addiction. Whether you realize it or not your reply really attempts to invalidate what this person is going through in several different ways and is barely helpful at best and very rude and damaging at worst. This kind of reply is much more suited to somewhere like r/drugs. This person needs help and compassion. Not some know it all telling them they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. People have all kinds of different experiences with all kinds of different substances. What you experience or read about may not be the same as what others experience.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q40wr2/severe_cocaine_addiction/hfznoso/"}
