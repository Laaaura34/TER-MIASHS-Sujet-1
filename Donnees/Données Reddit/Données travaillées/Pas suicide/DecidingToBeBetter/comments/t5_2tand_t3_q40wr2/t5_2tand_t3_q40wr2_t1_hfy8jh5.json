It is famously used in the Sinclair Method for alcohol but there seems to be some cross-over to use of certain addictive drugs (like stimulants, alcohol, depressants).\n\nAlso some indication that baclofen may be of some use due to its effect on certain receptors (GABA-B) to the effect that there\u2019s a downstream regulating effect on the dopamine release from use of stimulants in particular. \n\nAll this is to say, naltrexone may be able to train you to stop associating pleasure with cocaine and baclofen may help to block the dopamine release you otherwise experience from it while helping to relieve anxiety and insomnia (which are part of its regular therapeutic effects that are well-documented).\n\nNone of this is medical advice but this sounds pretty serious and you need every option available to you.\n\nYou should also delete your dealer\u2019s number and cut off all your sources. I always hated the toilet flush analogy but sometimes its either the drugs or everything else (relationships, job, money, housing, life).\n\nThese other options might be helpful to you but you should seek support in all the ways and means you can find it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q40wr2/severe_cocaine_addiction/hfy8jh5/"}
