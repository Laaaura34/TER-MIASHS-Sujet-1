I did coke every day for a year. One of the last times I did an ounce of good shit in three days by myself. I\u2019m not recommending that you do it like I did, but I just went to my  mom\u2019s house and isolated myself because I didn\u2019t have any friends at the time that wouldn\u2019t lead me right back to where I was and I didn\u2019t want to talk or think about it. I went for a walk every day. I was really bored. I had to change jobs because those dudes were all bad too. Left my gf. I think the turning point for me was that last big binge, and I saw disgust in the face of the person who got me into it. Pretty sure I was having dangerous cardiac events throughout the whole thing. There\u2019s more that I don\u2019t talk about, but it\u2019s fair to say that when you can\u2019t control your access and you can plainly see that you\u2019re going to die, it\u2019s not a stretch to nuke your whole life to get better. And I did. It\u2019s about eight years later. Work is good, family is good. Home is good. I have three boats,  so maybe I traded addictions but I\u2019m cool with it. Nobody is disgusted by my boat habit. I look better than I did eight/ten years ago. I feel better. You will too. Again, not saying that isolating yourself is the right thing for you, but it did work for me. From my perspective, whatever it takes is good enough!
