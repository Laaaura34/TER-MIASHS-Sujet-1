While you're saving, I'm spending but I'm also learning. Instead of just saving that money, maybe take a smaller percentage of that savings and dedicate it to a project. Learn something in and out, truly know it not just understand it. Buy something that's way over your head in complexity but something that you've truly wanted to know inside and out,  buy it busted. Spend your free time researching, testing, and fixing it; once it's working right, modify it and make exactly what you'd want if you were going to buy it from a production run.  \n\n\nI'm proud of you brother/sister, keep up the killer effort.  \n\n\nPeace!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cgbirz/i_started_saving_100week_every_week_since_june/eugov0o/"}
