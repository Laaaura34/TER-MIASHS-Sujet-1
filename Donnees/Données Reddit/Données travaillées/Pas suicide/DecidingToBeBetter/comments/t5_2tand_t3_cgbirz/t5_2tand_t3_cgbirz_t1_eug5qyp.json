With the money, I'd suggest going one step further to safeguard against spending it, so you're less likely to go \"oh I have $5,000 I could afford X\" (x being something like a new computer for $1500). Create a separate savings account (can be at your bank, can be an online high yield savings account) and name that account \"Emergency Fund.\" Once you have 3-6 months of expenses saved uo you can go ahead and put that money in a different savings account and even save for specific goals, like a fancy vacation or a house down payment or a new gaming console. But until that point, dedicate your savings to emergency use only.\n\nAn emergency fund can vastly improve your life and make you better able to handle a crisis. Lost your job? You can breathe easy while looking for a new one because you know you can pay your rent/utilities and buy food for a few months. A relative passed away halfway across the country? Buying a plane ticket for two days from now is no sweat. Your car's entire transmission needs replacing? You've got the cash on hand to cover it. Being financially equiped to handle problems will make you more emotionally equiped to deal with them too because the extra money stress will be gone.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cgbirz/i_started_saving_100week_every_week_since_june/eug5qyp/"}
