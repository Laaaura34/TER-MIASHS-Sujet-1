Keep it up! You deserve happiness too.\n\nIt's been 10 years for me. I just keep relapsing because I always stop the gym. I started again in November. And this time, im not gonna stop until I die or get where I want to be. \n\nExcercise is the only thing that helps. Drugs dont even work anymore for me lol.\n\nAnyways just wanted to show my support. Remember, the bad thoughts, and what ever the ego tells you, they are all lies! Dont believe them. Just keep doing the work. You get what you put into this life. You got this!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ltxape/i_fought_my_depression_anxiety_and_tumor_that_i/gp425ap/"}
