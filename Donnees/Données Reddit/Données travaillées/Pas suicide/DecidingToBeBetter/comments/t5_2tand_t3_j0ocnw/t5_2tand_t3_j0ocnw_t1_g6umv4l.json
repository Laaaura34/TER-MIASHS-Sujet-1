I recently got out of a five and a half year relationship. It's a constant struggle for me to remind myself not to succumb to the urges to be a fucking bum. I'm only like 6 weeks removed, if that. which for me is not near long enough to move on. But thank you for sharing your story, it reminds me to try to constantly be better even when I don't feel like I have it in me. It doesn't feel good to say that I may stand to benefit from your struggle, because I wish that you didn't have to struggle. But the subtle reminder may turn out to be very helpful in the long run, so yeah thanks again man. I look forward to your update, best of luck to you my friend \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffc", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j0ocnw/this_story_may_give_you_a_lesson/g6umv4l/"}
