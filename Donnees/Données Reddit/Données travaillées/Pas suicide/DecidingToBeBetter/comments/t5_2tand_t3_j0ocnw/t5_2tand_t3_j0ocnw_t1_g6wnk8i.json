I'm literally crying right now because I just had a break up(with my bestfriend turned into girlfriend) recently and I think I've been gaslighted by her. I feel shit and I'm kinda starting bad habits. I want to move on as soon as possible but there are days wasted that I spent just thinking about her. I'll also try to work and improve myself. I know that it won't be easy and there will be bad days, but I know that it will be worth it. If ever that I spiralled going into bad habits, I'll remember you who's working hard to improve your well-being and is moving forward with his life. I look forward to your progress in 6 months.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j0ocnw/this_story_may_give_you_a_lesson/g6wnk8i/"}
