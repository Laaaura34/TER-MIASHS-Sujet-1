They say \"time heals all\" but what really heals is the **effort** you put into healing and growing!\n\nDon't blame yourself for the choices you made - you did the best you knew how even though it did not give you what you hoped for. Don't get down on and shame yourself for those actions - just focus on doing better and growing from where you were. YOU'VE GOT THIS - BELIEVE IN YOURSELF!!\n\nI wish you all the best of luck! <3 <3 <3\n\nAlso, there's this cool RemindMe! bot here on reddit that can send you a reminder to come back later :) Just type \"RemindMe! 6 months\" in a comment (and maybe even in a post) and it will do it.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot\\_info\\_v21/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/j0ocnw/this_story_may_give_you_a_lesson/g6w09gt/"}
