I grew up in the 90s and shit was prosperous and the future was bright.  I was 19 and suffering from my first round of mental illness when 9/11 happened and things changed dramatically.  I sewed my wild oats in my 20s, all the while holding on to this idea I was going to get serious and get rich one day.  2008 crisis happens, my business takes a turn, I have to start over.  More mental illness, more reality.  COVID hit and my business takes a turn, I have to start over.  I don't know exactly when my dreams became more realistic.  I'm 38 now and basically I hope to be able to live comfortably, realize I'm lucky to own a house and have a spouse, probably won't retire but who cares, the climate will be shot by then and things will be very different for everyone.  This is as good as it gets.  Find ways to enjoy it.  Life is so short, most of us won't be rich and famous, and that's totally livable in the end.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nv7r3j/dont_want_to_be_rich_and_famous_anymore/h11s9xi/"}
