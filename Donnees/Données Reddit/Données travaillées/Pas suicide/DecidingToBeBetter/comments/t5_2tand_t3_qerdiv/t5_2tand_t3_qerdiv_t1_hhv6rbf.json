At the time, it was very Southern, Christian, Housewife (and I am none of those things), but I stuck with it, and it was transformative. There are parts of it I modified to fit my situation - I will never be one to wear shoes in my home, and I don't have to prepare for Christmas, because it's not my holiday. That's OK. What worked was, just the idea that I could start with wherever I was. The idea that if all I could get done that day was cleaning the sink - well, at least the dishes were done and the sink was clean, and that was better than nothing. That just 15 minutes was better than 0 minutes - because the 4 hours that you spent (and I used to spend) is a lot of time, and it gets daunting. Even now, I'll do 45 on, 15 minutes off, 45 on, 15 off - and those 15 minutes on a timer, because it's too easy for 15 to become an hour on line - but not working straight through (as you found in tidying your room) really helps.\n\nSo take a look at it. Ignore the stuff she sells, and don't use the stuff that doesn't work for you. But you might want to give it a try. It really helped me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qerdiv/finally_tidied_my_room/hhv6rbf/"}
