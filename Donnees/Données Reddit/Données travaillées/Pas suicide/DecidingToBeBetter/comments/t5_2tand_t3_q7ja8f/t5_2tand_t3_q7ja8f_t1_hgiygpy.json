You would need to find a gym that feels right for you.\n\nI would advise you against buying a punching bag and doing boxing by yourself initially, since you would need a coach to help you with the technique and it might be dangerous to do it by yourself (I am doing Thai boxing myself).\n\nThere is a rule of thumb that loosing weight is 30 percent exercise, 70 percent diet. If you want to loose weight, I would start with food (if possible, with the help of nutritionists/ friend, etc. Changing eating habits is really difficult and it's better to start doing it right from the beginning, so you would avoid the unnecessary struggle as much a possible) \nIf you want to do it just got fun and not for loosing weight, then just give it a go! I am quite sure you will like it. I am personally in love with boxing. And, believe me, everyone has their own insecurities. That's why people do it!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q7ja8f/i_want_to_learn_all_these_different_things/hgiygpy/"}
