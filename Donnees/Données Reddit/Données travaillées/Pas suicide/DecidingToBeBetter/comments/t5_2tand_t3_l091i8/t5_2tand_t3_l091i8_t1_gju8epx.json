I haven't held a job for almost 10 years. I have no interest in retail or any kind of factory work. A degree in something I enjoy is my only option for a happy life, which is exactly what I'm striving for. \n\nThank you so much for your support !

Just typing that gave me butterflies. \n\n\ud83d\udc95", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l091i8/i_applied_for_college_today/gju8epx/"}
