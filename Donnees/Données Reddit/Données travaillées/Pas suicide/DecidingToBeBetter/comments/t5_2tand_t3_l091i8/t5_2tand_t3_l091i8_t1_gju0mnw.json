Sometimes wait until you're a little bit older and more mature leads to making better decisions.\n\nWe moved across the country when I was just out of high school. I tried college a couple of times and didn't have any luck. \n\nI went back to college at age 33 and graduated just before my 36th birthday. I found that I was much more motivated because I was paying for it and I was the one who decided I wanted to be there, not my parents, not society, not some unwritten rule that says, \"this is what you should do with your life.\"\n\nMy barometer is that if you're going to b**** about Mondays and going to work, it's time to either find another job or figure out what you need to do to find a job you love.\n\nI don't remember who said it, but if you love what you do you'll never work a day in your life.\n\nBest of luck in your nursing career. You're going to be amazing!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l091i8/i_applied_for_college_today/gju0mnw/"}
