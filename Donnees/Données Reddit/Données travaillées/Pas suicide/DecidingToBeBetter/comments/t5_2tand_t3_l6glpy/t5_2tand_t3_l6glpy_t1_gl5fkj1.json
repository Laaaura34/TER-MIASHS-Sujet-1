Second hand smoke is annoying!\n\nI notice some people smoke weed reek of the smell everywhere they go. I\u2019ve seen brilliant people once they get high turn into unhinge reckless people.\n\nI\u2019m rooting for you to change your life! Everyone has an addiction to something, the challenging part is converting it to something that\u2019s productive without negative side effects.\n\nI hope you can make new friends who won\u2019t guilt trip you into bad habits. I hope you can fight your depression & achieve the things you dream of your already making the right steps by quitting and deciding to become a better person!\n\nYou got this!!!\n\nWhen the urge happens again try to find ways to fight. It maybe go out somewhere people isn\u2019t doing drugs. I hope you can make new friends that support better hobbies or have the strength to fight escaping. \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l6glpy/i_want_to_quit_smoking_weed/gl5fkj1/"}
