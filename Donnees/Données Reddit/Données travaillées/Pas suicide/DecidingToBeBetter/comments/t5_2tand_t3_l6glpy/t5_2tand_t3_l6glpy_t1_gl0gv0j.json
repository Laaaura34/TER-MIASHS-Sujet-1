I used to smoke daily, quit november 4th last year and been going strong since. The only way to quit is to go cold turkey; \u201cslowly waning off of it\u201d is almost impossible unless you have extreme self control (if you did you probably wouldn\u2019t have been mentally dependent anyways) Throw away your current stash, just limit exposure. The first week or two is going to make you feel like absolute shit and depressed, but once that passes, you will have time (life doesn\u2019t zoom by anymore) to process yourself and really work towards a more productive and self-sustaining self. You can always revisit later when you grow the self-control anyways. Until then, try quitting and be more productive and strive for self-growth. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l6glpy/i_want_to_quit_smoking_weed/gl0gv0j/"}
