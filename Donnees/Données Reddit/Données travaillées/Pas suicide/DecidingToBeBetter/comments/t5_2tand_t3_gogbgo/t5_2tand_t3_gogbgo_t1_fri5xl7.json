I decided that I will start working on myself during this period of not having to stress about work. I gave up soda mid-March, April, I committed to reading a few pages of a book daily. I\u2019ve adding moving my body daily in May which means I wake up and go for a walk in my neighborhood every weekday. I have a goal for June but I had all these things swirling in my head for years and I just started implementing them. I\u2019m 3 weeks into walking daily and now my body is beginning to crave it. I could barely walk .2 miles when I started 3 weeks ago. Now I\u2019m up to .7. The only goal I have in this is if it is a weekday, I have to take a walk. It\u2019s about 20 minutes of my morning. Then I shower, take a drive and sit in the park in my car and listen to an audiobook for an hour. This has become my new routine.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gogbgo/i_went_from_not_being_able_to_walk_1_mile/fri5xl7/"}
