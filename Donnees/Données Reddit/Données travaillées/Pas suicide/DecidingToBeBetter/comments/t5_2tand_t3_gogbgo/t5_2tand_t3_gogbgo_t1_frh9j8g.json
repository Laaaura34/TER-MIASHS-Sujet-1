My first day was 17 minutes, second was 16 minutes and on the third day I decided to toss in just a little bit of jogging here and there. Wasn\u2019t anything special, just until I got tired. As I ran, I set milestones so that the next day I could run farther than that milestone. I only run in the first mile for now, until I can run the entire mile. Now I added a second mile where I just turn back and walk quickly the second mile. I add just a little more every day. Although, I may just walk today since my legs are pretty sore from the new regimen.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gogbgo/i_went_from_not_being_able_to_walk_1_mile/frh9j8g/"}
