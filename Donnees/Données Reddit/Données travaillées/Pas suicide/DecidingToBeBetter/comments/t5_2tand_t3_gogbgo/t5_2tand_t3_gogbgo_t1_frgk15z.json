I've been struggling the past year to do better for myself (some type of physical activity). I use to be at consistent 175lb and now at 230lb. I llayed all kinds of sports growing up,, loved stretching and working out, and specifically train for jumping. I believe its more due to my BP med I have to take. Which I developed at the 175lb weight. I'm the first in my family to have a BP issue. And my family doesn't make me feel better that I have to take them b/c I'm between 30-35 yrs old. \nI've tried changing meds but the one that works for me is the one that attributes to the weight. Legs and breathing get fatigued on a flight of stairs to get to my apartment.\nDefinitely appreciate your post about how you started walking and made it to running a mile. Even with being quarantined I haven't even helped myself. If I didn't have 2 dogs, then I'd hardly make it out of the house.\n\nI'm going to spend some time today creating a starting point with small goals. Smaller goals that are achievable has always helped me feel more successful that helps build momentum. Plus I'm sure my dogs will alpreciate more walks as well \ud83d\ude01", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gogbgo/i_went_from_not_being_able_to_walk_1_mile/frgk15z/"}
