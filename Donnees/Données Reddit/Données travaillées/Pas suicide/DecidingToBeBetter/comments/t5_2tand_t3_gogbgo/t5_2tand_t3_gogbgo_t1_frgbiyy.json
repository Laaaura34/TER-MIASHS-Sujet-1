Off and on at first, then one day I promised myself no matter what, M-F I would walk. So many times I did not feel like it, but as they say to be successful you have to do it no matter how you feel. \n\nFor the last two weeks straight, I have been walking my 2 miles, doing either strength or HIIT routine, and a yoga video. Thank god for YouTube. \n\nYesterday when I was walking I felt like I was moving so slow I started running. I surprised myself! \n\nOff to do my morning walk :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gogbgo/i_went_from_not_being_able_to_walk_1_mile/frgbiyy/"}
