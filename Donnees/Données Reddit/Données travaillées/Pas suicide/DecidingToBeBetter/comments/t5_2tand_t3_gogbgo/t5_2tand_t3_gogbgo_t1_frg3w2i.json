My biggest issue was that I\u2019d start for a few weeks, have an \u201coff day\u201d and not do [healthy eating, exercise, meditating, etc], and then, almost subconsciously, beat myself up and consider it failure. The last few months, as we all had to start sheltering in place, I had to change my mindset to deal with the resulting spike in my anxiety. Instead of focusing of \u201cgoals\u201d and failures to meet them, I instead started to tell myself \u201cI am doing the best I can to take care of myself in this moment.\u201d \n\nNow, even if I do miss something (example: didn\u2019t do my usual yoga last night so I could stay up and finish a movie with my sweetheart) I don\u2019t beat myself up about it. When I go to bed I say to myself \u201cI took care of myself the best I could today;\u201d and when I wake up in the morning I say \u201cI am going to take care of myself the best I can.\u201d \n\nThis week I ran 2 miles every morning. I have been eating good, healthy, meals on a regular basis. I feel calm and well adjusted, even though the world is a mess, because I know that I am doing the best I can every day, and that\u2019s enough!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gogbgo/i_went_from_not_being_able_to_walk_1_mile/frg3w2i/"}
