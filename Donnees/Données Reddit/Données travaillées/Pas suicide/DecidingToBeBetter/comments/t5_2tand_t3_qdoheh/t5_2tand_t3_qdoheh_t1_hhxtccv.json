That saves a step and good people will be honest in return, then you meet in the middle. Undesirable people will try to take advantage and you can just walk away because you know what your needs are and you were up front about them.\n\nI think a \"Win\" attitude is kind of short sighted because you won't learn as much about other people's needs and you'll close doors for yourself unintentionally. By learning other people's needs and being honest about your own it will filter out the bad folks and put you on good terms with the good ones. There are always bad folks out there, sure. But do you want to haggle with them all day or save yourself time to move on and find someone better?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdoheh/convince_me_that_winwin_attitude_is_actually/hhxtccv/"}
