I met people my age through my friends who live in Paris and that was fun.\n\nBut the new person I met that I felt most connected to on the trip was nice woman from Seattle who was in her 50s and recently divorced.  If I was older... haha\n\nIn any case, I met fun people on that trip who were single, who were in relationship and recently out of relationships and it was ALL fun.\n\nYou don't need it but good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o3hqxe/m55_heartbroken_and_alone_just_signed_up_for_a/h2ck9ly/"}
