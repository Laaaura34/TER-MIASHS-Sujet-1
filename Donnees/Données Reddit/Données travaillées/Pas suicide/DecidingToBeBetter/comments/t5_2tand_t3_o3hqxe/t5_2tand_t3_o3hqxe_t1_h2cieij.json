If there's a room full of couples and you're the only single person, affirm yourself that you belong there as much as they do. If you believe it to be awkward and act awkward, others will pick up on it. If you affirm yourself with confidence that you belong there, then you will fit in much easier. I'm sure this trip is far from free, so just keep in mind that you paid your money just like everyone else to be there so you ought to be able to enjoy it just like everyone else. You might even befriend another guy there (married or not), but having another \"bro\" goes a long way regardless of where you are (in my opinion). \n\nEnjoy your trip too. I'm envious of you being able to go away for two weeks.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o3hqxe/m55_heartbroken_and_alone_just_signed_up_for_a/h2cieij/"}
