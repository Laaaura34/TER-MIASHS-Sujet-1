It seems to me that the training of therapist is more standardized.  I see a therapist as a PA student because of feeling overly stressed and constant comparisons with others.  It helps me a lot.  Sometimes just having someone who can listen to me and validate my feeling is enough for me.  After the therapy session, I almost always feel better and more energized to do work.  I don\u2019t think I have mental illness or severe mental issues.  I have never tried Life Coach before.\nThe thing about therapist is that it may take several tries to know if a therapist is a good fit for you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ottimr/life_coach_vs_therapyst/h6yylds/"}
