I do wish you well but I will say that building a knew life all over is also exhausting. And the burnout doesn't go away, it will stay on your heels. Before you make any big decision, take some time off, get outside, get away from technology, meditate, travel somewhere new. Do anything you can to recharge your batteries and see where you are after that.\nThen if you still feel burnout after that, I would say go to a therapist or even just a doctor because you might have something physical going on. And if you feel great, see a life coach to get a sanity check and get some guidance about how to reach your goals.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ottimr/life_coach_vs_therapyst/h6yhtv1/"}
