I tried breathing techniques and they helped a bit. I'm considering seeking proffesional help when I get home, I'm a heavy overthinker so there is a lot on my mind that has been gathering throughout the years. It is strange just how anxiety slips in in times where I'm supposed to be happy and relaxed, considering where I am and the opportunities I have. But anyways, I will do my best to enjoy the rest of my time here and keep calm, thank you for the respond, it helped! \ud83d\ude04", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvivv2/i_feel_like_i_cant_calm_my_mind_down/heqvtn4/"}
