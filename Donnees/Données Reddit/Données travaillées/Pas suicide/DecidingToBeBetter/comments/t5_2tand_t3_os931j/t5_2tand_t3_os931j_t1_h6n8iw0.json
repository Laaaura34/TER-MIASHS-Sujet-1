It has no control over you unless you allow it. The future doesn't exist. The only thing that matters is this exact moment. When you are ruminating on the past try some grounding techniques such as counting objects and slow breathing to bring you back to the moment.\n\nPractice self love techniques. Picture your inner child at whatever age you want. Think of the mistakes that you made/make. Love yourself as you wanted your parents to love you. Tell yourself things like; it's okay, it's normal to make mistakes, you were just a kid how could you know any better, I love you, I'm here for you, I forgive you, I will always be here for you. \n\nAre you into books? The power of your subconscious mind by Joseph Murphy is a great start.\n\nAlso please make sure that you express your energy/feelings/emotions. Whenever we have unexpressed energy/emotions/feelings, all that built up pressure causes us inner turmoil. Cry it out. Lay in bed and allow yourself to release all of that. It's okay to feel.\n\nYou got this dude. You're here asking these questions, so you are on the right path! Good luck and sending good vibes your way!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/os931j/just_lost_19_years_old/h6n8iw0/"}
