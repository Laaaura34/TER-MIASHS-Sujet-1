Tomorrow is a brand new day. \n\nDon\u2019t stop trying, nobody gets to change their entire lives and reach the pinnacle of self-improvement overnight. Big changes take time and practice. Just keep trying, each day. Try not to focus on the negatives but look at the accomplishments you\u2019re making, no matter how small. Any time you find yourself pointing out a negative, match it with a positive. Restore the balance. \n\nThis is not the end of your story, just another step along the way. Each and every day provides you with another opportunity to improve, even if only in a tiny small way, and those add up over the course of your life. \n\nAnd, if it\u2019s any consolation, I don\u2019t think anyone is exactly who they\u2019d like to be at age 19. Just keep working towards your goals and enjoy the journey that is life!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/os931j/just_lost_19_years_old/h6qp3sl/"}
