Do what you can in a day. If getting out of bed is all you can do, that\u2019s enough.\u201d \n\nAfter that, something clicked, and now I don\u2019t beat myself up if I have a \u201clazy\u201d day. I wake up, if I feel like eating, I eat. If I feel like working out, I work out. If I feel like reading, I read. If I feel like doing nothing but laying on the couch and watching YouTube, I do just that. It has really helped, and I find myself doing more and actually wanting to do it rather than NEEDING to do it. \n\nJust start small. It\u2019s okay to not be able to do it all.\n\nThere is a YouTuber called Rowena Tsai and she\u2019s made a video on making a morning and night routine, and she broke them down into three categories - low energy, mid energy, and high energy. Maybe that will be helpful to you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/os931j/just_lost_19_years_old/h6oip6e/"}
