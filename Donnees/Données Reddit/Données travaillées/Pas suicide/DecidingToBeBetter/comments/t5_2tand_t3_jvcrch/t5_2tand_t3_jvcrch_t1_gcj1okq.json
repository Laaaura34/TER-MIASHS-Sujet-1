I remember clearly during one of our sessions, speaking about familiar negative thought patterns recurring. My therapist asked what I did when it happened. I told him that there was now a new voice in my head saying \u201cDon\u2019t go there. You know what\u2019s there already and how it ends\u201d. \n\nHe told me that it\u2019s an amazing sign when your old thought patterns become the trigger for becoming mindful and responding with new thought patterns instead. That realization made me much more forgiving of when old thought patterns and triggers have come up, and I now respond completely differently to the same stimuli :)\n\nOn the the other hand, these new thought patterns can feel like there is now a stranger living in your head because you respond so dramatically differently to new stimuli. That\u2019s alright too and that\u2019s a good thing. it\u2019s only natural, give it time and slowly, some of those \u201colder\u201d new thought patterns will become commonplace and familiar and comfortable. If you\u2019re ever feeling uncomfortable, ask yourself whether you would pick your old thought patterns and comfort, or your more new and meaningful and rewarding, but slightly uncomfortable and unfamiliar, thought patterns. The answer should motivate you to power on. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jvcrch/so_i_am_getting_better_but_now_im_dealing_with/gcj1okq/"}
