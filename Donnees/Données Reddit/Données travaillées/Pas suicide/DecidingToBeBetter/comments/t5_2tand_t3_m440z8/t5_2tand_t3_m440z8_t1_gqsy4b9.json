It\u2019s all about reframing it as a climb or the race, or what will drive you in that moment. It\u2019s what will create positive emotional momentum to progress forward. Sometimes it\u2019s a focus on a small step after another, sometimes it\u2019s the imagination of the mountaintop, sometimes it\u2019s a appreciation of how far you\u2019ve climbed, sometimes it\u2019s a focus on getting to that ledge that is 20ft up and celebrating it. I firmly believe you keep it up and you eventually will enjoy the struggle of the climb it\u2019s self and you accept the challenge of improvement.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m440z8/deciding_to_be_better_isnt_easy_but_its_sure_as/gqsy4b9/"}
