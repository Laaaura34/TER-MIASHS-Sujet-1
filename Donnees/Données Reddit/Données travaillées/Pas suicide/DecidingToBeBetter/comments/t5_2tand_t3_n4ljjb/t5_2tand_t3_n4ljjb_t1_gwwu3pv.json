I wish you the best and I'm so happy and proud that you've decided to give life another chance. You're a strong person and you deserve happiness and a plenty life.\n\nI would like to complement your \"it's never to late\" with another phrase that I love so much: hoy es siempre todav\u00eda. Which is another way to say that yes, it's never too late because as long that you're alive, today (whatever day it is) will always be another chance to try, to live. \n\nI send you a big hug and I hope you soon encounter the bright days that are ahead of you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n4ljjb/after_drowning_in_depression_ptsd_and_addiction/gwwu3pv/"}
