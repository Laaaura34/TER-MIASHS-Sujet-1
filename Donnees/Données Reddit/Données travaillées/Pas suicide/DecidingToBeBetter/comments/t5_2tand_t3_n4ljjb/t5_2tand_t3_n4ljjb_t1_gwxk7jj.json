I can't begin to imagine what you've been through -- I really wish I was more eloquent so I could express how much your story moved me. I just want you to know that I'm ridiculously proud of you. I understand your ambition and desperate hope for this part of your life to last-- but know that I'm just as proud of past you as I am of present you. It's absolutely amazing that you've started to feel a glimmer of hope but please don't discount the years that you've lived and tried. Sometimes it's the random, little, but intentional decisions that add up. Even if that means you're just going to wake up and keep the motor running that day. I hope you take it slow and gentle and resist the pressure to be harsh on yourself. Good luck-- I'm rooting for you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n4ljjb/after_drowning_in_depression_ptsd_and_addiction/gwxk7jj/"}
