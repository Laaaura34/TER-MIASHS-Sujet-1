May I ask - are you between 25 and 30?\n\n>This one random person is the reason that I was able to get clean. Because it actually worked. It took me a while to really process the fact that I was finally on the other side of that miserable addiction, and when I finally understood that it was over, the amount of hope that I experienced was overwhelming. I hadn't felt hope in years at that point. I had tried to get clean so many times over the years, had gone into violent withdrawals every time; I was hospitalized for severe dehydration after vomiting incessantly for several days in a row during withdrawal, even developed a hiatal hernia because the withdrawal made me throw up so forcefully and so frequently that part of my stomach eventually herniated up into my esophagus (I did literally puke my guts up) and it was fuckung agony, so I had consistently failed. I'd completely given up on ever getting better. And then there I was, on the other side of it. \n\nThank God for that person, but this also infuriates me. You could have kicked easily with just a few days worth of methadone.  No acute withdrawal symptoms and you can't get addicted to methadone in such a short time. \n\nThat should be common knowledge.
