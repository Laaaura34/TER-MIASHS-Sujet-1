Also needing a lot of extra sleep. It's how your brain heals. I wish more people knew how normal this is. I wish there was more awareness on how long it can take to heal. Having a small seizure can depress a person for a month. Having a concussion - a year. To say nothing of more severe injuries. \n\nTo that end, I wish more people understood how common drug use is during these moments of agony. Without the shame, people would get a lot more help a lot sooner. \n\nYou have had to do so much of this alone. I hope you recognize your own resilience.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n4ljjb/after_drowning_in_depression_ptsd_and_addiction/gwwl0gf/"}
