You are a living miracle to make it this far. You have so much strength in you and it\u2019s ok to believe that this is gonna stick. There may be bumps along the way cause it\u2019s never a straight line but you can do it. I don\u2019t know you but for some reason, I know that. \n\nI\u2019ve set fire to my life so many times by relapsing with drugs and alcohol that I started to believe I was just doomed. It felt like I was back at ground zero again and again. Just like you, wanted to die but wouldn\u2019t kill myself so I didn\u2019t hurt my family. But I read something like the greatest strength of humans is our ability to rebuild and rebuild again. Our resilience. So I just keep trying. And this six years weren\u2019t a failure just like your mom\u2019s 10 years. You guys were in pain and just doing what you could to survive and try to manage the pain. Very human. All the love and faith in the world to you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n4ljjb/after_drowning_in_depression_ptsd_and_addiction/gwx1l7s/"}
