I'm happy for you, truly -- and for your daughter. Those are the people who keep us heading toward true north. For me, it was my mom; for my mother, at least in part, it was me. I remember making a deal with my mom a few years back...that if she could find the strength to keep going, then so could I, and vice versa. That bond really is something precious, huh? I hope your happiness is here to stay and I wish all the best for both you and your girl. We just have to keep pushing forward.
