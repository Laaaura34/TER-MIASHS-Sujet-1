Sure - capitalism sucks. While it\u2019s kind-of relevant, this isn\u2019t really the place for that sardonic interpretation of the world.\n\nThe system we live in is NOT GOING TO CHANGE IN OUR LIFETIMES.  It can be brutal, it can be unforgiving, and it is basically terrible (see my post history here, before you think I\u2019m being holier than thou). \n\nBOTTOM LINE: we live in this system, and if you know it\u2019s broken, and that much of it doesn\u2019t actually mean anything - there\u2019s freedom in that. You can wake up every day and tell yourself: I MIGHT AS WELL WIN THEN.  By being compassionate, by not participating in a race to the bottom, by not taking advantage of people. Because let me tell you, the system is much more bearable when you\u2019re winning - and telling yourself all those things about how terrible it is are easy ways to give up, and nothing is going to change if you give up.\n\nYour never \u201cjust\u201d anything until it serves you (meaning, I run an office of 80 people, and often tell someone I\u2019ve just met that I\u2019m \u201cjust an admin,\u201dbecause it doesn\u2019t make it weird, and I don\u2019t define myself by my professional position) Take it seriously, make it work, and one day you\u2019ll win.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nyq4ee/never_use_this_word_to_describe_yourself_or_your/h1lyce8/"}
