The \u201creplacement\u201d is easy to find and very often lazy and/or incompetent. \n\nFor example, someone I knew in management in retail was doing a fantastic job training a good sales team and improving quality of service. They had great ideas and a lot of potential. The company refused to increase their wages above a really insultingly low amount, because that\u2019s what the arbitrary pay scale was.\n\nYou can guess what happened next - manager left to get more education and move up in the world, the new manager let the place go to crap within months, and a ton of staff left. Sales went way down. Manager was fired. Company lost way more money than they would have paying for a good manager and giving better financial incentives for their sales team.\n\nMy point is, our view on who is and isn\u2019t easily replaceable is very skewed.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nyq4ee/never_use_this_word_to_describe_yourself_or_your/h1nibl9/"}
