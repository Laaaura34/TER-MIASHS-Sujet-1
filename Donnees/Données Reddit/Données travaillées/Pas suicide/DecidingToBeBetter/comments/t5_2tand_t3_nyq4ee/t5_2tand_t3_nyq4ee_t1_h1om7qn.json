So many PhD students looked down on me for \u201conly\u201d getting a masters, so when professors asked what I was going to school for, or if they assumed I was a PhD student, I would say \u201cno, I\u2019m just a masters student\u201d. I had a professor teach me a similar lesson. She said not to use \u201cjust\u201d and that my degree didn\u2019t make me \u201cless than\u201d. \n\nNow that I\u2019m out I realize she\u2019s right.
