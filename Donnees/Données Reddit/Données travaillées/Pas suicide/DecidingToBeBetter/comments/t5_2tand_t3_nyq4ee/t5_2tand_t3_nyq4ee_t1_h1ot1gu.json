I always tell the people I train to not put in emails \"I'm just emailing ...\" or say on the phone \"I'm just calling....\" because it takes away from the importance of the email or call. And not to say \"just\" when telling someone their position.  I work at an animal hospital and hear \"I'm just a receptionist \" often but tell them that without them, the hospital could not function. They are the ones who make the hospital look good, they are the face of the hospital and the ones who ensure the hospital operates smoothly. They are the ones making sure patients come in for their vaccines and whatever else they need.  They simultaneously tend to the needs of the patient, the client, and the veterinarians.  No matter where you think you are in the totem pole, without you, the pole could not stand.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nyq4ee/never_use_this_word_to_describe_yourself_or_your/h1ot1gu/"}
