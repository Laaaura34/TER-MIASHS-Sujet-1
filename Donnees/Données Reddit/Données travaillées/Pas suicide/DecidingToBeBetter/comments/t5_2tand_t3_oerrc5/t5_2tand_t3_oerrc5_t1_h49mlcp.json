Sometimes we get caught up in our mind that we become immersed in our own thoughts and become unaware of what we\u2019re doing.  This is the ego at play, thinking you know absolutely everything and not taking into account what you don\u2019t know.  Observing others is fine, but those observations wouldn\u2019t even take place if you didn\u2019t exist to observe.  Be mindful that you\u2019re thinking so you can also observe yourself.  It\u2019s the ability of self-awareness.  Meditation and mindfulness does work, but takes time to develop.  It\u2019s not an instant gratification practice, but one that builds up over time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oerrc5/how_do_i_lose_my_high_opinion_of_myself_it_only/h49mlcp/"}
