It\u2019s the understanding that you not only have a life to maintain\u2014yourself\u2014but that you ALSO have a duty to spread good and to further the wellbeing of not just yourself, but others and your community around you.\n\nOf course, I\u2019ve been largely supported throughout my entire life at this point, I\u2019m 25.
