But have you ever watched any videos from Andrew Kirby on YouTube and/or his series on dopamine detoxing? I ask because you are mentioning consuming the same kind of content every day. Have you thought about or are you able to detox yourself from screens, from videos and from social media, so that you\u2019re able to be bored, sit in silence and sit with your own thoughts?\nMaybe that could help with the creativity inside, if that makes sense?\n\n\nAnd then reading through your post again, I think it really helps me to get out of the comfort zone to meet new people.\nFor example, I try to just easily have conversations with new people when I go to the bar with friends to play pool and drink. OR I try to join different kinds of communities through Facebook or here with people that have similar interests and then try to talk with different people with different perspectives. \nAnd, I try really hard to keep asking the next question, as in continually asking questions about themselves and why on their perspectives. Rather than talking about myself.\n\nThrough getting more comfortable with being uncomfortable when meeting new people, it has helped me to open my mind and widen my perspectives by learning about other people. And in a sense it gets my gears going and can even inspire me in different ways in my life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/poa86d/internet_use_inspiration_and_creativity/hcv9p51/"}
