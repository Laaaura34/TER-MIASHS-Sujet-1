I may have a head start because I was fairly doing good with what I would tolerate and what I wouldn't but a lot of that went away when I was in a recent relationship where I supressed my emotions. This led me to doing the same in other areas of my life and I had to regain these skills. \n\nI started journaling about what I want and do not want. What I will put up with and what I won't put up with. I also started listening to talks on how to be more assertive. I learned there are ways to be assertive with out being aggressive. That was a huge help. Then I practiced these things. I started to get more direct with people. \n\nI ran into someone I knew at a bar and he began a small argument with me. What I would normally have done is not argue back but I decided it was a good time to push back. I stated my points and did not back down. It was a good moment for me and that has led to more moments of me reminding myself, I am worthy of not putting up with crap and pushing back when I feel people are trying to walk over me. I have seen good success and also feel like I am respected more.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q6bazr/i_need_to_take_charge_of_my_life_i_need_to_be/hgbey8l/"}
