From your post it seems like holding your opinions back is causing you a lot of pain and frustration.\n\nI am in a similar situation, but rather than presume to give unsolicited advice, I hope you can find it in you to assert your views without fear of negative reactions.\n\nI also wish you well regarding you depression; I hope that you are taking all actions you can in self-care.\n\nBut I must say - I admire your decision to take charge of your life. Well done!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q6bazr/i_need_to_take_charge_of_my_life_i_need_to_be/hgba9y1/"}
