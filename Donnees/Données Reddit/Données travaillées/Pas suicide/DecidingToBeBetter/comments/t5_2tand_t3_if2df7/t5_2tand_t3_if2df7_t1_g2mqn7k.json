It can help for sure. And, in my case, been a wonderful help, although unfortunately not a cure. So, we two continue, me on my path of desperately trying to swim out of depressive episodes, and him, watching, supporting from the sides - always supporting - just never truly able to grasp why the love of his life can feel so dreadfully down and unworthy. Joy to me and joy to all who find a partner to help weather the storm. It\u2019s just always wise to know that the storm might not ever truly end. I personally think that the rest of my life will be a relationship with both the scourge of my existence and the love of my life.
