Ever.\n\nDepression lies. Depression is one of the smartest viruses known to humans. It deprives you of the thing you need to beat it. Hope. And when you lose hope, you believe the lies. It\u2019s a vicious circle.\n\nName it, it\u2019s the black dog that sometimes leaves but comes back when it is hungry. You\u2019re high right now, and I\u2019m so happy for you, honestly I am. But it comes back, be smart and be prepared. \n\nBest of luck to you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/if2df7/i_beat_depression_and_married_my_best_friend/g2muna2/"}
