OP may never feel as low as they may have in the past, but it is important to be cautious, know the signs, and know that if some of those feelings come creeping back, it's not abnormal or anything to be disappointed about. beating depression can sometimes be more like constant but successful suppression. ive found a good place with my meds and stuff and i've never been as low as i have in the past, but i still struggle sometimes and thats completely normal. feeling good is great and a huge achievement no matter what. at the same time, it's a good protective measure to take knowing that there may be bumps in the road in the future and it's not only normal, but expected. it doesn't discount any of the past progress thats been made, though.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/if2df7/i_beat_depression_and_married_my_best_friend/g2lhvcq/"}
