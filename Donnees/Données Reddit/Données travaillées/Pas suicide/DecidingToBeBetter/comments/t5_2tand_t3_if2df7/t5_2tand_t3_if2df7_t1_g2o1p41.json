I didn't mean it that way. Others that have added onto my comment were able to explain it better than I was. Working on how to deal with your mental health and finding a medicine or series of medicines can really make the difference. You're absolutely right. I still haven't dealt with probably even the majority of the root of my depression. I was just trying to tell my story of how I felt the way that op felt once and how I thought I was fixed. I didn't think I ever needed to worry about my mental health again. I was wrong. Something interesting to me is that when I attempted suicide I actually wasn't nearly as depressed as when I once was. I just didn't think I'd ever have to endure those thoughts and feelings again. I wish someone had told me that it's ok to feel sad and depressed after you've made progress. It doesn't mean you've lost that progress. You're now more equipped to deal with that depression. But, perhaps this wasn't the platform to discuss this. I aplogize for putting a damper on the comment section. I am very happy for OP and his wife. I  hope he has truly beaten his depression and one day I hope I will to.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/if2df7/i_beat_depression_and_married_my_best_friend/g2o1p41/"}
