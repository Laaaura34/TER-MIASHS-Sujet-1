That's a really useful skill to have. I've seen some really neat videos online of people restoring heavily damaged retro devices [like this one](https://youtu.be/L232PR3_5JA). Maybe you could do this, but with phones/PCs? But really, do what you like. Your parents can't tell you what you should be doing. I do think having a hobby will help you feel fulfilled in life, but it should be something you want to do, not forced to do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdfhgn/i_dont_have_any_useful_hobby_that_i_can_practice/hhmmjn7/"}
