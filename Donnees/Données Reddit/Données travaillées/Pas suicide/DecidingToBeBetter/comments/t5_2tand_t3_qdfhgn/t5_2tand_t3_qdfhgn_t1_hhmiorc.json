But if someone is feeling unfulfilled in life or like their existing hobbies aren\u2019t satisfying, it\u2019s a nice suggestion to maybe try something where you\u2019re building up a skill that allows you to make something. Writing stories or poetry, drawing patterns or portraits, taking photographs, making crafts, building PCs, there are so many options. It\u2019s just a way to try something new that they might not have thought of before that generates feedback on their progress. Or maybe takes an existing interest, like video games and media, and exploring it more by making something of your own. Nothing is a must! But if you\u2019re feeling stuck, you gotta try something, right?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdfhgn/i_dont_have_any_useful_hobby_that_i_can_practice/hhmiorc/"}
