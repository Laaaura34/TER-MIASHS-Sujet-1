This is a must. Not just during your twenties but for LIFE. Want a random suggestion? Jumproping. Tons of dirrent styles you can try and a weighted one costs like 15 bucks on Amazon. You can do it anywhere. Tons of content on youtube. You can make up your own moves, or commit to a style you saw that looks ridiculous and little by little you'll start to get it. Music makes it fun as hell because you can select specific RPM's and jump to that rhythm. Do you want jacked shoulders and forearms? Do you want to Increase your stamina almost immediately? Do you want to lose back fat and love handles? Well go get a damn jump rope fool.. make your parents proud again", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qdfhgn/i_dont_have_any_useful_hobby_that_i_can_practice/hhm5l2t/"}
