I\u2019ve been suffering with severe anxiety and depression for a long time too and it\u2019s tough. I have some good days here and there, but I still have a decent amount of bad days all. \nDon\u2019t listen to anyone who says to \u201cget over it\u201d cause they probably don\u2019t understand what depression is really like. \n\nTherapy isn\u2019t for everyone. I\u2019ve tried a few times but it just isn\u2019t for me either. Sure I learned some good tips and tricks from it, but it wasn\u2019t my thing. Currently, I\u2019m taking lexapro 10mg for my depression, atarax for my anxiety. Are you able to possibly start taking an SSRI from a psychiatrist and maybe start on a plan with that?  Like I said earlier, I still have my bad days but it\u2019s wayyyyyy better than it used to be since I\u2019ve started taking SSRI\u2019s.  Basically it just levels you out. It\u2019s not something you have to take forever, but it balances out your serotonin levels so they\u2019re not too low and too high. \n\nI also recommend getting into yoga. I\u2019ve been consistently adding it to my routine for the last year and a half and it\u2019s life changing. Focusing on your breath and stretching out your body really makes a huge different. At least I think so :) \n\nAlso, getting on a routine is crucial. Don\u2019t do too much to start. Start small like every morning you drink one whole glass of water. Do that for a week. Than add on something like make breakfast every morning (look into meal prep if you hate cooking. It\u2019s awesome). And so on until you can get a consistent routine going. It\u2019s OK if you fall off your routine every once in a while. You\u2019re depressed and you e got a lot going on in your head I\u2019m sure, it happens. What matters is that you get back into it eventually. And when you do, congratulate yourself or even reward yourself in a healthy way (no junk food lol). \n\nI really hope this helps you. It\u2019s certainly helped me in the last two years (had a miscarriage a few years ago so I\u2019ve really been working on myself since then To get back on track).  Remember to always take a deep breath if you start feeling off, and remind yourself \u201ceverything is going to be ok\u201d. You\u2019re only Human and it\u2019s important to get better at your own pace and in your own time. No one else can decide that for you. Only yourself. Good luck \u2764\ufe0f you got this!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lxeatb/how_do_you_overcome_depression/gpmo4rn/"}
