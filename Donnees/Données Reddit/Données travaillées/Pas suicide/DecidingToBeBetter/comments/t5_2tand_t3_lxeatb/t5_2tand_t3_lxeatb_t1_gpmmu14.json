It is not okay.\n\nHere's the cold truth - Life is suffering. It is a miserable place to live. There are corrupt people, toxic people, racism, and every shitty thing you can find. It is not a fun place to live.\n\nAccept the truth and it will set you free.\n\nDECIDE FOR YOURSELF THAT YOU HAD ENOUGH AND THAT YOU ARE NOT GONNA BE DEPRESSED ANYMORE AND BE IN THAT SHITHOLE.\n\nOnce decided, start small incremental steps like starting to go for a walk daily, cleaning your room etc.\n\nGo and take responsibility for your life.\n\nPS- Sorry if I sound harsh, but man stop feeling shitty about yourself. Go do something -  anything !! and you will thank me later", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lxeatb/how_do_you_overcome_depression/gpmmu14/"}
