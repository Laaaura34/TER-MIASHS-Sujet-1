That's why it's easy to workout in classes and /or study with a friend, discussing notes or concepts. But life is all about being true to yourself and you won't always have someone to  help you to show up. Use the company to build a habit to show up for yourself. Then you can return the favor for making others consistent down the line. That's how you learn to pay it forward.
