But make sure what you're doing is something you like. Forcing yourself to work on something you don't like at all doesn't work at all. \n\nI have a bad problem of abandoning projects before they even complete and sometimes even taking up a lot of them even though I know I won't be able to complete them. The best thing which is working out for me is, start slow and with low amount of work. \n\nLike for example, if I want to implement this feature in my app, break it down to small small modules which I can work on daily for atleast 2 hours and eventually implement the whole feature at the end of the week. I started doing this and its working out amazing for me!\n\nHopefully this information helps you in some way or the other!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p4wyxl/youd_be_surprised_by_how_far_you_can_go_if_you/h9241ia/"}
