It may be difficult at the moment to find another mental health professional because of the pandemic (not that they already weren't scarce) but it sounds like you've had enough experience to determine that she may not be the best fit for you. \n\nRepetition can be useful to help solidify a concept if it's important or a struggle to grasp, but if you feel that you already utilize the concept then it may not be helpful. \n\nIt can sometimes seem like you're the one talking most of the time, and can actually be the case, but she should be contributing meaningfully to the conversation, asking questions or providing insight. If you need to vent you can vent to anyone willing to listen, and can vent to her, but you're paying for her expertise so you should be receiving it.\n\nI have been recommended books by my therapist before , but they were very widely known, highly rated, relatively cheap, and I also wasn't pressured to buy them, and they certainly weren't written by someone that may have been related to my therapist. \n\nIn my opinion, If you're doing better at the moment, and you think you can go without help for a while, save your money. It sounds like you've got a support system should you need it and there will be someone that fits your needs, even if they take a while to find. \n\nIf you want, you can try bringing up your concerns with her before leaving. She may improve if she doesn't realize she's not being as helpful as she could be and you let her know. \n\nBest of luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/odgk7n/should_i_change_my_psychologist/h40dmqz/"}
