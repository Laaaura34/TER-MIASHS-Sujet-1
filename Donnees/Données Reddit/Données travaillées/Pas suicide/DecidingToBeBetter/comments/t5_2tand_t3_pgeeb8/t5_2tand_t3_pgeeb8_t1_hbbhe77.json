Maybe in addition to finding a strong, time-tested belief system, you could look for real people (authors/famous mentors and people in your life) that you look up to and want to learn from. I've had a lot of success just reading good books from figures who have figured out finances, fitness, spirituality, and learning from their life\n\nAlso, you can study religions without committing to a belief in them. I've found a lot of value in reading the Bible and seeing some of its deeper themes (honesty, humility, forgiveness) without necessarily converting to Christianity. All sorts of time-tested world philosophies exist if you seek to find them and read about them", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pgeeb8/is_there_a_cultreligionstrong_ideology_completely/hbbhe77/"}
