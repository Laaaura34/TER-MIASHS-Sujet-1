That's really the first step, now it's just a matter of continuing to do exactly what you are doing, and by that I mean question yourself, challenge yourself, and hold yourself to a higher standard. You are well on your way. I am exactly double your age, 36, and I will tell you that I have always felt directionless in life. But by doing things, whatever they are, pursuing a career, art, reading books, all of a sudden years go by and I realize I have had direction the whole time. Also try to forgive yourself, everyone fucks up. The worst ones just never acknowledge it and live in ignorance. Stay occupied, be passionate about whatever comes in your life, and try and take it a day at a time. That's my best advice. Good luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8vcc58/my_life_feels_so_directionless_i_keep_running/e1mojzl/"}
