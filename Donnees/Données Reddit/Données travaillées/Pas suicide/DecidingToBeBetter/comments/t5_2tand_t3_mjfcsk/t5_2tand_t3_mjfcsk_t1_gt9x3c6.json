If there was a way to re-direct that energy against the negative mentally you built upon yourself, would you feel better?\n\nThink about it, does it feel great talking about all the bad things and everything that is going wrong?  Does it feel draining?  It's like you're willing yourself to feel miserable.  Stop.  Stop the abuse.\n\nFind the things about yourself that you like.  Are you awesome?  Have people thought you were awesome before in life?  Have you made anyone laugh or smile?  Yes?  Then it's possible for you.\n\nFinally, find a small goal to work up that confidence.  Just don't go bullying small children :).\n\nHope that helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mjfcsk/i_feel_like_its_time_for_me_to_address_my_mental/gt9x3c6/"}
