Maybe you could distance yourself from others, unless you study best in groups. Or maybe build a closer bond to a good friend or two or even a counselor as emotional support. I hope you do well on your exams. No, you\u2019re not a failure. A lot of pressure is placed on you. Keeping going. It\u2019s just a setback. \n\nI feel like that right now. I\u2019m 22 and I plan on moving out after things go back to \u201cnormal\u201d. My parents are religious and controlling. I don\u2019t feel like I can be myself. I feel you there. We all deserve to be our own individual selves- I\u2019m reminding myself of that too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ncp91j/i_feel_stupid/gy93lvx/"}
