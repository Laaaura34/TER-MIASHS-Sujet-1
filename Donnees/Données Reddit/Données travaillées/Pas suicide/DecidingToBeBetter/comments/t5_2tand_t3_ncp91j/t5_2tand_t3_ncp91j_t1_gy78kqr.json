I relate to a lot of this; for me, this is my ADHD. Have you ever been screened? Recording yourself, while tough to listen to (I don\u2019t think anyone likes the sound of their own voice) is a good step. Practice with people who are safe and nonjudgmental. Toastmasters is a club that focuses on improving public speaking, but personally, I\u2019m a big fan of D&D for practicing my casual verbal communication/ conversation skills.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ncp91j/i_feel_stupid/gy78kqr/"}
