I started a lot like you. Dropped out at 16, started drinking, smoking pot, the only exception was I needed people. I had been bullied, teased, made fun of all thru elementary school and Jr high, too, so when someone showed me kindness, I did everything I could to fit in. Fast forward thru 33 years of drug and alcohol abuse, promiscuity and major depressive disorder, I'm finally determined enough to make changes. I got clean and sober 7 years ago, but still dealt with worsening, crushing depression. It wasn't until this past December that I actively searched for change.\n\nWhy did I tell you all of that? Because I'm SO SO HAPPY for you that you are doing this after only 4 years. You have many many really GREAT years ahead of you. I wasted the best years of my life. Not you. I'm just trying to squeeze a little normalcy, happiness, out of the few years I have left. Look ahead, not behind, but just focus on tomorrow. I don't have words to express how excited I am for you!!! You've got this!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lsbm3a/went_out_of_home_after_4_years/goqrh2l/"}
