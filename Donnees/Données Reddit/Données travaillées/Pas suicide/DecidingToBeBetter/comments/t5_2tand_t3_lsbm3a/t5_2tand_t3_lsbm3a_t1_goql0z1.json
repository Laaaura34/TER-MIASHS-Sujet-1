When my son was born I realized I wanted to stay home with him, at least until he went to school, then was diagnosed with bipolar 2 that is more triggered by stress and I was advised to only work part time if I did want to work, which was followed with me having a hard time managing my symptoms. For years I have felt unproductive because I didn\u2019t work and was just a stay at home mom. But I\u2019m starting to work on changing that perspective, that this idea that working means being productive in life has been told to us so that we\u2019ll seek out working for companies so they make more money. I\u2019m starting to think just getting through each day is being productive. I think your goal to get out of your house more is being productive. I think me working on my bipolar symptoms is being productive. Living is being productive.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lsbm3a/went_out_of_home_after_4_years/goql0z1/"}
