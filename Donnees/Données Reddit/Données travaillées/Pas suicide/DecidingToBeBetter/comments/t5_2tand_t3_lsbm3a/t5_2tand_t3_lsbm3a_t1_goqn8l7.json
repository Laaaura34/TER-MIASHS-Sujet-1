Self awareness as well as the guts to act on it is far too uncommon in the world we live in. Keep thinking and reacting to your automatic thoughts and actions, urges, impulses, etc. and learn your personal patterns of behavior. That is the first step in the quest that I present to you. \n\nFrom this knowledge base, future you will be able to research and employ different skills and tactics to combat whatever it is holding you back from reaching your potential.\n\nThat said, note this: it is a very long-term goal to reach one\u2019s full potential, and whatever happens in your life that potential will most likely remain\u2014even blossom.\n\nI wish you nothing but luck and good fortune on your journey, wherever it takes you. You are loved, and you are important to the future of us all.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t touch on this sooner, but you\u2019ve hit the nail on the head as far as looking past anxiety and all that. ADHD will always be with you, but there are certainly a great many things you can do to fight it. \n\nKeep the positivity flowing through you and never lose sight of the dream: life on your terms, at your pace, and never at your expense.
