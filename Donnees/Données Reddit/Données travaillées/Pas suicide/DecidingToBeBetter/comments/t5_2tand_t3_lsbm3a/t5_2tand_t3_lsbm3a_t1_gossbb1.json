I actually went to psychiatrist before and unfortunately, ADHD is not quite well known in my country. The only thing they prescribe here is Ritalin which I was prescribed, too. I took it for a week and it was by far the worst period of my life. I couldn\u2019t eat or sleep and felt a like zombie. I\u2019m planning to eventually immigrate to the USA or Germany and hopefully I can find better treatments there and till then I will try to manage it by exercising, eating healthy, and good sleep. Thanks for the recommendation \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lsbm3a/went_out_of_home_after_4_years/gossbb1/"}
