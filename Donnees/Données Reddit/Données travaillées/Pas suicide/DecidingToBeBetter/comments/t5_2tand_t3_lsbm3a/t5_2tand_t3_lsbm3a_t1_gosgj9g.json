Just lived in my room smoking weed and playing video games. I didn't even open my windows or curtains. There were 2 defining moments for me. My mom asked me to take the washing in from outside and I hadn't even been outside for 2 weeks, or even breathed in fresh air. When I stood outside I felt the cold concrete on my feet and it was a weird feeling, and then the wind. It made me realize how sheltered I was and that I needed to change something.\n\nThe second moment was a couple months later and my sister asked me to get a scoop of hot chips to go with dinner, it was just across the road and I said I couldn't do it, she asked why and I told her I wouldn't be able to talk with the guy across the counter. It made me feel like a failure.\n\nI would feel like every car that drove past me was staring and judging and I got nervous if I was standing in line for something. I used to love subway but couldn't bring myself to select my salads. It was awful.\n\nI got out of it by forcing myself to go for walks. Eventually I moved back to my hometown where I already had friends, and they thought it was weird as fuck that I hardly spoke but they were ok with it and I very gradually developed social skills again. The internet is extremely addictive and people don't realize it. Social interaction is so, so important. I'm very happy that you've found a way to start your steps to a better life my friend!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lsbm3a/went_out_of_home_after_4_years/gosgj9g/"}
