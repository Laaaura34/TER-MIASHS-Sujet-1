I went into congestive heart failure due to covid last year and gained 30 pounds of water weight in less than a week. I\u2019ve been able to get the weight off but it always comes right back. I\u2019m not obese, but I\u2019m still self conscious because I\u2019ve been so thin my entire life. *And* I was born with pectoral excavatum, hypodontia, and three holes in my heart. Just a lot of birth defects which have always affected my confidence. \n\nI\u2019m happy you were able to break out of your shell. I hope I\u2019m not stuck in mine!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lsbm3a/went_out_of_home_after_4_years/goqyn25/"}
