You have to challenge yourself and be self driven which means giving up useless staff like partying and movies and social media. Most programming topics and projects are easily available on the internet especially YOUTUBE where you can learn from many programmers that have channels .I would also advice you to download Udemy and learn the topics you are interested from there since the courses are cheap ($10) if you can afford.  \nAlso learn how to use GITHUB and STUCKOVERFLOW  because you are going to use them in your job and can also help in your resume .  The most important thing is to know how to search for solutions on Google as programmer . \n\nI believe if you put more effort into self study, I am sure you are going to get a job as self taught developer.  As long as you have personal projects to show you can be hired as junior developer.   I  will advise you to continue your degree because its going to help you in terms of understanding concepts and also gives you more opportunities to get promoted in the work field .", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/igg9do/need_advice_from_college_students_programmers/g2uzqun/"}
