We all want to be liked and have friends and to excel in an area.\n\nSecond step, realize that being better than everyone at everything is impossible. Find your lane, whatever it is you\u2019re best at and dive into whatever that is and get involved in whatever that is and the friends will come, along with the validation you are seeking.\n\nThird step, realize that anger and jealousy only hurt you in the end. These emotions are normal, but when you start to cheer on those around you and realize that when you encircle yourself with winners, their joy will bring you joy, you will be able to be happy for others. Their success or ability to make friends doesn\u2019t limit yours.\n\nLast, seek a counselor or mental health professional to help you work with these emotions and find new methods as you move forward.  It\u2019s actually easy to change your thoughts once you are aware and the good news is you aware!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q9iqu1/deep_in_hatred_and_at_an_all_time_low/hgxc3n0/"}
