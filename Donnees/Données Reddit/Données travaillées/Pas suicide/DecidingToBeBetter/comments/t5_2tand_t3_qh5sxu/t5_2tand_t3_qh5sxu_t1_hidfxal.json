When people generally say \"live it up\", they usually mean partying, clubbing and other things. I had a \"midlife crisis\" because I never did any typical teenage and early 20s things like partying in college, hookups, drinking, and traveling. I always been \"straight-laced\" if u call it and whenever my friends tell me their wild and crazy stories, I would get severely depressed that I wasted my youth. \n\nBut now I'm doing a little better. I spent my entire 27th year, reflecting on my self and I realized that parties, hookups, and weed were NEVER my thing and I probably would've been equally depressed forcing myself to partake in those things at the time. And I love traveling but I never got to due to severe financial issues but slowly thats been changing and I realized that it's also not to late to travel the world as well. I know 50 yr olds that still backpack thru Europe. \n\nYour life is your life. Please don't compare yourself to anyone else your age or you're gonna have a bad time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qh5sxu/how_do_you_live_up_your_20s/hidfxal/"}
