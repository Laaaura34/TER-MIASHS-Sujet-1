I completely resonated with that. While the first half of my 20s was a wreck - it gave me all the experiences to make informed decisions as I grow.\n\nIn my 2nd half of 20s now, I'm at a much better place. Sorted out my existential crisis, overcoming FOMO, getting the growth in career that I aspired, keeping the small yet warm circle of friends that I have and most importantly gaining the independence I thought I'd never have. I can safely say 30s would my 'living it up' era.\n\nEveryone paces differently.
