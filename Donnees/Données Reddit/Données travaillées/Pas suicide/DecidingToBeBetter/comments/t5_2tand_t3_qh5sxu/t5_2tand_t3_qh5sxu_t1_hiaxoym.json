You've got 4 years left, there's a ton that can be done in that time. But YOU need to decide what it is you're going to do.\n\nOnce you've decided, plan it.\n\nWant to travel? cool, get a job and save, then quit your job and leave. Want to go to every subway restaurant in your city? cool, find them online and plan your journey.\n\nMy idea of living up to your 20s is different to everyone else's and that's cool.\n\nHave the confidence and conviction to do what you want to do.\n\nThere comes a point where you go with what you've got or you don't go.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qh5sxu/how_do_you_live_up_your_20s/hiaxoym/"}
