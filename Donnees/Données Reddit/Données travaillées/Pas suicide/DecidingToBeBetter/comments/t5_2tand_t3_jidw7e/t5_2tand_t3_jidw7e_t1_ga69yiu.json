At the same time, I recognise this feeling is amplified now because our social interactions are mostly limited to social media due to Covid lockdown, and it\u2019s really easy to compare the complexity of my life to the simplified versions of what people share of their lives on social media. I\u2019m fully aware that these people have their own battles which they don\u2019t share publicly on social media , and they all work hard on their own achievements. But even in recognising that, the feeling doesn\u2019t decrease, which leads me to think this is to do with my own sense of fulfilment.\n\nObjectively, I have achieved awesome things in my career so far, but it never feels enough. But it\u2019s whether or not this is a normal and healthy mechanism to drive myself and I should compartmentalise it as such, or if it\u2019s because I\u2019m not feeling fulfilled from my achievements - I\u2019m still figuring this out.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jidw7e/im_trying_to_overcome_my_jealousy/ga69yiu/"}
