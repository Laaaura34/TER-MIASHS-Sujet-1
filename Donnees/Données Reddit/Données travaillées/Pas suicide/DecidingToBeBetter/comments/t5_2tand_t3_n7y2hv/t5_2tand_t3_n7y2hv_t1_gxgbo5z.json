I was so scared of being found out that I just pretended to eat in middle and high school, I would sit with my 'friends' and would nibble away at my food, but the lighter stuff like fruit and milk I could get down. \n\n\\~ like with many things it gets easier as you make progress \n\nI'm able to get more food down than when I was younger. I don't know what you mean by progress.\n\n\\~ and it\u2019s hard to control or change but I know it can be done \n\nSo what kind of treatment are you guessing at? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry to pull apart the bits I don't like about your comment but I think my issue extends beyond anxiety, as in I can find it difficult eating alone too. I would guess the issues started internally, and in public it would lead to judgement and more anxiety, so it was better to cope alone. It seems like for you it was simply social anxiety.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n7y2hv/my_issues_with_eating_isolated_me_tw_eating/gxgbo5z/"}
