Also, being demanding of people can be an unhealthy coping mechanism for anxiety which can peak post partum, especially with all the extra stress going on in your life. I found anti depressants to be extremely helpful in both cases. I didn't even realize I had the anxiety part until the antidepressants dialed it down and I felt relief from it. \n\nI commend you for listening to your family's words and for reflecting honestly on them and I don't think you deserve the unsympathetic comments you've gotten here so far. While mental health isn't an excuse, it can be an explanation and a starting point for improvement. \n\nApologize to your family and let them know you are trying to change. Talk to your doctor about post partum depression. Try to give yourself a little grace. Post partum is a bitch and that's in a world without quarentine and job stress and and etc. Give your family grace as well. It isn't easy dealing with someone whose mental health isnt currently great.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fw5bad/how_do_i30f_change_myself/fmrh6yo/"}
