A new baby alone would do that, but combined with the fact that you're holding down three jobs, looking for another, and coping with post-partum - it's easy to see why you're feeling out of control.\n\n**First**  \nApologize to your family.  Let them know you heard them when they said that they're miserable and tell them you appreciate all their help.  \n\n**Second**  \nWhat are you feeling insecure about?  Take some time and think about it because that's where your desire for control comes from.  Do you feel like a bad mom?  A bad spouse?  Are you worried about the future?  Something will resonate.  Whatever it is, consider sharing it with your spouse.  See if the two of you can work on the root cause of your need for control.\n\n**Third**  \nTry starting a gratitude journal to bring a positive habit into your life.  Either first thing in the morning, or last thing at night, write down 10 things you're grateful for.  If 10 feels like too many, do 5.  It will help change your perspective.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fw5bad/how_do_i30f_change_myself/fmpmpim/"}
