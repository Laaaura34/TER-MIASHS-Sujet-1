Finding someone who understand what I'm talking is very important to me. \n\nYou know, since I have been doing this for a long time I did try to reach  out to my teacher and student services. I was basically told to get my shit together. Breath and you can do it.... Mental health issues are a joke in my place to say the least. What I understood from this is that, it's OK, it's not their problem to understand and I don't need them to understand to find my way out of this mess. As you can see I am still in that same rabbit hole.  \n\nI am working on something that really interests me. I know it'll be fun learning about it. \n\nThank you again.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p19f3s/talking_about_it_acknowledging_it_taking_action/h8dxpi7/"}
