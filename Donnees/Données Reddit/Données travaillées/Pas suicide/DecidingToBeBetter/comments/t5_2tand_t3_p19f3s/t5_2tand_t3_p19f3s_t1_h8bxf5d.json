Learning to ask for help was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do, but with practice it gets a lot easier.\n\nOne book I read referred to part of this issue as: your circle of comfort. The more time you spend in the circle the smaller it becomes, the more time you spend outside the larger it becomes. I think covid has made a lot of people's circles very small, including mine.\n\nI would highly recommend reading the book: healing the shame that binds you by John Bradshaw. Personally I found it incredibly helpful in dealing with those very issues.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p19f3s/talking_about_it_acknowledging_it_taking_action/h8bxf5d/"}
