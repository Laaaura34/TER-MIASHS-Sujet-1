I've walked the walk. Kudos for arranging to talk to your teacher. I suggest you bring a print out of your OP as it sounds like you are able to mask the severity of your emotional distress when interacting with people. Your post OTOH expresses your extremely painful emotional state loud and clear.\n\nWhen talking to your teacher ask them if there are any accommodations that can be made given your highly anxious, paralyzing state of mind. It may be good to also talk to student services.\n\nA way of understanding avoidance is to think about how people are told to freeze when confronted by a raging dog.  \n\n  \nMy suggestion to get past the paralyzing avoidance is to rekindle what made you choose your field of study. You need to spark your curiosity, In the course of your studies what are some things that have grabbed your your attention, that made you go hmm? Letting your curiosity surface will help get you through this.\n\nBeing curious puts you in the drivers seat. It is an active state. as opposed to the passive state brought on by anxiety.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p19f3s/talking_about_it_acknowledging_it_taking_action/h8c8p0h/"}
