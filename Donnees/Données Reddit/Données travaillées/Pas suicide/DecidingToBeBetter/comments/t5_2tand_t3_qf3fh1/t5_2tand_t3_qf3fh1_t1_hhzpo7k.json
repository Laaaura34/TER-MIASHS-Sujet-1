I have struggled and still struggle with that aspect of life, and always called myself an agnostic. But the truth is, when I'm really down for the count I do ask god for help. In my worse moments, where I have nowhere else to turn it's god I talk to. And I don't believe in him in an organized religious kind of way, I choose to believe in god as a wise benevolent being that I don't understand. And that's enough to give me some comfort in my worst moments.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qf3fh1/learning_to_believe_that_the_universe_is_kind/hhzpo7k/"}
