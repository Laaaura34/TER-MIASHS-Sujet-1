Once you figure out what is causing the problem, it might be easier to solve it then. For example, if your immediate issue is a fear of rejection - then the task at hand would be to overcome the fear of rejection. Despite this being the reason for many guys not to approach girls, the funny thing is that everyone has experience with rejection. You might not have been rejected by a girl, but your excuses for a late homework or a failed project were rejected, etc. Some of the best-looking and fully confident people I know get rejected and say \"you can't win em all\" and they are absolutely right; you can't.\n\nThat's just an example though. It'll be up to you to think about it and figure out exactly what it is that is causing this issue for you.\n\nFeel free to shoot me a PM and we can discuss privately if you'd like!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/87ooih/top_21_life_lessons_collected_by_me/dwhpzob/"}
