I\u2019ve dated leeches and bums and I\u2019ve dated very driven people, and I now understand that the one thing I want to see in a potential spouse is drive.\n\nI live in a tight-knit community that has a lot of wealth flying around, so many girls are spoiled or have no ambition to do anything - they just want rich husbands. My goal will be finding someone with drive, that actually wants to live their life and not just be alive. \n\nBut it\u2019s all relative! My best friend is dating this girl because she\u2019s a good religious influence on him (he comes from a religious family and he\u2019s a bit off-path), another friend married his best friend of 6 years because he couldn\u2019t imagine being happier with someone else, and another friend married his wife because she idolizes him. It\u2019s whatever means the most to YOU, you should look for in someone else I think. That\u2019s how I\u2019m approaching it, at least!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/87ooih/top_21_life_lessons_collected_by_me/dwgxpi4/"}
