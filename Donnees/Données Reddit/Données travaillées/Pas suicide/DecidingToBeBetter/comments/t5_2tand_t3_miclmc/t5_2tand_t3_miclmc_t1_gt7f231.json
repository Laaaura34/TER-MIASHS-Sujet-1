Will it help bring people closer together? Is everyone involved OK with it and on board?\n\nThat's a good point. I noticed that these kinds of emotional decisions follow a common theme. Whether I should act on emotions or not depends on whether these actions lead to valuable experiences that benefit myself and the people around me.\n\nSuppose I have a crush on a girl and I want to ask her out. Should I do that? Yes! It would be a valuable experience for myself and the other person. It shows that I am willing to be confident and shoot my shot. Even if I get rejected, it would still be a valuable experience for me to learn from. It could also avoid beating around the bush and any creepy and obsessive actions that result.\n\nNow suppose I have a crush on the same girl and I am pursuing her super hard. I am wasting all my time and energy on her, even if it becomes clear that she doesn't like me back. Should I keep going? No! Continuing would continue to drain my mental energy and make her feel uncomfortable. I would push her away. It would increase the chances of being rejected and blocked on social media and destroy any pre-existing friendship.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/miclmc/how_do_i_become_able_to_fully_feel_and_express/gt7f231/"}
