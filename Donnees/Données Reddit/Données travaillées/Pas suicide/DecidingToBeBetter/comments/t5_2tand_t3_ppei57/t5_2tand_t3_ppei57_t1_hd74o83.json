A librarian can help you (ask for an actual librarian, many people working there are assistants and haven\u2019t done a full degree on research).\n\nYou can also check out some YouTube, ProfessorDaveExplains does a good job of breaking down Physics, Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, and Mathematics. Zoe Bee does a lot of literary and philosophy videos that are very interesting. Kurzgesagt does extremely good shorts on futurism and pop sci topics.\n\nCongrats on taking charge of your knowledge and working to grow it!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ppei57/list_of_books_to_become_a_well_rounded_self/hd74o83/"}
