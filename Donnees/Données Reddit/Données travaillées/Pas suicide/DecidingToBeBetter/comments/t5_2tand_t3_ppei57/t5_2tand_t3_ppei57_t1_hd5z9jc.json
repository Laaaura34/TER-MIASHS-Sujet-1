Frankly, Hesse didn't truly understand Siddhartha or Buddhism \u2014 rather, read Old Path, White Clouds by Thich Nhat Hanh. He's one of the most prominent writers of buddhist literature in English, possibly ever. It's the same story of Siddhartha but honestly way, WAY better. (My credentials are: I've read both multiple times and also a pile of other Buddhist lit by Hanh and others)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ppei57/list_of_books_to_become_a_well_rounded_self/hd5z9jc/"}
