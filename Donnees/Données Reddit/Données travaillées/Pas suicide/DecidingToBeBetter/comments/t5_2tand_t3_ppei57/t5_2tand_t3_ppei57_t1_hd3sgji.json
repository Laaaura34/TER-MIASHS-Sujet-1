The gulag archipielago will let you get a grasp of some of the horrors in the Gulag told by a survivor. \n\nIf I happen to remember anything else I will comment it. I wish the best for you! God bless you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ppei57/list_of_books_to_become_a_well_rounded_self/hd3sgji/"}
