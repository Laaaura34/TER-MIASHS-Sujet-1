I also found a girl, I'm interested in. \nEven if, she is not the one. She has inspired me to be a better person. \nSeveral weeks back, I went to show her a picture on my phone, and noticed my hand was shaking pretty bad. I politely excused myself out of embarrassment.\n\nFrom that moment on, I looked at myself in the mirror,  and asked, \" Is this the person, I want to be?\"\n\nNobody, wants to be around a drunk'n fool all the time. It gets old fast...\n\nI drink out of boredom, and recently moved to a new state. No friends,  no car, quarantin in full effect.  My alcohol consumption went through the roof ! Shaking every day became normal...\n\nWell, day 10 and my apartment is clean, laundry done, things are starting to get fixed , that I ignored forever. I feel exceptionally better physically,  and emotionally.  \nBefore,  I had trouble sleeping,  Not so much now.\nNo more shaking.  No more panic attacks. \nI told myself,  40 days. Then reevaluate myself.  \nI've done this before,  but seem to fall into the same rabbit hole afterwards. \nThus, this time I'll take all that into account.  I'd like to drink sociably,  but if I can't, just give it up all together .\nI've drank enough for several lifetime's..\n\nI wish you the best in your journey!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gi6oad/i_found_the_one_i_know_i_have_to_be_a_better/fqdgyvv/"}
