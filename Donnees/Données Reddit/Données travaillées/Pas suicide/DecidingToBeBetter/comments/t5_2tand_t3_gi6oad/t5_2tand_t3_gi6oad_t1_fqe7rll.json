I get that a lot of people get really intense about their sober lifestyle, but how is that actively hurting their ability to conduct their daily lives? Because iirc that's the main defining feature of an addictive behavior.\n\nUnless you're talking about the prescriptivist vs harm reduction philosophies of addiction management, and how infighting between those groups can be damaging.
