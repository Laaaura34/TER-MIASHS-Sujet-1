It was a really great choice. \n\nNow I\u2019ve suddenly found my passion is for long distance running, not any sort of academic area. It seems kinda lame when you think about it, but at the end of the day, a job is just a job. I can work my engineering job and run as many marathons as I want. \n\nThe rest of my passion can come from my future marriage and my children", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nltltw/if_you_feel_miserable_since_your_life_isnt_really/gzl6pon/"}
