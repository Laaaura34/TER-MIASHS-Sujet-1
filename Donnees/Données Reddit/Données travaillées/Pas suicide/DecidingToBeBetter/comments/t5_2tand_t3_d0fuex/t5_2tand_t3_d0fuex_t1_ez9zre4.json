Control is a behavior done by the insecure. IF this was a friend that said this about themselves, would would you say to them? Treat yourself kindly.\n\nMy suggestion is to get motivated in finding a happier place to work and focus less on the stupid shit they do to you there. Think of them as people that mean nothing to you. Or you can chose an entirely different route and have empathy about how they are so insecure they feel a need to control others. You will be in a better place soon enough. \n\nRemember, they are losing you and you are valuable.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/d0fuex/struggling_to_find_joy_in_my_current_situation/ez9zre4/"}
