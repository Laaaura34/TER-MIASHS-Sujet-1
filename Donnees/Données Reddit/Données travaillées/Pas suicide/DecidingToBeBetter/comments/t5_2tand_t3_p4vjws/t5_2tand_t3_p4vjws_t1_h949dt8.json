I'm the same age as you and my child is now an adult though still living at home through college. I had one friend I met though work but they moved out of state a few years ago. It's difficult to make friends as an adult for sure. I have been debating trying out Bumble BFF though with Covid ramping back up I feel like I shouldn't risk unnecessary exposure going out to meet people. Unfortunately I don't have any tips or tricks that would be helpful but know that this random commentor sees you, hears you and wish you all the best.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p4vjws/42_and_no_friends/h949dt8/"}
