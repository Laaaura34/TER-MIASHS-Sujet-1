I think Twitter was the most toxic to me, I was constantly getting frustrated and fought a lot with others. I've been out of the loop with lots of things especially pop culture, memes, but honestly I couldn't care less about that now. I'm really glad I left it. \n\nI have returned to instagram though, to start an art account where I only follow artists who inspire me and I share my art journey.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gt5hu7/i_woke_up_a_week_ago_and_decided_to_suspend_all/fsbxxzj/"}
