Ever since college and especially since 2016. People stir the pot so much it gets old. I haven't logged into mine for at least a year. I feel fine. I dont really miss it aside from more contact with friends. But when I call or visited somebody since then, it has been more enjoyable and less dramatic. If I did miss out on some gathering or was excluded. I don't feel jealous because I made my own plans instead of obsessing over watching the newsfeed of other friends have fun elsewhere. I have a feeling I will follow suit when the election cycle hits. Might be difficult if the quarantine continues, but I know I am not alone and I can still be social without all of the social media.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gt5hu7/i_woke_up_a_week_ago_and_decided_to_suspend_all/fsb5u3e/"}
