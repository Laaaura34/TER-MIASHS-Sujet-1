I didnt delete my socials, but I did fill my feed with all positive shit. For example, my FB and Instagram feeds are  only filled with animals videos, memes, sports and makeup now since I followed a buncha zoo, makeup and meme pages lol. If I want the news, I\u2019ll watch it or go to news sites- which I do frequently. But I dont need to get bombarded with it 24/7 from fb and instagram, its depressing when you cant escape it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gt5hu7/i_woke_up_a_week_ago_and_decided_to_suspend_all/fsadb59/"}
