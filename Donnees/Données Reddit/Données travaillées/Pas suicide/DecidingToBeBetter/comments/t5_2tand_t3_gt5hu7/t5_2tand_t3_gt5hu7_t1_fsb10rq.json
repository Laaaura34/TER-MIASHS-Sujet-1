I think it is US that don't partake in rational discussions. It's not the platform, it's the people. If others like you and I wanted to really have engaging conversations and respectful debates against one another, we could..Anywhere. Instagram, Twitter, you name it. The problem I see is that humanity is too focus on being entertained. Wether that be with the next lil-whatever making trash music with no lyrics, the next scandal, who to cancel, race, hate, etc. We are focused on the wrong things and we now have these social media \"influencers\" who gain a huge following and use their platform to propagate more stupidity. Why have a conversation with someone online when you can watch a hillbilly drink an entire bottle of Jack Daniels? Or watch some fools take the cinnamon challange? Or any of the other meaningless droll that is all over the internet and has taken over many people's lives..\n\nWe as a race have allowed ourselves to value instant gratification (ie. Likes/upvotes), controversy, and fools over the internet who chase \"clout\" by doing whatever idiotic tactics it takes.
