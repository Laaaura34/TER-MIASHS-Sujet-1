I tried eating more veggies and fruits and less fast food for 3 weeks but at the end of that I just quit because... not sure why exactly. I guess I just didn't picture myself doing that for the rest of my life.\n\nAnd as for exercise, I tried several things like jogging, yoga, pilates but what I managed to do somewhat consistently were simple stretches and things like pushups and situps. I think I maybe did that for about 10 minutes each day for a few weeks consistently as well. I quit because I think I got frustrated by it. I felt as if it was pointless to continue.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/puf0ea/how_to_deal_with_depression_without_going_to/he7hjcx/"}
