Ever since I made this original post I began working on exercise and my diet (nothing much, just 10 situps a day and some kind of fasting where I try not eating anything for up to 16 hours). So I guess I just need to try to stay consistent with this. Question is, how? Doing such exercises and working on my diet is nothing new for me, the problem is just that I tend to quit after a few weeks. How does one just stick to it?\n\nAnd as for hobbies and work, I think my biggest problem with that is that I don't quite know what I want or where to start. I tried thinking of the things I most certainly wouldn't want to do and then determining what remains and seeing whether that would be doable. But I kinda always find a reason not to like something. The reason I don't want to work is because, as you said, it takes *hard* work and I don't think I'm capable of doing that. I'll just end up half-assing it and might get fired over and over again because I don't care about \"working hard\".\n\nDoesn't help that my self-esteem is very low and I'm especially not happy with my looks right now, so going into the wider world and showing myself is embarrassing to me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/puf0ea/how_to_deal_with_depression_without_going_to/hefx2xh/"}
