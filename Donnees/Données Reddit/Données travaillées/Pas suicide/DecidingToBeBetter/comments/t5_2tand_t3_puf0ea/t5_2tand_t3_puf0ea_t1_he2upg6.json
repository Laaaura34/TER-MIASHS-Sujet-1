Regular exercise, healthy diet, and quality sleep.\n\nA lot of people 'cure' their depression with these things. However, it's not 100%, like any treatment for it, but it is effective for a lot.\n\nYou don't have to go balls to the wall with training, just 3x a week minimum. I'd recommend both lifting weights, and cardio. Find the ones you enjoy doing, and don't force yourself to do ones you don't enjoy, or you'll find it hard to stick with it, especially if you're depressed.\n\nAs for healthy eating, most people know what that is. Get a lot of fruits and veggies in, stay away from fast food. Get plenty of protein in too, as your brain needs protein to work properly too. Also don't cut out fats. Your body needs a minimum amount of fats to have a healthy system, and if you have too low, you can feel like crap and that can cause certain mental health problems.\n\nFor sleep, regulation is key. Go to bed the same time every night, and don't do anything besides sleep in your bed. Teach your body that the bed is only for sleeping, and even on the weekends, go to bed at the same time too. Having a bedtime routine helps too.\n\nIn the end, doing these things is more effective when done alongside therapy, but if you really can't get it, treat your body right, and your mind should follow.\n\nBut let me know if you want more info.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/puf0ea/how_to_deal_with_depression_without_going_to/he2upg6/"}
