And as for the \"can't reach any doctors\" part, I attempted calling the few good therapists in my town but for some reason none of them pick up or the auto response message comes on saying \"we're currently too busy, call again later\". I also sent one of them an email but that was a few weeks ago, with no response. People say that apparently ever since the pandemic started mental health professionals would be much more busy, and I guess they are.\n\nNow the thing is, I might be overreacting a little bit because there are still a few doctors left whom I did not try to contact yet. My problem with those however is that they don't exactly look promising to me. Reviews on the internet agree that they either don't even listen to you or simply give you meds that don't really work, things like that. And even the social worker from the agency mentioned that these doctors aren't the best place to start either. So with that in mind I suppose I'm trying to prepare myself for the worst case scenario and, if these other doctors really don't help and I still can't reach a decent one, I want to know what else I could be doing other than hopelessly waiting for someone to pick up the phone while my life is just wasting away.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/puf0ea/how_to_deal_with_depression_without_going_to/he3mpww/"}
