I never really liked the idea that everyone should get 8 hours of sleep because, first of all, everyone\u2019s different and needs different amounts of sleep, but also because 8 hours can\u2019t be broken into even 90 minute segments. Try sleeping for 7 1/2 hours or 9 hours instead of 8 and see if that makes any difference", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qcrrvc/i_always_feel_tired_no_matter_what/hhi90t3/"}
