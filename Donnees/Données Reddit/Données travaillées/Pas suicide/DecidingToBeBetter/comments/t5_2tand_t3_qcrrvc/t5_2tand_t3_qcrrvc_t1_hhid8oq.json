Tried every supplement, every sleeping scheduled you name it. No matter what I did I was constantly a coffee addicted zombie man. Made me and my life miserable. One day out of sheer desperation I went dairy and gluten free. 3 days after that for the first time in my life I woke up an hour and a half before my usual waking time and had no headache. I also quit coffee and my energy level are of the charts.\nIf you try to go gluten and dairy free i urge you to be very diligent. Gluten and dairy are in everything so make sure you are actually gluten and dairy free. Good luck", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qcrrvc/i_always_feel_tired_no_matter_what/hhid8oq/"}
