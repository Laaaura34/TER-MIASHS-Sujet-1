I sleep about the same on weekends but am so much happier not waking to an alarm. Try programming Alexa or your phone to play a gentle wake-up song (I use \u201cSunrise\u201d Norah Jones it\u2019s gentle and calming) or they have alarm clocks with lights that slowly get brighter and brighter to wake you up. They can make noise too in case just the light won\u2019t do it. I startle SO easily and these little changes helped a lot. But get some blood drawn and a checkup too to make sure it\u2019s nothing medical. Also maybe try a REM sleep tracker? I think they\u2019re commercially available. See how many hours of good, restful REM sleep you\u2019re getting per night. You may be surprised!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qcrrvc/i_always_feel_tired_no_matter_what/hhlfd53/"}
