I personally find that 9 hours is too much for me, if I sleep too long I wake up feeling groggy and disoriented. I've done the opposite too, one time I even got caught falling asleep at work! Falling asleep and waking back up again is also an awful habit, no matter how much sleep I've had I always felt worse after doing that. Consistency of pattern is the key, if you go to bed and wake up at different times every day then you will never adjust to it.\n\nCould also be that your job doesn't inspire you and makes you feel tired before you even get in the door. I've worked two part-time jobs at once before, one that I liked and one that I hated. I never felt tired waking up for the one I liked.\n\nAlso don't listen to anyone saying \"this is your life now,\" it's so cynical and not a good habit to victimise yourself against life itself. You can feel awake and energised as an adult, it's not something to be sentimental or reminisce about, it's still within your power.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qcrrvc/i_always_feel_tired_no_matter_what/hhic4d0/"}
