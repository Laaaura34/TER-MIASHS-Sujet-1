Go to the drugstore and buy iron supplements. Take them. If that\u2019s the problem you\u2019ll feel a difference very quickly. Within hours perhaps. \n\nAlso get a blood test to measure your ferritin levels. \n\nDon\u2019t take iron with medication as it can interfere with the efficacy. \n\nIf you have a sensitive stomach and don\u2019t want to take the supplement then eat more red meat, clams and spinach. Pair this with tomato as tomato increases the bioavailability of iron. \n\nLast, try cooking with a cast iron skillet as iron will leach into your food. \n\nI hope you feel better.
