Are you consuming alcohol, caffeine, or nicotine? Are you eating balanced meals (enough protein, veggies, vitamins, limiting sugar and processed foods)? Are you getting enough down time (to counter burn out)? Are you getting enough social time and stimulation (to counter boredom/burn out?) Also Google \"sleep hygiene\", there's many things you can do to help improve sleep such as making sure you're in a dark room, stop using screens an hour or two before bed, etc. I'm a sensitive sleeper and I've found that drinking chamomile tea and magnesium before bed  + blocking out the light helps me tremendously. It could also be that you're just not a morning person -- they've found that based on genetics there is truth to people being wired to have a morning or night preference. I'm a morning person and I find evening shifts to be super hard even if I get enough sleep and wake up later. If you're able to, you could also find a \"functional medicine\" doctor -- they look at root causes and systemic issues to figure out why you're having problems.
