There are more mature friends who won't get insulted at everything you say. Taking a new white canvas to draw always feels good and liberating. \n\nIt's pretty funny coincidence since I also just deleted all contacts with 99% of my high school and college \"friends\" . Only kept like 3-5 people who I still keep in touch with currently. My close friend of almost 10 years never reaches out to me ever since he has his new group of friends and a new girlfriend. I also didn't click with him for the last two years. I was a bit sad but I still keep my heads up for new friends and companions later down the road!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kdim2e/severing_bonds_with_toxic_people/gfwp79v/"}
