I long for friends that actually bring out my personality instead of making me feel lonely. I constantly look around and wonder why I don\u2019t have friends that actually ask about me or want to know how I\u2019m going. Most people just talk about themselves as if I have no life of my own haha. I\u2019m just going to accept it is what it is and be my own best friend until the real people come along", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oem6gn/i_deserve_better_friends/h47ftqd/"}
