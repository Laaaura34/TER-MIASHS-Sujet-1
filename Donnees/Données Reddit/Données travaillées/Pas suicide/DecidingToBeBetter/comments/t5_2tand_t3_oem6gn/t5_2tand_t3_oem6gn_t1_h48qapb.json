I just quit trying with people who didn't put effort in instead of hanging onto old relationships that have fizzled. My \"best friend from college\" still sends me a text once a year saying she misses me and we should hang but it never comes with an invite. I haven't seen her for two years cause there's been no invite (and honestly several years before that, but I overcompensated by trying too hard). I always just say sure! Tell me when and where and I'm there! That one hurt a bit but I was expecting it. On the upside I've put that energy into making new friends and following up with people who do want to hang out! When I was so focused on these ungratifying friendships I wasn't noticing the people who did try and I wasn't taking the initiative with new people in my life. It's sad sometimes, but it's also such a relief to be able to make plans without the disappointment and having to work so damn hard make it happen.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oem6gn/i_deserve_better_friends/h48qapb/"}
