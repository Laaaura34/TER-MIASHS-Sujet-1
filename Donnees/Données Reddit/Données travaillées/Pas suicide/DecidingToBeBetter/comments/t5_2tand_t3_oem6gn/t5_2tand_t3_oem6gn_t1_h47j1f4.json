Things are opening up again where I am; and I'm running into a fair amount of people that always seemed nice, but that I never really had the time or energy, or maybe confidence, or even desire (since I thought I had friends) to get to know better. \n\nSo far I've twice met up with people that were going to events that I otherwise might have declined. Too often former 'friends' either stood me up, or ended up ignoring me, if there was someone else to talk to; so I had mostly stopped doing/agreeing to anything I wasn't 100% interested in doing on my own.\n\nOf course it's really too soon to tell if they'll become anything more than just acquaintances, but it already feels like an improvement.\n\nI actually wrote the following about finding friends a few days ago; apologies for quoting myself (I don't know if that's actually necessary, but it feels weird), anyways it's getting late here and I'd say essentially the same thing:\n\nMost people make friends with people they get to/have to see again and again. School and work are common places for many, but not everyone is lucky enough to fit into where they end up in that regards. Try to find somewhere you like, that you feel you could fit in, and become a regular. This could be a cafe/bar/club, book/music store, a game night somewhere, etc. It's a lot easier to talk to someone that you see regularly and have common interests with than it is to complete strangers.\r  \n\r  \nNot that this guarantees friendship of course, but activities with casual acquaintances are still way better than staying in and being sad.\n\nGood luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oem6gn/i_deserve_better_friends/h47j1f4/"}
