I was feeling bad and I reached out and shared something I was struggling with. I didn't share the whole story. Just a few words about how I was struggling. I thought that when they read it and asked some concerned questions - I would share more if my pain.\n\nThere response back was \"Suck it up.\"\n\nIt told me two things. They had stuff going on in their life that was stressful\n And that they either completely lacked empathy or didn't give a fuck about me -- or both.\n\nIt started to make me realize some people truely don't give a fuck. \n\nI stopped reaching out to people who never ask how I'm doing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oem6gn/i_deserve_better_friends/h47hz9x/"}
