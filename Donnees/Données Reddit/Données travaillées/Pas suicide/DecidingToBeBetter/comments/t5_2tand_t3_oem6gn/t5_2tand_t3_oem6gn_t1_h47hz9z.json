Is it pretty much every time you try to hang out? If you wanted you could try talking to them about how it makes you feel, but I understand it isn't easy to bring up. I've also taken wisdom from Brene Brown in that I should assume everyone is doing the best they can. Maybe your friend is really overwhelmed with things that you can't know and has trouble planning her days. Even so though, you do deserve to feel wanted and cared about, so I think it is a good idea to look for new friends. I've given up on flaky friends in the past and it was a very healthy decision. It can really open your eyes, being around friends who are dependable and want to see you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oem6gn/i_deserve_better_friends/h47hz9z/"}
