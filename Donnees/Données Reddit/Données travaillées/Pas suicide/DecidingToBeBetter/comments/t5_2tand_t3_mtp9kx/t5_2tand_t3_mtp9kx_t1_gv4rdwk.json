The [2020 Pew study](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/08/20/a-profile-of-single-americans/) found that for men 18-29, 51% are single. This means that essentially half are in a relationship when surveyed. These are Americans, so we're not talking about arranged marriages. They are all meeting women through the same set of options you have: at work, at social events, through friend groups, out in public, at Meetups, online dating, doing hobbies, etc.\n\n> maybe a bit awkward sometimes, but usually im kindly turned down. this is okay. But on the online dating platforms its just day after day of putting in effort to just not even get matches, or ghosted by a match, that i assume must have accidently matched with me, or my first message to the match must not have been \"entertaining\" enough. im not sure, but it feels very bleak either way.\n\nHave you had reasonable/wise/mature other people look over both your online dating profiles, your modifiable appearance, and how you speak to women in public? \n\n> 4 people were people ive not legit interested (2 were twice my age, and the other 2, we just did not have any connection going.\n\nWhy did you go on dates with women twice your age? What was your age at the time?\n\nSomething in this story is not adding up. Something is amiss. Let's see if we can figure it out.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mtp9kx/how_to_fix_life/gv4rdwk/"}
