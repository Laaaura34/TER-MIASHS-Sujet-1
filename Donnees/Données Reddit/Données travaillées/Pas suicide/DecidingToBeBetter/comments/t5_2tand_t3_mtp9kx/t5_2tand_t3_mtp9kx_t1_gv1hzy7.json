And not like \"wow I went to a cross-stitching class\" type of new things, real new things. Just my opinion, but hobbies are bullshit. Sure, you should have some things that you like to do for recreation or relaxation, but who you are is defined by what you really *do*.\n\nWhere do you live, how do you live, where do you work, who do you see every day? Don't sell all your possesions and move to bali, but look to make changes. People often fall into he trap of thinking \"I like my job, I like where I live, I can't really leave it,\" but you have to think, is it really worth staying on that path your whole life? Being happy and comfortable isn't necessarily what's important in life, living is. There's always time to pivot in your life, don't stop changing the way you experience your existence.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mtp9kx/how_to_fix_life/gv1hzy7/"}
