You've done what you can on your own - I'd shift your focus to participating in activities with others. \n\nI'm in my mid to late 30s and have found it difficult myself to make friends, especially since I have an unconventional job and basically work for myself. I also don't drink, though even if I did, the bar scene at my age is kind of grim. That said, I like writing, so I went to the library and joined a weekly workshop group that meets to discuss our writing. It's a weird crew, one you'd never see together normally, based on age and other demographic detail. But I always feel better after.\n\nMaybe you could do something similar? Sports can work, local meetups, joining a gym, whatever. You mentioned meditation. I do Zen stuff - maybe you do too, and could join a sangha? I've also considered taking random college courses in subjects I'm interested in, at the local community college. \n\nOn the subject of meeting someone to date, I've been told it's pretty bleak out there for guys. It sounds like you have your life in order, so I'm wondering if being more social, per above, might be a good way to meet people in general, and potential partners specifically. That comes with the caveat that you should go into those social engagements for their own sake, not to meet someone necessarily. In my experience, that's when the good stuff happens.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mtp9kx/how_to_fix_life/gv19qqq/"}
