I'm glad you had such an awesome experience! I somehwat can relate. I haven't turned my phone off completely, but it's in \"Do Not Disturb\" and I've turned MOST of my notifications off. If I actually turned my phone off my mom would freak out and think I was dead if she couldn't get a hold of me, which I've been trying to kind of \"train\" her not to do. Sometimes, I'm just not a very talkative person and just don't feel like talking. \n\nI've also recently cut back on texting by about 50% and traded that for reading the Redwall series again. \n\nAlso, Spirited Away is a great movie and I love the crickets, too, until it's summertime and the cicadas take over, ugh.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fa4i0a/i_havent_intentionally_turned_my_phone_off_in/fivv00t/"}
