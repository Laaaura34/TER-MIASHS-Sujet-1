Pick 3 things you want to get done today and make sure you get them done.  If they are on a whiteboard in your room or something that buzzes on your phone you will be less likely to forget.  And I said 3 things but you can adjust the amount of items based on how you are doing that day or how big the items are.  Shaving your legs would be small but climbing a big mountain might take up most of the day, for example.\n\nA big stepping stone when dealing with my depression/anxiety is when I learned to stop resisting it.  When I feel it coming I just stop, take a breath and more or less think \"Alright, let's feel it\".  Sometimes it's just a quick, uncomfortable session that washes over me in seconds and I can immediately go back to what I am doing and sometimes the rest of the day might be a bit down but the main thing is it doesn't escalate.
