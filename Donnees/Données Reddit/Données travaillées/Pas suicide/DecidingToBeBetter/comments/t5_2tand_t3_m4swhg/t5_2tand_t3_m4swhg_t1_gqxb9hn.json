I don\u2019t look very good, I\u2019m not great at talking to people, I don\u2019t study at all, but there are these times \u2013 when something I\u2019ve read (and I read a lot of obscure, vague shit from all sorts of places) is relevant to a conversation, or in a class. And yes, to an extent I regurgitate that but only because I actually think it fits. And when I do that, an entire class of 120 people shuts up and looks at me with astonishment. And holy shit do I love hat feeling. The only gf I\u2019ve ever had (we\u2019ve broken up now) said that\u2019s the time I seemed the sexiest. The way I think or the way I can talk ie shut people up. Even other girls have confessed they developed a crush on me because of the way I can counter anti-feminist stances or even radical feminist stances. \nIt\u2019s like I had these fantasies when I was in school that I can speak in front of a lot of people, counter a point that almost everyone agrees with or can\u2019t stand against, and they\u2019d all be amazed by me. And that came true when I got into college. \nAnd now I have to work even harder, to get away from the one thing that gives me a sense of validation, all so that I can become that annoying person who\u2019s obsessed about whatever is wrong with the world but can\u2019t take a firm stance on anything? \nYou can see why that\u2019s suck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m4swhg/im_more_interested_in_appearing_smart_in_front_of/gqxb9hn/"}
