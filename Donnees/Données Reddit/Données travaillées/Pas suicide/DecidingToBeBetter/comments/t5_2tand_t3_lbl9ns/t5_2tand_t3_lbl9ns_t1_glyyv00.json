In that way you know which area you can work on yourself. I really recommend therapy for this (it has worked for me in this issue) but since that is not possible right know, it is probably a good start to look out for self help books (preferably by a licensed therapist or psychologist, not by some hobbyist) in the topic of recognizing and understanding your emotions and thoughts. There\u2019s probably some news articles (written by doctors) that might be helpful. And if it is an area of issue for you, self help books on self-confidence is always helpful. I would also recommend looking in to coping mechanisms around anxiety if that is also an area where you want to improve.\n\nEdit: I wanna add a tip for looking in to attachment styles as well. All this might be overwhelming but start with one thing and give yourself plenty of time to work through the topics.
