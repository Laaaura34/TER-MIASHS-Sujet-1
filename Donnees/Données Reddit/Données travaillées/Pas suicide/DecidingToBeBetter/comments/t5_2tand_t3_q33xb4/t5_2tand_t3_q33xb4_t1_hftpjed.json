Which was similar to your answer which was be your own best friend and everything else is secondary to your own happiness, and I assume that means not to become a huge selfish asshole, but what you said happiness comes from within with all the things that you like to do, and all the experiences that you either have or want to experience. Like I said in my post I fine when I'm alone I'm happy, and content, but once I see other people share their experiences with others I feel lonely, and Wonder why what is wrong with me? Why can't have/find someone to share those experience with, but I know I guess I always have had someone to share those experience with which was myself, and those negative thoughts shouldn't matter at all since they aren't truly my thoughts, but thoughts that were forced on to me by the media and people I see. I guess I was brain washed to believe that they were the things I need to live a healthy and happy life, so thank you. You really help me see what I need to focus on to live a happy life.\n\nEdit: sorry for another wall of text.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q33xb4/how_to_copedeal_with_not_having_any_close_friends/hftpjed/"}
