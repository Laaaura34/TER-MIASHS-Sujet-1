To expand on what you said - self-deprecating humor is great and fun in the short-term - can be both funny and a crutch.\n\nThe problem is - in the long-run, your brain isn't very good at distinguishing what narratives are jokes/social ritual, versus what is true. So you self-deprecate for long enough and it begins eroding your self-esteem without you realizing it. Your brain starts to believe it.\n\nHad a long talk with my psychologist and this was just 1 of many things we realized about my neurotic thinking patterns. Good luck OP! Happy for you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mswx2g/im_quitting_selfdeprecating_humour/gv1y1zp/"}
