Teasing yourself is great; shitting on yourself is not. \n\nSelf-deprecating humour is one of the most beautiful things a human being can do. It builds resiliency. It makes others laugh at no expense to them. It brings down the threshold of insecurity in a group, making others more comfortable to make their own jokes. It makes it okay for others around to be fallible. It's got to be something that doesn't diminish your value and you're comfortable with. For example, I think my knees look like they're on the wrong legs. It's weird, funny, gets a laugh when I mention it at the beach, no one gives a shit and everyone else feels better about their insignificant flaws in bathing suits.\n\nSelf defecation, shitting on yourself, is not okay. It's needy. Takes energy from other people as they have to respond to it. It cements your identity as less than you are. Learning how to take a compliment is one of those things. I use to be bad at taking compliments, everyone kinda is except narcissists. We are our own worst critics. \n\nI learned to say \"thank you for saying that\" though. It's great. Acknowledges the compliment, thanks the compliment giver, doesn't deflect, allows the compliment to be absorbed a bit but I don't feel that \"imposter syndrome\" sensation if I don't fully agree with it.\n\nBe good to yourself. Tease your self. Let compliments linger, accept them graciously. Be kind to those around you. You sound like you're on the right track to being your authentic self. Good luck out there.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mswx2g/im_quitting_selfdeprecating_humour/guz0vcz/"}
