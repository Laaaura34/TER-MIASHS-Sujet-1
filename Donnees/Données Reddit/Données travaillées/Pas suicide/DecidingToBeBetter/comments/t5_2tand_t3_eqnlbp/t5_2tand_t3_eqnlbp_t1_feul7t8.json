I crochet, and I fell off of it for the same reasons as you. However, back in November my boyfriend and I took a road trip to Michigan and on the way there and back I made 2 hats. Those 2 small projects helped me get back to it and now I can't wait to finish this blanket and move on to making something new again! I have a lot of babys to make blankets for and I'm so excited!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eqnlbp/the_joy_of_making_something/feul7t8/"}
