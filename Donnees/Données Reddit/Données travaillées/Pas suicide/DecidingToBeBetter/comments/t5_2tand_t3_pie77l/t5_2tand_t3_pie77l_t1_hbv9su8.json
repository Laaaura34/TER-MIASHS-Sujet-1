It\u2019s a false construct made to I guess make people feel anxiety about not having a partner/marriage/conforming.\n\nI guess someone could apply it to women if they wanted..? I stand by that there is no wall for anyone ever though. Man, woman, gay straight can adopt at any age, or have surrogate, or get married and fall in love and in any order. \n\nHarsh to ascribe the wall to women of a certain age, as if their only function is to reproduce. What about the woman who is born and is naturally infertile? What about the woman who is in an accident at 13 and can never have children?  Going on about their impending fertility all their life to women reduces them to a weird birthing vessel instead of a human being.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pie77l/turned_29_this_year_and_im_having_a_quarter_life/hbv9su8/"}
