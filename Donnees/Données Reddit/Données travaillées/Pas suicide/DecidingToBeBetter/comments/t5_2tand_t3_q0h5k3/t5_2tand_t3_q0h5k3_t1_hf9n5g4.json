This is advice I would never have given 8 years ago, but you can\u2019t see all the ways you ended up here, and all the underlying patterns you\u2019re recreating- you have a good start, but the benefits of a good therapist are unbelievable when you get there, and they are forever. You\u2019ll have to work at it to find a good one for you (not all therapists are right for everyone), someone who will hold you accountable & push in places where you don\u2019t want to talk- that\u2019s where the gold is, exactly where you don\u2019t want to look. You can\u2019t do it on your own. You need another brain to analyze your brain. You can do this, but there will be setbacks, bad days & awful days. Having a therapist with you also means your closest relationships get a little more breathing room to support you as they best can, rather than trying to get at your psyche. Good luck OP, I\u2019m sending you good energy.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0h5k3/today_im_quitting_cocaine/hf9n5g4/"}
