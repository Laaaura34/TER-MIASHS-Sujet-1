It took relapsing on my trauma to even wanna quit it. Most coke users don\u2019t think they\u2019re addicts because they can go a day or 2 without it. They say \u201cI just do it\u201d and seem functional. But in reality that\u2019s the drug talking and controlling your mind. Tomorrow is when the withdrawals will hit me possible the next day. It\u2019s going to suck but it\u2019s a fight I\u2019m going to make. I want my life back!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0h5k3/today_im_quitting_cocaine/hfb5bx9/"}
