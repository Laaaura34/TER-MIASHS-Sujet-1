I know from experience that getting clean is the east part, staying clean is another thing all together. If the battery of AA/NA fellowships don\u2019t work for u there is smart recovery and refuge (Buddhist) recovery programs that work very well to address the educational portion of your recovery. Fellowship is paramount in recovery wherever u decide to land because the root of our addictions generally revolve around stuffing ourselves with facsimiles in leu of interpersonal relationships. In addition to recovery services it\u2019s generally advised that a client should seek help from a mental health provider, especially when there\u2019s complex ptsd and trauma. A blend of DBT, CBT , group therapy can be very helpful during the healing/grieving process. I wish u\nthe best of luck . Remember it truly is one step at a time , one day at a time.
