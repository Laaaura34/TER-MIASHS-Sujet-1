I'm 2.5 years clean from coke, after doing it daily for nearly 2 years. The biggest thing that has kept me clean is THERAPY!!! You need to find a good therapist to heal your PTSD (I have it too), otherwise you will continue to play wack-a-mole with substances and new maladaptive coping mechanisms. The withdrawals will suck for like a week, but then it gets way easier. Delete and block all dealers' numbers, block everyone on social media who could possibly get you coke. You got this!!! PM me if you want more advice!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0h5k3/today_im_quitting_cocaine/hf9xxb9/"}
