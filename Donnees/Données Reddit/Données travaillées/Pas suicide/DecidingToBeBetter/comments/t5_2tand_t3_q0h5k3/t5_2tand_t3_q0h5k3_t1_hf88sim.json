I too have died. This is going to be the single greatest day of your life...and the best part? It gets so much fuckin better every single day! Since ive gotten clean, ive changed my life. I got to watch nephews and nieces grow up. I get to watch mine now. Life is really shitty sometimes and it gets really hard at points. But no matter how shitty life is, its always better than the alternative of not having this life. As long as we live, we can strive for better...to be better. Addiction is as bad as death, if not worse. In death, you have no idea of the life you left behind. When we are addicts, we always have that vivid memory of what it was. Now you begin to get that back. Co gratulations and if you ever need to talk, please pm me. Im over 10 years free of that demon.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0h5k3/today_im_quitting_cocaine/hf88sim/"}
