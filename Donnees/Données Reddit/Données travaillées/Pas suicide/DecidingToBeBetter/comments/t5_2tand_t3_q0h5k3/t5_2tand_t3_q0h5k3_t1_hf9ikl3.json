I\u2019ve been clean for 9 months now and have a similar story with a heavily addicted ex fianc\u00e9 as well. After 6 years with our abusive relationship, drama, ruined relationships, lost jobs, prostitution, trouble with the law and debt I decided I was done for our children who were suffering because of our selfishness making their lives more difficult. We have both overdosed various times and I was just done. Once you really work past those crucial first two weeks, it\u2019s mental maintenance from there on out and it\u2019s does get easier. You can fuck up your entire life and if you\u2019re lucky enough to get a chance to be better, do it, you won\u2019t look back, I certainly won\u2019t and I hope you don\u2019t either. All the best!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0h5k3/today_im_quitting_cocaine/hf9ikl3/"}
