I believe in you. You\u2019re already doing great so far by just posting this. \n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to ask anyone for help. In order to help my past traumas I went to a therapist. \nI\u2019ve seen a few before and I hated them. Then, I tried a new one and sat down and told him how I\u2019d like therapy to go down. I don\u2019t need sympathy or you to patronize me. I just need help. \nPlus, don\u2019t be afraid to go to one session and ask them questions about how they handle therapy. Each therapist is very different and it is extremely important to find someone you vibe with. \nI\u2019d suggest it but I never force it. Just keep it in the back of your mind if you feel like you\u2019re struggling working through something particular on your own.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q0h5k3/today_im_quitting_cocaine/hf8o513/"}
