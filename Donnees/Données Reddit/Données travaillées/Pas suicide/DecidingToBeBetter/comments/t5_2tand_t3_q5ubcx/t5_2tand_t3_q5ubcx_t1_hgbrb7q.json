I've had size 11 feet since I was 14. HATED shoe shopping as a teen. My sister is 5 inches taller than me and has smaller feet which only made me more embarrassed. Fast forward 7 years and I don't even think twice about it (unless the store doesn't even carry that size at all). \n\nFun story - my uncle had size 18 shoes as a teen. Growing up the youngest of 5 kids in a poor Irish family, he could never get shoes that fit and was always embarrassed by the ill fitting hand-me downs on his huge feet. My grandmother eventually wrote a few NBA players and explained the story and one of them (cant remember who) actually sent him a few pairs! \n\nHaving proper fitting shoes is such a great feeling no matter what size!
