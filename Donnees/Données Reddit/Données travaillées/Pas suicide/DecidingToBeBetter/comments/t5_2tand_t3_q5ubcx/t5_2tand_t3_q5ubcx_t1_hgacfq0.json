I come from a family of *miniscule* people. Dad is 5'6, mum is 5'1 (size 3 shoe), sister is 5'4ish (size 5 shoe), grandparents similar height, and they're all very petite. Even the men. Me? I made it to size 5'8, larger frame, with a size 7 shoe. Or so I've been saying for years. Odd shaped toes, blisters galore, and a lot of pain later: I'm a size 8.5. I like being in the real world rather than my family home, because I don't feel very large, but I certainly have some complexes about my size -- almost all of my friends and partners have been ridiculously tall\ud83d\ude02.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ubcx/i_finally_went_up_to_a_womens_size_10_and_now_my/hgacfq0/"}
