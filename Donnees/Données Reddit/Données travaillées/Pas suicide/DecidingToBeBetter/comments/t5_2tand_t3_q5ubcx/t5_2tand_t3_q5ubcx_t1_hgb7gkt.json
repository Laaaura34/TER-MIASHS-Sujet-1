I stopped being able to play dress up in my mom's shoes before 2nd grade. My feet finally stopped at size 11, which is just out of range for a lot of brands. \n\nI was just at a storage unit helping clear things out for my someday MIL, and she wanted to pass on some of her nicer shoes, but sadly she's a size 6, just like my mom.\n\nI have big feet for a woman, but small feet for a man, so I like to go to the thrift store and buy up all of the fancy dress shoes from guys with small feet.\n\nThe sad part is that I'm not even an Amazonian goddess.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q5ubcx/i_finally_went_up_to_a_womens_size_10_and_now_my/hgb7gkt/"}
