If it helps any, you will be glad that you did what you are doing in the long run. The memories you make now will likely be as important as, if not more important than, other memories you have made with him throughout your life. Not to mention, it likely means the world to him right now. My only advice from experience, if I may, is to not neglect yourself entirely in this process. Yes, this is a hard time for you both, but that both includes you. That said, you sound like you are there for him through it all, which is something that, some day, you wouldn't change for the world if my experience is any indication. Times like this can, obviously, be incredibly difficult, but the memories last forever. If it means anything coming from a stranger, I think you are doing exactly what you should be doing. Just try to enjoy your time together. For many people, it can help with the healing process. I wish you the greatest strength in your journey to come.
