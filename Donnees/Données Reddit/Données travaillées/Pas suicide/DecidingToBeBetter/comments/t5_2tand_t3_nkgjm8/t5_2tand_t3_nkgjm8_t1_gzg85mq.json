Im in a similar boat; an ex and I split a while ago. My place was good but then he dropped off boxes upon boxes of stuff in my new space. Although I've dug through alot, quite a bit still remains.\nI know on the other side of purging the remains is mental clarity, but living alone definitely \"justifies\" my hesitancy to begin again.\nIt's been over 6 months.\nThanks for sharing your story, I'm feeling motivated to get this stuff out of here.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nkgjm8/i_decided_to_deep_clean_my_apartment_after_months/gzg85mq/"}
