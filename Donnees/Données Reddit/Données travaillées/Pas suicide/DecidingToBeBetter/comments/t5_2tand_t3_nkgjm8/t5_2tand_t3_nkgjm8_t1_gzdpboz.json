I was in this same position about a year back, realized that the room was just a reflection of what mess I was mentally. I use to go the extra mile in cleaning my room back in college. I had to examine what I felt back in university and found a massive shift had happened on a psychological level. Too tired to care, and take care of myself. This helped me understand this cause and effect between how you treat yourself and how you treat your surrounding. One deep clean session and my God what a difference it made!! \n\nI was sleeping better, eating better. Cleaning basically became my anchor and standard for never falling below that, and this on a psychological level allowed me to control spiralling down to a certain level of thought that is ultimately self-degrading.\n\nThis feeling may ebb in the future, so keep a note of how you're feeling now, and the power this little act holds to bring you back. Hoping for the best for you!\n\nOn a lighter note, I also started using fabric softener while washing my clothes and what a wonderful decision it turned out to be \ud83d\ude00. These habits transfer to other areas of life as well.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nkgjm8/i_decided_to_deep_clean_my_apartment_after_months/gzdpboz/"}
