Hope it works out for you man. You\u2019re right purpose doesn\u2019t come naturally, what comes natural for us men is to always strive for more (I kind of just assumed you\u2019re a guy). But that means you can never truly reach any point where you can say you \u201cgot\u201d there. The ambition never stops. That\u2019s why so many people burn out. Always chasing something that\u2019s always ahead. Like a carrot on a stick. Gotta learn to enjoy the moment and be one with the chase. \n\nAnd remember always clean your room every day :) do 3 minutes here and there to keep it clean consistently in stead of letting it get dirty and then clean it. Your home is a reflection of your mind in a sense. Messy mind messy home. Keep home clean and make your bed as soon as you get up. You\u2019ll feel much better contrary to what some people may insist.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nkgjm8/i_decided_to_deep_clean_my_apartment_after_months/gzg4y2j/"}
