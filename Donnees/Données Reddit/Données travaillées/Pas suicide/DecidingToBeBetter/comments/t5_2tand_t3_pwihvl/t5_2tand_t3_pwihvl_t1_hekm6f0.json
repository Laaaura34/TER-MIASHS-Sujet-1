I am a non-shy introvert, and am actually quite skilled at navigating social settings. However after the event, I definitely need time to myself for a few days to recharge and do \u201cme\u201d things. People are always shocked when I tell them I\u2019m on the introverted side of the spectrum, and it\u2019s usually because they associate the word with \u201cshyness\u201d.  For people looking to understand introversion, I highly recommend the book \u201cQuiet\u201d by Susan Cain.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwihvl/if_youre_deciding_to_be_better_start_with_this/hekm6f0/"}
