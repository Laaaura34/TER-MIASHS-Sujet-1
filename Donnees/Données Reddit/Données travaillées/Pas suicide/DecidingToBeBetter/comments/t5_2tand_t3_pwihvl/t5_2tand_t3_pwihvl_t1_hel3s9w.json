Perhaps they are just lonely or shy rather than purely introverted.  Introverts usually enjoy being alone or in smaller groups, but of course can still be lonely at times. There\u2019s definitely a difference between being introverted and feeling isolated. Anyway, wasn\u2019t trying to be critical, just wanted to point out that introversion isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing.  I actually feel exhausted mentally after social events and revived by something like taking a long walk by myself or having a day to myself to work on art projects.  My partner, on the other hand, feels incredibly restless doing those things, and needs to interact with people much more than I do.  Needless to say, I\u2019ve had a much easier time during this period of social isolation. \ud83d\ude0a", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwihvl/if_youre_deciding_to_be_better_start_with_this/hel3s9w/"}
