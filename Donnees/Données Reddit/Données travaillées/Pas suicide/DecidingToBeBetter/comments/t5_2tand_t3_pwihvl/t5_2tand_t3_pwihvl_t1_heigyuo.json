I\u2019m super hard on myself when it comes to being active and working out. I\u2019ve compromised, maybe I don\u2019t have to run 3 miles every single day, but I can def be active every day, in whatever way I feel up for it. Walking 3 miles still works for me, as long as I get out there, and as long as I\u2019m nice to myself regardless! It\u2019s way less energy to be forgiving of yourself, as opposed to beating yourself up constantly.
