It makes me sad to hear that so many introverts want to change who they are because of this. \n\nIt makes sense that extroverts would be more vocal, it\u2019s part of who they are. Introverts would (generally) rather do anything than call attention to themselves. Our society is very much one where \u201cthe squeaky wheel gets the grease\u201d. Those who speak up are more likely to get what they want so society has been set up for extroverts. \n\nBut introverts play a very important part and I invite anyone to learn more about the spectrum, but specifically introverts, so that this narrative can be shifted.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwihvl/if_youre_deciding_to_be_better_start_with_this/hel78g1/"}
