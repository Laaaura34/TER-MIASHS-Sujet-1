They\u2019re not though and that\u2019s why I posted this. I think it\u2019s important to know that there is a difference and for us to acknowledge it. \n\nI don\u2019t have much knowledge about whether a person can become an introvert or vice versa. But I don\u2019t believe that you can change what you are.  However, I do think that if you\u2019re nearer the centre, you will have some situations where people will give you energy and some where they don\u2019t. In that case, whether you are an introvert or extrovert depends on where you get your energy MOST of the time. \n\nOP, it sounds like you may be an extrovert that struggles due to shyness or social anxiety. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve found a way to get to a place where you\u2019re more comfortable. \n\nI do wonder if your last sentence \u201c\u2026which is what a lot of people want as well.\u201d refers to other people wanting you to be an extrovert or society in general being set up for extroverts? I think it\u2019s worth saying that society often looks down on introverts (combatting that thought is one of the reasons I put in the link to famous introverts). \n\nOne of my fave Ted Talks is this one by Susan Cain on introversion. If you have 20 mins it is sooo worth your time. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/c0KYU2j0TM4", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwihvl/if_youre_deciding_to_be_better_start_with_this/heiwmj5/"}
