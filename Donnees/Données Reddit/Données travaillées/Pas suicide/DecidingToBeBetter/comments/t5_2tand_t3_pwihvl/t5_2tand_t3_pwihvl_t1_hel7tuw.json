One of my comments above has a Ted Talk by her on this topic and it\u2019s fascinating. I agree with reading the book but for those who don\u2019t have time or interest, some articles or the Ted Talk are a good start. \n\nI haven\u2019t read Quiet but my husband has and we have the book. He\u2019s much more of an introvert than I am but like you is very good at social events. I\u2019m closer to the centre of the spectrum but not quite as good at social events as he is. People really are taken aback when they\u2019re told he\u2019s more of an introvert than I am.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwihvl/if_youre_deciding_to_be_better_start_with_this/hel7tuw/"}
