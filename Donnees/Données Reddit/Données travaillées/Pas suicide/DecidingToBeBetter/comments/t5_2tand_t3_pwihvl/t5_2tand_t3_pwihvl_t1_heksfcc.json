We can change so much of our behavior and habits that I would assume we can change this as well. It's something that is more a part of who we are than a habit, so it would be way more difficult (if it's even possible). Then again, I do not know whether or not this is something so hardwired that it's unchangeable, so you might just as well be right. \n\nThe last sentence refers mostly to my observations here. I see a lot of posts like \"I'm introverted, how do I become an extravert?\" or \"How can I told to people if I'm an introvert?\" things like that. And yes, there are lots of successful introverts, but the extraverts are generally more vocal about it. Which is why I think people believe you need to be an extravert to be \"successful\". \n\nThat's actually an excellent and interesting question you bring up there in the middle. I've been through times in high school where I was bullied pretty much on the daily and I know that has had a huge effect on me. So it might very well be as you say, or it could be a shift through deciding to do so. I honestly don't know which, but it's definitely an interesting thought!\n\nI'll check out the video when I have time later today.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwihvl/if_youre_deciding_to_be_better_start_with_this/heksfcc/"}
