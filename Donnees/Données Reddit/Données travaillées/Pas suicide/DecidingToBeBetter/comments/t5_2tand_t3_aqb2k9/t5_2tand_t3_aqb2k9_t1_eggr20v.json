Everything comes at a cost, maybe you wouldn't have formed the same relationships with people, maybe you wouldn't have the energy for another hobby you love but fail to see as beneficial?\n\nIf you want to be a composer then start composing. You ARE a composer. You don't have to become Mozart to consider yourself a composer. If I wanted to become a painter but failed to realize I was one after just one water color then I'm forever shackled to an unobtainable goal. I AM a painter when I paint. If you fail to see this then you don't actually find interest in the art, but the end game, that which can never be reached.\n\nThere's no reason to be hard on yourself for not dedicating time in your past to a pursuit without an end game. Enjoy the process, if you don't then you're not doing it for the right reasons.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/aqb2k9/if_past_you_actually_started_to_work_towards_your/eggr20v/"}
