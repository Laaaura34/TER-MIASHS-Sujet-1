Many of us form habits out of the crutches we use to avoid the existential fear of death, or perhaps our own loneliness. Whether it's sex, drugs, video games or other hedonistic forms of escapism, they all allow us to escape to another world, devoid of this feeling.\n\nWhat we lack is love. Not the love most people talk about - many people believe in a selfish form of love, born out of lust or selfishness. What I mean is a selfless, unconditional love. A love that says you want what's best for them, a love that says you want them to be happy - that when you see them happy, *it* *makes you happy*.\n\nThat kind of love.
