I'm just realizing this same thing myself. It's hard for me to open up to others because I fear being judged or rejected or hurt, and because of that I only have a few people in my life that I'm really, truly close with. I moved recently and am now an hour or two away from them, and with their lives being as busy as they are, they don't really have much free time to connect with me at the moment. So for the last few weeks, I've been feeling very much the same way you have, in a sense. Not totally lacking emotional intimacy, but lacking time with the people that I usually experience that with. It has me feeling really lonely and sad as well.\n\nI'm glad you came to this revelation. It's true... life is not really worth living if you're only doing it for yourself. It's other people and the relationships we build with them that makes all of this bullshit worthwhile. Keep on keeping on. I have faith in you. Change is within your grasp, if you want it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iryab0/i_woke_up_this_morning_in_a_fit_of_slobbering/g555y3v/"}
