There often are others in our lives we might not notice who care deeply for and value us but we don\u2019t see it. This is not to say the next move is guilt or beating yourself up if proves true.\n\nMy main point is that part of building more meaningful connections is to reflect on who has needed us or been there in ways we had not previously registered. \n\nRelated: moving towards building these deeper relationships now requires acknowledging that one isn\u2019t building meaningful bonds for oneself (like collecting good people), but instead building mutualistic bonds/relationships with others. Team effort :) \n\nKeeping that in mind might be useful if find yourself slipping into assessing individuals only in their capacity to become dear to you rather that allowing yourself to live a life where you and others can become dear to each other through life experiences.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iryab0/i_woke_up_this_morning_in_a_fit_of_slobbering/g55rlbz/"}
