You would think being in a room full of addicts would be a bad time, but a room full of recovering addicts who take inventory on themselves and monitor their behavior and thinking patterns is a surreal experience. To see gods grace in these people lives makes me realize how I\u2019ve also been blessed, and learning to give back is what keeps them successful. Not only has my life been saved, but I have family anywhere in the world at a moments notice. I wish there were cognitive behavioral therapy classes spread around the globe like AA/NA, maybe what we see in the news would be a little different.
