I have cried and cried about how much I cared for him and wish there were a way for him to understand it wasn\u2019t personal. However he may not ever read this knowing this is basically my throwaway account. These are things I really wanted to tell him but I decided to share here because ultimately I want to be better. \n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not trying to get him back but as break ups go, I\u2019m really grieving. It brings me comfortability when  I hear others say they\u2019ve gone through the same thing or dated a person like me because it makes me realize.\n\nI will definitely tell my therapist though, thank you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of8s8b/i_realized_i_was_the_toxic_one_in_the_relationship/h4d8krv/"}
