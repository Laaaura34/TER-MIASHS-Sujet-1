He can\u2019t blame you for not seeing a problem when he didn\u2019t address his discomfort and just expected you to know, and instead he just broke up with you at his breaking point when he should have told you how he felt before. You two could\u2019ve taken a break if that\u2019s what you both needed. Overall I\u2019m sorry you broke up but congrats on healing! \n\nYou do not have to be \u201cfully healed\u201d to have a healthy relationship, or to be loved. You just have to be willing or try to work on issues that you find in yourself, and you\u2019re doing that and you should be proud of yourself!! Sometimes we are the toxic ones, and to have enough strength to admit and get help for that is always incredible.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of8s8b/i_realized_i_was_the_toxic_one_in_the_relationship/h4dh7nb/"}
