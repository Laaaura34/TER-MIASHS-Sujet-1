My last relationship was toxic as all hell... and a lot of that was on me. I was needy and possessive because I thought that's what love was. I was very similar to you \"if you loved me you would ect.ect.ect.\". I'm glad you could self reflect and pick out those behaviors that need to change. I can tell you it's hard, I still have that \"if they loved me\" thought from time to time, but it gets easier to not act on. It just becomes a thought that you can shake away and be like \"no, they love me and love isnt conditional like I thought it was. Love isnt control\" \n\nI'm so proud of you for taking steps to shed the toxic behaviors. I'm so proud that you realized your mistake and didnt blame yourself. You took responsibility and are trying to become a better person and that is wonderful. Keep up the good work and know that some internet stranger understands you and is rooting for you \ud83d\udc9c", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of8s8b/i_realized_i_was_the_toxic_one_in_the_relationship/h4e4khd/"}
