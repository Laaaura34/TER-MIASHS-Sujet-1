I wish I could\u2019ve found a story like yours at the time, so thank you for sharing.  I always found \u201chow to cut toxic people from your life\u201d or \u201chow to spot a toxic person\u201d but never \u201chow to cope with the trauma you\u2019ve caused to yourself and others as a toxic person,\u201d etc.  It\u2019s not easy to find self-admitted toxic people sharing their experience towards getting better.
