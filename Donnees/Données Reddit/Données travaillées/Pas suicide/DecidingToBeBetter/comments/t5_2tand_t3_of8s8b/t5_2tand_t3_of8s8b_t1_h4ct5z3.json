All the good intentions in the world can be easily overwhelmed by the alphabet soup of trauma and trouble you listed. That pain gets in your way in the best times and overrules rational thought in the worst. As somebody on a mental wellness journey of their own, my advice is to:\n\n1. Take your meds. If they don\u2019t work the way they\u2019re supposed to, or you\u2019re not getting the results you want, or you\u2019re suffering side effects, tell your doctor, but keep taking your meds every day at the same time(s) until you have tapered off per doc\u2019s instructions. \n\n2. Work on your sleep hygiene. Sleep is the best indicator of mental wellness\u2014or illness. Figure out what you need to function optimally (not just what your can survive on) and get that much sleep 90% or the time or better. Sleep is a chicken/egg thing\u2014not getting enough sleep makes you mentally unwell keeps you from getting enough sleep makes you mentally unwell. Break that cycle, sleep, and get better. \n\n3. Don\u2019t settle on your medical team. If your therapist isn\u2019t listening, or your prescribing doc is hard to get ahold of when you\u2019re in crisis, or any of them don\u2019t treat you with respect, GET A NEW ONE. Keep the one you have until you find a replacement, but never accept second-best mental health pros for a single appointment longer than you have to. \n\nYou\u2019ve got a great attitude and a genuine desire to shape yourself into a person you\u2019re proud of\u2014you\u2019re going to succeed and you\u2019ll be 100x the person you were yesterday. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of8s8b/i_realized_i_was_the_toxic_one_in_the_relationship/h4ct5z3/"}
