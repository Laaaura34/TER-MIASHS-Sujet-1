For his I wrote about things that I appreciated from him and that I hope he heals because this was not personal. I think it will take him awhile to read it just because I know he\u2019s hurt and I don\u2019t want to manipulate him into thinking I\u2019m begging for him back. I am so guilty about hurting him that I wish I could help him understand.\n\nEdit 1: yeah so I realized I am blocked. On every social media imaginable. I think it\u2019s better for him and me because I\u2019ve become too attached. I felt the need to talk to him after the break up. For what? To make sure he knew that I wasn\u2019t trying to hurt him. But I realized that he needs to heal on his own and I have no way in contacting him anymore! With all the things I\u2019ve written, I\u2019m just starting on my journey and I\u2019m still making mistakes. I\u2019m trying my best though. Just started medication today so at least that\u2019s going :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of8s8b/i_realized_i_was_the_toxic_one_in_the_relationship/h4d7qr2/"}
