I tried to be curt and just make it clear to him that I\u2019m not interested in reconnecting and to never contact me again. But it\u2019s nice knowing people change and improve, even if they left enough scars on you to never want to be involved with them again. Happily, a few months after I found my currently bf who constantly shows me what emotional maturity and a healthy relationship looks like, so that I can address my scars from my last toxic relationship.  You hope your ex finds someone who can give him love, but I hope you can too, and that you one day will model what a healthy relationship looks like for someone else", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of8s8b/i_realized_i_was_the_toxic_one_in_the_relationship/h4bssfs/"}
