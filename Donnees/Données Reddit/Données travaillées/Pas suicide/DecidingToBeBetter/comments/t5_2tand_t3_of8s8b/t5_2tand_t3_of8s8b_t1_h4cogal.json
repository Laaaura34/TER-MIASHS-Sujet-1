I have ptsd, dealtg with lifelong  depression, severe addiction, spent 6 years in prison because of my addiction. Im 27m btw, got out a year and a half ago, it was for Armed Robbery. I'm very similar to you in relationships. \n\nHowever, it was when i decided to work on myself, on self improvement (which i use psychedelics beautifully to work thru the issues as opposed to just remedies) that my character flaws and dependencies began to subside. Maybe try psychedelics? Not for everyone but i wouldnt be here today without the perspective and insight psychedelics have allowed me to experience. Its not possible to truly become yourself without then in my opinion\n\nI've been dating one girl since i got out of prison and she is a blessing. I only think i even meet her bc i spent 6 years alone and lonely and somehow we attracted eachother into our lives.\n\n  You'll be okay darling", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of8s8b/i_realized_i_was_the_toxic_one_in_the_relationship/h4cogal/"}
