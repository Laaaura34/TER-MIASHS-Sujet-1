I\u2019m hoping my therapist will help me learn that when my anxiety flares up and I\u2019m about to say something stupid/wrong/hurtful, I can be self-aware enough to stop myself. It\u2019ll take time but I really want to learn how to monitor myself.\n\nI think my baby lizard brain is comparable to what I call my anxious self. I look back and realize how I made problems out of no where and I wish I could tell her to stop back in the day.\n\nThank you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of8s8b/i_realized_i_was_the_toxic_one_in_the_relationship/h4daurz/"}
