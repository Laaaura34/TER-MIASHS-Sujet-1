I called a counseling crisis hotline for immediate help and to untangle my thoughts. I've set up intake appointment to discuss medication and a therapist. Although this relationship\nhas ended and I am still grieving over it, he pushed me to get help. Though not intentional, I never want to hurt people by manipulating, gas light, or guilt-trip anyone\never again. It will take work to retrain my mind to be healthy but I am willing to do this for my own sake. It'll be healthier for my relationships with the people who are still in my life too. I'm ready to be better.\n\nOP, may I make a daily affirmation out of this?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/of8s8b/i_realized_i_was_the_toxic_one_in_the_relationship/h4c99i0/"}
