(I sound wise but I don\u2019t follow my own advice sometimes) I understand being anxious for sure, but try to stray away from calling yourself stupid, there\u2019s no reason to degrade yourself for things out of your control.\n\nIt\u2019s good that you and your friends have a system worked out so you\u2019re not around it if you don\u2019t don\u2019t want to be.\n\nWhen it comes to being fearful, try daily affirmations, it may feel silly at first, but brains are very silly and very programmable. Telling yourself you are smart, kind, fearless, etc, tell yourself what you need to hear everyday and you might start believing it. Also journaling helps some people. Forums like Reddit, and Reddit itself. Talking to your friends and family. Therapy if you can afford it (I can\u2019t so I find whatever other ways I can to help myself).\n\nJust NEVER give up on yourself. You are capable of so much whether you know it or not. And always be kind to yourself, be patient, be caring.
