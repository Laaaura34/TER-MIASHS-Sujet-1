Knowing your age would help explain it, but maybe your beliefs about marijuana is affecting the way you feel on marijuana. You believe it is bad, you find it scary, you don\u2019t understand why anyone would do it. So don\u2019t do it. Tell your friends you don\u2019t want to, if they don\u2019t understand that then they aren\u2019t your friends, but if you also want to be a good friend you should not judge your friends for finding it relaxing and fun. I smoke every single day, before I started smoking I hated myself and couldn\u2019t be productive and I couldn\u2019t silence my intrusive thoughts. It is helpful for some people, and very unhelpful for others. No matter what tho, if you go into it thinking it\u2019ll be bad, it will be. If you do decide to smoke again, go into it with intention, take very little, and do something you enjoy with people that you trust and love being around.
