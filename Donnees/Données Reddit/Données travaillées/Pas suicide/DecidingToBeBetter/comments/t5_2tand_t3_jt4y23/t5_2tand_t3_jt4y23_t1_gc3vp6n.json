I feel isolated from everyone in my family. Parents, siblings, aunts and uncles who are all in this web of trauma. \nIt feels very lonely. I am not one of them. I am an outsider looking in. Studying them as I try to understand myself. As I try to heal myself and do better than I was ever taught. \nI look at their mental illness, the generational trauma, the issues. But also their unwillingness to look in the mirror. Their comfort in the repeated cycles. \n\nI\u2019ve lost myself for many years as I drowned in their trauma. As the most \u201cnormal\u201d one in a family they never acknowledged that I was a child. They made me forget that I was a child. I felt the burden of supporting them from a young age. I had to be the emotional support. I had to parent my own mother. I wanted to save them so much that I lost myself. \n\nPeople often recommended the book \u201cit didnt start with you\u201d which is about generational trauma and I brought it and I am going to start reading it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jt4y23/i_just_want_to_cheer_on_anyone_whos_deciding_to/gc3vp6n/"}
