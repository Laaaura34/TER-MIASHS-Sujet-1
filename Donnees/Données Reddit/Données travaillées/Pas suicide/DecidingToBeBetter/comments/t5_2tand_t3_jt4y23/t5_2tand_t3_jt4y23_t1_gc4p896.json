Honestly I would have a very different life if I weren't second generation to cycle breakers. My parents both came from abusive and divorced homes but had a long happy marriage (my mom passed in a recent year or I'd have said \"have\", but they made it as long as they could) and they raised kids that didn't turn out too bad.\n\nBut if they didn't make all those changes I'd be in poor health with bad habits and a messed up life blaming the world because that's all my extended family knows. I'm so thankful I have it easy but by endless respect for my parents and their effort doesn't mean I think they were flawless either and I still have habits to break that my parents or siblings didn't try to.\n\nYou're doing the hardest work but the most rewarding when you get through some of it.
