It's an incredibly powerful decision to make. I'm a big fan of it for two reasons: \n\n1) Once you see the patterns for what they are, you remove the burden of guilt from yourself, and you do so without placing it on another person. We're targeting the pattern itself, rather than the people perpetuating it.
