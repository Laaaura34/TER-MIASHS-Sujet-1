I've mostly navigated my way here by consistently demonstrating exceptional performance, comprehension and an ability to innovate at higher levels of cellular research. Academically, I personally only hold 3 degrees...1 technical, and 2 BS degrees in biomedical & clinical engineering and in electrical engineering. \n\nThe rest of the journey to get here was just maneuvering my way through my career field and a bit of luck, proving myself as a sort of prodigy, continously talking and defending at medical board meetings on a near weekly basis and establishing rapport that way, getting 4 different biologic IND's (Investigational New Drug) passed through the FDA and into P2/P3, etc. My co-founders and advisors for our company are much more formally qualified, as they hold post doc level training and are considered world class experts in their respective fields, have published several high impact peer-reviewed research papers, one is still a full time university professor of immunology and conducts top-level research in the field, and so on. We have a pretty diverse field.\n\nBut returning to your original question, I did not arrive to this position through totally traditional means, ie acquiring all of the higher level formal degrees etc.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gmrb74/yesterday_i_resigned_from_my_job_to_fully_devote/fr6uttl/"}
