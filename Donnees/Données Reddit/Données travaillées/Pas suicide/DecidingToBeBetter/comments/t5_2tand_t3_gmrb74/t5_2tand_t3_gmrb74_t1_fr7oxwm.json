Stepped away recently due to the pandemic. I can say 3 solid pieces of advice. \n\nKnow if you are running TO something or FROM something. Run from bears and run towards your exact purpose. \n\nYou will not be fulfilled with the results of your business's success if you will only be fufilled by your business' s success. You are not a part of the results. They are your artwork. \n\nTread with extreme caution. Do not get sucked into the ego and try to shortcut. Your best friend is you admitting every day that you do not know how to run a business so do not pretend. Every day commit to hours of learning business science. Commit to finding help. Never tell yourself you are savvy enough. \n\nBest of luck because it is time to place your bets.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gmrb74/yesterday_i_resigned_from_my_job_to_fully_devote/fr7oxwm/"}
