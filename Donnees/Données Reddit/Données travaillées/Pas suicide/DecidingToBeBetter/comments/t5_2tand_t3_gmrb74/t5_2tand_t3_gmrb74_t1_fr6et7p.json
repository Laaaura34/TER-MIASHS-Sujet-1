I don't have much direct experience with CRISPR, as that was not my personal project. I have a few friends doing research with that technology and it sounds like it is very promising but there are challenges to everything. \n\nWithout being an expert on this, I won't comment further as it would just be my speculation based on academic articles I've read. \n\nOur research has to do with genetically engineered cellular nanoparticles to take advantage of certain processes and pathways that the body (and biological invaders) naturally utilize. Over the years we have identified specific molecules and pathways that appear to be extremely effective towards our indications, and they have shown *knock on wood* absolutely no safety side effects likely due to the fact that we are just manipulating naturally occurring events, molecules and mechanisms. Hope that helps! I promise that I'll give more detaile info out to the world once my legal team permits us to!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gmrb74/yesterday_i_resigned_from_my_job_to_fully_devote/fr6et7p/"}
