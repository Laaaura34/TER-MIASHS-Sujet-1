It's a 7 week course basically designed to help you reflect inwards and prepare you for a long-lasting relationship. The title sounds a bit cheesy but the content is quite insightful! I did it after a 2 year relationship came to an end (and after a rather toxic rebound) and I made a deal with myself that I would NOT date anyone new until I completed the book in a thoughtful and intentional way. It really helped me out in a lot of ways, hopefully it can help you too!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ns3b6j/i_need_a_relationship_detox/h0lsaq5/"}
