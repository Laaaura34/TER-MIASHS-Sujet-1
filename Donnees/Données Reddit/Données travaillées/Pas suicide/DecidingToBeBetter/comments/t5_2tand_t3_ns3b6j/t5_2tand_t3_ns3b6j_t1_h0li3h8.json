Try and focus on friendships that give you fulfilment, so that you feel good about the relationships you know give you reciprocal love and affection - in a different way. \n\nRelationships can be a wonderful thing - that\u2019s also why the pull can be so hard - but just remember that you owe it to yourself to work on you.\n\nIf someone comes along that supports you being you, and fits into where you\u2019re going, be cautious, but turning them away because \u2018you should be on your own\u2019 might mean you miss a great opportunity for a loving relationship.\n\nAsk yourself often: Am I ready for someone to come into my life? Do I know what I want for a  relationship? and the biggest one: WHY do I want a relationship?\n\nIf the reason is because it would be wonderful to add a companion into your already nice life, great. If it\u2019s to \u2018fill a gap\u2019 or because you think something is missing and a relationship will fix it, then that\u2019s a risky place to be in. \n\nMaybe look up some self help books. This is obvs all just my opinion :) \n\nI wish you luck on your self love & growth.\nYou deserve to build a good life for yourself. \nFind out who you are and what you like and what you want before you allow someone else into YOUR world!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ns3b6j/i_need_a_relationship_detox/h0li3h8/"}
