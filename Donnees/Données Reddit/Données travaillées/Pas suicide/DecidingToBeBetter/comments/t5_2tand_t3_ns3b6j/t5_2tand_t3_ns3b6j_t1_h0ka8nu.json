My partner of 7.5 years left me out of the blue a month ago. It's been an excruciating breakup because she did it as quickly as possible with no idea how we'd split assets. She's done and said things that have deeply wounded me. So when I downloaded dating apps and women started showing interest, it literally felt like a drug to have that affirmation. After briefly meeting someone and texting for two days, we went on a date last night and it started out amazing. I literally had the thought that if I don't tell her my situation right away, we are going to end up in a long-term thing, which is something I don't think I could do anytime soon or potentially ever again. So, a half hour in, I told her the exact situation and she did not take it well....even though this was literally our first date. So yeah, I hear you. You have to make the conscious effort not to fall into something when you know it's not right. But there are so many ways we can connect with one another without committing to each other. And I don't mean just sleeping around. I mean talking, doing fun things, supporting each other. Maybe if you find those connections and make it clear you can't be serious that will make it easier.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ns3b6j/i_need_a_relationship_detox/h0ka8nu/"}
