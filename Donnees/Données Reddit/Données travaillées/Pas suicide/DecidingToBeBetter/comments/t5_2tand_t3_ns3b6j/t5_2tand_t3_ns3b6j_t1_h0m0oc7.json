During that, examine them as from an outside perspective. Question why you feel or think or react a certain way. Typically, these reactions are learned behavior to a previous response. Uncovering these things will help you learn more about yourself, help place your mind in a tranquil and silent space, and allow you to control your life by being able to thoughtfully respond rather than instinctually react to similar events that come up in the future. I would encourage you to try and uncover these instinctual responses in every part of your life, whether it be in school, work, how you interact with friends and family, how you face certain problems, obstacles, or fears. I started this after a divorce at 33. I\u2019m 35 now and for the first time feel like I have my own purpose, goal, identity, and control of what I want and who I am. I let the loving and innocent parts I discover flourish. I no longer shy away from facing difficult internal thoughts or emotions. I learn from them, change my behavior, and overall live a more peaceful and fulfilling life, while avoiding the previously accepted drama, conflict, insecurity and fear as something \u201cnormal\u201d.\n\nIf you want examples for clarification, I\u2019d be happy to respond, but don\u2019t have the time right now! Good luck in your journey.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ns3b6j/i_need_a_relationship_detox/h0m0oc7/"}
