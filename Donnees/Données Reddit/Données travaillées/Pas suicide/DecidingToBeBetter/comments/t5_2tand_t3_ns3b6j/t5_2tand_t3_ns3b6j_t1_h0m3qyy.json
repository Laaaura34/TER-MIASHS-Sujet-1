More than anything else, I think that being *known* by someone else is one of the most fulfilling connections you can have (for me, anyway). To be recognized by another and to recognize them in return. I think we are all just so conditioned to believe you can only find that sort of recognition in romantic relationships. Or, if you do find that sort of recognition, the other party expects it to turn into a romantic relationship. Which is what I'm trying to avoid while still wanting that type of connection with people. \n\nI've thought about this a lot. I actually met someone a while ago (which is probably what prompted this post now that I think about it) who I could honestly envision having a very fulfilling romantic relationship with. She's a great friend and we want extremely similar things out of life while being able to balance each other out and play off each other's strengths yet also understand and support each other's struggles. If we had met 2 years from now, I absolutely would have pursued her. But it's not right for me right now. I do worry I'm letting a great thing pass me by but I also am just incredibly thankful to have that friendship. \n\nThank you so much for reminding me of all of this. Sometimes you just have to hear other people say it, you know? :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ns3b6j/i_need_a_relationship_detox/h0m3qyy/"}
