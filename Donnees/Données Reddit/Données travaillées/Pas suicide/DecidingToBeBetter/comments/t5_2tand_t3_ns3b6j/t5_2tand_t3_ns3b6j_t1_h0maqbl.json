That is never easy and can be quite terrifying. \n\nI totally understand what you mean when you say all those pushed away feelings are reemerging at once. When I was in therapy, she told me during our very first session that things may get worse before they get better- that's exactly what happened! But they DID get better :)\n\nTo your last point: I think your concern is very valid, and worth exploring deeper :) personally, i believe it comes down to letting go of any and all preconceived ideas you have about what you and your life *should* be, and allowing space for reflection and honoring who you truly are at your core, and not accepting anything into your life that doesn't align with that. I think the longer we honor our truth, the more our external world will align with our internal world, thus creating maybe not the life we've \"dreamed of,\" (because let's face it, I can dream of being a millionaire but will still be unhappy if it doesn't fulfill my soul), but definitely the life that we truly resonate with. I'm still learning to trust this process, myself. I didn't begin making an effort to do this until about 8 months ago, but I already am starting to feel a bit liberated. And of course this is all easier said than done :P", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ns3b6j/i_need_a_relationship_detox/h0maqbl/"}
