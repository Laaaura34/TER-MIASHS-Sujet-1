I\u2019ve been dating almost constantly since 11th grade without having a full year being single to just focus on myself, where I\u2019m going, and how to get myself there. I\u2019m really ready to intentionally not be in a relationship for a while... which\u2019ll be hard because I\u2019m definitely a relationship person but I\u2019ve realized recently that part of that comes from a fear of being alone. I do love spending time alone, but currently it feels quite scattered and procrastination-ish, and before long I get restless for someone else to distract me from my lack of a life plan haha.\nAhh that\u2019s a great quote, I\u2019ve heard it before but it really hits differently reading it now. \nThank you again :))", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/np615u/breakup_made_me_realize_my_insecurity_about/h04fgxx/"}
