On the positive side, it can be a great opportunity to reinvent yourself and discover new interests. \n\nA lot of my hobbies are just gentle interests rather than things I would say I was totally passionate about. But having multiple different interests helps make my life feel full, and more balanced as a person. It makes me feel independent as I know that I always have multiple different options about how I can entertain myself. \n\nSo I suppose in summary my advice would be, don\u2019t feel you need to spend all your free time on your passion straight away. It can be good to branch out and try new things too, especially if you aren\u2019t too sure how to motivate yourself. Once you feel more happy and confident in the way you\u2019re spending your time, rediscovering your passion will hopefully follow naturally.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/np615u/breakup_made_me_realize_my_insecurity_about/h03j8q2/"}
