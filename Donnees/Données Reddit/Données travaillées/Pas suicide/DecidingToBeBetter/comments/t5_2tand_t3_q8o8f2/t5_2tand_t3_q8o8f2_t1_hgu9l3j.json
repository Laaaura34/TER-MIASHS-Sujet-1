Im planning on bringing it with me since I have such a hard time articulating what I\u2019m trying to say on the spot. \n\nThe packet of tests I was given to fill out before my appointment was also helpful, it was the scaled tests for depression, anxiety, bipolar, and adhd. I kind of based what I want to work on from those since I never realized how extreme my emotions are during certain situations and when I look at it objectively I realize it\u2019s not healthy. \n\nHopefully this sort of helps. Best of luck, sending tons of positive therapy vibes your way!\n\nEdited to articulate what I was trying to say a bit better \ud83e\udd74", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8o8f2/i_want_to_book_an_appointment_with_a_psychologist/hgu9l3j/"}
