The first time I went to meet my therapist I was super nervous. I was unable to drink my coffee because of the sheer nervousness, I could not bring this cup to my lips it was just all to overwhelming.  This first session we went through some basic questions about why I came and what I was dealing with. He really eased me into to therapy. In total I have had therapy for a few months and now I've quit for the time being. It really helped me put my feelings into words and most of all it helped me understand my own psyche and it gave me the confidence and trust that I am most of the time a functioning human being. Don't be afraid to just say ''I don't really know how what my feelings are'' if it's the right therapist they will help. Best of luck to you stranger hope this helps :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8o8f2/i_want_to_book_an_appointment_with_a_psychologist/hgr4sot/"}
