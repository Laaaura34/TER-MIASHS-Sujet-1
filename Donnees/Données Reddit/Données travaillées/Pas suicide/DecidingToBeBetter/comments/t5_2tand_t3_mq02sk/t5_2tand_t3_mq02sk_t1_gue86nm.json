Just keep pushing on it. I have thought about this myself, wanting to be on a higher vibration, wanting to be one of those people other people look up to. How to do it?  I only have a few ideas. \n- start saying the nice things you think as long as they\u2019re not weird. Compliment people sincerely whenever you can. Know any children? Like not strangers, ones you know?  Praise them literally whenever they do good even slightly. \n- express gratitude to someone every day. Reach out and express gratitude to people for things they\u2019ve done in the past. \n- always try to understand another person, don\u2019t understand something? Read about it, ask about it, research it. \n- try to change all your language to be more gentle and positive, it will begin to affect your thought process. \n- instead of seeing others (adults and especially children) as being a problem, try to see how they\u2019re having a problem. Most people would be better to others if they weren\u2019t going through it themselves. \n- just find one kind thing to do each day, no matter how small. Again, make sure they\u2019re not things that come off as weird because then you\u2019ll end up awkward.\n\nA rising tide raises all boats. But you can\u2019t shovel sh** without getting some on you. \nAdages I\u2019ve heard that really mean a lot to me to bear in mind. Keep putting good out into the world, it will come back to you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mq02sk/i_need_to_change_i_want_to_be_a_light_to_everyone/gue86nm/"}
