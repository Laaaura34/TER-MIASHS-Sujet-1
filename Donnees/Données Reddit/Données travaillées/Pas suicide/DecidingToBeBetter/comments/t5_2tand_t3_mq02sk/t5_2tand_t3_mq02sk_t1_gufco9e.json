Actually caring about people and making them feel valued is awesome. And in that situation, it doesn't matter if that person is wearing the right clothes or has a good haircut or whatever. You will think they're awesome because they cared about you and made you feel valued when you were down.\n\nI resolved long ago to spend more energy trying to be awesome, and less trying to be cool.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mq02sk/i_need_to_change_i_want_to_be_a_light_to_everyone/gufco9e/"}
