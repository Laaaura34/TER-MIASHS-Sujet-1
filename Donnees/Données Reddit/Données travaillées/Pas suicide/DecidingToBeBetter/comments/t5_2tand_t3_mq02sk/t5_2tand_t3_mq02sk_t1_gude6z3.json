You want to be a force for good, but seem unsure where to start. May I share a quote that helped me when I felt that way?\n\n\"To spread joy, you have to have it. To impart delight, you have to be more or less delightful. And to be delightful is not some factor of trying to make yourself look delightful, it is to do things that are delightful to you. You thereby become delightful to others.\n\nPeople who are interesting, are people who are interested. \nAny person for example, who is constantly thinking about all sorts of other things and other people and so on, because they are fascinating, becomes a fascinating person. A person who does not think about anyone else, and has very little going on inside their skull, is boring. So in other words, your engagement with the external world -- the more you are involved, the more your personality is enriched.\" ~Alan Watts\n\nEssentially, find out delights you, and do it. What gladdens your heart? Obviously it\u2019s not porn and gaming. Maybe it\u2019s volunteering, reading, gardening, feeding ducks, learning a new skill. Something that enriches and uplifts you.\nWhen you\u2019re enriched and happy, you\u2019ll become a light to others.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mq02sk/i_need_to_change_i_want_to_be_a_light_to_everyone/gude6z3/"}
