If you wanted something where you volunteer from home, you could try a crisis hotline (they train you extensively). Otherwise, good places to look are homeless shelters, free clinics, hospitals, food pantries, nursing homes, and nearly any place that works with children. \n\nThere's also an app called Pappa I believe that sends volunteers out to senior citizens that need a hand. So you'd help out an old person with groceries or even just spend quality time with them. \n\nFor day to day stuff though, you can go make people smile at your local grocery store or coffee shop line. \nYou'll see that something as simple as a random compliment on someone's shirt, hat, jewellery, or shoes can really put a spring in their step.\nWhen you're shopping, look out for elderly people. If they seem to be struggling with finding something, ask if you can help. Same with when they're putting groceries in their cars. It's a simple gesture but can go a long way.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mq02sk/i_need_to_change_i_want_to_be_a_light_to_everyone/gudb1oa/"}
