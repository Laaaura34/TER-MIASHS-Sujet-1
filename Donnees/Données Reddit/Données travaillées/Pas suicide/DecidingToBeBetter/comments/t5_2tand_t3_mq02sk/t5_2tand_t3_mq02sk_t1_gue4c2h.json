Thank you for writing it, and good luck becoming more of that person and working toward the skills and attitudes that will get you there. \n\nI want to join you on that journey. \n\nOne thing I have found is that I can sometimes be the light for someone else when I am full up myself; when I am glowing with joy and love for myself and everyone else.
