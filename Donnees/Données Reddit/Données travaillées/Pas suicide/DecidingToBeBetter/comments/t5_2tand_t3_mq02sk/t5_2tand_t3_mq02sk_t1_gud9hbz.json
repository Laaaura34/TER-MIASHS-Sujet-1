Volunteering is so wonderful. The people working in those environments are usually so compassionate and caring. \nIt can be a little sad sometimes seeing living beings less fortunate than us, but it is so worth the pain to see the light and life it brings to peoples faces. You're not just feeding a homeless person or cleaning poop at an animal shelter, you're giving hope to those who might be lacking it. You're reminding them that there really are compassionate loving people in this world who care about them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mq02sk/i_need_to_change_i_want_to_be_a_light_to_everyone/gud9hbz/"}
