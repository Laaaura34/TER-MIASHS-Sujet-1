Yes it\u2019s Buddhist, but the ideas are pretty applicable in general. \n\nDeveloping wisdom and compassion are two of the goals of practice Buddhism, and I feel like most of us could benefit from that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mq02sk/i_need_to_change_i_want_to_be_a_light_to_everyone/gudrh5u/"}
