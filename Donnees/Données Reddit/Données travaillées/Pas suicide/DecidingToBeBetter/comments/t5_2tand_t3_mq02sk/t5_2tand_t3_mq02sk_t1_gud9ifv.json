Have you been in love before? That euphoric, generous feeling where the other can do no wrong? Try to feel that all the time, with the world around you, with people, family, with yourself. Look for the beauty in everything, especially when you have an initial repulsion. Focus more on being than doing. Be love. Check out hai.org for some workshops that will inspire you.\n\nDon't get discouraged if people don't show signs of being affected. Just love them more. Trust that you being love makes a difference even if you can't see it. Don't fall into the trap that people owe you a smile or laugh or liking you. Just be love.\n\nListening is a super power. Try to listen 80% and only talk 20%. Learn how to be a better listener. \n\nFocus on the moments where you feel alive and connected. Let go of the moments you don't. Life is too short to regret things that can't be changed. \n\nI hope your shares in the future come across my feed and that I get to hear about your journey. I'm sending you lots of love \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mq02sk/i_need_to_change_i_want_to_be_a_light_to_everyone/gud9ifv/"}
