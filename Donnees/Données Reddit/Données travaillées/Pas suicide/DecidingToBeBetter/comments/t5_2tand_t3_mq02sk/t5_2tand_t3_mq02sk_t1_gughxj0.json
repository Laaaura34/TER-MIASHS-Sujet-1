You've already made all of our days who read the post by trying to be a kind person to others.\n\nThe best part is, all it takes is patience and kindness. It doesn't cost money or a lot of time and effort to change yourself. However it does take some resilience and persistence to always keep being a person like that. Because when you decide to use your voice to do something good for others there will always be people that will try to put you down for your efforts trying to hide their reasoning of their own selfish endeavors. So always be true to yourself and hold onto what you ultimately want to do, make someone else's day by being there for them.\n\nAnd also, be there for yourself, because the more you realize you want to be there for others, a long term strategy is to be there for yourself as well. Because you need to be well and in a healthy mindset to feel motivated to go out there with a kind attitude for someone as well.\n\nWe need more people like you, you already made my day better <3", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mq02sk/i_need_to_change_i_want_to_be_a_light_to_everyone/gughxj0/"}
