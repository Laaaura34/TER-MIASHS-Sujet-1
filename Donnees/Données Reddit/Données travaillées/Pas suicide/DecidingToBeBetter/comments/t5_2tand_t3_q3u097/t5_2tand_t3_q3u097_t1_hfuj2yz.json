But I would encourage you to pin it more on the relationship than scapegoating her as a person. You have a part in creating that dynamic and it might be worth investigating why *you* have kept up with this friend at the expense of doing all these other things. And as someone who was pretty well destroyed over a breakup (but tried to not let it show), if you care about this person, it would be nice to at least mention your problems with who she\u2019s become. That\u2019s not your responsibility to do, and it certainly doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t walk away at the same time. You can do it in a non-codependent way. (Codependent No More has a cheesy title but is a great book. It doesn\u2019t sound like this friendship is coda to the extreme as, say, someone who enables an alcoholic, but i\u2019m sensing there might be a little bit going on. It can be easy to slide into over the years, esp by year two of a global pandemic)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfuj2yz/"}
