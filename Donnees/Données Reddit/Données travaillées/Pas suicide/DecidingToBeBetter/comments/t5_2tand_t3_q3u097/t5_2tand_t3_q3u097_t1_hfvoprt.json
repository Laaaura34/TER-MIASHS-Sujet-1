I'm not saying she doesn't deserve you but she could also use someone else to put her on better path. I think you're too nice and too afraid to change the current friendship that went on for so long! I moved around a lot so I never had friends that lasted over 4 years. I think you don't need her permission to hang out with other friends. Just do it and tell her you want to spend time with others too. If she has other friends she'll be fine. Well she will have some company if not better friends. If you're each other's best friends, then it's important to have that conversation.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfvoprt/"}
