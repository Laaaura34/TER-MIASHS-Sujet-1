He's not someone who's interested in doing a lot of things and I was wondering the same thing, but then he got into rock climbing on his own and I eventually started going with him and now it's a really great way we spend time 2 times a week together after work. There's lots of good advice I read here, but I just wanted to say that that while your situation is clearly not the same as this one as she really seems unwilling to move on from a certain mindset that's bringing her down, sometimes it's also about suggesting activities that bring you more joy. It still seems more necessary to say goodbye though you can set the boundaries that you're needing the relationship to shift in certain ways and that you love her, but you can't keep being friends as it currently is and also suggesting other activities besides going to a bar.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfuxqk3/"}
