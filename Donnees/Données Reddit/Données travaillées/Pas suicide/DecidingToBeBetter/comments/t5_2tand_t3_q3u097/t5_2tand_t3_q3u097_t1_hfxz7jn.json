I didn't realize until we were so close. Also strictly platonic.\n\nI always exposed them to what I was seeing as toxic. They all got defensive. It was terrible.\n\nI left them in their misery and moved on. Many of my friend stayed friends with them but preferred not to actually speak to them. No idea how that works. Not my life. I just worry about me.\n\nIt sucks. It's like an actual break up. It hurts but you get through it knowing you can't wait for them to change. Sometimes that toxicity ways on you and really fucks up your head.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfxz7jn/"}
