Let her know you still want to be friends, but the bar lifestyle isn't where you are at anymore.  Make plans to spend time doing other things like going to the movies or shopping or whatever else you two enjoy doing.  This may be enough to change the dynamics of your relationship and be beneficial to you both. \n\nIf she isn't open to the change and is upset about your decision you can still give her some time to come around, but it is imperative you stick to your boundaries and do not allow her to coerce you into reverting back into that lifestyle.  If the friendship is important to her she may start to take you up on your offers to spend time together in other venues. \n\nIf she still insists... the friendship may just be at its end.  Not all relationships last, and forcing one will create an extremely toxic environment for you both.  \n\nYou are worthy of respect and happiness.  You deserve to live your life the way you want.  Stand your ground and don't give in to pressure.  If she can't respect your choices and isn't willing to compromise to make it work, then unfortunately you are at an impasse in your relationship. \n\nI hope you are both able to find happiness in your lives.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfyj3i0/"}
