I can empathize.  I cut ties with a former best friend and work partner a few years ago and I saw her yesterday for the first time in about 2 years.  She is the most negative,  angry person I've ever met.  I don't know how I didn't see it before.  I spoke with a colleague and mentioned seeing her yesterday and they agreed about her toxic negativity and saw it a few years ago when I was blinded by our friendship.  Seeing her behavior on the other side has reaffirmed my decision to cut ties.  So glad I did.  You will feel like a weight has been lifted when it happens.  Best of luck to you. It's never easy breaking up with someone,  especially a best friend.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfu6ijp/"}
