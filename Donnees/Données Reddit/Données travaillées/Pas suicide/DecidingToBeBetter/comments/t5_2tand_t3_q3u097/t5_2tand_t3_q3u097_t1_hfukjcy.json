It happened to me too and I have started keeping people at arms' distance. But sometimes, its fun to not think about work and self-improvement. Like, its difficult to make deep friendship when you are older and you get more critical and a \"little\" selfish (happens to all). \n\nI would not just cut off people if she is a genuine and true friend only because she is of 'no use' to me. I have done that and I have regretted it. You can definitely decrease the times you meet or go to cafe instead of bar.\n\nWhat I mean to say is that its never one sided and its not like someone is forcing you. Its good to have fun and not always think about in terms of gain and loss. Maybe just look deeper if she is actual problem or if you are using her to procastinate on your goals and just putting all blame on her.\n\nSorry if it was not the expected answer. \n\nThanks!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfukjcy/"}
