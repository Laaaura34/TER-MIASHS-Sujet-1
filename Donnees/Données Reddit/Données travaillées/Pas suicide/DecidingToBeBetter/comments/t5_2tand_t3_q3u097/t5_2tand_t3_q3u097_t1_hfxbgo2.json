I'm older than quite a few of the users here.  Lived long enough to experience the biggest highs and lows.  I'm not elderly but I'm really starting to see the lens of my world with that bigger history of experiences....getting older is...neat.  Can be very lonely...but some things you only gain with time.  Everyone here will figure it out one way or another.  Hope whatever your going through works out the way that's best for your future.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfxbgo2/"}
