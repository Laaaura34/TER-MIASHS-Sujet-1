For years I was a typical doormat and allowed things to be forgotten/brushed off. Once I moved away and gained confidence, it was difficult once we reconnected. The jaded remarks about my growth, telling me what I could/couldn't wear, ignoring my sexuality when I came out, etc etc, were a big slap of reality. I ended up writing a letter, to which they didn't respond to very well to and said I was disrespectful for telling them this way. We ended up talking about it and I asked for some space for a few weeks to process and get my life together. I was going through other stuff at the time so I knew I was a bit chaotic/dramatic and needed time. Unfortunately they ended up blocking me on all social media and haven't heard from them since, which hurt. But honestly this situation (plus therapy, thank god for therapy) has allowed me to grow to be a better person for me, so it worked out in the end.\n\nI'm very glad your friend was open to listening to your words and has been receptive to your boundaries. That's a huge step and honestly shows a good side of her character. I hope everything for you all works out!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfvesyc/"}
