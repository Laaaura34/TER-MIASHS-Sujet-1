Also it\u2019s funny everyone in this thread is rushing to call this person toxic but we got a one-sided story from OP who\u2019s been friends with her for years and only *now* that she\u2019s talking about *another man* it\u2019s a problem. Lol. Everything else was fine to look past until that I guess?\n\nNotice how there was a lil insert where OP mentions her not being over another man as a catalyst for *all of this*. Bit strange. Also the fact OP is mentioning the potato thing as a prank.. red flag that OP is not \u201cabove\u201d these people like OP wants to think. Just because you declined to go doesnt change that you also view something like that as a \u201cprank\u201d. There\u2019s clearly a reason you were friends. Don\u2019t pretend you\u2019re above people now that you dislike old activities you happily participated in.\n\nIt\u2019s fine to decide you want to be better and end relationships in your life, it\u2019s not fine to shit on those same people because now *you think* you\u2019re better than them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfwytwj/"}
