Have you tried talking to her about this ? I know its a sensitive subject. \n\nReading the top comment reminded me of something I had written on my wall in a temporary flat. \n\"People are either a blessing or a lesson\" though you could argue they could be both in a sense as life changes. \n\nAnd I don't know if there's any one sidedness here, like you are trying and she isn't, I can't assume thays the case but if it is, and you have other friends that it is more a mutual thing then I think this could apply,\n\"Stop swimming oceans for people who wouldn't jump a puddle for you\" \n\nThat may not apply so please ignore if it doesn't. You sound like you're very aware of how better you're time could be spent and how that would be more positive for you. I believe people grow out of each other sometimes but it doesn't make it easier. If you have tried approaching her and it doesn't work, you may need to be upfront and tell her this friendship isn't working for me anymore. \nIf it can be saved, great. If not, I think from what you've said, your life would be more positive without a toxic friend.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfvn4gz/"}
