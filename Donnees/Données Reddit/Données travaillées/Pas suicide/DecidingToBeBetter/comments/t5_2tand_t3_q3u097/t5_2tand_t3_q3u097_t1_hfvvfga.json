Known a friend of mine my whole life but I don\u2019t feel like I can be myself around him anymore. Also he\u2019s very judge mental and talks a lot of shit about our friends when they aren\u2019t there so I know he obviously talks shit about me when I\u2019m not around. I feel like I\u2019ve completely moved on from the relationship but I still have random dreams where I\u2019m forced to explain to him exactly why I don\u2019t want to be friends anymore. Just put yourself first and protect your well being. As we grow up we grow apart. My friend and I don\u2019t have the same things in common as we used to when we were younger and that\u2019s okay. I wish you the best at coming to peace with your decision.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfvvfga/"}
