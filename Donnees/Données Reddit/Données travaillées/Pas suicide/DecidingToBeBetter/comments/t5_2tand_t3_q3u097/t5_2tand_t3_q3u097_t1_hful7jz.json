Most people start realizing what their \"friends\" are really like...right around your age, up to 30. \n\nThe adult you now sees how they are just kids with no direction and still partying like they are 21. This is when you choose to let bad things go and focus on building the life you want and release the people that are standing in your way. \n\nThe adage \"misery loves company\" is really true. When people won't grow up, they start using friendships like a crutch for their own failures, instead of learning to cope.\n\nGood luck to you and Cheers.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hful7jz/"}
