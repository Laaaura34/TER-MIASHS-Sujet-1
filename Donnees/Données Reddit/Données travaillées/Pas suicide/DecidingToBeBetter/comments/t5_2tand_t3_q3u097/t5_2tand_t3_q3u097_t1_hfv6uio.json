It\u2019s all just bullshitters bullshitting. \n\nI don\u2019t see anything toxic about Jay, either. Seems like maybe OP views friends as opportunities or accessories and Jay isnt \u201chigh quality\u201d enough. Your friends don\u2019t have to change who they are for you, or change their interests. She doesn\u2019t sound like someone I\u2019d want to hang with either, but she\u2019s not toxic for going to bars a few times a week and talking about herself too much. If you have new interests go make friends with people with those interests, no need to decide to drop or keep a friend like it\u2019s a fantasy football lineup. Sounds like OP has convinced themself they are the most mature person but still has a little growing up to do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfv6uio/"}
