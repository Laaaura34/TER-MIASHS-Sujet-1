She very likely has an emotional attachment/addiction to the attention you give her.\n\nStart with reducing contact.  Instead of seeing her twice a week, reduce it to twice a month.  Become busy.  If she tantrums, let her know that\u2019s not OK.  She needs to find other people, places, things to do besides being around you.\n\nBecause she is part of a larger friends group, you want to avoid everyone having to pick sides.  She\u2019s not your girlfriend.  You don\u2019t need to give a reason for withdrawing.  If she demands to know why she can\u2019t monopolize all your time, let her know she is your friend but not your only friend.  You need your space too, and you have many interests.\n\nShe is using you likely because nobody else wants to put up with her toxicity.  You are not helping her deal with her issues so much as being used as a free therapist.  You deserve to get something out of every friendship, not just give give give.  \n\nIf she is toxic, then you need to detach.  Do it slowly, quietly, discretely, to prevent drama.  If she goes nuts and creates drama, well, that\u2019s more reason not to want to be around her.\n\nDetaching from toxic people is hard.  You find that you were getting some needs met too, and now you must fill them elsewhere.  The poison is more than the benefit.  \n\nSo it\u2019s great that you came to this realization.  Be kind in the way that you detach her.  If she has a tantrum, well, that\u2019s more reason to detach.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfww0dz/"}
