No advice is flawless and advice that works in one situation may not work in another situation.  Every person/situation is a unique universe unto itself.  Nothing is cookie cutter.  I typically find that being honest and upfront is the best situation for me.  Things may not always end up the way you wanted...but you lived your truth.  So I'm sorry if you had a bad experience but I still think my advice is a good standard to try to live by...be honest with others...and attempt to help people evolve...give them a chance to see what your vision of the future is and offer them the chance to be a part of it...if possible.  The description OP gave didn't make them seem toxic beyond repair...but if someone IS that toxic...of course cut them off as you feel is needed.  No advice can hold to every situation.  \\*hugs\\*  Hope you're having a good day.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3u097/im_realizing_that_my_best_friend_of_65_years_is_a/hfxahz2/"}
