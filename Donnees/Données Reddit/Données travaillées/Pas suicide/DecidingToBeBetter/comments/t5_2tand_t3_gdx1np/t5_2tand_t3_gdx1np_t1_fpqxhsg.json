Its actually really touching that you both have stayed a part of each others lives. I've been reconnecting with some good people and reevaluating existing relationships. Things are slow going since they knew me as someone different not so long ago, but the ones who've struggled get it at least. Finding God and praying again is definitely one of the things that's helped me the most over this whole time. A lot of people turned their back on me when I started this, but God's been with me through it all so far and I'm thankful to have that!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gdx1np/officially_a_year_sober_today_from_alcohol_this/fpqxhsg/"}
