Please consider medication. I think many of us have struggled with the idea of it. However I recently tried to come off mine and the thoughts, I\u2019m sure you know the ones, popped right back up despite all my best efforts and nothing having changed for the worse. I don\u2019t especially like the idea of relying on them either, but I have a simple choice, which is: live like that, or don\u2019t. (Also: I have children and a spouse and I am fully capable of making them miserable when I\u2019m not doing well.) I now fully understand the analogy of \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t tell a diabetic not to rely on insulin.\u201d \n\n(Note: I am multiple episode.
