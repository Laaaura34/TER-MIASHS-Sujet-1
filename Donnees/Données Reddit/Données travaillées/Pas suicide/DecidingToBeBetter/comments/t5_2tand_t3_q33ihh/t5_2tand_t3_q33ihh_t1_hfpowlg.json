I was suggested some medicine by a doctor for depression and anxiety after just one session but I do not want to rely on medications as I think once you numb your unwanted emotions like depression and anxiety or artificially introduce happy hormones in your body without actually dealing with your emotions first. Chances are I will have depression for the rest of my life and be dependent on medication for the same reason. Talking about supplements I haven\u2019t taken any. Thank you for your suggestions I am going to try them and try doing things that make me happy.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q33ihh/how_to_stop_feeling_nothing_and_depressed_all_the/hfpowlg/"}
