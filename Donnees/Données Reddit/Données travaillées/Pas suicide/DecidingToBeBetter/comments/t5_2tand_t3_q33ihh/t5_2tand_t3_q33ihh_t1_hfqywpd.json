Thank you for being willing to admit something is wrong and for seeking help. You can have a full life and do not have to loose the years of your life that I did. Thank you for reaching out and thank you for being willing to seek help. It is a terrifying thing to do to admit to yourself much less strangers that their is something wrong in your life that you don't understand and can't deal with by yourself. It can induce deep panic or anxiety but please power through and I promise you not having to live like this is worth the effort. And thank you for giving me hope and reminding me that I'm not alone.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q33ihh/how_to_stop_feeling_nothing_and_depressed_all_the/hfqywpd/"}
