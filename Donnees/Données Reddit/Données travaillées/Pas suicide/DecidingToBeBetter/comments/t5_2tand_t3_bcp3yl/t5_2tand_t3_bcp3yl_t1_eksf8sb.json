Move out. Afraid of loneliness? Then accept dad's ways with awareness of your choice or learn to develop healthier ways of improving your life other than inserting people in it to validate your existence. Don't like the way your dad talks? Let him know and ask him to do it differently. Your life is monotonous? Add a spark in it. The world is vast; there is a ton for you to discover, learn, participate in. Shy and timid? Practice meeting people and being friendly. Hookups make you \"shattered\"? Then stop hooking up and focus on yourself.\n\nI appreciate the words, but it's Dollar Store advice, you know?\n\nI know it's a lot to unpack in a post on the internet. Maybe there is no other answer the internet can give me, other than \"just change lmao\". Unfortunately heard that hundreds of times before.\n\nAnyway yes, I am risk-averse, I take no accountability for my own life and I've relied on others for support my whole life, so I can't help but take out my dissatisfaction on them.
