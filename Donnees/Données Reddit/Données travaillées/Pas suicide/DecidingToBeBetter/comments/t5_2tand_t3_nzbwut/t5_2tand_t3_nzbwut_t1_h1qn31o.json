Instead, use the other\u2014that he is your brother, that you were raised together, and then you will have hold of the handle that carries.\u201d EPICTETUS\n\nThe famous journalist William Seabrook suffered from such debilitating alcoholism that in 1933 he committed himself to an insane asylum, which was then the only place to get treatment for addiction. In his memoir, Asylum , he tells the story of the struggle to turn his life around inside the facility. At first, he stuck to his addict way of thinking\u2014and as a result, he was an outsider, constantly getting in trouble and rebelling against the staff. He made almost no progress and was on the verge of being asked to leave. Then one day this very quote from Epictetus\u2014about everything having two handles\u2014occurred to him. \u201cI took hold now by the other handle,\u201d he related later, \u201cand carried on.\u201d He actually began to have a good time there. He focused on his recovery with real enthusiasm. \u201cI suddenly found it wonderful, strange, and beautiful, to be sober.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. It was as if a veil, or scum, or film had been stripped from all things visual and auditory.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s an experience shared by many addicts when they finally stop doing things their way and actually open themselves to the perspectives and wisdom and lessons of those who have gone before them. There is no promise that trying things this way\u2014of grabbing the different handle\u2014will have such momentous results for you. But why continue to lift by the handle that hasn\u2019t worked?\n\nEdit: Taken from The Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday.
