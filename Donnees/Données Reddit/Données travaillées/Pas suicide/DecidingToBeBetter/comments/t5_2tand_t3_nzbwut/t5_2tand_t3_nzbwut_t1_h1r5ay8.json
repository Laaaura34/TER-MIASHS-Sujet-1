I saw the balance became off kilter so made a decision to stop. My honest opinion is that they all could be used recreationally but society doesn't allow us that autonomy. I am a substance misuse worker now. I don't believe in abstinence for everyone but staying in control is a tough thing to achieve so I get it. My mental health suffers when I feel powerless and am exposed to too much negativity. I regulate my intake of main stream media and social media to filter out its mire. Its a mad world,  we are not mad or bad.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nzbwut/headed_to_rehab_saturday_morning_not_sure_what_to/h1r5ay8/"}
