I have nothing to show, i have nothing to make me happy, i feel more lonely than i ever felt. I smoke it for probalby 14 years non stop, and i mean. Im my days off somedays when i go have lunch i realize i already smoked 3/4 joints with an empty stomach. So i feel stuck in my life i dont even know how to put it on words. The money it takes, the health it takes and the fantasy it creates is ruining my life and i cant quit this shit !!! i became so anxious, and now even wrst with this breakup :( this is the fountain of my problems in life", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k9g9hr/quit_smoking_pot_lost_40_lbs_left_a_6_year_toxic/gf61vzg/"}
