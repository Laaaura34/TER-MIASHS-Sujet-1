Still, I could smoke a gram or so of flower go to sleep at midnight and wake up at 630 too. No one here said anything about feeling lazy so Im not sure what point you\u2019re trying to make there. I never feel lazy when smoking, but my focus isn\u2019t where it needs to be. Everyone is different.\n\nAs far as the dreams I remember much less when I am smoking compared to not. When I talk about it with other smokers they echo the same statement. No one said its impossible to have dreams when you smoke bud.\n\nDo better next time, enjoy your dabs.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k9g9hr/quit_smoking_pot_lost_40_lbs_left_a_6_year_toxic/gf6gxgf/"}
