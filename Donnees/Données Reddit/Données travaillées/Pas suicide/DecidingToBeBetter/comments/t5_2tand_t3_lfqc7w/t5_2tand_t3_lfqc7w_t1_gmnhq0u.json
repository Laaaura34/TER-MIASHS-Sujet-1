He swapped from 5+k per month to 2-3k per month.\n\nBefore that he was working hos same old job with annoying customers. He was irritable, tired, stuck in the couch and a bit depressed even if he didnt admit it. \nHe swapped for something that was much more fulfilling. After, he was happier. He wasnt angry or irritade as often. He had the energy to fix his motorcycles wich is his hobby. He made more jokes and was just generally more satisfied in a way that others noticed.\n\nBut he was financially stable and not dependent on his income. He didnt have a bunch of payments or expensive living so he could still feel secure, if not as well off.\n\nAs Long as you know your home and food is safe, switch jobs. You dont need a bunch of commodities, you need to be happy 9-5, you spend A LOT of your time at work.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lfqc7w/comfort_vs_happiness/gmnhq0u/"}
