Because everything I've done has been motivated by beating myself up, simply because I don't have any self-love to use as fuel for the whole \"be kind to yourself\" approach. At the same time, I'm also prone to burnout and I tend to fail more often than I succeed, by a lot. So a change is needed. But I also don't love myself enough to tolerate failure. After all, I'm the bastard who ruined my life. Yet it seems that punishing the bastard who ruined my life is keeping me as the bastard who ruined my life, where I'd like to no longer be the bastard who ruined my life, but I still keep screwing things up. So it's a tangled mental web.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nirfzs/im_not_a_good_person_im_a_27_yo_college_grad/gz478xf/"}
