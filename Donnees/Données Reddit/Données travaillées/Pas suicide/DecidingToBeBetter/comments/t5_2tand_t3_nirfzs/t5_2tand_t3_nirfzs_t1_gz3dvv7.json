Change it! \nMake a list of things you absolutely need to do. If you never had a job, try to find something you are good at and work towards it. If you are good at fitness, find a way to become a coach! If you want some extra cash, work with a housekeeping company. Use what you got and hone it!!! \n\nSex is very personal. I don't think your virginity or lack of, really defines you unless you choose to be defined through that lens. \n\nEvery since line you have written in the post is a sign of self-loathing. Which simply indicates a need for change!! You can change yourself if you choose it. Bit by bit. Getting laid is no big deal. Get over your current self criticism and gain your self confidence through accomplishments.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nirfzs/im_not_a_good_person_im_a_27_yo_college_grad/gz3dvv7/"}
