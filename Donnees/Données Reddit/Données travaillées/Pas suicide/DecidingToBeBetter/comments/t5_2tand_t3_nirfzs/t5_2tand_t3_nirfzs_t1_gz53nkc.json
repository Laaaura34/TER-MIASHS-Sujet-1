This post is definitely not the vibe I give off in real life though, I mean I use these posts when I\u2019m at my worst and/or need to vent. \n\nI didn\u2019t say that I wanted everything in my life to be easy, just that it would be nice for one thing in my life to happen easily without so much of the turmoil and exhaustion from mental illness. \n\nBut you\u2019re right in a way I am selfish. All my worries about the v-card are about me me me. So it\u2019s a good to be reminded when the virgin stuff is bothering me that sex isn\u2019t just about one person or shouldn\u2019t be. I\u2019ve had some romantic relationships (they just never got to piv cuz of my anxiety) and I think I was pretty good at being attentive to their needs? Hopefully decent idk but I\u2019ve gotten a lot of advice and learned a lot since those days so I think I would be better in the present. If romance ever happens for me again.
