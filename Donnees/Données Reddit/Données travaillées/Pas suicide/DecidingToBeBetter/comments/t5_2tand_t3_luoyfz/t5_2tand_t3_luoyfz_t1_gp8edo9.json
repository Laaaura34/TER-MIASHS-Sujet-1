I quit smoking cigarettes almost 2 years ago, alcohol exactly 1 year ago, and was forced to quit cannabis use 8 months ago for health reasons. Every day that you go without smoking is an accomplishment and you should be very proud of yourself. I used to crave the act of smoking and the feeling of being drunk but the feeling of pride that I have for saying that I'm one year sober feels like a home run. Good luck on your journey, virtual high-five for the milestone of one year.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/luoyfz/1_year_since_i_quit_smoking_dont_have_anyone_to/gp8edo9/"}
