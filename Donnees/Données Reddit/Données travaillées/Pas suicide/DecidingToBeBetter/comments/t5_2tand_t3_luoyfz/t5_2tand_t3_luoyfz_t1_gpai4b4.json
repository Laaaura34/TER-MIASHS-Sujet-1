During lowest of my lows and hyperstressed i have just quit, not quite sure how or why (i think i broke my IQOS semi-intentionally).\n\ni quit drinkink exactly one month ago (it was shorter month but still a month lol).\n\nand yesterday i quit something else that i have failed to quit for several years now. Will i be successful? Without a shadow of the doubt. Can i prove it? No. In fact retrospectively i have very low probability of success, the statistics are not on my side. However my past does not define my future and my failures do not prevent me from trying as long as i dont give them meaning of defeat.\n\nWe are always quitting something and sometimes the battle seems insurmountable and progress insignificant until one day we turn back and see that we have succeeded, although nothing really happened or changed. Quitting something is internal state of mind not preset duration of time, and you are always successful as long as you never give up trying.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/luoyfz/1_year_since_i_quit_smoking_dont_have_anyone_to/gpai4b4/"}
