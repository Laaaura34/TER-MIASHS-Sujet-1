Smoking did not fit in with the values but I did it anyways.  It's called \"cognitive dissonance\". I knew smoking was bad for me, I was aware that I should not do it but because I always had a quit date in the near future, I was able to do it for *two decades.* \n\nThere is no downside to not smoking. Not one. Your future self is immensely grateful right now.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/luoyfz/1_year_since_i_quit_smoking_dont_have_anyone_to/gp8djmt/"}
