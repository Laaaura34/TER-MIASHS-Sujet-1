You recognize the hurdle that the weed is, you just need to be patient with yourself. You kicked the nicotine, you can\n kick the weed habit, too. Just need to feel ready and then it will happen, but don\u2019t stress over it... it will come!\n\nI will come up on a year here in a month or two. I vaped about 0-1.5 mg of nicotine for the last half of a year before I quit, found out I was pregnant and did 0 for another week or two then quit. I was more troubled by giving up the hand to mouth type habits of smoking. I never thought I\u2019d be able to quit like I have. I hate myself for smoking through my first pregnancy years ago (to be fair, I was MUCH younger and a terrible dr I went to at the time told me I could kill my baby by going cold turkey, terrified me and made quitting feel even harder, now I think back and wonder wtf? How did she have a license, she did some wonky stuff...?), quit for my second and breastfed for two years and then stupidly went back to smoking. \nAnyway.. I keep telling myself I\u2019m determined to show I have a shred of will power. Feel like I didn\u2019t just quit for my kids, but myself this time. I won\u2019t go back!!!\nI know you can stay strong, too!!!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/luoyfz/1_year_since_i_quit_smoking_dont_have_anyone_to/gp9l1z8/"}
