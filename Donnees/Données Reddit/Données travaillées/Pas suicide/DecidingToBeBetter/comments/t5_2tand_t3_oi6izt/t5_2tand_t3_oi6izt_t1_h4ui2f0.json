We may be wrong about what exactly that experience is - we may just be brains in a jar, or we may be much more than we appear.  That is something we can never know for certain, and as such is fun to speculate upon but ultimately not worth worrying or concerning oneself over too much.  The experience of life *is* real, however it is derived - by organic brain or artificial machine or some other unknowable means it matters not - I experience life, right now, I *am* experiencing life. \n\nSo, knowing that, and accepting that we don't experience life for any externally prescribed purpose, or at least not one that is forced upon us, we can also accept that not only are we *free* to interpret and declare our own purpose, but that we *must*. \n\nAnd once we accept that *we* experience life, the next axiom I choose to accept, is that *others* are experiencing life, too.  You experience life just as I experience life.  I cannot validate, for certain, that you do - you may be an AI, this may all be a simulation - but I *choose* to accept that as true, that all beings are experiencing life, just as I am experiencing life. \n\nFrom that standpoint, when I think about my purpose in life, I think of how fascinating it is that each of our individual experiences of life are these islands, these vast pocket universes each of their own, which overlap here, in this physical reality. \n\nAnd I think how amazing it is when those pocket universes collide, intermingle, mix with one another.  I think of what vast, complex wonders can be created in the intermingling of the universes of our individual experiences of life.  How things like love can transcend the boundaries of these universes, can make us feel interconnected in ways that seem to defy reason. \n\nAnd I conclude that, without knowing the specificities, *that* is my purpose.  Although it can be painful, and difficult, and infinitely confusing, I want the experience of life to continue.  I want other beings to be able to get to experience life, and I want their experience to be *wondrous*.  What can we build when we can unite more and more conscious minds together in unity, rather than continue to divide and subjugate them? \n\nThe experience of life is something that, at least in the observable physical universe, is rare, and miraculous, and astounding, and *worth preserving*. \n\nAnd so if I can use my experience of life to improve *others'* experience of life, and to help extend and preserve the experience of life as a phenomena on the whole, then that is the meaning I choose to embrace.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oi6izt/its_all_meaningless/h4ui2f0/"}
