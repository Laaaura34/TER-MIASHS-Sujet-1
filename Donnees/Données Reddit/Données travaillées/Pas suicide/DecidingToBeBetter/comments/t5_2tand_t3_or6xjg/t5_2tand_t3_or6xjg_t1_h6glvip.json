If you believe you are being treated \"unfairly\" by \"assholes\", the result is anger. The anger you feel is inflicted on you, by you, by choosing to view the world this way.\n\nYou can either be angry and maintain these beliefs, or you can choose a more reasonable interpretation of people and the things that happen to you, one that doesn't involve \"heroes and villains\", and in doing that you can be calm.\n\nIf you say \"but that's just rolling over and dying\" then give up - you do not intend to do what is necessary to make the change.\n\nIf you are prepared to make the change, then you need to begin researching the topic of belief change. Fortunately it's a very well-understood topic in psychology, you will be replete with books on it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/or6xjg/how_to_stop_being_angry/h6glvip/"}
