It's unresolved trauma so when a stranger makes us feel the same way, those feelings of hurt and anger rise again because it's still bottled in... self love is the way to go. Acknowledge the times you were hurt as a child and forgive them and yourself for the experience. I find myself getting especially angry on the road but due to the fact they're giving out guns like candy, it's not worth getting in road rage anymore. It's costing some people their lives.. one quote I've been telling myself that has worked when I'm about to get angry is \"hurt people hurt people\" that's essentially what anger and being mean is, someone who is hurt. I hope this helps.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/or6xjg/how_to_stop_being_angry/h6h8d97/"}
