I always tap my left index finger with my right index finger and thumb whenever I\u2019m angry and it releases tension and soothes my anger. I call it my crab claws.\n\nFor long term relief take time every day to realize how meaningless and fleeting it is to focus on the people who have wronged you. Acknowledge what you\u2019ve learned from those negative experiences so that you don\u2019t have to relive them again.\n\nAlternatively you can also find passive revenge through self improvement. My Ex cheated on me with another girl because she was fitter than me even though the reason why I was so heavy other time was because of the fast food he bought for me so I spitefully went to the gym and ate healthy and lost weight and got in shape after our breakup to the point where I was more toned and attractive by his standards than the girl he left me for. \n\nIt\u2019s been two years and he is still trying to get back together with me to this day.The satisfaction of that kind of revenge itself counteracts my anger for him. I forgive him now that I have the high ground and emotional closure of making him feel like shit without even having to interact with him just by living my best life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/or6xjg/how_to_stop_being_angry/h6h0auj/"}
