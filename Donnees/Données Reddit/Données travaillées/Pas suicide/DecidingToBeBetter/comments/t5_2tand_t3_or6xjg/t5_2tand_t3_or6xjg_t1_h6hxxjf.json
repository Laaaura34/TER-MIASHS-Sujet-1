I used to be pretty hot headed, and but I didn't know why I got triggered so often. Anger fuels adrenaline, so in that way it's like a drug. You are going to keep \"getting high\" so to speak until you realize where that feeling originated and deal with it. For me, I finally realized I had a pretty abusive childhood. I was the smallest and easiest target for a family of bullies. You'd think that'd be pretty obvious to the person getting abused, but it was my normal and always treated like I deserved it by everyone around me, so it was SSDD. Once I discovered my anger well, I was able to drain it. Yes, what happened was not right, and I am completely justified in being angry about it. However, I'm not justified in taking that anger out on other people and situations in the present. Also, if I keep letting that negatively affect my life now and in the future, they win because it keeps the abuse going. My anger was valid, but it was time to move forward. I think the best revenge in a situation like that is to live an awesome life as possible. That's what I focus on now, and that includes being good to people. \n\n\nFind out the root of your anger issues and deal with that. It might take therapy. That's OK. Whatever tools you need to dig out that bit of poison are fine. A wound can't heal without treating the infection first,  right? That's what you're dealing with here. Treat yourself! \ud83d\ude09", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/or6xjg/how_to_stop_being_angry/h6hxxjf/"}
