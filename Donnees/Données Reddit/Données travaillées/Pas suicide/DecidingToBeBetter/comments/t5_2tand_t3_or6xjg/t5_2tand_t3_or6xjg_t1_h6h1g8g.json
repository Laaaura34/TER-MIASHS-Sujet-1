Where you see malevolence it is usually just ignorance or lack of education. This knowledge has made me pity people more than get mad at them.\n\nEgo is the driving force of most people and they're completely unaware, read up on what ego is/does/makes people react and just how fragile it is. It also keeps me from reacting immediately and lets me examine the intent of others. This knowledge has made me more understanding of peoples' trauma and reactions. The way people interact with the world is borne of their survival instincts.\n\nPeople will do their best. If you're at a job where you feel like you do the most work and it's unfair then I just think of the one rule of humility: what does the world require of me today? This knowledge reminds me that people are complicated.\n\nI love the concept of not holding space: I don't tolerate things that don't make me happy. I have the choice to walk away or speak up and if I do I can make a difference, if I can't make a difference then I've at least done my best to do so. I don't have to just sit there uncomfortably in the face of bigotry, racism, misogyny, etc.\n\nI've been journalling a lot and working on mental health over the pandemic and these are a few rules I use that have made me a lot more understanding and sympathetic. I hope some of it strikes a cord with you and you find it useful! I'm happy to clarify anything.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/or6xjg/how_to_stop_being_angry/h6h1g8g/"}
