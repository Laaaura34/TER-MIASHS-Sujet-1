Mindfulness will allow you to notice that your anger hurts you while those you are angry with go about their day. It sounds like you've already started to realize that which is a perfect place to start. That mindfulness will allow you to take the next step which is reframing.\n\nWhen you get angry, you're most likely interpreting the other person's behavior in the most antagonistic way possible. There are always different interpretations available and most of the time, other interpretations will be more accurate anyway. A person is riding your assin traffic and driving like a moron? What if they are having a personal emergency? Their friend could be lying in the back seat with a bad wound bleeding fast and they need to get to the ER. Their wife could be in labor. Maybe they just lost their job and they really are being an asshole but it has nothing to do with you and any other day of the year they would never act like this. There are a thousand different interpretations other than assuming this is just a piece of shit who is intentionally targeting you as a victim.\n\nYou can safely assume that everyone you interact with is fighting some kind of battle that you know nothing about. Practice reminding yourself of that. The more you do, the easier it will be to let go of your anger so you can go back to being a positive influence in your own life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/or6xjg/how_to_stop_being_angry/h6gts32/"}
