A to-do list, doing my finances (I know, so lame), shows to watch, or journalling.\n\nJournalling I was doing pretty daily, I started with some getting to know yourself questions from a few articles and went from there. I made it a point to only write with the intent of nobody seeing it but me so I had no bias. I stopped in the pandemic because it always came back to that and I was tired of writing about it.\n\nAnother great use is just scheduling your week. I use a system of urgent and not time sensitive tasks and I'll write my weekly schedule out and put down the tasks I need to finish that week.\n\nUse it how you want! It's your book for your own sanity. Make sure you keep track of the wonderful things in your life, even if you're just remembering a joke that made you laugh once. Write it down for your future self to smile at. If you get mad at how people treat you again, remember: you have to endure their teasing for only a little bit. You can walk away. They have to live in that head every day. That's got to be pretty terrible.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/or6xjg/how_to_stop_being_angry/h6jf6gw/"}
