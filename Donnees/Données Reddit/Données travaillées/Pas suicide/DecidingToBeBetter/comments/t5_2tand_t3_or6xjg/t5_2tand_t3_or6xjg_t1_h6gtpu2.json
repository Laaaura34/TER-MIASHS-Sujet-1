If something someone did is making you feel an uncomfortable emotion (anger, sadness, frustration, confusion, etc), say something. You recognize that you can be susceptible and sensitive of other peoples treatment of you - be up front about that. Your feelings are real and valid, and you should be able to express them respectfully. If you don\u2019t tell people how their treatment effects you, they don\u2019t have an opportunity to change or fix their actions. It takes some time and practice, but if you try to express your feelings in a constructive way, then you won\u2019t need to get angry about these kinds of miscommunications. Just keep in mind, communication is a two way street. Give yourself some grace in the process as well, we\u2019re only human after all!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/or6xjg/how_to_stop_being_angry/h6gtpu2/"}
