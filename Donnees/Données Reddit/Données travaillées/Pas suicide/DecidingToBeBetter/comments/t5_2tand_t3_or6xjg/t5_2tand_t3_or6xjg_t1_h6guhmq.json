I think the general rule is to approach these practices slower than normal.\n\nAnger is actually a healthy response to upsetting situations, but it is really common for some cultures to blame the anger as opposed to really dealing with the problematic situation effectively.  In order to properly perceive the problems leading to your anger, you may have to relearn how to better listen to your anger as opposed to trying to stop it.  If you resist, it persists.  It sounds like you need to shout and move your body in a way that lets it release the anger (run, air boxing, lift weights, punch pillows, etc) before you will be able to observe your anger effectively in meditation.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/or6xjg/how_to_stop_being_angry/h6guhmq/"}
