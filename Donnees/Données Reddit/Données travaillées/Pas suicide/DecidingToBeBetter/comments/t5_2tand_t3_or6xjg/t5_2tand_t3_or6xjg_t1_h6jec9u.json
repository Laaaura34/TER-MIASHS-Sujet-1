There's a lot of research on how spending time in nature can quiet the amygdala, which is the part of the brain where anger comes from. Meditation also does this, but I don't think journaling does (just because journaling isn't really about being quiet, it is about being active). Think of a quiet park, or a quiet day on the beach, and then compare that to the noises of a busy street, or a loud parade. They have also found that people who live in New York City tend to have larger amygdalas (assumedly because it is so noisy there). You can research more about the relationship between nature and the amygdala, there's a lot of research out there, but I think the best way to think of it is quietness leads to quieting the amygdala, whereas noisy environments like a city lead to excitement and not quieting the amygdala.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/or6xjg/how_to_stop_being_angry/h6jec9u/"}
