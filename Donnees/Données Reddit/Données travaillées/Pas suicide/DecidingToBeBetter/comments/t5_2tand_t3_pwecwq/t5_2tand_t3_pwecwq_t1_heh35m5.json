I went to the doctors and found alot of things wrong that I had been neglecting. I lost 75 pounds and it was awesome! But life still goes on. And I struggle daily to not go back to the weight I was. I still did gain more than I'd care to admit due to covid. I keep telling myself \"baby steps\" start small and stay consistent. I hope you are able to maintain and find joy in the \"baby steps\"!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwecwq/why_i_was_fat_how_i_dealt_with_my_unprocessed/heh35m5/"}
