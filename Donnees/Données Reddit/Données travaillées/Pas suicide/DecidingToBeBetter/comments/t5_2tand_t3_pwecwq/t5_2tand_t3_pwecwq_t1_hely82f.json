A good and balanced diet should not feel restrictive or leave you hungry. In terms of volume I am now eating more than ever, rarely feel hungry and am healthy and energetic.\n\nHowever, if you have to eat certain foods due to your gastrointestinal issues then that makes sense. I would recommend checking out Dr Gabor Mates' work, \"When the body keeps the score\" - it is a wonderful book about the relationship between emotional trauma and physical health, there is a lot of discussion about digestive issues in that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwecwq/why_i_was_fat_how_i_dealt_with_my_unprocessed/hely82f/"}
