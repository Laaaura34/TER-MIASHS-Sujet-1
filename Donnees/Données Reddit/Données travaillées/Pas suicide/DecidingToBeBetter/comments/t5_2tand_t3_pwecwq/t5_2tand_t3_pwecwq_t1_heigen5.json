I also believe that it take a lot of effort and may be difficult to work through. But what if someone believes that they can't identify the root problem and that their anxiety just comes from some unknown source. If this is true, it would seem to be hopeless (and more depressing). What do you say to this line of thinking? Does anyone else believe some sources of anxiety are unknown?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwecwq/why_i_was_fat_how_i_dealt_with_my_unprocessed/heigen5/"}
