A few years back when I was around that young age as well (12), I always found comfort in food. Sugar everywhere. Soda and no water for days on end. Chip bags as I lied on my bed unable to find the energy to get up. I was probably vitamin deficient in almost all categories. Looking back now, that was around the time when I had a multitude of health problems: infections and colds that never went away, problems with my dental health, zero energy and constant physical and mental fatigue - you name it.\n\nFood was my only comfort back then. What you said perfectly describes it. I felt like I was eating a bundle of love and happiness, which I didn\u2019t realize was actually destroying me. I never gained much weight, yet my health was deteriorating right there.\n\nNow I\u2019m better. I still have a huge love for good food and some occasional drinks, but I no longer binge on it or reach for it the second I feel negatively. \n\nThanks for making this post. To see someone describe what I felt with such accuracy makes me feel a bit better about it. I\u2019m really glad that you managed to find your way out of that cycle, as not many people really do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwecwq/why_i_was_fat_how_i_dealt_with_my_unprocessed/hehzrc9/"}
