It's also no secret that getting drunk is a dumb idea... And that consuming alcohol lowers inhibitions and WILL interfere with pretty much most mental health meds you can be on.\n\nI'm not sure what you expected when you drank lol. Of course it was gonna be a shit time, literally what did you think would happen??? Stay away from booze while you're on meds. Alcohol free cocktails taste good too!\n\nThat said, you shouldn't make an experience you had while impaired your baseline or standard. It was an exceptional situation and you had an exceptional reaction. Thank your boyfriend for taking care of you and trying to protect you, work through whatever the actual fight was about and maybe think about wtf you're doing the next time you get the genius idea to drink while on meds \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nStay strong!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkd85t/i_havent_cut_myself_for_over_a_year_how_do_i/gnj8qxh/"}
