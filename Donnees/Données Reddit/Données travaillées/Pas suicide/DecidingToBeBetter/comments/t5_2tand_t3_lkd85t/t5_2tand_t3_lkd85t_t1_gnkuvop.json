The feelings usually need some time to relax and dissipate, so give them that space to calm down.  I suggest when feeling not great try asking yourself the question (it may seem weird):\n\nWhat if everything is fine just as it is? Because it probably is.\n\nTime is what helps me most, and hopefully it helps you.  I say this as someone who stopped i believe 2 years ago, and still want to from time to time when my emotions dip. I don\u2019t even need to be at rock bottom, it still feels good. But the whole world is hurtful and hard - no need to add more hurt to it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkd85t/i_havent_cut_myself_for_over_a_year_how_do_i/gnkuvop/"}
