Not because it\u2019s something to fall back on, but because you\u2019re consciously choosing to be better. It wasn\u2019t taken away from you. It\u2019s not taboo and dangerous and therefore sexy or alluring. It\u2019s right there. Bold. Raw. In the morning light. Nothing is hidden or forbidden or mysterious about cutting yourself. It\u2019s always a choice, and the fact that you choose not to only makes you stronger and more certain the next time you choose not to. You\u2019re building self-discipline on a record of choices you can be proud of. It\u2019ll always be there, but the good news is you\u2019ll always be stronger.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkd85t/i_havent_cut_myself_for_over_a_year_how_do_i/gnkp8n6/"}
