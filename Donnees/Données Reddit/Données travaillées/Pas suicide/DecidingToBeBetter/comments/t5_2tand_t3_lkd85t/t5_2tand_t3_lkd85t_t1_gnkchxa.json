I also noticed it mostly in the way I updated close friends and family, one week being so productive and then next week being embarrassed to talk to anyone because I\u2019m so low. Just something to consider because it\u2019s often hard to diagnose but then easy to treat. Best of luck on your journey sounds like you\u2019re doing great so far!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkd85t/i_havent_cut_myself_for_over_a_year_how_do_i/gnkchxa/"}
