Once I accepted that this would be a life long struggle, that made it a bit easier for me to recognize when I was starting to head down that slippery slope. \nI also have an amazing support system. My husband and I have a safe word for when my brain won't listent to reason. I encourage you to find something similar. For me, it helped retrain my brain to know where my limits were for sanity and bad choices. \nIt'll get easier the more time goes on, but for me it'll never go away. \n\nGood luck, and you always have people to talk to if needed :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkd85t/i_havent_cut_myself_for_over_a_year_how_do_i/gnkib6c/"}
