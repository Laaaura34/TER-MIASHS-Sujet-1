It's okay to be silly with this, and to feel silly while trying out other options. Test things out when not stressed, to make sure that any NOPE or yeah, maybe... feelings aren't affected by your stress. Can be harder to realise that something isn't going to work, or might work with more practise if you are stressed out.\n\nYou obviously need \"outlets\" - so let yourself have some. Some people like running, some people like knitting, some people like fishing, it doesn't really matter what it is. Personal experience suggest that something that involves physical movement might help more than sitting still though. \n\nBut I also know people that love embroidering to relieve intense stress, so to each their own.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkd85t/i_havent_cut_myself_for_over_a_year_how_do_i/gnk5bqr/"}
