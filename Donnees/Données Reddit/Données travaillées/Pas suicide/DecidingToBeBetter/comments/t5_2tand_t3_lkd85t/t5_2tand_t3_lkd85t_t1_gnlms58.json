I love the paper idea to show people how I\u2019m feeling. This might sound crazy but one of the reasons why I stated cutting was to show people I was in pain too. I didn\u2019t know how else to express that I was at my breaking point because I would get whiny and critical of my loved ones. Cutting showed them blood and the fact that I\u2019m cutting my skin must mean something is very wrong.\n\nI think the main emotions I want to release are grief and anguish. Sometimes frustration. \n\nAnd if you could recommend me books, I would appreciate it.
