You are on the right road.  I would cut out the drinking for a while.  I, myself also cut out drinking past 7 years  (without ever having a episode while drunk, but I know its not good for me).\n\nI used to self harm and its been 14 years since I cut.  I dont think of it until I am pushed to my emotional extreme edge.  If I feel trapped in my emotions or feel extremely misunderstood or a injustice happened.  \n\nQuiet time helps me.  Desensitizing in a hot shower in the dark.  No one around me.  Fresh clean cotton clothing.  Than a cuddly bed.  I invested in good blankets And sheets.  It feels loving and like a safe place.  My blankets are a cloud of comfort.  It helps me.  But everyone is different.  I also use soft lighting.  I use red christmas lights.  And i put clothes over brights lights.  I get myself into a relaxed environment and state.  And get the sleep in. Or watch a comforting show. \n\nEverytime you work past the stress and the urge to cut your rewiring your brain for a new way.  This may take some time.  Continue to be proactive, you noticed the drinking may be a trigger. Trust your intuition and cut it out for a while.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkd85t/i_havent_cut_myself_for_over_a_year_how_do_i/gnjxq6g/"}
