I haven\u2019t self harmed in 5 years and never want to again but at my lowest point there\u2019s that thought at the back of my mind. However the way I look at it is I just tell me self that it isn\u2019t an option for me. I think about the progress made and how doing that would set me back. I think the one thing that\u2019s stood out the most is I remember the expression on my moms face when she saw my burn mark (from self harm). She looked so sad and hurt and that memory sticks with me. So for me it\u2019s not an option at all of it means hurting someone I care about.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkd85t/i_havent_cut_myself_for_over_a_year_how_do_i/gnki4l9/"}
