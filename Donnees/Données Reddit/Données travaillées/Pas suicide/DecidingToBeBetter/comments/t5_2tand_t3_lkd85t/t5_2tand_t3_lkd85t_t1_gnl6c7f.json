Snap a rubberband on your wrist, get a designated person to text/contact, something, anything. Write out your feelings, something to get the feeling out. It\u2019s like getting struck by lightning, if you have an exit point, it won\u2019t hurt as much! Good luck! Be gentle and kind to yourself. You are lovely and worthy of all the goodness the universe holds.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lkd85t/i_havent_cut_myself_for_over_a_year_how_do_i/gnl6c7f/"}
