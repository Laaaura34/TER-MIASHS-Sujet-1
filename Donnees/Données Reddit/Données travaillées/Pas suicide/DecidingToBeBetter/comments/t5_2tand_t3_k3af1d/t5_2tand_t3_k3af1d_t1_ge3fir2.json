I used to think it was cathartic or liberating to lose myself in booze... but with self love I\u2019m realizing it\u2019s just sabotage. I am entitled to feel the authentic \u2728\u201duninhibited\u201d looseness of being wasted \u2728WHILE BEING JUST PLAIN SOBER ME. Does that make sense? Lmao \n\nI had my accident in January 2020, had to wait months for a virtual court that happened in August, and since august I had a 4 month \u201csentence\u201d before I can drive again etc. I was devastated and salty (still am often times) but having time to work remotely and heal my body and start loving myself is literally priceless. I miss my freedom but I don\u2019t miss lonely drives to liquor store parking lots. \n\nProud of you and us. \ud83e\udd73", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k3af1d/31_and_finally_waking_up_to_my_own_potential/ge3fir2/"}
