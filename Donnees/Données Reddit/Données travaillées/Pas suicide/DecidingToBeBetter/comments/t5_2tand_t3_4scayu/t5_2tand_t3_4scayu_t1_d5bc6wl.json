I agree with this - from personal experience and from watching others destroy themselves because they couldn't find a balance between caring for themselves and others. You need to strike a balance between self-love and love of others. \n\nI particularly liked the bit about the broken cup. You can try to fill it all you want, the joy will eventually seep out. This was brilliant! It's a clever way of saying that fundamentally the problem is much deeper than the cup being empty. People who are sad will sometimes need more intense, prolonged help to \"fix\" themselves (the cup.) \n\nLike the other's said however, sadness is fundamentally more complex than what the first statement takes it for. People typically can't just 'pop' out of sadness. Not to mention actual clinical depression! \n\nRegardless I think some responses here were rather harsh. OP's post is not without value.
