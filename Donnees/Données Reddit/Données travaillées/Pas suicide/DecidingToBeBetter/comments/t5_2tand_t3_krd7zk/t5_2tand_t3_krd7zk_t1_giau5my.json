You **DECIDE TO BE BETTER**. Once you make that decision, the next steps are practicing self-compassion and self-worth, empathy for others, owning your mistakes and being willing to apologize for them. Listen to your psychiatrist and begin to unlearn the negative habits that you've developed over your life.\n\nThe fact that you recognize that you treat people like shit and don't want to treat people like shit is a great first step. It's the first step of AA too. Admit that you have a problem. You don't need to join Cunts Anonymous or whatever, but it may be worth looking at the twelve steps and asking what you need to do to change yourself. You'll have setbacks, which is always part of the process of recovery. Own those mistakes. Apologize to others if you need to do so.\n\nAgain, I want to reiterate, the fact that you see your patterns of behavior and want to change them is the first step. You're deciding to be better. I'm proud of you. Keep it up.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/krd7zk/how_do_i_become_a_better_person/giau5my/"}
