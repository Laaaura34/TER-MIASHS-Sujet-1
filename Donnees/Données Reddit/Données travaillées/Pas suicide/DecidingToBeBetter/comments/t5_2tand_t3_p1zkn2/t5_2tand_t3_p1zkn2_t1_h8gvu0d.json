I love your advice about doing something that makes me feel like a kid again. What's funny is that I didn't mention what I did for work before the pandemic in my post, but I worked with kids (in various settings) and have since I was in highschool. This is actually the longest I've ever gone without being around kids (I don't have any of my own and I recently moved away from my niece/nephews). Before the pandemic, I WAS doing things that made me feel like a kid again, regularly. I am definitely going to try this out!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p1zkn2/ive_lost_my_sense_of_joy/h8gvu0d/"}
