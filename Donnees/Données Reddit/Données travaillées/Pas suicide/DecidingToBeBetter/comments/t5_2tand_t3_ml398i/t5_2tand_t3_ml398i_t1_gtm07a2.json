That is incredibly kind of you. They know I\u2019m coming in blind, but it\u2019s a training program at first so hopefully they can answer my questions.\nHowever, I will take you up on that (assuming you\u2019re in US) and PM you because I\u2019ve seen a couple red flags about the company already.\nThanks again for posting.
