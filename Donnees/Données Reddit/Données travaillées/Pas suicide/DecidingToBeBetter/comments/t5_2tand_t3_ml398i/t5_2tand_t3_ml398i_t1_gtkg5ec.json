For anyone looking to get into telecoms be prepared for this scenario. I got this new job on the people I knew. I got my resume pushed. I was using every connection I had ever made in the 4 years at my old job to get a new one - I was desperate. Luckily some of the connections I made had direct lines to people at companies that were hiring and looking for someone just like me. The more I think about it the more I realize how lucky I was with timing.\n\nGlad to hear you finally got something better though. The bigger companies are for sure going to have an easier time brushing over you when looking to hire within because there are so many to choose from. But still sucks you weren't even considered based off merit rather than connections. That never feels good.\n\nedit: typeo", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ml398i/i_quit_an_abusive_job_and_now_normal_jobs_seem/gtkg5ec/"}
