It was fun to be home at first and not having to work but after now a full year I\u2019ve slowly had enough. Not only would I like to have some structure again, but financially it\u2019s of course also been a bit of a struggle even though the system here is okay I guess, compared to other countries, from what I\u2019ve seen...\nJob hunting is the worst. I hate writing cover letters and answering the same questions over and over again in interviews. But I\u2019m still hopeful (most of the time at least haha) that I\u2019ll find something soon :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ml398i/i_quit_an_abusive_job_and_now_normal_jobs_seem/gtkhfnl/"}
