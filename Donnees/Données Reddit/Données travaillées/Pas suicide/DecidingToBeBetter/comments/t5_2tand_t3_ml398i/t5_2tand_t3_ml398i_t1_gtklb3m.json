Then, being told what I was doing wasn't enough when I had asked for help, not gotten any, and then get told I was not doing my job. Basically there was no point of building me up just always tearing me down. I never got recognized or thanked for the time and effort I had put in to keeping my job moving. I was really up in the air about using the term \"abusive\" and looking back, toxic may have been more fitting.. I also didn't expect this kind of response! But you're not totally wrong in it not being abusive, i would agree maybe toxic would be better choice of words. Thank you for the kind words!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ml398i/i_quit_an_abusive_job_and_now_normal_jobs_seem/gtklb3m/"}
