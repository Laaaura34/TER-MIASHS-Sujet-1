I thought ok been here long enough let me apply for other positions in the company . I had been turned down 4 times at different positions and constantly been on top for 4 years and these are all in technical positions. I saw people in my team and in the Centre getting better positions and starting off the same time as me. Then I realized its all about who you know at this company and who you buddy buddy with in the smoke room. Then I got position closer to home with another company better pay as well and left . The former company I use to work with use to be one of the top in the telecoms filed however now they just going down from what I hear .", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ml398i/i_quit_an_abusive_job_and_now_normal_jobs_seem/gtjufdu/"}
