The only downfall to this is putting it on your resume that you were there for such a short time, but you can always explain this in an interview at a new company. I know I did. For our generation its very common for someone to stick around at a job for like 3-5 years to get the experience and move on. That was not my intention with this situation but it happened anyways. You're kind of in a tough spot, I would try to make it a year at least but if its taking a severe toll on your mental health then try finding a new job now. If you want to stay where you are and try to improve, go through the effort of trying to be the one that asks the tough questions. Question processes, make sure its known that if you don't know how to do something that they know it. I was always offered training when I was asked if I could do something, but it was so that person did not have to do it anymore. Its def a tricky situation. \n\nI let my employer know at the beginning of 2020 that I was afraid I wouldn't have the time to handle all these processes. I was told I would get help and it never came. I gave them every opportunity to make it up to me and at least appreciate me and it never happened. If you can see this happening and you know its not going to improve, improve it yourself. I hope this helps, if not, send me a PM.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ml398i/i_quit_an_abusive_job_and_now_normal_jobs_seem/gtnid2s/"}
