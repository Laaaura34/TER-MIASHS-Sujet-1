You seem to be a bright and positive person who wants to help and work as a team. I'm so glad you are happy and that your new role is living up to your dreams. \n\nI just want to warn you to be mindful of volunteering to take on extra work, while you might feel you are helping, you could get landed with this new task. This happens over and over and next thing you know you are drowning under an unmanageable workload. It's a pattern with good employees and it only goes one way. \n\nI only mention it as I am the same and have had to learn how to be wary of how I volunteer to ensure I don't get landed with all the work and responsibility. \n\nIt certainly helps to have a supportive management team so keep an eye on your workload and stress levels and if it starts to become heavy, make sure to highlight and ask for support.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ml398i/i_quit_an_abusive_job_and_now_normal_jobs_seem/gtm52zu/"}
