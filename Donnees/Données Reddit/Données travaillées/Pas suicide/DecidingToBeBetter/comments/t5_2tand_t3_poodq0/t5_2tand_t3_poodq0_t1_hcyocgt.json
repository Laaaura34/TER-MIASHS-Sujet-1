What made me work on it was the frustation and sadness I would feel when people had no problem putting themselves first at my expense. I would get soooo mad at them for being so selfish. Then I realized I was actually mad at myself for not standing up for myself. Slowly but surely, I have been able to say no and mean it. Saying yes and meaning it. I let my feelings guide me... not other people guide me. What I also noticed, people will respect you more because you are telling then how to treat you. They will NOT hate you, I promise. If they do hate you, well then its better for them to stay away if they can't respect your boundaries. I also learned you are not an evil person for communicating what you want. If you don't learn this, people will walk all over you and discard you like trash. Its up to you to stop them. Otherwise. You are giving your power away because they will never know what it is you need. They will always act and respond to their benefit so its up to you to have your voice heard. It will set you free!!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/poodq0/for_the_people_pleasers_of_this_sub_how_did_you/hcyocgt/"}
