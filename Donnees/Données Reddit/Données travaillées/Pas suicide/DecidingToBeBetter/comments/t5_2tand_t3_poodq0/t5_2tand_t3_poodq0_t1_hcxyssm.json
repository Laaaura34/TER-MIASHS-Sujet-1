It was an extremely uncomfortable process, no one likes finding out that they're crossing boundaries and it's scary trying to advocate for yourself when you don't know how. It was also not lit realizing exactly how much I perpetuate the nonsensical stuff my wild parents taught me about loving people, but I did it by sticking with the goal. \n\nIt took a lot of trial and error- for example, I had to learn how to set boundaries before they become a problem, and how to communicate with people in a way that is firm but kind even when they're upset with me. I had to learn to be okay with people being upset with me and even how to listen to my body when my parasympathetic nervous system is reacting to my environment. \n\nThat being said, the rewards of that journey have been immense. I am worlds away from how I used to be, my past self feels like a strange dream, my life is completely my own, and I like being me now. You should absolutely stick with this effort, it's so worth it.\n\nThe resource that helped me most is Dr. Nicole LePara, she's on Instagram as The Holistic Psychologist and she published an extremely useful book called How to Do the Work. I absolutely recommend it, or at the very least seeing the stuff she posts about", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/poodq0/for_the_people_pleasers_of_this_sub_how_did_you/hcxyssm/"}
