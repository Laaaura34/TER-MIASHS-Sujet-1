I used to and still do get really angry when people do that as well. I think of myself as kind and generous and I have 100% had people take advantage of that. It's so frustrating. I would love to just continue saying no to people but I always think I'll come off as rude? Like for work if I'm told to always say yes to projects and work... that's just going to burn me out. And with friends who pressure me to do things I don't want to, it's also hard to say no.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/poodq0/for_the_people_pleasers_of_this_sub_how_did_you/hd06k74/"}
