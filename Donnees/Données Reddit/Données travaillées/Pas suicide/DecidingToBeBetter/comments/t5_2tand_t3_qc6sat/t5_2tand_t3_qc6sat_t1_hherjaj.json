When you wake up remember your resolve & go out & get a smoothie or so e healthy juice stuff. Something to make you feel cleaner inside. Have a cold shower ( I just cut cold turkey & had a cold bath that night ) & ask for support. You can designate a friend to text / call to distract you by talking about other stuff when you're feeling like it. I don't even remember why I stopped, I do remember people distracting me from it & then it being too late to buy some & my smoker friends were sleeping already. It happened 2/3 days in a row. Oh & I stopped hanging out with my smoker buddies as well. However I've never smoked more than 2 months in a row & I only smoked first time in my 30s so maybe it was easier to start & stop feeling like it was just a way to get over a bad phase of life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qc6sat/how_can_i_finally_put_an_end_to_smoking_weed/hherjaj/"}
