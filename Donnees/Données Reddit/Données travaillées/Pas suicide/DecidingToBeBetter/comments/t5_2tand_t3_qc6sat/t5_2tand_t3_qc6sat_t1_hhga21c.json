And if you feel like you can truly use it as a tool and not a crutch (and have previous positive experiences with it), try microdosing psilocybin (lots of resources here and elsewhere - DM me if you want some pointers. But I generally would not recommend it if you\u2019ve never tried it before only because it can be overwhelming to experiment with something you have zero experience with while also stopping weed). The withdrawal symptoms are different for everyone, but they will most likely be strong for you as your body probably doesn\u2019t know how to function the way it used to without THC in your system. Definitely recommend r/leaves to help you prepare for the journey. The very best of luck to you. Your life will open up in amazing and unexpected ways!\n\n(Personal experience - worked for a cannabis company for years before switching industries to become a lobbyist working on psilocybin. Stopped weed this June after years of daily use so I can get my body ready to get pregnant.)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qc6sat/how_can_i_finally_put_an_end_to_smoking_weed/hhga21c/"}
