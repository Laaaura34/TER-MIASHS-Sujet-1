Grab yourself some CBD and try to smoke that once you feel another craving coming on, then *immediately* start doing something immersive. Video Games are my goto, but you can also try working out or just going for a walk until the craving subsides. \n\nStill treat yourself to the occasional THC though. Set limits on specific times you'll allow yourself to smoke regular weed, and try to stick to it. I personally choose to smoke around bedtime, because I know that I'll be asleep for the next 7 hours, then busy for the next 10 hours due to transit and work. \n\nAnd for that matter, try to fill your day with distractions. Go to the gym, go our to eat more, hang out with friends if they're close, attend some meetups, speak to your employees if you have any, etc.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qc6sat/how_can_i_finally_put_an_end_to_smoking_weed/hhef79n/"}
