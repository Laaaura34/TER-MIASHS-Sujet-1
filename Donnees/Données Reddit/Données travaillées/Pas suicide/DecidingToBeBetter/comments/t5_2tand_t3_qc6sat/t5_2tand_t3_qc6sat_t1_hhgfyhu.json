Lose your plugs number. \n\nI know this sounds oversimple but here\u2019s the thing, you\u2019re only exerting willpower when there is something to resist against. If there is no weed in the house and you can\u2019t get more, the choice is made for you. Also to parrot what others have said, after you have a week of no smoking I\u2019d say you\u2019d start to realise the benefits you\u2019ve been missing. I find that when I\u2019m smoking daily I think I\u2019m feeling fine, until I stop, and then everything becomes easier and less hazy.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qc6sat/how_can_i_finally_put_an_end_to_smoking_weed/hhgfyhu/"}
