It would usually relax me enough to not have the urge to smoke.\n\nThe first few days are hard but after the 4th or 5th day it starts to become a little easier. You'll remember it being a week before you smoked last, two weeks, a month, etc.\n\nYou'll also most likely have days where you'll get super stressed and all you want to do is smoke but you gotta stay strong and not start again. Going on a break and smoking once or twice a month is fine if you want to reward yourself, but you need to make sure that its a few occasions only.\n\nIt all depends on how bad you want it. I smoked for 4 years straight and after not smoking for 1.5-2 months I noticed how much happier I was and more pleasent to be around. I didnt realize how bad my memory was when I was smoking before I took a break.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qc6sat/how_can_i_finally_put_an_end_to_smoking_weed/hhej5tq/"}
