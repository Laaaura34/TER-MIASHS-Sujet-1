Many orthopaedic patients develop a physical dependency on their opiate painkillers without any addiction.  They feel like shit for a few days if they suddenly stop taking them, but can often ride it out.\n\nAddiction is when something gets ingrained into the dopamine reward pathway - usually something that gives the user an escape from emotional distress.  \n\nMost addicts have been primed by some kind of trauma, either a single horrible incident (rape, loss of a loved one etc) or chronic lower-level trauma (like years of being bullied, or growing up in grinding poverty)\n\nThe actual substance of addiction is whatever triggers the dopamine pathway strongly.\n\nI'm an addict - sober for many years now.  Cocaine, which is supposed to be a scarily addictive substance, is something I could do, enjoy then leave alone.  Weed, which is often described an not particularly addictive, was one of the two things I just couldn't leave alone.  Alcohol was the other.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qc6sat/how_can_i_finally_put_an_end_to_smoking_weed/hheo6sm/"}
