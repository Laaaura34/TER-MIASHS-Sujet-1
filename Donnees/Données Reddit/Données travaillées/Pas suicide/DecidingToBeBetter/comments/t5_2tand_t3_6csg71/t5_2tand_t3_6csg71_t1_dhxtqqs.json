Wow I actually thought I might've written this subconsciously.\n\nIm a dancer and im very self conscious about how i will be recieved. I do live shows and all. I just always drifted back to my consoles. I may want to branch out. Maybe start a youtube channel. Finish school and eliminating debt is my first priority. After that im just in my apartment doing nothing but eat sleep games and sex. \n\nWith all that I am glad I have someone making that transition with me. Definitely feels less frightening when you are around (textually???) like minded people. \n\nGreat post and hope to see you on the other side.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/6csg71/ive_just_admitted_to_myself_what_the_central/dhxtqqs/"}
