It relaxes my muscles and reduces inflammation in my joints (which increases the impact of the workout and reduces recovery time).\n\nIf I work more than 10 hours straight, I'll smoke in order to relax and get my brain out of \"crush it\" mode.\n\nIf I hit all my goals for the week, I'll smoke with a few friends on Saturday or Sunday and watch comedy or play games or go on a hike,  or go to the beach, etc.\n\nIt's a great tool if used responsibly and better for your health than coffee or alcohol.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/6csg71/ive_just_admitted_to_myself_what_the_central/di347sv/"}
