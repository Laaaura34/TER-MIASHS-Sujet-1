Invest. I had an ex who drove me into a 200K bankruptcy about 13 years ago. I got rid of the woman, but not the bills if I wanted to keep my house. Took me 5 years to get it paid off, but once that was taken care of I realized I was rather far behind on retirement savings. Instead of suddenly living it up like I could have I chose to save and invest the extra money. As of now 42% of my paycheck is put away. As I\u2019ve made more money I\u2019ve increased the percentage, and I fear no bill or expense.\n\nI carry zero credit card balances and other than normal monthly expenses including the mortgage I\u2019m debt free. Congrats on getting yourself out of the hole. Maintain that discipline and you\u2019ll ensure yourself a bright and comfortable future.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p204ui/after_5_years_i_paid_off_70000_of_credit_card/h8iq9pa/"}
