I work in design, not CS, but I make 2-3x more freelancing than I did when I was an employee. You trade \"job security\" for getting paid what you're actually worth. Freelancing also allows you to work for multiple companies with much less management looking over your shoulder every 15 minutes. My output is also 2-3x more and the work is better for my portfolio.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p204ui/after_5_years_i_paid_off_70000_of_credit_card/h8ke5tr/"}
