Even if it's something that is I am not able to do for myself. The project I'm working on has me think of something that happened daily that made me feel uncomfortable and write out my thoughts that I had and then analyze why I feel that way. And then come up with more rational thoughts that are healthier than my original ones. I didn't really think it would help, subconsciously I'm starting to stop with my automatic thoughts of blame and need to help and realize, that sometimes kind words just like \"That sucks.\" is all you can do. It makes me realize that the whole world does not need me to fix things.  \n\nI'm never one who reads self help books, but I'm going to promote this workbook (The Self-Esteem Workbook) by Dr Schiraldi. I'm not even halfway through, and I feel a lot better about myself.  ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/6iekik/how_to_find_the_balance_between_caring_for_others/dj7dk4o/"}
