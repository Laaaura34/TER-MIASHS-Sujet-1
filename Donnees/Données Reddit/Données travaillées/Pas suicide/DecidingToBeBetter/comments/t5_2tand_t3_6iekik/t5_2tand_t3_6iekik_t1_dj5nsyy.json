I have the same issue, and if you don't address it, people pleasing will definitely eat up your identity. \nWhat has worked for me is reminding myself that I can help others around me best when I am in a healthy place. Setting limits is really a very loving thing to do in all your relationships, because you are showing others that you respect yourself, and that you respect them enough to be honest. Start with little things, and use language that makes it easier. For example, if you're feeling overwhelmed by helping someone: \"I want to help you with this, I know it's important to you- I'd like to take a little time for myself and come back to it, and we can tackle it together then.\" Anyone who responds negatively to this has their own issues with expectations on you. Just remind yourself to be straightforward and honest about where you are, and what you need, and find a loving way to tell people what those needs are. You can do it!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/6iekik/how_to_find_the_balance_between_caring_for_others/dj5nsyy/"}
