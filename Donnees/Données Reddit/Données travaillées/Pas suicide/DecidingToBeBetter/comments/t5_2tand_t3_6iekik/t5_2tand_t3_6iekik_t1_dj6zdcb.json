I really can't recommend this book enough to both man and woman despite it's tragic title. \n\nThere is a huge difference in what caring for other people does and what caretaking is. Care taking which is likely what you are doing now is smothering others, it is not your job to fix everyone problems, by doing so you are actively hurting them by taking away their independence to be able to face their own problems. \n\nYou need to give people around more credit, there is no need to disrespect them by thinking that if you can't fix their problems, they will surly fail, people are much more resilient than you think. Others like you sometimes need time for themselves to just sit down and think about their own problems and start working through them.\n\nWhen you worry about everyone else feelings you are that guy at school who allows everyone to copy their homework, you help them short term bu likely hurting their education progress long term. \n\nYou also need to understand that having your own needs and feelings doesn't make you selfish, telling your friends that you can't help them with something tonight because you are going out won't make them hate you. They will still be your friends but may also gain a lot of respect for you for sticking to your decisions.
