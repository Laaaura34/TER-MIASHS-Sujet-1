So I started to plan out my days, hour by hour, every little thing I had to do. It seems excessive, and maybe uptight, but it made everything SO much easier!! I still do it today. Any time I'm not sure what I need to do today, I just look at my schedule and do it. It removes so much stress from my everyday life.\n\nI recommend it :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1xr7aw/do_you_plan_your_day_proactively_planning_our_day/cfe8r1a/"}
