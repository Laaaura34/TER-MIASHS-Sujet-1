You are doing your best under your current circumstances and you should applaud yourself for reaching out for support! My advice is to (1) determine your priorities, aka what are the things that if you could change them, would have the greatest beneficial impact on your life and (2) then commit to just a few actions (that you promise to do consistently) to make progress on those priorities. For example, if you feel like your mindset is holding you back from your full potential, commit to watching some YouTube videos or reading books/articles that will empower you with the perspectives/skills needed to get further. Or, if it's not making enough money, commit to learning how you can increase your earning potential at your current jobs, switch jobs, or find another way to earn money. Perfection isn't the goal, but consistency and clarity re your priorities is essential. If you are making gradual progress and getting 1% better every day, then I believe you will reach all of your goals!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1a4oy/how_do_i_keep_up/hfei2rb/"}
