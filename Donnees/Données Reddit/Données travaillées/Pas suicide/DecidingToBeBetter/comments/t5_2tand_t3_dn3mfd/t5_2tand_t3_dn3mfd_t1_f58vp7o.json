First time I made the decision to call and proceeded to make the call without consulting my mom. I just sat down and told her I was going and she just cried from joy. First time I not only agreed but even considered doing 60 days. First time I'm looking into sober living afterwards. I'm on day two here but I feel like this is the start of finding myself again and being happy.\n\nI'm only 25 but its been a tough road. I'm so happy for y'all! Keep it up. I won't do traditional NA or AA but I know of multiple alternative groups around me to attend once I get done with this program. I look forward to not making anymore excuses and bullshitting myself and finding my community.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dn3mfd/my_motherinlaw_got_her_1_year_sober_chip_from_her/f58vp7o/"}
