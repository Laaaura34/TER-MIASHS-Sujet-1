Because my mom died of an overdose 5 years ago. \n\nWanna know why I cheer myself on?\nBecause I was physically abused as a child and often alone bouncing from group home to group home. \n\nWanna know why I started smoking, drinking, and doing reckless things just to get positive attention from others?\nBecause I felt like I had no one and became willing to do anything for anyone. \n\nOnce I decided that I was the one in control, regardless of if anyone stood with me or not, everything changed. \n\nThe choice is yours though. You can choose to continue the cycle of self-loathing or you can march\u2014or limp slowly\u2014forward. Start your own parade and people will join. I guarantee you people will come cheer you on.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/dn3mfd/my_motherinlaw_got_her_1_year_sober_chip_from_her/f5ad31y/"}
