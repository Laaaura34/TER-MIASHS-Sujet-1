This is fact and it doesn't change whether you're eating vegetables or burgers. \nThis means that you either need to reduce your caloric intake to match your current expenditure OR you need to up your expenditure. \nThe best option IMO would be to both reduce calories and also up your expenditure (find some kind of physical exercise that you enjoy).\nIn regards to what to eat - common sense! Just eat real food (vegetables, fruits, nuts, meats, etc). Avoid processed foods if possible and learn to read labels when you buy things like sauce (most are full of added sugar).\n\nGood luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/drsbcb/not_sure_where_to_start_for_help/f6lmodp/"}
