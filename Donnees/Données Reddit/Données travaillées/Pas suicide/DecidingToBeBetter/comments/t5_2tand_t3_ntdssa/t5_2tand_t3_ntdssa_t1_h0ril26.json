Benzodiazapenes are incredibly physically addictive, and people can and do die from the withdrawals. If I were you, I would go down as far as possible -- try going down to 2x a day -- and then going to detox. The less you're on, the easier that detox will be, but at the very least you're going to need to have your vital signs monitored when you come off of it completely.  At such a low dose you shouldn't be in too much danger, but it's still better to be monitored, especially your blood pressure.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ntdssa/low_dose_xanax_anyone/h0ril26/"}
