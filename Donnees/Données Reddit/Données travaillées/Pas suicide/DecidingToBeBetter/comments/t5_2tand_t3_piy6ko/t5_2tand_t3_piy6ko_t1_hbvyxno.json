I did this slowly  over the past 4 months.   Lost all the weight I wanted to lose, lost my belly, feel super-charged practically everyday. I have a few tips I want to share with the assumption that we all want to see rapid cascading changes.\n\n* When you start this process of transformation, work on changes that bring about big energy gains with low effort.  For example, I replaced my greasy breakfast with what I call \"Fruits on the run\" where I pack half a dozen fruits and eat them as I walk or jog 5 miles.   That made me more energetic and I  easily made other changes.  With vastly improved energy levels, smaller changes like \"flossing twice a day\" were very easy to make.\n* It is okay to **occasionally** eat junk food or other behaviors that you know aren't good for you  **as long as** they are not in response to a cue. That is, they shouldn't follow a temporal or other event pattern (habit forming).   You could take a Every-Friday-Pizza habit  to  something more random.\n\nI have mostly focused on health and fitness so far and it has paid off (I'll probably work on a get-rich scheme next :-).   I can go on and on and on about all the  positive health improvements I see.  My biggest however is when I go to bed, I am so eager for the next day!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/piy6ko/habit_stacking_how_to_successfully_build_habits/hbvyxno/"}
