Good or bad everyone is in their own bubble to get better. I have really bad anxiety and struggled at first thinking I looked like a total noob. Just go throw yourself on a treadmill and walk a mile. While doing that observe others working out just to see what methods they use. That was the easiest way for my foot in the door. \n\nLiterally no one cares you're there. You will feel like you moved mountains after your first treadmill sesh. Just slow and steady. No reason to blow your energy in .2 miles and become discouraged from the exhaustion. It just isn't going to work that way", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kje20j/i_worked_out_every_single_day_for_3_weeks/ggwvhur/"}
