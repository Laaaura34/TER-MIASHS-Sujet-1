I just smoke weed occasionally (not that it is any better) to distract myself ever since the pandemic started. I have reduced the amount that I used to smoke in the last 2 months though, I was smoking a joint every night to sleep but now I'll enjoy a small one every other day to wind down. It is an extensive habit so I'd like to stop completely soon, I just need to wean it off slowly since the last time I quit cold turkey I relapsed quicker. Thank you for the suggestion though! I'm gonna work hard at it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kje20j/i_worked_out_every_single_day_for_3_weeks/ggwmpiv/"}
