Glad to hear!\n\nIf you want, download an app called \u201cShred\u201d. It\u2019s free and there\u2019s a \u201cbasic\u201d workout that\u2019s free, but it gives you different body workouts every time and even has an \u201cat home\u201d or \u201cat gym\u201d option which will convert the workout to let\u2019s say push-ups instead of a bench press!\nGoodluck & keep up the amazing work!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kje20j/i_worked_out_every_single_day_for_3_weeks/ggwen80/"}
