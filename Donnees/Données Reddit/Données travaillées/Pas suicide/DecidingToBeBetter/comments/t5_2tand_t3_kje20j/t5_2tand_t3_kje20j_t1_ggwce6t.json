I struggle to workout too. I have depression and anxiety as well. I used to work out before the depression and what kept me going back then was the rush of endorphins after a work out. Now, i don't feel those endorphins after a work out and it is so much harder to continue the routine. There is no good feeling after for me. \n\nI also find that when i plan to work out, i frequently spend an entire day to psych myself up to do it and then my day was basically just psyching myself up and working out and nothing else.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kje20j/i_worked_out_every_single_day_for_3_weeks/ggwce6t/"}
