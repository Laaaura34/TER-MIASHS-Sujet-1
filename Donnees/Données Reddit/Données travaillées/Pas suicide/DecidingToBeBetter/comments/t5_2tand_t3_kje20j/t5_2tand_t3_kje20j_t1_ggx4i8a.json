I began running around mid-June because my exercise bike seat somehow caused my ass to go numb yet also be excruciatingly painful at the same time. I\u2019m still running 4 times per week, but I\u2019ve never had one week, let alone 3 in a row, where a workout was completed 7 days in a row. One thing I\u2019ve learned, just focus on doing it because it makes you feel good, because visual results can fluctuate, at least with me anyway. Some days I feel like I look like a stud. Some days I look like shrek. But there\u2019s never been a day I wasn\u2019t happy with the fact that I got out and ran 4-5 miles.
