Here's the thing--I also had businesses, write, and did a bunch of other stuff while I was teaching, so I really knew the \"real world.\"  (I left the classroom 4 years ago, switched careers, got poached).   When teachers would tell me I was too lenient w deadlines, etc because \"their boss would fire them in the real world,\" I could say... \n\n\"Um, I am a boss in the real world. Nothing ever ships on time.\" lol.  And edu became about data... in \"the real world\" if I ever had an employee collect data that'd never be used for hundreds of hours... I'd fire myself! \n\nI tell you the truth--many of my \"failing\" students were way smarter than valedictorians. They saw through the nonsense. And they weren't being served. I mean, there were lazy kids, too, but 90% of the deal was figuring out the passion and showing them the path that a textbook didn't show.   Very simple.   And all relationship based with a little drop of probable ADHD so you can see all the visions at once.  \n\nI wish I could push fast forward 4 or 6 years and see what kind of medicine you choose. I get to do that with a lot of my kids bc even though I'm gone, they're still in my inbox, many of them:)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qa9mld/started_my_20s_with_a_18_gpa_and_homeless_ended/hh46j3u/"}
