One was that if you save gratitude practice for before bed it can put you in the mindset of actively looking for interesting things to be grateful for as you go about your day. Another was to take some time at the end of the week to review your daily entries and make a list for the week. This makes sense for me because I never really look back  on mine and  I probably repeat the same things every other day.\n\nAnother tip the guest had was to give yourself permission to complain, but promise that you'll follow each complaint with 3 things your grateful for.\n\nLots of good stuff here:\n\n[https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9tb2Rlcm53aXNkb20ubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M/episode/YjFlOWU3NWYtZTMwZC00MmE5LWE4YzUtMDNjYWY0OWM3YTFk](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9tb2Rlcm53aXNkb20ubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M/episode/YjFlOWU3NWYtZTMwZC00MmE5LWE4YzUtMDNjYWY0OWM3YTFk)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mp2lb9/gratitude_and_forgiveness_practice/gwhw9rn/"}
