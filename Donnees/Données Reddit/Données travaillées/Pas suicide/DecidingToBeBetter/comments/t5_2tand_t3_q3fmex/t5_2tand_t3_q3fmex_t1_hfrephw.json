We spend all our lives just trying to get by and eventually it's hard to feel you've accomplished anything, or found your place in the world. I really wish that the today's world wasn't so affronted by constant bad things. Between humanitarian issues to continued progressions of environmental events, it's hard to feel like it's a world worth fighting worth for and easy to be jealous of other who seem to treck through unscathed.\n\nHonestly, the only thing helping me and my own mental health right now is hard line boundaries with people. And then enforcing them instead of letting people trample them. Another thing has been to do Cognitive Thought Restructuring. Pick a thing that you worry about, and then turn it into a positive. \"what if I disappoint my Team.\" would be \"today I can show how helpful I am to my team\".\n\nEtc etc.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q3fmex/i_feel_sincerely_inferior_to_others/hfrephw/"}
