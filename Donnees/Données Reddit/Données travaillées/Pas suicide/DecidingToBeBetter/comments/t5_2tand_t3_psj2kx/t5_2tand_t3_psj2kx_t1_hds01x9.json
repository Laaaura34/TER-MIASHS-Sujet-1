I'm no expert, but I've been in a similar situation when I was 21. I'm currently a 27F and I was very unhappy when I was younger and in college. I quit and made a big change... I joined the military. (I'm not promoting the military if you think it's not for you, but think about making a big change.) As a young person, it's important to try new things and go for big changes while you can!\n\nAlso think about doing things you like! Changes don't have to be scary!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/psj2kx/i_hit_rock_bottom_where_to_start/hds01x9/"}
