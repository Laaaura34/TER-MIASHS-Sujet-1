You \n\n-> are overweight\n-> don't have college degree \n-> don't have any friends \n-> don't have a job \n\nOkay , now what you do have is time :). Remember , rationally the only things required for a happy life are money, health and friends , and for money you need education( of some sort atleast ) \n\nRemember improving any one aspect of the above will motivate you to chase the rest. Now I'd recommend you start with fitness , this is no joke once you start taking care of your body and start seeing little changes,  you'll feel enormous positivity and this will be great way  to slowly channel out your depression.\n\nNow you said you failed college , it doesn't mean you can't try again ? Idk what your interests are but having basic college degree is always a good thing and studying requires effort, both mentally and physically but now since you're fit and confident you'll see mentally you may want to study the only thing is to physically sit at a place and actually study ( this habiy takes time , but you already have it :) \n\nNow finally friends are something that you cannot just buy or get. Since your working out , studying ..  you'll meet people , be nice to them, start striking convos eventually you'll learn  to socialize.\n\nNow Remember,  none of the above will work if you don't ACT , take action TODAY or else you'll just keep thinking. \n\nAs for your parents ,they are sure to get disappointed but if they are nor being supportive don't bother. It's not them who have the opportunities coming up.. it's you , go fking show them gurl!! U got it \ud83d\udc4d\n\nMy dms are always open for any further advice/vent\n\nLong comment  coz I feel u as I've been there too :)\n\nAll the best !", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/psj2kx/i_hit_rock_bottom_where_to_start/hdrbn2w/"}
