Whether it be a hobby, or exercise, or want big habits (lots of evidence to suggest a healthy diet improves symptoms of depression), or school if you feel so inclined, or reading a book, anything. \n\nAs quickly as it feels like things spiral, they can just as quickly improve. \n\nExample. Focus on a hobby. Join a club. (Maybe Halifax sport and social club, language practice, dungeons and dragons? Whatever). Even if the whole week feels depressing, try to enjoy that one hour a week. Say you join a soccer team (indoor women\u2019s soccer is starting soon for example\u2014no experience necessary. From that you will inevitably feel a little better with the exercise, which may help you eat better, which may lessen depressive symptoms and being on the team, you\u2019ll get some socialisation, maybe make some friends, suddenly you start feeling a lot better about yourself.\n\nMaybe this will encourage you to reach out to chat to a physician. \n\nDo you work at the moment? Maybe try getting a part-time job, while you figure things out?\n\nMove at your own pace though, but just keep moving. Even if its go for a 15 min walk, or update your resume. \n\nCelebrate all your wins, no matter how small! \n\nMost people go through ruts. You\u2019ll get through it! You reached out on here, so that in itself is a positive step. Well done!
