Where to start?\n\n> I want to find myself again. I want to enjoy things like I used to. I want to be positive person like I was before.\n\nSounds to me like you answered your own question.  The most important step in deciding to be better is articulating what direction you want your life to go.  You *will* end up in the direction you head towards.  Instead of specific advice about how to accomplish those three things, my suggestion is to focus on staying the course over the long term.  Like selecting a landmark in the distance to head towards when you\u2019re lost.\n\nThe three goals you named are healthy ones.  Moving toward them will undoubtedly lead to more motivation to pursue other healthy goals later down the road.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/psj2kx/i_hit_rock_bottom_where_to_start/hdswe1x/"}
