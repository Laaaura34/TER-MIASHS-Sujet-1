That speaks highly.\nOh gosh, go easy in yourself. Just take a few steps in the right direction every day and you will be amazed where you will be in a year. I find that hanging around the right people makes a HUGE difference. I like to keep my mind fresh with new ideas so that means I need to move my body on a daily basis. Like long walks. Just start today. But start. All the best now. It's your turn.  :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/psj2kx/i_hit_rock_bottom_where_to_start/hdruerv/"}
