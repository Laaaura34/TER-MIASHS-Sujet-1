I used to feel the same way but with ideas I would have in another field ( math and philosophy ). I can't claim to know how to make you feel better but I can offer you some of what gave me solace. I should credit my professor here because they helped me with this one.\n\nSo here goes, great writers love to read, great physicists build on the work of those past, as do mathematicians and philosophers. They could have begrudged their predecessors for having discovered/done things that they could have done themselves and they'd not have gotten where they were. The greatest ability mankind has is that we can take the knowledge, skills, and work of the past and build upon it.\n\nI know it feels terrible to see all your ideas being done before you can put them out yourself. But ( and maybe I'm being a little cheesy here ) I believe that you've the potential to take all that has been done before you, learn from it, and then offer to the world your rendition of these talents. That is harder, yes, you would have to top your predecessors but if there's anyone that can do it, it would be someone like yourself right? Someone who from youth was able to envision much of what they see already out there. All you have to do is keeping moving forward. In the spirit of this subreddit, decide to be better!\n\nWhile shallow of me considering I do not know you, I believe you're more than capable of this. Again I don't mean this to be the solution to all your problems. I'm only sharing this as if comforted me once too and I wish to pass it on!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ncmckt/severe_creative_envy/gyam56n/"}
