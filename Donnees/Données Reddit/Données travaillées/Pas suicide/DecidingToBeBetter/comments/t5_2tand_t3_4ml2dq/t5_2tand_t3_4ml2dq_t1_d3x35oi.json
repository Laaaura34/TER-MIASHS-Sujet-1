I'm not saying you're going to have full-blown panic attacks and or pee your pants with terrror, but it's still aw projection that's by no means certain. I mean,  you *are positive* that you will only act one specific way? \n\n> In fact, I consider myself very logical\n\nAll fear has a certain logic behind it. It *may* be an entirely rational fear. But often it's not. I also consider myself a very logical person. Heck,  I used to belong to a \"Skeptic\"  Meetup group. But I've also struggled with irrational phobia. In fact, the definition of a phobia us a fear that you know it's irrational,  but you experience it anyway. \"Fear of failure\"  sums up all my socal and career problems quite well, actually. \n\nFear of failure has a much thicker veneer of rationalization,  but it's cut from the same cloth,  to mix my tangible object metaphors :P\n\nAlso, not to armchair-analyze you, but you seem wedded to this conviction about mental illness \"not affecting you since you were 12\".
