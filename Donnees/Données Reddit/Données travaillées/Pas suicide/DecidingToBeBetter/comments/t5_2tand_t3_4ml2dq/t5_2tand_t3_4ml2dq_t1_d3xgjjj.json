And some are right for you only at a certain time.\n\n I've been to four or five  different therapists over the years -  at some point when I feel like I've gotten everything I can out of their particular specialty,  I go to a new one with a different focus. For instance, the first therapist I saw focused on biofeedback and panic focused CBT. This was good for me, as I was suffering from bad panic attacks at the time. She wasn't really able to help me with some old traumatic stuff though, so I moved on to someone who focused more on that.
