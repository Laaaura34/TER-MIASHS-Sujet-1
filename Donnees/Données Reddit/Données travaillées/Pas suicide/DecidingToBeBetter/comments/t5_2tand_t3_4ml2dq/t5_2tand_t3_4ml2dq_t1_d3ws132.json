You're 25 and even if you don't realize it you have complete control of your life.\n\nHenry Ford said, \"Whether you think you can or can't you're right.\" Have you tried going back to college? Have you tried to take a course? How do you know you can't do it? \n\nIn another comment you say you have several learning disabilities but unless you're mentally retarded, I doubt that from how well you write, it shouldn't be a barrier.  My friend has a brother with autism. He got his associates degree in engineering and is now studying for his bachelors at a university.  It may have taken him years to get his associates degree but he did it after being bullied so badly in community college that he dropped out and stopped studying for a year.\n\nThe point is, there is no reason why you can't be like the successful doctors or lawyers you know. No one says you're unworthy of that success except for you. You really need to find yourself in order to find out what you really want. I really recommend you read No More Mr. Nice Guy! by Robert Glover.\n\nWhether you try or not is up to you. I can't promise you that you'll succeed overnight. It's going to be the most uncomfortable and frightening experience but it keeps getting better and better.  Its up to you to decide.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/4ml2dq/is_it_okay_that_im_a_loser/d3ws132/"}
