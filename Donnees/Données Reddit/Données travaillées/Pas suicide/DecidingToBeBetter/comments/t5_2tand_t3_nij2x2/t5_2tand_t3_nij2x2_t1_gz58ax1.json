Yesterday I posted this with the thought of just leaving a reminder behind for myself that I got this, as well as maybe helping a few people who stumble across my writing. I didn't think it would blow up this much, but I'm really glad it did because reading how these methods work wonders for you guys too or that I gave some of you inspiration to start walking/meditating made my day even better! I'll definitely revisit this post from time to time to see your comments and gain strength from them when I need it, so again, thank you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nij2x2/walks_and_meditation_are_the_way_to_go/gz58ax1/"}
