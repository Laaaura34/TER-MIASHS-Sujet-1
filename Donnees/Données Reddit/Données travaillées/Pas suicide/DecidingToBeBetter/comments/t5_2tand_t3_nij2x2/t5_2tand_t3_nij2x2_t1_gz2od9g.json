And don't worry if you don't know what to do while meditating or how to do it, it was really weird for me too when I first tried it. Guided meditations work the best for me because it's way easier to follow instructions than come up with your own, imo.\n\nAlso, I just heard a great observation from Dr. K (psychiatrist Twitch streamer) yesterday: if you \"fail\" meditation, aka your thoughts drift away and you have to bring them back a lot, it means that you're training your brain even harder to focus. So basically you gain more when \"failing\" meditation. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nij2x2/walks_and_meditation_are_the_way_to_go/gz2od9g/"}
