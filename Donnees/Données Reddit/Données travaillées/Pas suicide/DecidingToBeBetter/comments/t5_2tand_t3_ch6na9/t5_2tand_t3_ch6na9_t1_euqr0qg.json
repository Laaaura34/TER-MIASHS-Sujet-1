I normally am exhausted, with these heated moments being among the only times I feel rested, which is completely the opposite.\n\nEven so, hearing about your situation definitely helps a lot. Understanding what others have gone through, especially those that are in a similar position to me, always gives me more to think about, more things to consider and try out.\n\nAnd yeah, I've now had therapy for something like 3 months. It feels slow, but at the same time it definitely helps to have someone who will hear you out and who is qualified to give you the kind of advice and whatnot that would work best for you.
