As a 51 year old who made the changes I needed to rather \"late\" I can confidently say that 35 is an ideal time to change your life in the direction you want it to go. No matter what the time is going to pass so it's all in how you spend these days, weeks, years. \n\nI say, above all, start small and be steady (my first set of goals was simple \"make my bed, meditate and stay hydrated every day no matter what. Then it was do my CBT - actually DBT -  workbook, cook a meal, take a walk. And so on. I am still adding things to do daily and I've been able to quit 2 addictions along the way as well). \n\nYour future self is already grateful.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lfd6fe/it_time_to_change/gmmvqrj/"}
