You're basically teaching yourself Mindfullness which (at least for me) is incredibly difficult. \n\nIve been working at it for a year and a half WITH a therapist and I still give in to my emotions and harmful impulses, because for some reason the gratification I get from lashing out is more rewarding than simply waiting a day or sometimes even a minute for the feeling to pass. Confronting it, dealing with it myself is somehow more of a chore than all the harmful habits Ive formed over the year.\n\nSeriously, hats off to you, I hope you stay healthy and sane.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g60gtb/i_started_studying_psychology_in_my_free_time_to/fob8kti/"}
