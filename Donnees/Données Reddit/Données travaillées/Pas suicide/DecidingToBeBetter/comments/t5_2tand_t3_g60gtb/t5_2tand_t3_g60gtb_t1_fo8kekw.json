I have had severe depression and basically did the same. Psychology really became a huge interest. But what actually helped me get out of it weren't the usual things people say (like exercising) but it was actually finding something every day that make me laugh, create things and connecting with people. And also writing all my thoughts down immediately sometimes felt just as good as talking to a psychologist. But the process of healing takes a long time. It has been more than 7 years but I finally feel completely myself again. I didn't even realise I wasn't completely healed yet. My depression took 2,5 years and I have vowed to try to keep my mental health as healthy as possible. I hope one day you can feel this too and I'm sure you will. It sometimes may seem like you don't make any progress. That you didn't do anything because you layed on your bed all day, but that is just how it looks and feels. From the inside you have been fighting for a long time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g60gtb/i_started_studying_psychology_in_my_free_time_to/fo8kekw/"}
