I've been in and out of doctors offices for as long back as I can recall and, \\*none\\* of them were able to do shit for me. Sure, they prescribed me medication to try and deal with my disorder but, without making that emotional/psychological connection with your patient, how is s/he able to know what you need--hence  the specific type of drugs in your case.\n\nEnter years-and-years of passing through that revolving door for half of my life, to the extent that I'd become sick of it all and had written them off as money-grubbing-quacks who really had no (or very little) interest in seeing me get batter. At least not to the extent that I wanted for myself, or needed.\n\nWhich brings me to the current woman I'm seeing at the moment... a god-send for me; she actually pays \"attention\" to what I have to say, in the sense, not that the other shrinks didn't but, her way of approaching the whole doctor-patient-relationship is attuned to what I'm more comfortable with and exactly what I need--hence her having got me on the right medication, in the right dosage. All I'm saying is that if you've found a way to help yourself and better understand what it is that you might be suffering from then, that is a boon worth a thousand times over than what any/most clinicians would be able to offer you so please don't think you might be at a loss here because you're not.\n\nBest of luck for your future and hope to see you on the flip-side, when you're kicking life and dropping names.
