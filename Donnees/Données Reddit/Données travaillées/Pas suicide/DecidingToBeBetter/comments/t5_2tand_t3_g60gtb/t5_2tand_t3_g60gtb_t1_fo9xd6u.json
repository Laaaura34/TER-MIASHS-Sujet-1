I actually had a counselling session last year and found I didn't get much out of it because it turned out I'd accidentally through trial and error found coping mechanisms which were putting me on the right path. So a year later I'm so much better and I did that by accident but with a lot of hard work! \n\nI think the biggest thing here is that trying for self improvement will always pay off eventually, it's just professional help can speed it up. But clearly it's possible to learn to do it yourself, which is awesome. Really glad you've made progress too :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g60gtb/i_started_studying_psychology_in_my_free_time_to/fo9xd6u/"}
