I thought it was because of the huge shift in culture, food, and homesickness. But i just couldnt fit in no matter what i tried. Two years passed by, like a blink of an eye. Then i came across this article that talked about different defense mechanisms humans adopt to adapt themselves into difficult situations. I found out that i am the dissociation type. I dissociated myself from the misery that is college life and indulged myself into the internet. There came a point when i popped open a funny video and  it would take away my pain. I became shy and talking to another person became a huge ordeal for me. It still is. My brain was conditioned into this mess, so i am not going to blame it for this inability. Science backed up my flaw so it gives me hope that if i applied science and a little hard work on myself i can be the person i want to be.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g60gtb/i_started_studying_psychology_in_my_free_time_to/fo7rpld/"}
