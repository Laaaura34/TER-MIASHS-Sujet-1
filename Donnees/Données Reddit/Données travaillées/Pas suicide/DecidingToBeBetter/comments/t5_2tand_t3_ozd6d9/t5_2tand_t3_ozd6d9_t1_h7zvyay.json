Even the bar right now is kicking my ass with high reps. It\u2019s humbling for sure just some background I played high school and D1 football so that muscle memory is there but my overall strength and mobility is lacking due to the long layoff from doing Olympic lift. I\u2019m glad I have that background in lifting and athletics but it could be discouraging to know where I was at 3-4 years ago to what I\u2019m lifting now but I try to not let it bring me down. \n\nNext step is for sure finding a meal plan that works for me and recording myself to critique my form.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ozd6d9/back_to_the_gym_again_lol/h7zvyay/"}
