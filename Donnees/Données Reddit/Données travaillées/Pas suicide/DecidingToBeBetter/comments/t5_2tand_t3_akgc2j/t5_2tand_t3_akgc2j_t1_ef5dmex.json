I watched a lot of TV and felt sorry for myself.  \n\n\nBut I did do some positive things:  \n\n\n* helped my mom with repairs on her house\n* dealt with her tenants (the house was rented for a time when she was away)\n* worked on technical skills so I could find better work\n* took some classes\n* took a comedy improv class which was always a goal of mine. through this class I joined an improv troupe and met some of the best friends I've ever had.  They also helped me find work  \n\n\nSo it might help if you could 1) work as much as possible 2) learn new things 3) do things you enjoy with other people 4) GET OUT OF THAT HOUSE!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/akgc2j/34m_i_have_no_idea_what_i_should_be_doing_with_my/ef5dmex/"}
