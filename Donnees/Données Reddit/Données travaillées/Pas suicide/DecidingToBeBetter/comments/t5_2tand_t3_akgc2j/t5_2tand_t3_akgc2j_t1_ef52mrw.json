Nobody can tell you what before they know the why. You have some purpose - a passion, a skill, a service to share with the world. Life knocked you down, and so far your WHY isn\u2019t great enough to overcome that punch. I can\u2019t tell you what it is, but I can say that if you look where you are most afraid to fail, that\u2019s a good place to start. Some lofty goal or dream that you wanted to achieve and now you feel deflated and afraid to fail again. \n\nEric Thomas summed it up nicely [in this clip](https://youtu.be/UNQhuFL6CWg) , \u201cIf you don\u2019t know what your why is, and your why isn\u2019t strong, you\u2019re going to get knocked out every single time.\u201d\n\nFor AtticSquirrels, it was pride and spite. Then the what came naturally.
