I own a spa and I've put most of my beliefs into action about the industry.. giving my employees an environment that I didn't have as a massage therapist when I first started and I've made sure to be the best boss I can and business owner. At the end of the day this stuff is easy. I enjoy it and it's really my family now. Maybe another location or two.. I'm traveling .. sure. \n\nWhat is hard is that I'm almost 40 and a single lady. I don't really feel like I'm in the best spot for a partner because I don't want kids and I do want to travel. All the sudden selfish.. and also mourning an earlier version of myself before an abusive relationship. \n\nWhen I read your question I was thinking that the WHY was stay alive just long enough to make it to tomorrow, because maybe tomorrow there is a real WHY. There is already action. so much action.. literally endless action. (I spent hours on a yoga mat today.) \n\nBut what makes it worth it? It can't be another person, that can't be the answer.
