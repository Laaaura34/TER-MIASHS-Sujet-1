My therapist is helping me remember who I am after all this time and I'm beginning to see that there may be a future for me even though I'm nowhere near past any of this. I had to resort to a second antidepressant to help (and it also helps with sleep, which is very important for managing stress hormones). \n\nThankfully I have kids and I haven't stopped working out. Both of those things help. Maybe go and do some things you've always wanted to? Martial arts, hiking, stamp collecting, role playing or growing pot.
