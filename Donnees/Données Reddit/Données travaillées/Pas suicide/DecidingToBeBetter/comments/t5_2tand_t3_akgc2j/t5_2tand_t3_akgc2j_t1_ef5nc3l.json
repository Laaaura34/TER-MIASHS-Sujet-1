It\u2019s still quite fresh for me but I have been trying to work out how to push on when everything is stacked against me, and you know what? Spite and pride sound like some good fucking motivators. \n\nI wasn\u2019t able to stay in great shape during the relationship as I worked a lot, parented a lot, and was constantly trying to keep my narc ex happy. She took and took and took and still wasn\u2019t happy. But now I\u2019m going to get ripped, tattoo arms and chest, and I know she\u2019ll say \u201ctypical you get fit now\u201d and I\u2019ll do it just to fucking spite her, if for nothing else. \n\nSo, thank you. I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through that but it sounds like you\u2019ve made it through. You give the rest of us hope.
