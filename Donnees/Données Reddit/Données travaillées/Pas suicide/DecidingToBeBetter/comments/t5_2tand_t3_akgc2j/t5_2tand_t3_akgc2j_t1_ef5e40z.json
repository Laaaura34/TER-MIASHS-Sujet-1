There is a mess to be sorted in a PART of your desk? Devote 1 day to do that. Next day: sort the rest of your desk. Next day, make sure by 9 am your bed is neatly made and that your desk is acceptable, next day: do the dishes, keep your desk acceptable and by 9am your bed is neat. Next day, add sorting part of your wardrobe, next day, add rest of it... Slowly take steps you know are manageable but a bit of effort is needed too. Carry on, start cutting sugar out of your diet one day, some other day add 30 min of walking, keep adding, and remember the big picture, if you have not so great days make an effort so that overall the gain is mostly positive, and take your time, but do consider and make an effort, even if small. Don't expect to have everything sorted by day 1 or week 1 or even month one... Just move forwards, even if slowly at the beginning, but do challenge yourself. Good luck to you and to us all.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/akgc2j/34m_i_have_no_idea_what_i_should_be_doing_with_my/ef5e40z/"}
