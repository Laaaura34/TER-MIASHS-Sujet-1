A look at the basics might help the details sort themselves out.  Good luck.\n\nEdit: I should be more explicit and personal here.  I\u2019m a 50yo married father of 2 girls in college.  I\u2019ve suffered through anxiety and depression and job stresses and a solid, but not always love-filled, marriage.  I didn\u2019t believe in God in college.\n\nMy physician, when I complained \u201cwhat\u2019s it all about?\u201d one day challenged me to understand my place in the universe.  \u201cBSF\u201d is not a holy-roller pastor asking for money.  It\u2019s not judgmental Christians.  It\u2019s not fear-mongering in the name of Jesus.  It IS a simple back-to-basics Bible study.  I\u2019ve learned the Bible is a book about mankind\u2019s desire to get back into right relationship with God.\n\nI continue to struggle with my place in the world, and continue to be disappointed in my life that isn\u2019t as holy as I\u2019d wish is would be.  But BSF just keeps gently reminding me how it should be, and influences my actions in a positive way.  If you are feeling lost, it is an excellent roadmap.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/akgc2j/34m_i_have_no_idea_what_i_should_be_doing_with_my/ef4qwtd/"}
