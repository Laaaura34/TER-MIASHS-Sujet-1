Man, I love you. \n\nI\u2019m such a victim of a fragile masculinity that it\u2019s weird to say it but us men have to support each other and be open. I grew up with a dad that called me a pussy if I showed an ounce of emotion and that shit is hard to overcome. We have to be able to support and love each other if we are ever going to make this a better place. \n\nWomen are great at celebrating each other, which is wonderful. We just have such a hard time with it. Honest to God, I am pulling for you bro. I hope that BlueSparrow00 is a fucking world eater in the future.
