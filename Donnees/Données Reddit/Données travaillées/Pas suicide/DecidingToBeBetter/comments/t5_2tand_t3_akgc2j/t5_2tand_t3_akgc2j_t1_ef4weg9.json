Heartbroken, alone, alcoholic. All I really had was the weekends with my kids. I got fired from my job and lost a bunch of friends. I wish I could give you an exact recipe to turn your life around but to be honest I stayed like this for 2 years. \nEventually though I had healed enough to see that I needed change in my life. First thing I did was begin seeing a therapist. Working with him, he gave me some methods (cognitive behavioural therapy) to move past the breakup that I was still hung up on. I also decided to challenge myself to a 12 month break from alcohol. I\u2019m now at 9 months! Around the same time I started at a powerlifting gym and have been learning to lift and building muscle, this is a great way to achieve some goals and make you start being happier with your body. Also really helps give you confidence with the opposite sex. \nAround 6 months ago I still wasn\u2019t feeling like I was progressing enough and decided to ask my doctor for a prescription for an SSRI, she recommended Lexapro. Others may not agree or recommend medication, however this absolutely worked wonders for me. Within a week I was no longer ruminating on the past or feeling anxiety for no reason.  \nSo now although life is far from perfect, I feel like I have a strong grip on life. I\u2019m fixing my finances, I\u2019m healthy and I\u2019m having fun dating. I hope this helps you man, maybe it won\u2019t but this stuff is what has improved my life a great deal.
