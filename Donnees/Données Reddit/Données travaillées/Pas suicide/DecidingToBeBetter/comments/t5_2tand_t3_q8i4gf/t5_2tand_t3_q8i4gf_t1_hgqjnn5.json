It was nice, Had plenty of boys to get into the shit with. But As i got older i realized that Being in a group of people is stressful! and id rather be in an individualized freindships.\n\nRegarless of what age, There is drama, There are going to be issues.\n\nthe thing is, If there is a fight or altercation going on, Being the nuetral one inst always best, People will ask you to take to their side of things, Then its all on you to make that decision on how to proceed.  Wont always be easy, But realize where you stand and be firm.\n\nPick and choose your battles wisely\n\nIn my opinion, Its not worth it to have a group, If you are in a group, Just try to stay to yourself. Obviously be concerened with whats going on within the group.  But recognize what you want to put up with/and what you dont.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8i4gf/anyone_else_not_have_a_group_of_friends_but_just/hgqjnn5/"}
