It's kind and helpful and I appreciate it but I don't think it gets at the heart of the problem. These things don't matter if you can't get out of bed for commitments you've made, or haven't showered in days, or have no friends nearby. I know you mean well and want people to share in how you're feeling, and it's a very kind thing to do, but sometimes these lists can come across as patronizing/naive if they aren't grounded in reality.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ax6shz/depression_a_list_of_things_that_may_help/ehs5i77/"}
