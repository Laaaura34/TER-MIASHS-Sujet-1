My husband battles depression and these types of things do help a lot when he can keep up with them. Especially exercise and eating right. And the podcasts! He\u2019s gotten into Jocko and David Goggins (both military motivational dudes) which helps on a down day. He describes bad days/periods kind of like a flu - you know it\u2019s going to pass eventually but it doesn\u2019t make it any less painful in the moment. I don\u2019t think anything will ever \u201cbeat\u201d it permanently but these are certainly good coping mechanisms and tools to have in your pocket to protect yourself and help you through the bad times. I would also suggest opening up to a loved one - I might not ever 100 percent understand his pain, but because he\u2019s honest about it I can recognize it before it gets bad and help empathize and support him as best I can. Especially as a wife - a depressed person might not be able to handle something as seemingly trivial as giving them shit for not refilling the paper towels the same way a non-depressed person can. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve been able to fight the good fight - thanks for your kindness in sharing with others!
