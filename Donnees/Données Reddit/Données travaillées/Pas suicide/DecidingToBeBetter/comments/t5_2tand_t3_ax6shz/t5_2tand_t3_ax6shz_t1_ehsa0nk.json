The purpose of most anti depressent medication is to get over the initial inability to put any of these tips into action. \n\nI still think this is a helpful post. Depression is very hard to treat. Medication is only the first step, designed to allow you to implement the sort of life changes that can contribute to a sustainable recovery and prevent relapse.  Unfortunately we don't yet have a complete medical treatment for depression. The current state of the art treatment plans rely heavily on these sorts of lifestyle interventions. I think any psychiatrist would agree that these tips are helpful. \n\nOf course, people should be encouraged to go to a doctor and be reminded that if they are trying to implement these tips and are struggling to do so, it is not their fault or a shortcoming. They may just need some medical intervention to help. \n\nThe overall argument that you are making, to me, sounds like telling someone that a diabetic needs to go to a doctor (which of course is true) but therefore no one should talk about the diet changes and excercise that are also needed to successfully manage this disease. \n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ax6shz/depression_a_list_of_things_that_may_help/ehsa0nk/"}
