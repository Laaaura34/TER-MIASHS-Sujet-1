I'm not much to hear. lol It's something that I find very enjoyable. Music is an integral part of my life, and being able to create it is something that is special to me. \n\nMaybe one day I'll get up the nerve to broadcast some of my playing on RPAN. LOL I've seen a handful of musicians on RPAN that I thought were talented. Very enjoyable. What would really be cool is getting a bunch of musicians together virtually and just have a drop in and jam session. Play when you feel froggy! All the missed chords, screw ups, good stuff and all rolled into one feed. That kind of stuff I dig doing with other musicians.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/immiws/4_months_sober_today/g45jki8/"}
