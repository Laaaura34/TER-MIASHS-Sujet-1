I LOVE my sweets: soda, cookies, cakes, ice cream, candy. It was painfully obvious that I had to control my intake of them. I tried various diet fads. I tried things like \"no more soda...ever\". Yeah, ... that doesn't work. Then I figured out that I would limit myself. I allowed myself one day on weekends to have as much as I wanted. That worked, and it is still working. Yes, by Thursday or Friday the little cravings come around, but I know I can wait the day or two.\n\nPerhaps a technique like that could work. I firmly believe that no smoking is the best option, but if limiting yourself perhaps to one day in the week, one day on the weekend, then that would significantly reduce the harm of smoking 7-days per week. I'm sure this process can work for other things.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7uxgmg/want_to_become_more_disciplined_as_i_have_a_very/dto7gms/"}
