I actually have been pretty good about keeping busy lately. I'm learning Italian and have written a few songs, whereas before I wouldn't have even had time because I was busy doing bad habits. You never realize how much time couple cigarettes takes up order to pack a bowl and smoke and then get lost in a TV show and then realize wow it's been 2 hours  lol. I can get into such a good routine and be doing so well and then one little thing happens and I slip up and go right back to where I was. I just feel like there's no in-between. Going to try harder to take this advice to heart and just stick with it. Thanks again!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7uxgmg/want_to_become_more_disciplined_as_i_have_a_very/dtodi6w/"}
