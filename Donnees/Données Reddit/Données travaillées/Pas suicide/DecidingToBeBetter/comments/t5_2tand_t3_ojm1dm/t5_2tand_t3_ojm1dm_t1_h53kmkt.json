I just lost a lot of weight. I changed by diet (I went vegan but I know a lot of people do not want to do that) but another thing I did was have reminders to myself how I felt when I was heavier. I would have post it notes left for me. When I began to work out I had post it notes on my coffee table that reminded me how good I feel after I get a work out in. Also, you might have days you eat a little too much. That is common and we all do it. I used to fail diets after one night of eating poorly, but I just reminded myself that it was just one night and stopped punishing myself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ojm1dm/after_my_experience_at_an_amusement_park_i_am/h53kmkt/"}
