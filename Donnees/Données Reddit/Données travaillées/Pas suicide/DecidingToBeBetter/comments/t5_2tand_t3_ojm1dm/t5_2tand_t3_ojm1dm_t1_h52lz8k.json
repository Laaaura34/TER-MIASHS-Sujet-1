It sounds counterintuitive; \"gain muscle to lose weight, what?\" Not just exercising though, I mean weight lifting. It's half the battle, really. I know it can feel like a tall order. People tend to assume that its only for bodybuilders. But not only does lifting weights burn additional calories during the session, but it boosts your metabolism for hours following the session, as well as increase your BMR as muscle mass increases. There are many other benefits, but I found that it is the glue that holds the rest of my program together. Helps with depression, etc. Best of luck. It takes a couple weeks to build the momentum. But that momentum is like nothing else. It's an hour of my day where I'm alone, focused on bettering myself and nothing more.
