Start by taking a 30 minute walk everyday until you feel your energy and confidence are up to start lifting weights. \n\nOnce you start lifting weights, you'll start LOSING weight even faster (your body uses more caloric resources for recovery post muscle training).\n\nIf you're starting from 0 exercise, you'll likely be surprised how quickly you can actually lose just by getting cardio exercise and tracking your calories. \n\nGet a calorie counter app too they REALLY help. Some you can even scan the barcode on the back of boxes of food you get and automatically tracks it. \n\nGood luck! In just a couple weeks you'll feel happier and have more energy, in 2 months you'll notice a visible difference, and in 2 years you'll look like a different person.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ojm1dm/after_my_experience_at_an_amusement_park_i_am/h54c556/"}
