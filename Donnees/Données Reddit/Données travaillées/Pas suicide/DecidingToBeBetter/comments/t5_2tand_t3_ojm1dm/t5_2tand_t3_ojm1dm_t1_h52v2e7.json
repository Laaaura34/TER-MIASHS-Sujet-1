I am instead working on walking around them while my family enjoys and they take extra care to make sure we do non-ride attractions.  Luckily for me in my area we have many options, especially for hiking.\n\nIf you wanted advice, I would say that eating, sleeping and being on your feet are something we generally do everyday.  Make sure you always can eat, sleep and get around on your own power the best and most comfortable way possible.  Get some good Asics, ebay's USA store always has closeout sales.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ojm1dm/after_my_experience_at_an_amusement_park_i_am/h52v2e7/"}
