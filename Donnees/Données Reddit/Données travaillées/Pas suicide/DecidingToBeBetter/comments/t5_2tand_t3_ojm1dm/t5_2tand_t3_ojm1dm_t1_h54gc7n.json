What is a lower calorie/more natural version of what i would normal eat. Replace ice cream with frozen bananas and cocoa powder.\" Replace sweets with fruits, replace crunchy things with veggies.   \nAnother idea is to eat more, not less (within reason ofc. Don't go wild). Eat more veggies By adding more vegetables the foods that normally filled you up, you have less room for.   \nIf it is a day where you are allowed your ice cream or snack. Eat you meal first. The sweet or snack goes last. Eat the good stuff first before eating the bad stuff.   \n\n\nNo, you don't have to finish whatever you are eating. Maybe there is only one or two chips left and you're full. You might have the urge to just eat those last two chips and finish it now, but you could save it for later and later you will be happy to have a few unexpected chips. :3 (just be sure to put your name on it so it isn't a sad surprise to other family members. etc, etc", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ojm1dm/after_my_experience_at_an_amusement_park_i_am/h54gc7n/"}
