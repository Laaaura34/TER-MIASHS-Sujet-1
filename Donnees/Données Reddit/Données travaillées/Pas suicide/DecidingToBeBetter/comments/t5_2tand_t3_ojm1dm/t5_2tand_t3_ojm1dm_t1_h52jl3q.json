If you try to overhaul everything in one day the chances of a hard bounce back are a lot higher. You can def do this but be realistic about it and you\u2019ll really see results!!\n \nTry choosing one habit you want to change and track it for a week. \n\nLike actually keep a log: \n-when do you want to eat/do X?\n\n-where are you when the urge hits? \n\n-what was happening right before the urge hit?\n\n-how did you feel when the urge hit?\n\nThen identify the reward you get from the habit- like take the ice cream. What is the actual reward? Is it that the sugar gives you a burst of energy? Are you bored or down and the sugar makes you feel better temporarily?\n\nA brisk walk around your neighborhood would satisfy all those rewards and also be adding exercise to your day. You could even start a good book on tape and only listen to it when you\u2019re on your walk as an incentive. \n\nIt\u2019s the idea of [keystone ](https://www.wanderlustworker.com/keystone-habits.pdf) habits- changing one small thing and feeling success leads to more conscious decision making across your life and those behavior changes stick long term. Keystone habits can make universal change without you having to battle each individual thing you want to happen.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ojm1dm/after_my_experience_at_an_amusement_park_i_am/h52jl3q/"}
