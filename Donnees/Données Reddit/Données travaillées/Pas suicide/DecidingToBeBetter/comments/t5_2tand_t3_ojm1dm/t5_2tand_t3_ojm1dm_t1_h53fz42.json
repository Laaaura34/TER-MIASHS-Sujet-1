Once you are then design the plan climb out and sounds like you are. Losing a lot of weight is NOT like those silly shows like The Biggest Loser where they are losing entirely too much weight too fast at way higher of a target heart rate than safe. You should be at a training target heart rate as long as cleared by the MD with no other medical issues. Then you build to a program of 45 -60 minutes of it an hour. By target heart rate I mean pulse rate. You exercise at that pulse rate. Here is the formula to find that called the Karvonen formula: 1) first find maximum heart rate 220-age. For me 220-53= 167 beat per minute (pulse rate). Then find your pulse at your wrist. For me it's 70 beats a minute. I take my Max HR and resting HR (heart rate) plug into this equation for this equation for 60% target heart rate which is a good median.\n\n.6(max HR-resting HR) + (resting HR)  \n.6 (167-70) +97= 128 beats a minute  \n128 on your pulse rate is your training rate. You exercise for 10 minutes and check and see where you are at. If you are lower then pick up the pace and if you are higher you can slow it down a little. But you stay there and build to 45 minutes a day. Do that and watch the diet as you said and set up a diet (like richard simmons deal a meal is good) that is healthy and you will lose 1-2 pounds a week ----and two years later you are a whole new you. And enjoy the process. Hope that helps----Charles", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ojm1dm/after_my_experience_at_an_amusement_park_i_am/h53fz42/"}
