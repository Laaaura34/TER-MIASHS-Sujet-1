Be proud of yourself for making the commitment!  \n\nOne thing that makes a big difference for me, in terms of calories is what I close to drink.  I, unfortunately, love sugared soda and dark beer.  Juice is another favorite.  \n\nI do my best when I force myself to drink a glass of water in between.  If you also struggle with beverages and don't want to give them up, this may help you too.  \n\nI get bored with water, so I trade up with flavored waters and lemon or lime water.  \n\nWishing you the best of luck on your journey!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ojm1dm/after_my_experience_at_an_amusement_park_i_am/h53jubp/"}
