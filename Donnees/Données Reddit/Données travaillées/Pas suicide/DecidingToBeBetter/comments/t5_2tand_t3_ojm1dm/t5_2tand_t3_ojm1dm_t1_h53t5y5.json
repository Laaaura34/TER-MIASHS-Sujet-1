You can literally just replace that with a Popsicle (45 calories) or Fudgesicle (80 calories) and lose about a pound a week (3500 calorie deficit a week)\n\nAlso, you've been buying food for a reason, figure out that reason and work around it. \n\nFor example, I eat shitty breakfast unless I pre-chop veggies to put in my omelette. I just, won't do it in the morning. So that little effort makes breakfast healthier. \n\nMaybe you don't know how to cook what you like, in which case look up videos. Also don't feel bad about not making literally everything from scratch, often the in-between stuff is far healthier then ordering it or a frozen meal.\n\nYou can do this, start by meal planning and make good food accessible.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ojm1dm/after_my_experience_at_an_amusement_park_i_am/h53t5y5/"}
