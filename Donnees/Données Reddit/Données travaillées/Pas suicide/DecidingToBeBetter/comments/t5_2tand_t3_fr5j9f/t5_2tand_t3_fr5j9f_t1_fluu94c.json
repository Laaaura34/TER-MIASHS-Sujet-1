There are a lot of different concepts like the pain of staying the same is so great that you've had enough to change it. \n\nBut I prefer associating the deepest paid with my \"old ways\" and the greatest pleasure in my \"new ways\" and becoming the best version of myself. Therefore, change is not painful or hard but fulfilling and pleasurable for the 'Longterm Implicit Pleasure'. This makes it much easier not to go back to the old ways because the brain wants to avoid this pain.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fr5j9f/change_is_hard_but_pain_is_harder/fluu94c/"}
