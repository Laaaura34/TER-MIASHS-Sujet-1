I know that feeling. I have all of it or some of it from time to time.\n\nHaving abused alcohol and weed but feeling shitty in the long run, getting jealous of my own friends because they have girlfriends, and seeing myself as a loser because I see that I have \"awesomeness\" in me but am not utilizing it; all of that culminated and is forcing me to change because I dont wanna live like that anymore.\n\nI'm not sure if this relates to the type of change you are contemplating that could happen or not, but I was a shy inward goofy person back in school, making me a daily target for bullies. Instead of going through with killing myself, I decided to fight back the next day, and i significantly started changing.\n\nI believe change is possible but only if you believe in its possibility and believe in yourself. If you dont believe you can eat an apple, you wont be able to eat an apple no matter how menial/mundane that task is.\n\nI don't like telling someone \"believe in yourself\" or \"relax\" or otherwise, because that comes from within. I think you should think about all the achievements and \"awesome\" things you accomplished in your life. That will grow your belief and confidence in yourself.\n\nI wish you the best", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fr5j9f/change_is_hard_but_pain_is_harder/flxx7pu/"}
