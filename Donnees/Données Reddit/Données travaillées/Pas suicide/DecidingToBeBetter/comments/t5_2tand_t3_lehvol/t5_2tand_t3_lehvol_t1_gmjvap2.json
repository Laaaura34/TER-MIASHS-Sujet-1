You should take some time to play video games or sit on your phone or do something that won\u2019t make \u201cfuture you\u201d any better except maybe mentally. \nThere\u2019s a difference between cutting back and cutting out. Literally everything you listed is fine in moderation.\n\nALSO \nfucking masturbate. Like honestly nobody but you gives a shit and you shouldn\u2019t even give a shit. \nI have never once met a dude who didn\u2019t have some problem with their dick because they used it too much or too little but like, it doesn\u2019t matter as long as you\u2019re comfortable.\nAnd other than time, there\u2019s no proven issues with masturbation. If anything, it makes it easier to tell your partner what you enjoy in the future.
