You have to go out of your way to make the effort, but not too much or you look like a stalker. Also, I felt like I had to learn how to have a conversation with people again. Not small talk, but actual conversation. As part of getting comfortable with myself again, I starting trying something new every month. To reconnect with old friends, I invited them for bar bingo at a new place, laser tag, and a paint and sip \u2014 I hated this idea but knew my friends would go. I\u2019ve had the most luck meeting new people by group fitness stuff like joining a kickball team, Hash House Harriers, and climbing. I check events in my town and invite people to go. This winter we had a cocoa crawl downtown so I invited some work people and told them to bring people. I always say yes to any group activity I\u2019m invited, even Pampered Chef parties and my coworkers\u2019 kids\u2019 little league games.\nGood luck! You\u2019ll get through it. You might have to get out of your comfort zone, but it\u2019s worth it. I\u2019m not athletic at all. My neighbor\u2019s 7 year old saw me practicing for the kickball team and told me to give it up. I had a blast hanging out with the team and was invited back for the next season. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/azd84u/its_a_lonely_road/ei7te50/"}
