Try getting a massage every couple months! But if it\u2019s an emotional issue, try finding real friends that you can be vulnerable with. I\u2019ve found being vulnerable to people, especially when it\u2019s reciprocated, forms the best bonds. Find someone with the same mindset as you, and try to find time every week or two to go have coffee or watch a movie. Focus on your goals, and things that excite you. You\u2019ll get through this, you\u2019re on the right path!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/azd84u/its_a_lonely_road/ei83ysl/"}
