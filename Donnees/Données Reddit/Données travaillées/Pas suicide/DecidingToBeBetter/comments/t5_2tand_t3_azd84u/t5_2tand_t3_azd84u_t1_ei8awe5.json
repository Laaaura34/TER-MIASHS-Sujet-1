I'm going through something similar to you. I had to cut out toxic influences in my life, which turned out to be pretty much everyone. I don't have any friends I talk to on the regular, just my parents and my brother. It is lonely sometimes, but I try not to let it get me down. I've kind of embraced the loneliness, if that makes sense, and it doesnt even feel like a negative thing to me any more. Like I really have all the time I need to work on me and be selfish and not have to worry about anyone elses needs. I know some people crave companionship more than others, and I really always thought I was one of those people because I've always surrounded myself with people and hated being by myself but since my Big Change it hasn't been that way for me at all. \n\nI hope you're able to find some sort of solution,  even if this doesnt help! Best of luck to you! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/azd84u/its_a_lonely_road/ei8awe5/"}
