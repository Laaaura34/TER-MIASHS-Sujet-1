You seem highly capable and in control of a lot of things in your life. I am much younger then you (21) and I have already felt this same thing that you speak about, I have sort of found something that helps me out. I know what im about to say will instantly turn a LOT of people off, I wish not to sound like a preacher either. I don't consider myself a part of any religion, I grew up atheist in an atheistic family but lately I've found that if I just sit down and pray that It has this really weird effect where I no longer feel lonely. We are all a part of a huge society and we are all one, hippy nonsense yeah yeah but there's some very strong benefits to praying and putting that energy out there. It may be worth a try.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/azd84u/its_a_lonely_road/ei7kpge/"}
