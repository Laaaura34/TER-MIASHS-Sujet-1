I relate to this post sooo much. I love my friends dearly but they are either married or have kids and it's hard to get them alone or to even hangout without it being us watching their kids at their place. I have no idea what I want to do with my life and it's hard for me to get close to people even if I really want to. I'm starting therapy now because my depression and loneliness really interferes with my life and I know I can't find the right person in the current state I'm in. But it's hard being so lonely, I know I have to do the work but I wish I could find someone patient and kind enough to help me through it. When I was younger I didn't feel so much pressure cuz more ppl were single and able to hang out.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/azd84u/its_a_lonely_road/ei7acjn/"}
