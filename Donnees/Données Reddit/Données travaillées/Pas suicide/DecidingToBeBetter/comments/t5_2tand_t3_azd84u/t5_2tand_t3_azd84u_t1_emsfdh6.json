I had to really discipline myself NOT to share my plans, because it always gave me too much satisfaction, and I wouldn\u2019t feel that need to actually follow through. The \u201cwow that\u2019s great, good for you!\u201d was enough for me and then I just never finished those plans. \n\nNow, I just try to keep it to myself. I have one designated person that I tell my plans to, and they don\u2019t congratulate me until I\u2019ve seen those plans through. Maybe that might work for you, too?\n\nBest of luck!
