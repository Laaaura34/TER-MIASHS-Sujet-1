The secret is \"want to be alone\". Learn to love yourself, like you want other people to love you. \nMy issue was I didn't take the necessary time (which was surprisingly little) to get to know myself and therefore by default proxy HATED being alone with myself. \nNow I prefer it. I'm getting to know myself on a deeper level and learning how to be more honest with myself and handle my own shortcomings instead of relying on others for help. It's incredibly liberating. Better yet, it's showing up what relationships I do have. \nEven then, I put myself first. I say things bluntly from a place of honesty that I wouldn't of said before because I worried about whether they would like me or not. Now I don't give a fuck, because at the end of the day I have me, and I love me now. What's weird is people respect that and they like me even more. It doesn't come off a rude and/or brash as I thought they'd take it and so I'm finding myself surrounded with genuine relationships. \n\nI'm alone, but I'm not lonely.\nI don't know if this applies to your or is any help, but this is what I did and it's changed my life. 3 months ago I was a completely different person, and I'll never go back to that. \n\nDate yourself. Show yourself a good time. Lol\nIt's addicting!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/azd84u/its_a_lonely_road/ei95dff/"}
