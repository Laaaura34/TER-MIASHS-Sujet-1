Enjoy the present moment and all the little changes you are doing with your life, you might find comfort in your own little loneliness. Everything is moving nothing never is stationary, it's just about time that someone will come and find you as the incredible person you are. \n\nJust don't restrain yourself from that by seeking it, enjoy your own being and be content. If you ever feel lonely ask for some friends to go out and have a drink or engage in some social activity. If you want to be calm you can try meditation or just being mindful most of the time. Honestly this is something that must come from oneself, changes always happen, learn to see how your emotions affect you in this case, loneliness and maybe discomfort. Hope this helped, I tried to approach different ways on how to tackle this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/azd84u/its_a_lonely_road/ei722x0/"}
