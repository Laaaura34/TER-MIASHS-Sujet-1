You grew up in a really toxic environment, and adults were not there protect you.\n\nFurthermore, they had hurt you. Your avoidance is completely normal, of course. Your brain has been wired not to trust people according to your experiences.\n\nNow as an adult, your reason say :\" look people are not that hurtful like what you think.\". But your body say \" I'm really super sensitive to danger. Everytime I see a little danger, I think this really dangerous, I prefer to run, because I have Suffered too much\". \n\n[\u00e9dit] when we are under a danger, we have three options : 1) run, 2) fight or 3) Immobility \n\nYour way to defend yourself is to run. \nFor me, you have to learn how to protect your body, your soul and your heart.\n\nHow?\n\nGo to boxing or any martial art. Learn how to fight, how to protect yourself physically. Your body will learn that you can manage danger.\n\nThen you need to learn how to protect mentally and socially. This is a more complex task. But I think, when you will know how to protect yourself physically, you won't get afraid to protect yourself with words.\n\n[edit:] In last words, learn how to feel secure with people emotionnaly, not with your reason. Therapy can help you to find the action you need.\nFor example, I have done some contact dancing or Impro dance. I have learnt how to feel comfortable with people. Especially with sensitive people. I have built some confidence.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k1yfa5/i_want_to_hear_a_criticism_that_doesnt_apply_to/gdr5r0z/"}
