I was academically gifted and grew up athletic, same deal.  Parents always encouraged what i was great at, and let me give up on things i wasn't good at, because they didn't want to force me to do something.  Good intentions, but it allowed my silly kid brain to think that i was just SUPPOSED to be good at stuff, and if i wasn't, well, it wasn't for me.\n\nStick with something youwant to learn and  are bad at, until you notice improvement.  (not just until...keep doing it even after!) There are a million ways to mentally prepare for it/get to that point, but you just have to do it.  Work on it, get mad about it, threaten to destroy it, and improve it until you can tell you are better at it than you were before.
