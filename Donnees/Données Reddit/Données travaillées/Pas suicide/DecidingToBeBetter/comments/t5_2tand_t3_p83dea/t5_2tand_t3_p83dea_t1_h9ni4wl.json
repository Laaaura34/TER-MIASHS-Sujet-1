In my experience, it's best to just force yourself to do it. Then when you've finished trying, reflect on how nothing bad happened and nobody judged you.\n\nIf it makes you feel any better, most people don't immediately giggle at someone who is trying something for the first time. The classic example is a fat person who is jogging for the first time. I used to be really self conscious about working out when I was bigger until I noticed my own reaction to that sight was to silently encourage those people. Eventually I ripped the band-aid off and tried it myself and I'm so glad I did.\n\nHope this helped somehow, and good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p83dea/how_to_not_be_afraid_of_being_seen_trying/h9ni4wl/"}
