I have been lucky to have a lot of success so far in my career, but I also know that it's not just luck. I have failed more endeavors than my unsuccessful friends have even attempted. I put myself in situations that intimidate/scare me professionally (projects I'm unsure of, reaching out to people whose reactions I can't anticipate, applying for dream opportunities that I'm mostly qualified for, etc.) probably weekly because, as cliche as it's become, you really do miss 100% of the shots that you don't take. I've gotten more comfortable with fear (still hate it, but no longer afraid to face it!) and that has helped me seize cool opportunities to grow further.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p83dea/how_to_not_be_afraid_of_being_seen_trying/h9qygbe/"}
