Don't let someone drag you along because it makes you sad to accept to the truth - you need to have more respect for yourself. I know how much it hurts and how hard it is to accept but the reality of the situation is that she doesn't value you the way you value her and she doesn't respect you. She wouldn't lie to you otherwise. Nothing you can do will change that. \n\nGo to therapy and invest in yourself. You are worth more than chasing some long distance girl who betrays your trust. If you keep hoping that she'll one day fall in love with you all you will be doing is wasting the precious time of your youth. I'm just trying to save you time and more unnecessary heart ache. I've been where you are, I've been in denial and I've sacrificed my own self-respect and time chasing after people who treat me like shit. I don't know how old you are but this is a great learning experience that can change your life for the better if you embrace the truth and move forward. \n\nKeep working on and learning to love yourself and you will find a girl that isn't long distance who will treat you with respect and want to spend time with you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p7ugdb/i_think_i_just_saw_my_friendship_fall_apart/h9mi44v/"}
