I support causes with money, but I can use my time as well.\n\nAfter consideration, I am going to up my writing time to three hours and allow myself 90 minutes of video games.  If I want to play more, I have to \"earn\" more time by allowing my self more hobby time in a 2:1 ration.  An hour of a service project, or an additional hour of writing will allow myself an additional 30 minutes of hobby time.  :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oe8win/what_is_an_ideal_mix_of_time_particularly_how/h44zpw5/"}
