Often I don\u2019t even know what I want or think cause you kind of lose touch with it as a people pleaser. Its kind of scary. \n\nMaybe you could pick one person you trust most to be honest to. Do you have someone in your life that you believe would respond positively if you share something? If someone hasn\u2019t been mean to you before, responds nicely to whatever you do share, is kind to others, you could rationally think that they would be kind to you as well. And then you could try stepping over the fear and share something small that you otherwise wouldn\u2019t. I have one good friend I try to be honest to and I think it helps. Hope this helps! The book is dealing with this as well and it has a program with steps at the end to overcome this. You could give it a try.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lknyar/im_struggling_with_being_comfortable_in_my_own/gnmtkho/"}
