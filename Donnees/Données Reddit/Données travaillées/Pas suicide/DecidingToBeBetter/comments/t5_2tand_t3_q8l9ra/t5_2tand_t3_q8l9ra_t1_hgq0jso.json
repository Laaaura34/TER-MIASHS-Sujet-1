There is no point playing out a confrontation scenario in your head. Let it go and make sure if a similar situation comes up, that you let yourself step back and sort out how you feel about it. Then gather your thoughts and have a conversation with whom ever is involved. \n\nIt's not easy, I hate confrontation, and I struggle alot with fawning as a trauma response. But all my relationships have become so much better when I stopped suffering in silence. \n\nSome people though, may never change, some people will always be rubbing you the wrong way and I honestly believe it's up to you weather or not they can stick around.\n\nGood on you for admitting something was wrong and that you could have handled it better,  I'm sure this will give your courage in the future!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8l9ra/regretting_not_standing_up_to_my_former_nanny/hgq0jso/"}
