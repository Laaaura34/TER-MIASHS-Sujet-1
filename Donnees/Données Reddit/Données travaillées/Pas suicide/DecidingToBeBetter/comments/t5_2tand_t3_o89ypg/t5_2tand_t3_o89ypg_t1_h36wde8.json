But I think you haven't explored anything alone, yet. Doing those things you did with your friends, alone, makes you feel like you'll never be happy doing stuff alone.(Not true\ud83d\ude0c)\nTry things you haven't done before. New things. \nLike watch a series, movies, dance(if you're even into that\ud83d\ude05).. \nAs an introvert, these are the stuff I do. Personally, I write, dance, paint, etc(sorry I'm boring\ud83d\ude02). \nBut just in simple words, try everything.
