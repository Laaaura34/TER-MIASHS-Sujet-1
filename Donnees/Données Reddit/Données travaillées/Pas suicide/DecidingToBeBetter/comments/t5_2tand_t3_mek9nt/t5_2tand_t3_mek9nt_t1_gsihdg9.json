I am fully aware there are superstitions, and that this is just normal human behavior. Your macaroni and cheese  allegory is also spot on, but i think it goes a bit further, and it is worth the effort and try to teach people about logical fallacies, like confirmation bias, proportionality bias and so on. There are shades of Conspiracies from \"Actually happened\" to \"Fully ountlandish\". Somewhere in between the two, there are spots where the far right just catches and utilzes you. That shits dangerous, Information doesnt count anymore, its a game of prevention, not telling people they are wrong. I myself, and I did not fully addressed it in the OP, was in some really strange \"hollow earth, nazi-ufos on the moon,anti-vax, dont everfucking see the doctor because wants to kill you\" kind of shit, also cancer is harmless and what not.
