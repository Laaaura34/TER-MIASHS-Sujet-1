I'm 34, used to be super self-conscious and got over it.\n\nTwo ideas that might help\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Here's the deal - **people don't really spend much time judging you**. Get deliberate in noticing that. People mostly are worried about themselves and how *they* appear - just like you are, and if people insult or diminish you, it's usually because of their own insecurities. Once I fully accepted that my worries about being judged are way out of proportion to reality, it actually became liberating, and I was able to relax, be myself and actually pay attention to others - and people began to relax around me and like me! Basically, once you respect yourself, people will respect you.  \n \n* Continuing from that, the more you accept yourself, the more it'll make sense to just be honest with others. If you would really rather live by yourself, you don't want to stay miserable to *pretend* to be agreeable. Just be honest with your roommate. Make it clear that it's about you, not him. That will be better for both of you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kpxfzw/serious_issues_with_selfassertiveness_and_putting/gi1lhof/"}
