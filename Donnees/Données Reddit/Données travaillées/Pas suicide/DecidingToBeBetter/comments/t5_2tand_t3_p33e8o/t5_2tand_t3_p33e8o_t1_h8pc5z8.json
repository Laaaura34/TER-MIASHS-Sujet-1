I used to be in that same boat. I was always the winner in arguments and when I noticed that I realized I was the winner because I was toxic. Lots of things I did wrong and lots of things that I had to change over the years.  I was fortunate to have a partner that was very caring and willing to work with me, because of them I was able to actively improve a lot. \n\nDon\u2019t feel like you\u2019re not worth loving okay, you are. You just need to improve on some stuff, whether you\u2019re by yourself or with someone just try to always push yourself to see the points they\u2019re making and see where they are coming from. \n\nSometimes emotions can get the best of us so in those situations it\u2019s best to take a step back till we can be a little more clear headed.\n\nDon\u2019t beat yourself up for how you were be happy that you\u2019ve recognized and you\u2019ll be someone much better in due time. \n\nIf you ever need to talk feel free to message me", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p33e8o/just_realized_im_toxic_looking_to_improve/h8pc5z8/"}
