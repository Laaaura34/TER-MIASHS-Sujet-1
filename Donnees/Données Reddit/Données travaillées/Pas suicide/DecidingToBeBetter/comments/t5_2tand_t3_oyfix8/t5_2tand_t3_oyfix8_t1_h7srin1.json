I used to be like you, but eventually I asked myself if all this stuff was worth it... and it wasn't. \n\nWaking up super early is fucking hell, and unless they pay me or I got errands to run, I ain't fucking doin' it.\n\nDo you even enjoy yoga? Cause it sure as shit isn't necessary that you do yoga every day. Or at all.\n\nStudying after a day of work... could be possible, I've done it. But always because it was *strictly necessary* and the alternative was worse. \n\nI don't know if I have much advice to give. Try to focus on necessity and pleasure. That's the only thing. And don't sweat it too much. \n\nI don't know what your age is, but if you have a steady job and are studying you've got a lot going on. You should be proud, not ashamed. \n\nAlso how's Valorant?
