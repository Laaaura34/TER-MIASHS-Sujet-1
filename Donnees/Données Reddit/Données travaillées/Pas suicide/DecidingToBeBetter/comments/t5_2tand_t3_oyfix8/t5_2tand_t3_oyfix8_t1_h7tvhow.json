I ran out of time eons ago. Now I'm in post-ludium. \n\nSo I getcha. I'm still trying to figure things out myself, and I won't lie that sometimes I feel \"less than\" some random dude who's got it all sussed out, or so it seems. Maybe they're lucky. Maybe I'm an idiot. Who knows!\n\nBut I was tired of living someone else's life, by someone else's standards. So what if I don't reach tantric enlightenment? Or win the olympics? Or be more like John, or Marie, or whoever, they're so happy and healthy and who gives a shit, really.\n\nYou seem to have a good head on your shoulders. Focus on what \\*you\\* need. If it's mo' money (mo' problems!), go and change your line of work, if you are able to. Find yourself a girl, and settle down. Or don't! Sleep around! Become a nun! Go with the flow. \n\nI wish Valorant was the first FPS I played lol.
