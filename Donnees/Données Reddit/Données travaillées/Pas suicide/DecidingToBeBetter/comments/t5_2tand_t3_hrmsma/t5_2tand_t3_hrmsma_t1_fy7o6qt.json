I was so consumed by their lifestyle and started to make it mine. Deep down when they'd take me to \"spots\" or drive around to just smoke pot i knew my time was not worth it, but it was just hard to be self aware especially with a cloud of weed above me, messing up my morals. I thought i was the only one, I don't feel so alone anymore :)\n\nLike you said cutting out stoner friends was the best thing i did for myself but i sometimes feel like going back because of how lonely i am now. I'm more of an extrovert and thrive off of people beside me to keep company, always have and once i blocked out the only crowd i knew well... It's... hard. I can't wait for when i find these wholesome friends cuz it'll feel like all this is worth it in a way.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hrmsma/17f_finally_quit_smoking_and_toxic_friends/fy7o6qt/"}
