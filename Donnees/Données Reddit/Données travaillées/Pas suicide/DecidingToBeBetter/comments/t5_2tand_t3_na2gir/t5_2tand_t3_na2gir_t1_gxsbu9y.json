Also, if you aren\u2019t enjoying something that is supposed to be fun then it is definitely a waste of time. If spending time on it is making you feel bad or worthless then it is even less than a waste of time. At that point it is actively hurting you. \n\nBe aware of how you think and feel though. If you find that video games/YouTube wasn\u2019t the problem and you are still having a hard time enjoying things your problem may actually be depression.
