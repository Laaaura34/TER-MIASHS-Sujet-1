For weightlifting, I\u2019d absolutely recommend the three most basic and effective compound exercises I can think of, which are squats, deadlifts and bench press. I don\u2019t know how familiar you are with those, but technique is very important not to injure yourself when it comes to heavier weights, so I\u2019d recommend starting really light and add weight in small increments each day of lifting. You\u2019ll see results in strength increase in no time. I\u2019d probably recommend 5 sets of squat and bench press with around 8 reps per set, for deadlifts I\u2019d say 2 sets with 5 reps are good. \n\nNot much to say about cardio but to do what you enjoy! High intensity interval training (HIIT) is great if you\u2019re low on time but want to get the cardio in anyway. \n\nFeel free to do both cardio and weightlifting on the same days initially, but as weights get heavier you\u2019ll want to separate the weightlifting and cardio to separate days, otherwise you might hinder the gains in one or the other (and also, doing cardio before heavy lifting might increase the risk of injury if you\u2019re tired before lifting). \n\nIf you feel like you want to squeeze in a third day of workout a week I\u2019d recommend to go for weightlifting-cardio-weightlifting. Lifting weights improves most things that cardio do as well, and you can never go wrong with more muscle. Better strength overall makes cardio less risky in the long run as well by reducing the impact on limbs from running, for example. \n\nI could elaborate on all of this if you\u2019d want, but I just threw this together right before going to bed.
