I\u2019m 26 and suffered from GERD since 18. It was really bad to the point where I couldn\u2019t work at all due to waking up feeling nauseated all day. It got a lot better over the last 5 years though from just increasing my daily water intake to around 3L a day. However the adderall is what I\u2019m struggling with now. I don\u2019t even have ADHD I just enjoyed how it made me feel and eventually got addicted and now it\u2019s very difficult to stop. It\u2019s taken over my life and I struggle to stay healthy like I was. I also suffer from anxiety too and especially being on adderall it can increase those feelings tenfold. I\u2019m glad one of us is on the road to recovery, stick with it stranger. Hopefully I\u2019m not too far behind you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nf2v56/five_weeks_in_a_row_that_ive_gone_to_the_gym/gylz2mq/"}
