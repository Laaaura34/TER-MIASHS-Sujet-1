It might help too if you have the goal to be healthy rather than to be in good shape. Just by going your doing so much good for you body and mind. Reducing your risk of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's...the list goes on! \nHaving a goal to look a certain way can be hard to sustain because if you don't see results it feels like a failure. If you switch the goal to be consistent for health reasons just by going you're achieving it and over time physical appearance changes might happen too (diet and intensity of exercise dependant) \n\nCongrats on sticking with it \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nf2v56/five_weeks_in_a_row_that_ive_gone_to_the_gym/gyjkcdf/"}
