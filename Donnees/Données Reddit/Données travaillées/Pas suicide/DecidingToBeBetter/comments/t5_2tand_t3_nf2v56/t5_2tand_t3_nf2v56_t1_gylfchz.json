I\u2019m struggling right now myself. I used to go 4-5 days a week consistently and looked really good. Now I\u2019m fighting my addiction to adderall and COVID closed down my favorite gyms and I\u2019ve barely gone in the last year, like a few times a month if that. I\u2019m also under eating and losing all my muscle I gained over the years and becoming skinny which is really destroying my confidence as I\u2019ve got body dysmorphia. I hope I can turn it around like you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nf2v56/five_weeks_in_a_row_that_ive_gone_to_the_gym/gylfchz/"}
