I respect you for being 21 and having had jobs before, I am 21 and I am only now potentially going to get hired for my first job ever.\n\nI'm currently trying to become a graphic designer. It's honestly not something I was expecting to do in my life, but I think it's pretty damn cool and I am going to learn some more about it. The paths I've taken in life weren't exactly what I was expecting, but I don't just think to myself that going further is going to be bad just because it's not what I was initially thinking of, I just think to myself that I might just find something fitting for me, even though it's not what I was initially aiming for.\n\nWhat I also suggest you do is read philosophy. It can really make you feel different about how you search for your pathing in life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2ctyt/everything_ive_done_in_life_has_been_in_the/hfknwgn/"}
