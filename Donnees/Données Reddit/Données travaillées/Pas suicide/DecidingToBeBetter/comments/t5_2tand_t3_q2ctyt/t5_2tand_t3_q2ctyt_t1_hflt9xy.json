The thought of taking care of the house and him actually appealed to me. He made enough money for both of us to live comfortably. \n\nBut, like always, I started to go stir crazy within the first month. I\u2019ll always appreciate him letting me try it but that actually lead to one of the worst mental fallouts i\u2019ve had to date. I was the most insecure that i\u2019ve ever been. \n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that\u2019s not my issue, but I appreciate the feedback", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2ctyt/everything_ive_done_in_life_has_been_in_the/hflt9xy/"}
