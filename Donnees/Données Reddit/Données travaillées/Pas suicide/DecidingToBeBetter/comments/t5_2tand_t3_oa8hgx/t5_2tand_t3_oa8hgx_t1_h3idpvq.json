The symptoms vary from person to person and many symptoms can sound normal to a neurotypical individual. It is the degree of those symptoms that ultimately dictate the diagnoses. \n\nSo while anyone can lose their keys, or wallet, or forget to turn the oven off, people with ADHD will often find these tasks a constant struggle. \n\nSimilarly, cutting people off in conversation might be a personality quirk. But for ADHD brains it's just the norm- their brain has to keep producing words so they don't forget what they're saying. \n\nLots of people have trouble with deadlines, or hygiene, or sleep. But for ADHD it's often all (or most) of the above. \n\nFor instance, I woke up to my oven being on yesterday.  For the fifth time this year. Not only did I forget to turn it off, I also couldn't recall if I had left it on after making food, or if I had turned it on to prepare food. Or if I even ate dinner the day prior. And frankly I'll never know.\n\nEdit: To add to this, Dr Russel Barkley has lectures on YouTube that are very informative. ADHD is an impairment of the executive department in the brain. This area does not mature correctly, or at the same rate as peers. Which causes an imbalance between knowing and doing. And also memory loss. And a myriad of other possible symptoms.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h3idpvq/"}
