I never had an Xbox, never had a Wii, never had a Nintendo or PS4, and the games I usually played on the family computer were club penguin, cd roms and moshi monsters, and my first proper smartphone (I had a Nokia brick for emergencies) was when I was 14. And tbh I had a better childhood because of it. As a 20 yr old, I now have my own PC set up (paid for myself from a part time job woo!), that I occasionally play \u2018proper\u2019 games on with my best friend and just as a wind down. But I have an instilled limit so that I still have a life (when covid isn\u2019t a thing :p). Initially it did make me rebel and play for hours on end (covid didn\u2019t help cause I was stuck indoors with nothing to do). But I\u2019m now at the point where I\u2019m still working hard and having maybe 2 or 3 hours a week gaming.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h3jlvbv/"}
