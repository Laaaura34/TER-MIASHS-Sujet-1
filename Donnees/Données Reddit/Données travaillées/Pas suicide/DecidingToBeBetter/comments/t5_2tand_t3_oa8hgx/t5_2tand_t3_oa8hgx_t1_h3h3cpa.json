The subreddit is filled with posts and comments of people's experiences. Not everyone has the exact same symptoms and not everyone portrays them the same. When it comes to medication some people need small doses and some need larger. \n\nI have not began medication yet but the interesting thing with ADHD is the speed at which it is treatable. Usually results are noticed very soon, or lack thereof. If you think you might have it, set an appointment with a psychiatrist and talk to them about it. Mine had all the right information for me as an individual, I was blown away. Hoping medication treats me like it seems to treat many others. \n\nADHD is severely underdiagnosed.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h3h3cpa/"}
