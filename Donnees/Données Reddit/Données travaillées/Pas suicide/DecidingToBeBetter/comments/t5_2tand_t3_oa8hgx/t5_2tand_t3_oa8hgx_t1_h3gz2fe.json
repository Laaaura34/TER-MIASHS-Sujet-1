There's a few important facts that need attention when it comes to marijuana and its stigmas. \n\n1) Our brains have receptors specifically designed to react with cannabinoids found in cannabis. \n\n2) Due to legal process we have been unable to study long-term cannabis use \n\n3) Many people with mental health disorders are predisposed to addiction, so while a drug itself might not be treating the condition properly, it is still a treatment and should be respected as such.\n\nMy only issue with your comment is \n\n>I've yet to meet a single person who consumes a particular drug EVERY day that isn't just in denial\n\nIf you have a disorder that makes you 20% of what you feel you should be, and taking a drug makes you feel 30%, then of course you would be in denial. If it helps, it helps. The real solution is isolating the primary cause of the individual's addiction. And from there you can identify proper treatment. \n\nAre people in denial? Yes. Wouldn't you be?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h3gz2fe/"}
