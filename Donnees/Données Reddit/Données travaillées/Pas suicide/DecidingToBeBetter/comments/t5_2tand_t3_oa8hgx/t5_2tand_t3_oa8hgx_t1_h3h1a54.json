It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the junk gaming of most MMOs and \u201cscam\u201d games, but there are much better games that are made by people who put effort into making meaningful, engaging experiences rather than farms for your money and time. Try creative puzzle games: The Room, The Witness, Portal, and Superliminal. Telltale-style games are also good. Life is Strange tells a beautiful story with a good soundtrack and art direction, and Detroit: Become Human is phenomenal with its philosophy. Retro games or retro-style can also take you back into a world when video games were about the challenge and reward: look to Celeste, Cuphead, and old digs into Nintendo classics. All of these categories provide ways to enage with a unique media that books, movies, and music cannot do for us, while refraining from the capitalization of our addiction to bottemless entertainment. It\u2019s easy to get sucked into gamble-gaming with most MMOs, MOBA\u2019s, open-worlds with disgusting amounts of DLC, FPS\u2019s, and their lookalikes. Consider this as a supplement to the activities that you mentioned above, and I hope you find enrichment wherever you go in life! Good luck! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h3h1a54/"}
