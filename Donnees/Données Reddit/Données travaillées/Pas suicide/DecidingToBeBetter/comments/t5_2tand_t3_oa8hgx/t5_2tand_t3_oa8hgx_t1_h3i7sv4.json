That's a very nice move. Ambious too. And so is the life. You have a brand new day, a whole new time. I know, pandemic still sucks and keep us out of concerts and crowded places, but you did a nice move!!!  \nCongratulation!!!  \nMy 2 cents? I realize (to me, very personal informations) gaming was like an escape sometimes. I never really suffer from anxiety or depression, but I had small hints, you know? That little feeling, affraid of the world ahead and real life issues. Adult life is not so boring but we deal with non glamurous jobs and dating problems... and there's beautiful and fun and knowledge in this side of life too. I am really proud of you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h3i7sv4/"}
