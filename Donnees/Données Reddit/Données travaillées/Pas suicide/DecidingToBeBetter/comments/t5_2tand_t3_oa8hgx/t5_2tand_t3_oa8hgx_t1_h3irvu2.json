Reading, grows your vocabulary, teaches you things, expands your horizons. Baking nourishes you and others. Painting is a creative and expressive venture and can bring joy to yourself and others.\n\n>The few positives that gaming provides pale in comparison and everything that gaming does provide, real world activities provide it much better\n\nI strongly disagree with all of this.  I think certain types of gaming work your brain out in very specific ways that help learn and maintain effective problem solving skills.  And they do this better than any other hobby you mention here (other than maybe painting depending on how you are painting) by bombarding you with problems.  Especially competitive strategy games like MOBAs, TCGs, Chess, RTS games, and Auto Chess games.\n\nIMO a strong cognitive workout is just a valuable thing to get out of a hobby.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h3irvu2/"}
