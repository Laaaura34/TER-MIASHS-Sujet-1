It's easy to sink 6 hours in a day and keep going, and it's still fun. And it's easy to play a great game daily for months on end, if that is a person's favorite hobby. Similarly, a person can easily binge read a great book or spend all day painting or doing elaborate baking, etc. I've done all of these-- guess that's just my \"insecurity\" and \"unhappiness\" that draws me to different hobbies.\n\n You sound like a typical prejudiced person making assumptions about why people do what they do. Heaven forbid a person have a daily hobby you don't countenance as \"healthy,\" ie, \"productive.\" \n\nGaming addiction exists, but not every gamer is an addict. It shouldn't be that difficult to understand.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h3gou2l/"}
