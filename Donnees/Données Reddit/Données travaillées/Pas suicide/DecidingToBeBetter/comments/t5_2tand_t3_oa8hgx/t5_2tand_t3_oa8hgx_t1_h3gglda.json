I also wasted a large portion of my life on video games. When I was about 40, I pretty much gave it up. I'll game a tad on my phone but really let's be honest the habit ain't even near what it was. Hard-core marathon gamer obsessed with mmos and console games to ... meh... I play a dinky phone game. I went to school for games, worked in games, lived for games, got in student debt, eventually payed it off (phew) and now hate \"the habit\" ... and gamer toxicity. \n\nSo here's how you do it: when your console or video card ages, don't upgrade. Let it all pass you by. \n\nFind a hobby you can level up in real life: karate, yoga, biking, weight lifting... ect.\n\nRead. \n\nFind a class or subject to learn. Gardening ect.\n\nThe dopamine deficit will be real. Exercise through it. \n\nDiet and healthy foods helps. \n\nIf you're in an area that the law allows microdose shrooms (won't go into that don't ask) do that. Great for addiction treatment. \n\nGood luck... its a process not an instant thing.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h3gglda/"}
