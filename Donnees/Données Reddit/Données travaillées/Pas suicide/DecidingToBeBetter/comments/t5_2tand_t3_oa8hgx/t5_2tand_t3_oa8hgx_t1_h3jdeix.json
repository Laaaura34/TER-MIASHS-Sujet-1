It's not for the sake of trying to improve my grade point average or to socialize with more people, it's so I can look for something better to do like discuss and share stuff with people on the many communities that encompass Reddit.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h3jdeix/"}
