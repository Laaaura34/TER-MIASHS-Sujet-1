Games should be played so that they add onto your already engaging life, not as a substitute for it. To paraphrase Dwight Schrute playing an online game, \"I liked my life so much that I wanted a second one.\"\n\nEdit: How engaging your life is exists on a spectrum as well. Currently, my life is a little bit engaging; I'm doing little things that are slowly building upon that more and more, like giving time to meditation, reading, jogging, embracing the still of the moment. I play a little bit of games as a treat.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h3ghga1/"}
