It is easy to do that with anything. You are right. You just need to learn how to pace yourself and simply enjoy life for what it is. I am coming to you and saying this as a recovering alcoholic. The one thing that I would suggest to you is explore activities that allow you to be more spiritual and in touch with yourself and the world around you. Pause. Take your time. Savor your existence. The fact that we exist at all is incredibly improbable if not nearly impossible to comprehend. Open yourself up to new experiences and people. Learn to love yourself so that you can be available to love others. Be kind to yourself as that will end up going out in the world without even trying. And, whatever you do, quit keeping score.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h3hvptz/"}
