Alcohol isn't a problem for you, but you haven't developed that neurological pathway.\n\nWhen we're younger, we have so much fun socializing, and typically substances are involved. If you were to start going out and socializing with a group of friends, have a great time, you have a little more alcohol, have the best time ever! Your brain would start to equate alcohol with fun. So you start having a little more, friends aren't available every night... boom. Drinking alone for no apparent reason.\n\nPeople don't become alcoholics overnight - it's a slow, insidious process that you don't realize until you hit your rock bottom.\n\nIt's the nature of addiction and whether or not a substance is physically addictive, the pattern is the same. And when I say the same pattern, is obviously not always the drug=fun, it could be drug=numb or drug=chill. But the brain starts associating the drug with a desired feeling, whether or not the drug actually provides it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oa8hgx/after_wasting_literally_all_my_life_playing_games/h3i4xba/"}
