Like the poster child! Get help. I actually feel bad for you. You so clearly lack love in your life. You\u2019re bashing a complete stranger over the internet to feel better about yourself.\n\nGo on tinder, find some lonely gal to fuck (I know, I know, easier said than done since I imagine you look like something I\u2019d scrape off the bottom of my shoe and NOBODY wants to touch your reddened, blistered, micropenis) but man GIVE IT A TRY, STOP TROLLING ON THE INTERNET and actually contribute to society! Damn man you are sad\n\nOh, mommy didn\u2019t love you or hold you enough and now you hate all women? Yeah dude I\u2019ve seen your bullshit story a million times. Get over yourself\n\nAnd fuck your brother, hope his wife took everything he owned!\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fvz07t/two_years_ago_i_left_for_rehab/fmsaxy7/"}
