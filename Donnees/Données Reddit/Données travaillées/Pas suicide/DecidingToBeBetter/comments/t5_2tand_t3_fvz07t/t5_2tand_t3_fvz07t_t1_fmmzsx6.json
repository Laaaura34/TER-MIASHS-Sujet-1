In the past 4 years, I've spent two of them in long-term recovery programs with over a year of being relapsed in between. I spent about 3 years before entering my first rehab actively addicted to Roxycontin followed by heroin, so I definetely know what its like. I lost everything I had and was basically a dog chasing its tail for years, leaving nothing but a trail of destruction behind me and too warped in my thinking to realize the gravity of harm I was causing to those who cared about me the most.\n\nBut after a *long, long* uphill climb I'm now clean coming up on two years and back in control of my life and future. It took a long time to finally get to this point and it sure as hell hasn't been easy but I'm finally happy and learning to enjoy the simple things in life, and wouldn't trade this to go back to that garbage and misery it brings with it for anything in the world!\n\nI'm proud of what you've accomplished and keep on moving forward because you've got a great future waiting for you!!\n\nAnd thanks for posting this its exactly what I needed to see today.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fvz07t/two_years_ago_i_left_for_rehab/fmmzsx6/"}
