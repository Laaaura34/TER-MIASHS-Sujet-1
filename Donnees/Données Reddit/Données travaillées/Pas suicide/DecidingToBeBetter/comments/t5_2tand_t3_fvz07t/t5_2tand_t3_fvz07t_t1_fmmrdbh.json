Cold turkey I can\u2019t even fathom that. That takes incredible strength. Before the heroin, I had my run ins with coke and Xanax and I was able to stop those cold turkey but heroin was a whole other story. You\u2019re incredible and deserve all the world has to offer. You are definitely not alone in a strange and twisted sense I\u2019ve felt more sense of community with people in recovery. NA and AA aren\u2019t for everybody I went for awhile but don\u2019t anymore but if you struggle or find yourself struggling definitely find a meeting. Imagine relapsing and having to go through these 11 days again, no thanks Tom Hanks! You\u2019re a rock star and I appreciate you. I\u2019m here whenever if you need a listening ear.
