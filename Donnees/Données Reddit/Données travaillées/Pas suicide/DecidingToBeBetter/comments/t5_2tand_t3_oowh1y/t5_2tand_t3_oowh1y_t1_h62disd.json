I've been getting burned out lately too. I have 2 jobs and going to school part time. It's a lot ughhh I don't really have any good advice for you aside from just keep trying to find 1 job that somehow pays the bills and hopefully something you don't hate. I know that's way harder to find these days though :( Hang in there!\n\nEdit: Also saw you're an illustrator. Those designs are adorable! Maybe try to get a side hustle going on Society6 or Etsy.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oowh1y/deciding_to_try_again/h62disd/"}
