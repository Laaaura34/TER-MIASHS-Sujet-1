It is the root genre for almost all contemporary music (rock, rap, metal, etc.) and for good reason. It has a high level of emotional tension.  \nWhy? Blues is just Minor (sad) scales played on top of Major (happy) chords. This creates that bitter sweet, constant tension of emotion in blues.  \nIf you play Major chords on Major scales, or minor on minor, it sounds nice, but quickly becomes hackneyed and boring. There is no tension. (Mmmbop by Hanson? Catchy but quickly gets old).  \nHow does this tie into socializing?  \nEver hear of a \"yes man\"? Constant agreement and is always afraid to cause dissonance.   \nLikewise, the chronic devil's advocate come of as depressing, jerks, etc.  \nBut truly memorable individuals hold their line. They mix emotions and aren't afraid to cause dissonance.\n\nVery high level idea, but just how I frame things.
