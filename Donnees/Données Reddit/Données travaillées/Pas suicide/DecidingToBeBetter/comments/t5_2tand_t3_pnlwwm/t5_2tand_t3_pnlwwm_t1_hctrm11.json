We don\u2019t have dads who give us amazing jobs with growth potential. We all have dreams that have to put on the side for a while while we save up enough money to afford them. But most of us have to work at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, not at a sweet corporate job that pays way higher per hour. So it takes us way longer than you. You\u2019re still insanely privileged, and seeing you complain about this job is tearing me apart inside, watching my friends from poor backgrounds break their fucking backs for cents on the dollar.\n\nStop complaining. Take the job. Do your creative work on the side. \n\nIt\u2019s exhausting. You\u2019re gonna fail at discipline some days. You\u2019re gonna have a difficult adjustment. But just don\u2019t fucking stop working. Wake up every day, do your job for 8 hours, and just try again to do your creative work on the side.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pnlwwm/what_advice_can_you_give_to_a_spoiled_brat_who/hctrm11/"}
