It\u2019s that simple. No one- literally no one- wants to do a boring ass 9-5. But we don\u2019t think of it that way, and we mostly are coming from worse with this being an excellent option because it damn near guarantees a middle class life, sometimes more. For an unlucky few, less, even with hard work. \n\nSo stop telling yourself how hard this is. Start one step at a time- go to bed in time to take care of your body & get enough sleep. Get up & drink good coffee or whatever it is you like so there\u2019s a small joy to start your day. Show up on time and do what\u2019s asked, one task at a time, learning & growing from those around you. \n\nYou\u2019ll find friends there. Talented people that know things you don\u2019t. Peers that are just as good as you were at your old occupation. And you will be guaranteed an incredible reward for those basic daily steps. \n\nIt IS hard at first, but your dad is right. It\u2019s time to grow up. You will stumble- it\u2019s ok- this humility you\u2019re learning is actually good for you. Can you imagine the insufferable prig you\u2019d be at 45 had you kept on that track? \n\nOne day at a time, friend. You can do this. You\u2019ve had motivation before, it\u2019s just that it was too easy to get the rewards, and too easy to party away this short fleeting life. \n\nYou\u2019ve got an amazing second chance. You didn\u2019t die, presumably aren\u2019t brain damaged, and can still have an amazing amount of privilege. Take care of yourself, and take each step as it comes. You got this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pnlwwm/what_advice_can_you_give_to_a_spoiled_brat_who/hcsi5v3/"}
