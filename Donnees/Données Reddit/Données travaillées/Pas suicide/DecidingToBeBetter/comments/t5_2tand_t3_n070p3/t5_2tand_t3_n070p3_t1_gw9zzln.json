I guess being around psychiatry has hurt me quite a lot. I often use words like that to get a point across, but for sure, addictions/vices are ways to cope with pain, just like dissociation is. Putting a \"disorder\" on yourself and identifying with it is really not helpful. I suffer from chronic dissociation, and I have done that too much these past few years. It has only hurt me to identify too much with being numb and disconnected. Viewing them as symptoms of trauma but not as a \"disorder\" is the most helpful. Nowadays, we get put in boxes everywhere, and it only furthers the divide between people. This is kind of a rant lol, but I'm just glad you made me think a bit about it again. You helped me as well. \n\nAnyway, glad it was helpful. All the best to you, my friend \u2764", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n070p3/i_almost_died/gw9zzln/"}
