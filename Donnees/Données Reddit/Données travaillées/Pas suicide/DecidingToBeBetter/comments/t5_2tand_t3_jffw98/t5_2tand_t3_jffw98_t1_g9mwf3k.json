Don't get me wrong, I like nice things, but there are certain nice things I'd never be interested in if I was living in a world by myself (like a sports car for example in my case - I've never been into cars but would like one to flex basically). \n\nWhat I really desire personally and what drives me is personal freedom, independence, ability to express myself, and realizing my highest potential in various pursuits.\n\nThe only one that will be able to tell you what your real motivating factors are is yourself. That's the point, it doesnt matter what anybody else considers to be a false desire. What is a false desire for one man is a real one for another. Pleasures of the flesh (material, sexual, etc) are not inherently wrong to pursue or be motivated by imo. Its all dependent on what you find when you soul search, and it likely will change throughout your life too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jffw98/after_25_years_of_procrastination_and_unfulfilled/g9mwf3k/"}
