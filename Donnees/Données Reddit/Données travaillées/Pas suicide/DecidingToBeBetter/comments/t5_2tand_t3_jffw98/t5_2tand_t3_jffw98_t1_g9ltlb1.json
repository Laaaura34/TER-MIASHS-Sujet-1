When we fail to form a strong connection between a task and a positive outcome, or we don't value the positive outcome enough, we avoid the task. Work on creating a clear visualization of the positive outcome you desire and keep that picture in your mind's eye at all times. We tend to casually create visualizations of outcomes but only visit them from time to time. Successful people have their vision of their future in their mind 24/7.....like picture in picture on a TV or a HUD like Iron Man's helmet. Sound funny but it works very well. These visualizations.....if maintained and utilized effectively.....will fuel your energy and motivation in amazing and powerful ways.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jffw98/after_25_years_of_procrastination_and_unfulfilled/g9ltlb1/"}
