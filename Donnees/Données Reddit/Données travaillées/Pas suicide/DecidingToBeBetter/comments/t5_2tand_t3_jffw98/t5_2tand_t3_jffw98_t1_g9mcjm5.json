Everytime I tried to do things this way, it ALWAYS backfired. You don't have to do this thinking \"I hate how I've lived my life so I'm gonna change and I'm gonna do this and this and this\". It's way more easier to leave from a place of just wanting better for yourself. No hate towards your past, no resentment towards what you did or someone else did. Just move on towards a better life because that's what is best for you and your future. Take care and if anyone needs it(because I do), remember that a small setback in your journey dosen't mean all the progress you've made is gone!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jffw98/after_25_years_of_procrastination_and_unfulfilled/g9mcjm5/"}
