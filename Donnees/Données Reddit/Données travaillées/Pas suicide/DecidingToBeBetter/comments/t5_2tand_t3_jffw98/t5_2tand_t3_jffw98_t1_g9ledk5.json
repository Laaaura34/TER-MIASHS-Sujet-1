Those do take a long time to stick.  \nI didn't say I was cured. I said I \"found an effective way to combat\" my problem.  \nAnd as for it taking a while.  \nIs 25 years not long enough to get something to stick?\n\nThe fight isn't over and I'm sorry if that was your takeaway.\n\nThe only hope I'm giving is that it **CAN** be done if you stick with it. I've spent a lot of time fighting my inner demons. I know they will always be there. But now I also know that it is possible to live a life where they don't own and control my actions.\n\nThat was the message I wanted to deliver.
