So I go straight to envisioning \u201cdude you are screwing up and you\u2019re going to lose your friggin job!\u201d  This then creates a loop of fear of it and depression from the weight of it all and then I lose motivation.  \n\nI know I need to get past it.  \n\nOne thing that has been helping is telling myself, \u201clisten you are already behind.  Deal with it. Will working on just this one thing mean the other stuff gets pushed aside that should already be done?  Yup.  Would the other stuff get done if you weren\u2019t doing this one thing?  Nope!  So just do it\u201d\n\nIn that above scenario I try to stay on the same type of task (multiples of same one) so the momentum built up of getting in the mind set for that type of task isn\u2019t lost.  It\u2019s one big uphill and then flat land instead of every different task being uphill at each start if that makes sense?\n\nSorry for the inner dialogue but I\u2019m in a rush and now I\u2019m out :) \n\nGood luck all", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jffw98/after_25_years_of_procrastination_and_unfulfilled/g9nxtci/"}
