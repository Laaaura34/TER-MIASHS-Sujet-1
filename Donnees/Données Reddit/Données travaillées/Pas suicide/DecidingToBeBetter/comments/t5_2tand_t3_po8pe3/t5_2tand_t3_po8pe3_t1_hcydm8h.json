It\u2019s important to come out of your 20s with people who make you want to be a better person and are there for you in times of need, not just to have fun. I made the mistake of only staying with a small band of guy friends and not venturing out of my comfort zone, and barely had any dating experience. Cut out toxic and negative people as soon as possible, whoever they might be. Staying with them will make you more lonely and be bad for mental health.\n\nIf you\u2019re still in your hometown, try to move to a new city to experience other aspects of life. There\u2019s nothing wrong with staying in your hometown if your financial situation doesn\u2019t allow it or if you have a supportive social circle there, but you discover yourself if you live in another place.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/po8pe3/what_advice_do_you_have_for_someone_whos_turning/hcydm8h/"}
