Had I been more financially responsible, I could adventure more now that I am 30.\n\nOther thing I wish is cut shit friends and focus on the relationships that actually better me as a person. Life is too short to be surrounded by assholes or to be one yourself.\n\nHappy birthday and good luck in your journey !", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/po8pe3/what_advice_do_you_have_for_someone_whos_turning/hcwpcfm/"}
