Fail hard and fail often. It means you're experimenting, trying new things, trying to find your authentic self. I wish I did SO much more creative things to find my passions and interests instead of just assuming that if I was any good at then I'd be doing them already. That's bull. Try everything, be weird, be daring. Take up photography and travel, have little to no money for a while if you can, date around, make things, perform, wear weird outfits. Do anything you feel like you want to try and fail. It doesn't have to be at 23, everyone should do this bc in my opinion, this is what living is. I just wished I started sooner bc the longer you keep doing only what's comfortable, the harder it is to let yourself do uncomfortable things for risk of failing. But to fail is to have lived. Good luck, don't take yourself so seriously. And have fun!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/po8pe3/what_advice_do_you_have_for_someone_whos_turning/hcwqq6f/"}
