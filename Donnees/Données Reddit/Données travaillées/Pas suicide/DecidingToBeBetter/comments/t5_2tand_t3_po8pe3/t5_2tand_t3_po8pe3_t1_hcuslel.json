It seems so unreal and far away until suddenly you\u2019re keenly aware it is approaching.\n\nI also wish I hadn\u2019t just drifted city to city rental to rental due to relationships or things that didn\u2019t work out. Although I love them I wish I hadn\u2019t burdened myself with pets as they cost me a fortune and gave me less freedom in my twenties.\n\nI am glad I committed to a career in tech and got fairly good earnings, although I defo could have levelled up more if I hadn\u2019t kept changing early on due to moving etc. I was easily bored and used to just change stuff up all the time. I should have just picked up a cool hobby instead.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/po8pe3/what_advice_do_you_have_for_someone_whos_turning/hcuslel/"}
