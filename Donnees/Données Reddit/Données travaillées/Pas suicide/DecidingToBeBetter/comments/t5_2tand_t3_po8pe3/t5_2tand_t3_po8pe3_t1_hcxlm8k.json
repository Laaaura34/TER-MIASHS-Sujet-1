You\u2019d be able to retire early, actually.\n\nBut also: be healthy and exercise. Do this now. Don\u2019t wait til you become overweight if you aren\u2019t already. Get a gym membership, and go routinely. Your health can only get worse if you don\u2019t pay attention to it", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/po8pe3/what_advice_do_you_have_for_someone_whos_turning/hcxlm8k/"}
