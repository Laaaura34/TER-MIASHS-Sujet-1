Here goes:\n\nStrong reasoning skills\n\nWell developed empathy\n\nCreativity and willingness to be different \n\nPatience and tolerance of other's weaknesses\n\nI have useful skills like first aid, cooking, gardening. \n\nCourage- I am currently taking big risks to follow my ambitions \n\nPassionate- sexually, emotionally, creatively.  I burn strong.\n\nHumility and self awareness\n\nOrganised. Mostly. I *can* be organised. This has slipped recently.\n\nLeadership- when in my element i take charge and people follow\n\n\n\n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/2rafew/what_are_ten_positive_qualities_about_yourself/cnej2d8/"}
