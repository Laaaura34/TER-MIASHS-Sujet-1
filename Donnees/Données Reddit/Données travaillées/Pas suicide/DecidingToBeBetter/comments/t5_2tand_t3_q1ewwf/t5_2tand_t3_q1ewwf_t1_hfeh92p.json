Being a teenager is hard.\n\nThe best thing to do now - the thing that will set you up for a happy life more than anything tangible - is to develop good habits, of which I would suggest two things:\n\nFirst, discipline in work and school - be willing to sit down and read one book for 45 minutes at a time, or write for 45 minutes. Essentially, do what you can to avoid the constant distraction that comes from technology.\n\nSecond, habits related to physical health. Exercise and sleep are the two big ones. But another one that is very important to start or keep up as a teenager: your teeth! They'll be with you your whole life.
