I'd say first to continuously learn empathy and kindness BOTH towards yourself and for others. You're life probably won't always be too easy-but that's ok. Take time to spend with your relatives/parents/siblings/friends. Granted, I'm not sure what your relationship is like with those groups. Tell them you love them. \n\nDon't be afraid to ask for help even if things are better right now-if you have access to a licensed therapist then that is a completely healthy and normal place to go to talk about these things and set goals for yourself. If you have felt suicidal and you haven't talked to a therapist or even a school counsellor then you should absolutely do so.\n\nBut also have fun. You're 14. You are probably just now starting to learn a little about responsibility about some things, but you are still a kid (and that's a good thing). Have some fun and give yourself permission not to worry about these things TOO much.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1ewwf/things_i_should_start_doing_at_a_young_age/hfegxgj/"}
