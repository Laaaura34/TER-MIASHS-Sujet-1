It was a defense mechanism to be overly protective because my mind was fragile and couldn\u2019t take criticism without it feeling personal.  In hindsight, my mind lacked self-awareness so I perceived everything coming from my perspective without taking into account other\u2019s perspectives.  This was remedied after meditating for a few years and my self-awareness has allowed me to identify when I\u2019m wrong.  Criticism now are merely pointers to learn and improve as I see the practical nature behind it.  Self-awareness is just observing your own mind without judgments.  It\u2019s being aware of what you\u2019re doing and why as it\u2019s happening.  Practicing meditation can increase this ability.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pfaaa1/im_a_self_diagnosed_narcissist_and_i_want_to_be/hb39f44/"}
