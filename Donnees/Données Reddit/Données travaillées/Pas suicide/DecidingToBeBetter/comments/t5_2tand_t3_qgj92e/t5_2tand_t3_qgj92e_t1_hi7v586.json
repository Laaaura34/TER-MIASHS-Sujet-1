If you want a relationship, you need to meet men who also want a relationship. Dating for the sake of dating is a waste of time. When people are serious about finding a life partner, there's no need for games and BS. The exploitation you experience is simply because the men are trying to get their needs met, but have no interest in creating a life with someone. In other words, date as if you're looking for a husband, not just someone to pass the time with it. I'm not saying you *have* to marry anyone, but you should date men *as if* that's what you are looking for. If he's not good enough to marry, he's not really good enough to date. Of course, that means that you have to be \"good enough\" also.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi7v586/"}
