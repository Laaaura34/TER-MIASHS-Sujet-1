And I do think we are a bit ideologically opposed. Which is fine, whatevs. I am a radical feminist and a anti-racist. I believe that racism and sexism is harmful bc of its hierarchical power over people. Sexism / racism isn\u2019t just about hating, it\u2019s about upholding the oppressive hierarchy. The powerful group will always view challenging behaviour by the marginalised group as hateful. Like\u2026men in the 1900s viewed the suffragettes as anti-men too. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s good to hate men obv. But what I\u2019m saying is with all the pain this woman has faced with sexual harrassment and male abuse, I can understand why she would hate men. She says she wants to stop. I understand that you may view that as sexist. But I feel like using that language already acts like we\u2019re in an equal world, which we aren\u2019t. \n\n\n\nI haven\u2019t called you a misogynist. You are the person who called me a sexist pig? I don\u2019t have an ego and am happy to stop chatting if you want? Love the \u2018real definitions\u2019 thing, what school of feminism do you follow?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hiary27/"}
