I understand. \n\nI would start with just being friends with guys. I couldn't jump into a relationship right away, I needed to know men didn't all have to use me. Even if it's a couple of guys, even if it's over a game, even if it's online, doesn't matter. I have many guy friends who haven't hit on me at all and merely see me as a friend. I'm queer, and I could understand how maybe befriending a queer man could help? \n\nDon't feel the need to jump into dating until you are ready.
