You can feel however you want about an individual or specific individuals, sure. But hating a group of generalized people makes you a sexist pig. \n\nObviously you don't know me, but I've voted strictly left, very progressive and dated approximately 30 women and now I'm engaged. I'm friends with almost all my exes except the ones who cheated on me. I agree with your sentiment about the imbalance of men in \"power\" but this taking it too far. You should try to evolve past this way of thinking as it also leads to unhappy mindsets. You're setting yourself up to see 50% of the population as a trigger. That's just silly psychologically.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi9x6mk/"}
