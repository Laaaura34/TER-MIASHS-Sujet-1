I don't think your hatred for men is the problem. Reading your post you seem very intolerant and controlling.  Makes me wonder what your childhood must've been like.  Were your parents very overbearing?  Did they have unrealistically high expectations of you to where you were conditioned to think leisure activities were worthless?  Was your father present to give you a good example of how a man can treat a woman well?  Be it you or your mother? \n\nYes there are scumbags out there, but you sound very judgmental yourself and I'm guessing you're struggling to find a person who meets your expectations to spend time with because maybe you're too unattractive (personality) for a kind, happy, and attractive man to be around or even approach.  \n\nI think you need to work on being happy with yourself to the point where you don't take the differences in other people so personally.  Sink your teeth into your passions that bring you a lot of joy.  Or try out a new hobby that you've always wanted to explore.  Learn about things you have been interested in and start sharing those ideas with your loved ones.  Wish you all the best OP.  Stay in your lane and focus on your joy.  Life is too short to be so angry.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi97i0u/"}
