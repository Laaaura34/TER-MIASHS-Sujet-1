Our first man was our father.  The way we bonded with him, will be the way you'll bond with every other man.\nBecause my mom abused me (not sexually) I got ingrained that the ways men and women relate are on an abuse basis.\n\nI don't know if this makes any sense. But there's a starting point.  You can unlearn. Accept the posibility of other ways to relate with people, on a more healthy manner. \n\nAnd, again, deep inside, people chase their parents in their partner selection.. so it's a possibility you are repeating the relantionship with your father, in every other men.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi7715t/"}
