It's the same with dudes I hang with. If you come over and eat my food, consume other stuff, don't contribute positively to what's happening around us, then you aren't getting an invite back. If a girl who wanted to be friends said \"hey, let's go hiking, let's meet at the trailhead at 1pm\"  and she was fun and a good conversation then I would show up and be friends and it would be great. Repeat with other activities and her not flake out, not ask for anything other than good company during a mutually enjoyed activity, then that's a good friend. Same with guys. \n\nBut introduce flakiness, not bringing equal *whatever* to the table, and demanding time and attentions and complaining when you don't get it, and you'll quickly see why guys who are actually awesome and worthy of quality people in their lives won't put up with any of that shit.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi8py51/"}
