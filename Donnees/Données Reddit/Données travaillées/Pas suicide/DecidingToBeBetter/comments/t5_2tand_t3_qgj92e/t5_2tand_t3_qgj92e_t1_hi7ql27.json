It may seem immature or in someways lazy to partake in the viewing of porn or playing video games, but that doesn't outright correlate with a man being horrible. Like you may go for walks or vent to reddit as a way of dealing with problems, men & any individual may resort to video games as a way to deal with their own issues and trauma.   \n\n\nOne way to stop hating them, is to start relating to them. It's true you always FEEL like men are horrible, but try to avoid allowing your brain to vilify a set group and do so with the individual instead.   \n\n\nWhile I don't condone you continuing hatred, because hatred is as damaging to yourself as it is to others, but when you think about these bad experiences, put names to the people. So when you say you hate men, say you hate Jeremy, Kyle, Justin, David etc. Make it habitual.   \n\n\nI find that the best way to break bad habits, is to create good and healthy ones!  \n\n\n..Not that hating people is a good habit, but I think you get what I'm trying to say.   \nNot sure how helpful I can be from my end of the spectrum, but I do hope the best for you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi7ql27/"}
