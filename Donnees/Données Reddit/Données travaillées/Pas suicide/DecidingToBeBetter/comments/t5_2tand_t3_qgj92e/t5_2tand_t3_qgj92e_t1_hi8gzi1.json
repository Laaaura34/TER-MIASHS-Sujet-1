This is obviously not true, for a number of reasons. This is sort of a mirror-image of the behavior a lot of incels engage in.\n\nIncels will generalize a handful of bad interactions with women to *all* women, when the problem is mostly a) they were ignoring actually kind and decent women (millions and millions out there) and b) engaging in toxic and abusive behavior themselves and mistaking women's reaction to their toxic behavior as shallowness on the women's part.\n\nIt's also the case that plenty of women also watch porn and/or play video games, and women who engage in casual porn/video game consumption are basically never accused of having porn/gaming addictions.  So obviously there's a lot of stereotyping and erasing of individual identity/agency going on.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi8gzi1/"}
