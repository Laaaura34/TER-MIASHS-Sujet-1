Everyone says we are all the same think the same feel the same and can do the same things. That is 110% a lie that has catered to woman\u2019s emotions. I love women but I also know there\u2019s garbage ones out there as I\u2019ve experienced it. I know there\u2019s garbage men too, its not a gender thing. My first encounter w/ anything sexual I was sexually abused by a girl at the age of 7. Been cheated on lied to borderline abandoned by my mother even though i know she loves me but still don\u2019t fester that hate in my heart. I attracted tons of women & friends who were damaged and resembled the people that hurt me. That all changed when I adjusted cultivated my mindset to stop being hateful and hurt like them. Men are different than women. In lots of ways. I\u2019m no better nor are you. We are different to compliment eachother. Men are half the population if you hate us you\u2019re always in a hateful mood bc you see us all day every day. You\u2019re always in that mode then. You need a male therapist to break that down. Read some books inspired by male struggles to stop this idea that we\u2019re predators lol. The energy you have inside of you attracts the same men you hate. The things you focus on is all you can see. If anger is all I allow myself to feel then i\u2019ll always see things that make me angry & frustrated. If I allow joy I notice things that make me happy and grateful. You and tons of other women I see that \u201chate\u201d men have the same bubble of issues.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi92n5o/"}
