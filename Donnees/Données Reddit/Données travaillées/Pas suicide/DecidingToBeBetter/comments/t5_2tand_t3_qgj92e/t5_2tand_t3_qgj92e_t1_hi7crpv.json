Sounds traumatizing and discouragement and frustration seem like natural feelings to have. \n\nIf I'm guessing right - somewhere in your mind, you know that there are decent (but not perfect, nobody is) guys out there who want to have healthy relationships with women. \n\nI'd say that you should be true to your feelings and allow yourself to process feelings of betrayal or just abandonment or a sense of shame or self loathing for \"allowing\" yourself to get into a relationship like that. \n\nIt might take a while, but if you were my sister, I'd say to take a break, and eventually you'll feel your mind and heart open up again to the possibility of connecting with someone. I know with me, in various dating relationships that have gone not well with some women I've dated, I learn to observe and kind of scout out some of those behaviors, mentalities, or whatever before I get too far into a relationship. \n\nIt's definitely not wrong to have standards. It can kind of suck because standards can be fundamentally exclusive and our dating pool can get pretty reduced. It's easy when you feel really lonely to let those standards drop, but it's good to work to maintain them so guys know what you're all about and it'll naturally filter out some guys who aren't willing to invest in something more meaningful with you. \n\nGood luck! :-)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi7crpv/"}
