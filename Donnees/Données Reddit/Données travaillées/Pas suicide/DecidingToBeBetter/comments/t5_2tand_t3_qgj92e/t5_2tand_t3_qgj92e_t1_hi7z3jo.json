My parents and eventually wife/gf can shut down my internet all they want, but I laugh in C# offline documentation and the offline programs like Paint and Visual Studio still working (actually faster without Internet connection and I drop mine myself when I get to work on something).\n\nHow can you stop hating men? First advice: learn to tell the good and the bad apart, some of their hobbies aren't bad even if you can't find them useful. Learn to respect boundaries and learn how to set boundaries. Always focus on yourself first, jobs, friends, hobbies etc., don't make dating a priority. Dating is about confidence and about being already a functioning human in the society, no matter if you're a guy or a girl. The most common mistake nowadays is not progressing in life until getting girlfriend/boyfriend, and not being able to get or maintain a relationship due to nothing to do in life besides the bedroom fun and/or addictions. And yes, most men are like that, I'm a guy hated by most guys just because I ditched porn and because I never did drugs or alcohol.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi7z3jo/"}
