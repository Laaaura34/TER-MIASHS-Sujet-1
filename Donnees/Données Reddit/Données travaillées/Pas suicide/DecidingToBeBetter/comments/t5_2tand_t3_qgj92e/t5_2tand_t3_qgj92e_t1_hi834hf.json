I can have a very hard time trusting men especially after having some bad experiences myself. \n\nI think therapy is key and if you also have ptsd you really should try to treat the physiological problems that brings things like hypervigilence. Basically you can't turn off the fight or flight system because ptsd causes physiological changes to your sympathetic nervous system. A medical doctor and counselor can help so much and dialectical behavioral therapy is one of the best treatments in clinical studies. \n\nThere's also something called a stellate ganglion nerve block which is just a lidocaine shot into a bundle of nerves that controls the sympathetic nervous system. This is being used more and more in the treatment of ptsd and it's success rate has been pretty good treating the physical symptoms of PTSD. Its something to look into. It can turn off your hyperarrousal symptoms so you don't always feel like you're in fight or flight.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi834hf/"}
