Those \"I always meet the same horrible people\" stories (no matter the gender, works the same for men) often stem from unprocessed trauma and /or father or mother wounds. You hating men may be a direct reflection of you being mistreated by your father or a father figure in your life in your (early) childhood. You then subconsciously decided that \"men are not safe\" and from that belief, you go into the dating world and attract unsafe men, because they feel familiar to your subconscious. Even if the familiarity is pain. \n\nWhy is that? Unprocessed trauma is like a wound in the psyche and as long as it's not healed, it is filtering and overlaying your perception, so that one feels attracted to those types and not drawn to \"healthy\" people.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi9ojws/"}
