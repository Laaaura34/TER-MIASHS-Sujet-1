I was thinking like your but nowadays I realise that not everyone is the same, because everyone is an individual. It\u2019s just inconvenient and unfortunate that some people mostly meet the \u201cbad\u201d ones / not well behaved ones. But good men do exist, sometimes we just need to wait and see. And never rush into things but let friendships grow over time, so you can be sure it\u2019s a person who wants your best and wants you to be happy. But it\u2019s much easier to be friends than more than friends sometimes. And can be more rewarding too. Good luck and God bless:)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi7x5nq/"}
