If you don\u2019t like how they behave, tell them and leave. Make sure that you aren\u2019t befriending men \u201cjust cause they\u2019re men\u201d. Use the same standards you\u2019d use for a woman for a man. And try meeting men in different places. Trying to befriend a random drunk man in a bar isn\u2019t going to give you the best of humanity.\n\nWe can\u2019t help you unless we know what is your target demographic. Married men in a book club are much less likely to want you for sex than drunk dudes in a bar.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi8iwwc/"}
