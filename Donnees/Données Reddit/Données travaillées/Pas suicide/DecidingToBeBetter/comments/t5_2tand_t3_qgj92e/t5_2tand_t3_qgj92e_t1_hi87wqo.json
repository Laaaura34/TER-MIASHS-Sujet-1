He holds no power now. Its not right to be ok with someone being racist or sexist. They could have power one day.\n\nIts not that usual. I like stereotype jokes. I was called sexist few times just for jokes. But I love when a woman makes a good joke about male stereotypes. Its just fun. Other women would call men sexist for other small issues. Being abusive and harming women is beyond sexist I would say.\n\nWow. If you think that about men maybe thats why you attract those types of men? I mean the \"only fucking is important\" type. Because that seems to be your vision of who men are. Are some like that? Sure. Many? No. Are many men just looking for sex? Yes. Are many men not looking just for sex? Yes. Its theirs choice. Super horny people can choose to fuck anyone or just one person they love. And both men and women can be horny as fuck.\n\nThere are even famous people, who have much higher chance of fucking some young hot girl, who have one wife for a long time and most likely never cheated. Because its theirs choice.\n\nAlso depends how you date. With guys in bars? Tinder? Your friends friends? Some dating site or an app thats not tinder? And even on serious sites are idiots. But first I would say find good men around you and maybe befriend them and try to understand how good men can be.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi87wqo/"}
