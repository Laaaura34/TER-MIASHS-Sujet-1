I joined female dating strategy, a community for women only, which I've never had, it made me reconnect with my feminine nature and I felt at peace to see so many women acknowledge my experiences, we women have a common consciousness, it made me realize I'm enough, and so I stopped hating men, hate comes from a place of hurt. I don't like men still, but I don't hate them, I avoid them (like I'vebeen taught since I was born, for good reason) most will hurt you if you give them a chance, just like putting your hand in hyena's mouth will end up with you missing a hand \ud83d\udc81", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgj92e/how_do_i_stop_hating_men/hi8pc0y/"}
