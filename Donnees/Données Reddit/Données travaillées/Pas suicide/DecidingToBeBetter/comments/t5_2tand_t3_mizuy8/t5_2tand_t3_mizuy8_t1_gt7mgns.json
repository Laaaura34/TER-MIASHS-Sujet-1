I was pretty motivated from December to February when vaccines were rolling out in the U.S., but then the start of March hit me like a ton of bricks. My goal right now is to just... survive, I guess. I should be eligible for a vaccine in the next 6-8 weeks, but that feels like a lifetime from now. I'm just trying to take things day by day. I do the bare minimum to do well in work and school, but that's about it.\n\nTry to find some joy if you can, even if it's just a good book or an entertaining TV show. We don't need to strive for greatness, just good enough right now. Getting through a global pandemic is good enough for me right now.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mizuy8/lost_my_spark_another_lockdown_coming_up_is_not/gt7mgns/"}
