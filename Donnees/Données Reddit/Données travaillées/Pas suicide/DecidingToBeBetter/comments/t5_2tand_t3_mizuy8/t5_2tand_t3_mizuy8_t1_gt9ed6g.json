What can you do to help? Can you volunteer somewhere via zoom or phone? Is there something you can do that can help and be part of the solution?\n\nFind a local community center or church that needs help. A suicide hotline, something that matters to you. Look here on Reddit.\n\nI think you'll find that in helping others you're inadvertently helping yourself.\n\nGetting out of your own head can be sometimes the best thing to do.\n\nBest of luck to you.
