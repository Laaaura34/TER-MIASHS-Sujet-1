Distraction with another activity is literally the opposite of meditation. While meditating you are 100% present. \n\nThe best advice I can give you is to LEARN meditation.

I can guarantee that will change your life positively and teach you the skill of meditation.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qftopw/meditation_is_ruining_my_life/hi31bpc/"}
