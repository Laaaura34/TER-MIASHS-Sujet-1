Just curious, I keep telling myself I can\u2019t write because I\u2019m withdrawing and blah blah blah but deep down I could probably get something done. I\u2019m gonna try tomorrow!\n\nIf I was to go back I would go for the .25 at night to help me sleep but honestly xan sleep is so shitty on a taper plan, I might get relief for the first few nights but regardless I\u2019m going to have to deal with a few sleepless nights. I feel overall okay, just super socially awkward, a little body achey and I have to force myself to eat and drink water but at least I\u2019m not puking my guts out like all the other times.\n\nPerspective I guess?\n\nWhat do you do when you\u2019re not writing?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hjpjtu/my_last_dose_of_xanax/fwrmd7c/"}
