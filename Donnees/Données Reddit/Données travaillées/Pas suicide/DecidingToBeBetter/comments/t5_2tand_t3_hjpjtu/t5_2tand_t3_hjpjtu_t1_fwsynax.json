Flualp is like alp but slightly more uhh... normal feeling? Off pure alp I was wrapped in a cloud of bliss, I feel like flualp gives me the anti anxiety properties and leaves me a little clearer headed then pure alp but then again now that I\u2019m sober almost 72hrs and going back to music I\u2019ve worked on or projects I\u2019ve done I\u2019m disappointed in my ear, it wasn\u2019t as \u201cclean\u201d as I thought it was, a lot of things just wooshed past my head (in terms of engineering music to make it sound radio ready).\n\nAnd you\u2019re right, it\u2019s easy to say you\u2019re gonna get stronger on a good day haha, it\u2019s really difficult this morning when all I want to do is crawl in bed and sleep but I have an eight hour shift and then when I get home I know I\u2019ll be fighting demons for a few hours before I blink to attempt sleep. It definitely gets rough, and I\u2019m only on day three. I feel like I haven\u2019t slept in days, I switch between extremely full and empty like on a dime, my energy levels go from great to dead in moments. It\u2019s awful.\n\nI just know if I take a bar or rescind any of my previous convictions I\u2019ll be disappointed in myself. Tomorrow is Fourth of July in America so they\u2019re gonna be shooting off fireworks. I\u2019m going to believe they\u2019re shooting them off for me and my four day sober chip to get me through today and hopefully tomorrow. Someone said it gets easier on day four. I feel like I could handle this so much better if xans didn\u2019t deprive you of sleep too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hjpjtu/my_last_dose_of_xanax/fwsynax/"}
