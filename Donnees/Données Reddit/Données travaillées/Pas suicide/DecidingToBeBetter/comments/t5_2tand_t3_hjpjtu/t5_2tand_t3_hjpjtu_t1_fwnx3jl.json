My heart truly goes out to you as an ex Xanax addict. Benzodiazepines are no joke and I\u2019m really glad to hear how you\u2019ve tapered, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that withdrawals can kill you but not many people talk about how miserable and difficult it is to quit even from a small dose. Where you\u2019re at you should be safe to fully cold turkey, from my experience the first 3 days were terrible, day 4 is the worst, then it\u2019s all up from there.\n\nThe problem with Xanax is it doesn\u2019t alleviate stress, it suppressed it. Shits gonna be emotional for a while. After the physical withdrawals your probably gonna have to face some mental demons that you\u2019ve been neglecting to go through because the drugs make it easy to ignore those feelings. So sorry to hear about the gf and the cat bro, that\u2019s a lot of shit to drop all at once. \n\nShoot me a message if you need some encouragement, someone to talk to, vent to, whatever. I\u2019ve been in that struggle bro you ain\u2019t alone.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hjpjtu/my_last_dose_of_xanax/fwnx3jl/"}
