I obviously am sad about that but HEY. Just like you, I've thought about the situation. My school will end in 2 months and I'll write my first exams in about a month. Even tho I am pretty bad in math I still have hope and I've decided to do my best. There is no reason to hold on these past not so productive weeks. Yeah, we've made some mistakes but hey, now we've seen that we still can change our perspective and hell yeah we're gonna get whatever we want. Wish you the best of luck!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g6i5ap/only_2_months_left_to_finish_college/fodq796/"}
