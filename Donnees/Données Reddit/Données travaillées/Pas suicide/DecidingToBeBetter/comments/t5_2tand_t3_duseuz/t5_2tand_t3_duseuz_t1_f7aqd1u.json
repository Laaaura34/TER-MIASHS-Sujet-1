Maybe even things that some people would laugh at. Like, *\"Your goal is to squat 10 kgs? I do 80 without even breaking a sweat\"* (just a random example with arbitrary numbers). Fuck those people. We all have to start somewhere.\n\n**The key is to remember that you're not competing with anyone. You're trying to be a better version of yourself.**\n\nIf you have never exercised before and today you walked 200m THAT'S PROGRESS! The important thing is you put on your running/walking shoes and showed up. That's half the battle.\n\nEven if you increased your distance by 5m everyday that's still progress. If you didn't have the time to do 200 and did just 100m, no worries. It's better than doing nothing at all.
