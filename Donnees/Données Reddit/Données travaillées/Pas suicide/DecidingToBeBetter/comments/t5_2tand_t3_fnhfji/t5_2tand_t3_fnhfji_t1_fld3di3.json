To decide my goals this year I had to look at them as trade-offs: for each one I complete well, another will suffer, so what are the goals that I will be extremely sad about if I don't get there. \"What do I absolutely want to achieve?\"  Anything that did not fit this category was something I can work towards but it will be sacrificed every time I have to make a choice what to work on.\n\nExample, I let \"get better at guitar\" off the list and \"make great videos\" on the list. Whenever I have time, I will always choose the videos and if and when I am done, I get to guitar. \n\nFor longer term goals, I think anything over 2 years you can't really plan well, you can set a direction but not really a clear goal. A clear goal is important because it needs to be measurable and achievable. If you don't know when you've achieved it you will get discouraged. So set some essential goals 1-3, break them down into actions you can take daily, and try to do something for those 3 things every single day.\n\nHope that answers your question  :))", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fnhfji/a_week_before_the_lockdowns_began_i_did_a_one/fld3di3/"}
