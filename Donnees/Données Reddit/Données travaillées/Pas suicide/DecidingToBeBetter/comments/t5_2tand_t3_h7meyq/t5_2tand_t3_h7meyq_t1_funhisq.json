I quit a lot of social media a couple of years ago but have been sucked back in due to lock down. It\u2019s just eating away at my life in a really negative way. I also spent the past 24 hours unsubscribing from negative subs that were draining my energy.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly hard to escape physical pain in positive ways, so you went down a dark hole in order to deal with it for a while. That\u2019s a totally legitimate route to take. At least you\u2019ve acknowledged that you want your life to be different from now on and that you need new strategies to cope with your emotions in hard times. It takes a lot of maturity, insight and self-reflection to be able to admit the things you don\u2019t really like about yourself. You need to take a moment to be proud of being able to make that shift and for feeling comfortable enough to share it. \n\n\nMy resolution for the rest of the year is to start building echo chambers of positivity, fun and joy too. We\u2019ll force the rest of the world to get on board with loving one and other wether they like it or not!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h7meyq/realising_internet_points_dont_matter_every/funhisq/"}
