So that\u2019s mental disorders along with substance abuse. I went to AA ( I never been a drinker ) for months. It\u2019s a great program. I had a great sponsor but we disagreed on a few things. He was a little older then me. He thought that any kind of anxiety med even Chantix the quit smoking med alters your mind and he was against me being basically on everything. He just didn\u2019t understand mental illness. We had a little circle. I was way to close to everyone to drop him as a sponsor ( gossip everywhere ) and I was sober and doing great so I just stopped going. To be honest a lot of days I would make up an excuse not to go to a meeting but once I went it was AMAZING. I was like this is my home. \n\nI have debilitating anxiety and depression but when I\u2019m on my meds I\u2019m all good. I take a few meds. \n\nThroughout the last few years I\u2019ve had my slips. My sponsor told me it took him 5 years to get one year sober. ( he used and didn\u2019t drink either ) \n\nWhat I\u2019m doing is making tomorrow ( Easter ) my sober day. I still take a supplement some would judge is an illegal drug called Kratom. \nIt helps me out a lot with anxiety. It\u2019s actually taken if your withdrawaling from opioids and helps. There\u2019s a lot of different strains. \n\nCompared to how I was and what I was abusing. Adderall, pain pills ( even snorted heroin ) I can take a powder a couple times a day to help my depression and anxiety I don\u2019t get high from it or anything. \n\nI was familiar with dry drunks. There was someone who attended the meetings and he was sober for like 16 years but he was a di*k. He defined it right there. \n\nI miss my meetings and I plan on going back maybe or therapy. I know how easy it is to have a slip. They say a slip is not a relapse. A relapse is going back to your old ways and a slip is just like a one night off ( few pills ) \nRegardless it\u2019s still really bad, I\u2019ve had quite a few of them. \n\nAs of tomorrow no slips nothing. I just started working out today. My dual diagnosis ( anxiety and depression makes shiz so hard to become motivated ) I\u2019m not throwing out a lazy card my psychiatrist knows that if I wasn\u2019t feeling unmotivated then I would be doing what I should. \n\nThere a medication called modafinal. Most people can take it responsibly but I can\u2019t. It sucks because it\u2019s great for depression and making someone alert but it is a lot safer then most stimulants. That\u2019s what I was slipping on. Next doctor appointment I\u2019m going to tell my doctor straight up doc I can\u2019t take these meds I like them too much. Don\u2019t prescribe them anymore. \n\nThey say insanity is doing something thinking you will have different results but the outcome is still the same. I\u2019ve tried like 5 times to take this medication thinking that I can take them as prescribed. Can\u2019t do it. Happens to the best of us. I really could use it for my daytime fatigue I sleep so much. Might be my night meds carrying over and part of my decision to do this is to figure out all that stuff. \n\nDamn I didn\u2019t mean to write an essay may bad. I hope your doing amazing!!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mj9xvc/3_years_ago_today_i_hit_rock_bottom_and_went_to/gtabbzv/"}
