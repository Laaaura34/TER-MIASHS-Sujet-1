Him getting up consistently early and helping to keep on top of prying me out of bed every day was the beginning. Then came the extra time and the ability to fill it with linking up with friends to go on walks and diet together. So, the key for me was to have a partner. Put it out there that you're looking for a friend to do an early morning walk three days a week with. You'll be obligated to get up for it. And I know this is easier said than done, but you have to use pure will power in some cases. You have to be honest with yourself. \"I know I could cancel and I want to but I CANT. \" and no further arguments! Put shit in your calendar the second you make a plan for something, and set a timer and alarm. That's what I can think of for now. If you have any more questions just ask! \n\nfind motivation buddy(ies), stick to your shit, be honest with yourself, GIVE YOURSELF GUILT FREE REST TIME thats soo important in adhering to a schedule successfully, and long term.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nm3ndp/my_best_friend_challenged_me_to_do_one_difficult/gzo7htc/"}
