Thank you for writing it. I just got out of a hole and I'm realizing now that I didn't get that low in one day (as my brain likes to think) it was a lot of habits I left (told myself it's okay if I skip today and one day went to a week). It's crazy how things multiply and you're not completely aware. Also, what you brought up about the one negative interaction causes you to think negative for the rest of your day is true. Thank you for saying the point about how peoples reactions has more to do with their feelings. That helped. I didn't think of that. I appreciate this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ab75ck/how_can_i_cleanse_myself/ed3zt2i/"}
