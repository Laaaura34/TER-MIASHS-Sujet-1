It's not a fun feeling at all.  \n\n\nA good start is to set small, ***reasonable*** goals for yourself.   \n\n\nFor example, I have wanted to be physically fit my entire life. In the past that translated into me going to the gym and feeling terrible that I wasn't as strong as other people there. That's not reasonable.  \n\n\nWhat I have learned to do since then is to just *go to the gym*. That was my only goal. It ended up being the perfect goal because once I was there I started working out and what do you know - I've gotten stronger and more fit.  \n\n\nOftentimes it's easy to look at everything you \"should\" be doing and how you \"should\" be doing it. But it's unreasonable. Give yourself time, give yourself credit for what you have/can accomplish, and start small.  \n\n\nMy family has a famous phrase we always repeat - \"How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.\" You can't expect yourself to swallow a whole elephant first thing. Give yourself time to take small bites and you'll realize how much you are accomplishing given time.  \n\n\nHope this helps!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ptl5om/whenever_i_want_to_do_anything_i_get_paralyzed_by/hdxshju/"}
