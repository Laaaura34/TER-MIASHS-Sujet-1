If my mind starts to drift off into something negative, I ask myself things related to my current activity or area. Some things I do to anchor myself to where I am is by asking myself \"Where am I?\", \"What colour is the wall?\", or \"What am I doing?\". That helps me get out of the funk.\n\nIn terms of achieving goals, I had a problem by always thinking far into the future. I never looked at what I had to do immediately (things like homework, classes, etc...), which resulted in me performing poorly at whatever I was studying. I haven't found a perfect way to get around this, but what helped me was to \"trust the process\". The process in this case may be your career for example. How do I get a career? I need masters degree. How do I get a masters degree? I need to pass my classes. How do I pass my classes? I study. My point is to look at things in a very small scale, and do things step by step. This way it satiates your result-oriented mindset with completing little tasks here and there. Though do note that this doesn't mean don't think about the future, just minimize the time spent on it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ptl5om/whenever_i_want_to_do_anything_i_get_paralyzed_by/hdxce8h/"}
