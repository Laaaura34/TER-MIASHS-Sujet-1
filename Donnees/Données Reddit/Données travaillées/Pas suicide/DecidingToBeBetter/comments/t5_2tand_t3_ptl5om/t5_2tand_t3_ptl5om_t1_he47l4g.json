My body finds it easier to react to irrational thoughts apparently. Like whenever I say \"Stop listening to those thoughts, everyone in here is focused on their workout, they dont care about you, be free and do the shit you gotta do\"  my body ignores it and reacts to the other irrational thoughts  that come to my mind instead., and then I start feeling worse while doing my workouts. But yeah, thanks for the advice. One thing at a time. I will keep repeating that to myself everytime.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ptl5om/whenever_i_want_to_do_anything_i_get_paralyzed_by/he47l4g/"}
