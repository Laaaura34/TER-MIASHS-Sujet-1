Dont know. Are you the only one in the world who's had this problem? Because that's all it is -  a problem. Who are you to decide that your life isnt worth living anymore or that you dont have anything left to give? Is this all the fight left in you? So if faced with a really tough situation you'd rather run away like a coward than face it? It takes a lot more courage and a lot more strength to persist than give up. So why don't you show that you're capable of it and beat the crap out of the pain in your mind. \n\nFace yourself in the mirror and tell him or her that you wont let him or her down again the way you did last night. Follow through. Even if you have another break down again someday, you do the same thing and repeat. YOU DO NOT GIVE UP!\n\nI say all of this through all of my own learnings. :/ Take care, friend.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ozwv9e/i_have_thought_of_getting_euthanized_last_night/h84m649/"}
