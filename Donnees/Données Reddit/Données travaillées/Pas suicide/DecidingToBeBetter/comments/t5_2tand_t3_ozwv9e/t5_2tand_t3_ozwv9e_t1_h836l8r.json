You can find lots of videos by people who are disabled or have chronic illness. For inspiration or just for knowing that you're not alone. A great youtuber is Jessica Kellgren-Fozard. She talks plainly and openly about challenges she's been through and her videos are very interesting and enjoyable.\n\nDon't give up.
