Your family is toxic af. I'm sorry if that's hard to hear. This sounds like a classic narcissist dynamic where you were the scapegoat and golden child brother could do no wrong. Also your parents should be happy to help you get on your feet(within reason) but they definitely shouldn't take shots at you to hurt your self esteem .

Good luck homie I'm here if you need me", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pzzxzb/from_mid20s_unemployed_loser_to_successful_late/hf5r58t/"}
