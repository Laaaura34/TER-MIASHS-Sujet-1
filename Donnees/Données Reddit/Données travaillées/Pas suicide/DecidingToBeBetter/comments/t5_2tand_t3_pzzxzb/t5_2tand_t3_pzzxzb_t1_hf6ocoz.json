I am aware of this.  \n  \nBruh.... nobody asks to be born. You're your parent's responsibility. You owe them nothing. Fuck that mentality. You owe it to yourself to get out of them as much as you can.  \nI'm in a similar situation. I've been going through a deep rooted depression since losing all my savings at twenty and basically just losing my life. I've been working as a waiter for the last 5 years and really just doing the bare minimum to get by. Now at twenty-six I'm gonna be starting a new job later this month. It's been a tough few years, but hopefully I can ride this job and save up enough to move the fuck away from here real soon.   \n  \nFuck your family! I only wish you'd milked them for all they had, if that's the way they treat ANYBODY let alone their own son/sibling.  \nCongratulations! I'M PROUD OF YOU!  \nBest of luck, man!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pzzxzb/from_mid20s_unemployed_loser_to_successful_late/hf6ocoz/"}
