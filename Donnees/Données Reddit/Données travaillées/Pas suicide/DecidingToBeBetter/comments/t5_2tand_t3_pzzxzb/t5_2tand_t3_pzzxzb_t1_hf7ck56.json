Expel all negative feelings and thoughts from your mind and feelings.  \n\n\nGet yourself in a state of positive energy and avoid anxiety and stress.  \n\n\nThere are times when you may feel overwhelmed while learning, but that's okay, that's everyone. Don't try to overexert yourself while learning, but do discipline yourself to keep at it and program everyday.  \n\n\nYou may have to take crappy low - 0 paying gigs when you try to get work at the beginning,   but it all come to an end. Once get your that first employment contract, the rest becomes easier.  \n\n\nSome people have said it took them no more than 6 months, from learning programming to full time employment, others say 3 months, others one year, and others is more or less two years.  \n\n\nFor me it was almost 2 years.   \n\n\nGood luck.
