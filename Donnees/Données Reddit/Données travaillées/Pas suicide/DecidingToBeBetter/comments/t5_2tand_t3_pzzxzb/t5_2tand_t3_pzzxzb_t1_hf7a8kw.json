Started with android development(Java), then went on to learn web dev(html, css, javascript, mysql). I picked up php and laravel during a gig. Picked up scss as well, just for learning purposes.\n\nGot the android dev internship later on. After that, there was a short break in between in the end of my internship and my first fulltime employment. Between that break I started learning reactjs, because I wanted a frontend(react position).\n\nSoon landed a php developer position at the medium sized company, and now I've gone on to work fulltime/permanent as frontend(react) developer at another company. Exactly what I wanted.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pzzxzb/from_mid20s_unemployed_loser_to_successful_late/hf7a8kw/"}
