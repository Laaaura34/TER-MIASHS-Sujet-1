I graduated on 2017 as an industrial engineer, but I feel like I don't know anything about my career. I worked for an industry 6 months and it sucked, I hated it because 8 hours working plus 2 hours from my house to work (and 2:30 hours from work to house because traffic), also they paid me like 350$ a month. After those 6 months, and because of the pandemic, I began working with my father in his business just to be treated as sh*t and found out that my father cheates on my mother, so I have been unemployed for a month. My dream is to put an ecommerce of streetwear, but I'm horrified to try it and fail. I don't know what to do. I'm 25 now, I feel depressed, and I feel myself unable to concentrate on anything. I just wish to earn money so I can get out of my house, but jobs on my country are so bad. If you could give me any advice I would appreciate it a lot, I really don't know what to do.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pzzxzb/from_mid20s_unemployed_loser_to_successful_late/hf6saae/"}
