Congrats on your achievement! It really is inspirational, and I hope I can someday achieve the same success in building myself up. It's a very small work in progress for me right now.\n\nAlso fuck your family! I hope you move into a nice area far away from them, I'm disgusted by how they've treated you honestly. I hope you find peace surrounded by people that don't consistently put you down to make them feel better about themselves.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pzzxzb/from_mid20s_unemployed_loser_to_successful_late/hf6tcd3/"}
