I call the negative mindset you described \"detrimental perfectionism\" lol. The sort of thing where it's like \"if I can't do it perfectly it's not worth doing at all\", and so nothing ever gets done at all because aiming for perfection will forever be an exercise in futility.\n\nSaving this post because it's very motivating and reminds me that even doing just a little is worlds better than doing nothing at all. Sometimes I still fall back into these periods of all-or-nothing mentality and it drives me insane lol \ud83d\ude05", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nzma0o/chipping_away_at_allornothing_mentality/h1qwvuc/"}
