I had a similar realization, so I will try to clean up for \u201c10 seconds\u201d (really just a couple minutes) because I tend to leave things scattered. So before I move on the the next task I take a beat and clean/organize.\n\nYes, I stated a full time job and at the end of the day I am very tired. I had wanted to do a whole fitness revamp but I\u2019m not able to right now. However sitting on the couch all evening makes me feel not good. I started to go for short walks when I get home, even though I feel tired by the end I\u2019m wide awake. This is where discipline comes in.
