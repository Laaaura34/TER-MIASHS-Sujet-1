Like with sleeping, if I can expect I won't sleep my full 8h I'm like well fuck that and stay awake way longer so I will have ~3-4h sleep, or if I would leave a minute to late for work, I'm like well fuck that (obviously I still go there, just like an hour later lol) etc. \nBut I will definitely try the 1 Minute timer if I don't feel motivated for such reason, thanks", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nzma0o/chipping_away_at_allornothing_mentality/h1rrht1/"}
