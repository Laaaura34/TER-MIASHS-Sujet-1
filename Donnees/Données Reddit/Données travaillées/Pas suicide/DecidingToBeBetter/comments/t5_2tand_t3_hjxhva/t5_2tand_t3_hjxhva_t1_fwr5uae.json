I haven\u2019t had a persistent streak of doing it for multiple weeks in a row - but I\u2019ll buy a puff bar and rip it for a few days and then immediately miss it once it\u2019s gone. I still really like doing it but don\u2019t let myself have them that often. I\u2019ve tried to preserve them for occasions only. \n\nThe most annoying part is the association that I\u2019ve made to wanting a nicotine rip after a full meal or after a few beers. Whenever the craving gets real bad - it feels like the moment just isn\u2019t complete. Shit is crazy. How can I hate it and love it at the same time?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hjxhva/been_able_to_stay_away_from_nicotine_for_10_days/fwr5uae/"}
