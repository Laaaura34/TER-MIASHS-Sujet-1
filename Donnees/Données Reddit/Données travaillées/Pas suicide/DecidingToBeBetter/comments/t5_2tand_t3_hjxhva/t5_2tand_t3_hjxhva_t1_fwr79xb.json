Looks like you are on your way to getting a healthier body and a happier mind! Keep it up!\n\nI have quit smoking about 5 years ago and I am soooo happy I did. The first 2 weeks were some of the absolute worse of my life - terrible anxiety, mood swings, depression, broken sleep... Truly felt like a zombie. Eventually, the intensity of these symptoms starts fading and you start feeling better. I knew I was \"cured\" when I noticed I was able to be around smokers without craving a cigarette. \\[Kudos to my partner, for helping me to be strong and not give up and for putting up with me during that period.\\]\n\nWell done!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hjxhva/been_able_to_stay_away_from_nicotine_for_10_days/fwr79xb/"}
