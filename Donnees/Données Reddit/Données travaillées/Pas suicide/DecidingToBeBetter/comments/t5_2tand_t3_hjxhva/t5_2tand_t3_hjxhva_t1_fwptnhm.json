I take the time to try to think about nothing (focusing on the air coming in and out of your nose if that helps). By the time my alarm goes off I\u2019ve pretty much forgotten about the craving and feel much more relaxed afterwards. Kind of a distraction but after I get the good feeling from a bit of meditation it kind of helps me accept that I don\u2019t need the nicotine in order to feel good.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hjxhva/been_able_to_stay_away_from_nicotine_for_10_days/fwptnhm/"}
