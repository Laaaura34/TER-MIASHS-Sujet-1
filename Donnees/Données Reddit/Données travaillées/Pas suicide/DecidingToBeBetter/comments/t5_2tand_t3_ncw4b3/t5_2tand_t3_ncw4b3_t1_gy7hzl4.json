It just feels like less effort (less mess and steps), and it's better than letting things build up. \n\n\n\n\nI reccomend a steel tongue scraper too, they're cheap, last long (forever?), and also low effort. It's easier than brushing your tongue because of surface area and scraping gets more of that nasty stuff out in just a few swipes. \n\n\n\n\n\nThose floss toothpicks make flossing much easier too. Low effort. Make life easy for yourself. If you still can't do something then make it even easier, take a smaller step.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ncw4b3/i_have_brushed_my_teeth_every_night_and_morning/gy7hzl4/"}
