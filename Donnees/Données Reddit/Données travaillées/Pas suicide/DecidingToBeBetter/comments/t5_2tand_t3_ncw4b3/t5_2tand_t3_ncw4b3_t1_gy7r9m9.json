Not everyone has this habit down especially if it wasnt instilled into you as a young kid. \n\nIm also working on flossing and brushing my teeth nightly before bed! I bought myself a nice electronic toothbrush as motivation.\n\nI work w many older adults who have dental problems. It is painful, cant eat, and expensive as Medicare (I'm in the US) typically does not cover dental care.\n\nGreat job and keep it going. \ud83d\ude0a", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ncw4b3/i_have_brushed_my_teeth_every_night_and_morning/gy7r9m9/"}
