Trust me, not everyone brushes their teeth! Be proud. I\u2019m proud of you that you have made this great change. Check out the ADHA website for technique tips to make sure you are doing it properly and I recommend trying to work in flossing with floss pics whike reddit reading or watching TV next. Just stash some near your comfy chair/bed and make it a rule that if you haven\u2019t flossed yet, you have to while vegging out. This new healthy habit will likely save you tens of thousands in dental work over a lifetime. Great job!!!       \nAlso, anyone struggling with bedtime brushing: try brushing right after dinner. Yes, brushing right before bed is best, let\u2019s say that is getting an \u2018A\u2019. But brushing after dinner is like getting a C. Everyone prefers an A, but a C is a passing grade at least and waaay better than an F for not brushing at all. And you can always brush again at bedtime if you remember. Try setting an alarm for five minutes before bedtime too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ncw4b3/i_have_brushed_my_teeth_every_night_and_morning/gy8uhrm/"}
