Doesn't sound like this was in any way an easy situation, so it's all the more impressive that you achieved this. You should be so proud - not only of the grades, but also for deciding to get therapy :) reading your story is such an inspiration to me, as I'm in uni as well. \n\nHope that things continue bettering themselves for you!
