Even more thanks for demonstrating resilience! Good luck!\n\nThank you (: One piece of advice that has stuck with me is \"Be kind to yourself\". I know I was able to get As despite my hardships and am very happy about that. Everything else in my life wasn't going right so I decided at least I had control over my grades. On the other hand, I know some other people would have taken a break or might not be doing as well. And that is understandable. Going through tough situations is part of life and we are human. My point is that you should not beat yourself up much especially if you have gone through a lot. Be kind to yourself and do not be afraid to reach out for help. Anyways good luck to you as well (:", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k8rmza/after_some_major_life_events_i_still_passed_all/gf2nvhx/"}
