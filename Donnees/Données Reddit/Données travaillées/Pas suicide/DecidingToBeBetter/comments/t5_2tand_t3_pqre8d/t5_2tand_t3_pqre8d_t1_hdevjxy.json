I messed up the past eleven years of my life. I wouldn't take it back because I am where I am now. I know what not to do. If I could go back to twenty-one years old I would change one thing. I would meditate everyday to not worry so much about what other people think. If you're worried about what to do in the future, is this because you are afraid of what other people will think about your career path? Have you taken a career quiz? Those are fun, totally didn't get my anywhere. But it did get my brain jogging. I ended up filling making an Indeed and other job searching sites. I applied to jobs that I wasn't qualified for. I got put in so many scenarios that I was sweating from my hands because I was so nervous. Apply to the jobs that you want to do. Do the interviews despite of the outcome. Talk to people that actually have those jobs. Ask them what it's like to do that everyday.
