They open in my presence and everything that is inside is now getting out. All the love and positive emotions, but also all the crap and negative ones. So I function as a personal can-opener. What you have inside will be coming out. They're usually not ready for it and feel uncomfortable later, because they had no idea what they had inside. It's a bit lonely place, because most will then put a distance between us: they don't want to lose control again over the image they've created of their identity. But those few people that own their shit will be the deepest friendships ever.\n\nSo yeah, I too show people who they are.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/psrq7t/should_i_drink_the_spiritual_koolaid/hdtd7wu/"}
