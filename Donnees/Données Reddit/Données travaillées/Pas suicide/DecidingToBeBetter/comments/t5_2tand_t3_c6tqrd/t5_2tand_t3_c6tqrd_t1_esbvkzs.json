Make a list of things you want in your life, or ways you want to change. Then re-write the list as if you have it all. For example: if you want more confidence, you can write \u201cI am confident\u201d as your affirmation. If you want to overcome fear and doubt, you can write \u201cI am brave\u201d. If you are struggling with issues in your past, or worrying about the future, you could write \u201cI am in control of my life.\u201d Or \u201cI cannot change the past, but I can control my future.\u201d \n\nI hope this helps! You are amazing! And you can do anything you set your mind to!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/c6tqrd/nothing_original_to_say_but_ive_been_a_little/esbvkzs/"}
