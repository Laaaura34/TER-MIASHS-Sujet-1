After you have made your list of affirmations, repeat them to yourself every morning when you wake up. It will help you to get into a positive mindset. Another tip, think of a task you can complete first thing in the morning, and wake up determined to do it. This can increase your productivity throughout the day. Or find a task you DONT want to do. Making yourself do something you don\u2019t want to do will make the rest of your day seem a little easier. A cold shower for 3-5 minutes works wonders for me in the morning. I never want to do it, but I always feel so much better once I just jump in and get it done.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/c6tqrd/nothing_original_to_say_but_ive_been_a_little/esccnco/"}
