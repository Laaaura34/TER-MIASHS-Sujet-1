To be honest, no one can decide it for you. And, to be honest, your whole path in life will be more like an experimental roller-coaster instead of a straight path. Personally, it took me years of trying \"this and that\", to finally figure out where I feel comfortable and finally get some direction.\n\nExplore, volunteer? Think about your preferences, have in mind your best abilities and what brings out the best for you. Try different options, just be open-minded. And if you finally settle on something, but after a while it starts to feel all wrong again... Don't be afraid to re-consider things and make change.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fuwslj/deciding_which_path_to_take_in_life_after_leaving/fmgx12u/"}
