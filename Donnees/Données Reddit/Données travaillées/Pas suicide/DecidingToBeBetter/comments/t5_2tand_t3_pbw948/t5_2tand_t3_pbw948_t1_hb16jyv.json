My friends studying Medicine look pretty fine from the outside, and those people who have doctors as parents are rich enough to afford overseas education, big houses, you know the rest. It feels cruel of life to pull the rug under me just when I was about to taste success, by fucking up my final exams and essentially making me unwanted from medical schools because of my grade. \n\nLook, I still don\u2019t know, what free things in life are great? Like I said, I don\u2019t have much money on hand right now, and all the low-cost things I\u2019m doing don\u2019t give me any enjoyment at all. I don\u2019t want to impress anybody with the money, it\u2019s mainly for myself and the comfort money provides. \n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do since when I say I can\u2019t find my passion no matter how hard I try the general answer I get is to \u201ctry harder\u201d. \n\nAnd yeah my previous group of friends left me for being too negative. I don\u2019t have enough money to find a therapist to vent to, so I turn to them hoping to make me less miserable. Once again, money is needed for happiness here.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pbw948/i_set_an_ultimatum_for_myself_here_goes_nothing/hb16jyv/"}
