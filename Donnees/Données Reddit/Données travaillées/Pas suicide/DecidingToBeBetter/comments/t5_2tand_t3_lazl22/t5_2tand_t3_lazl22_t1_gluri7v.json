Everyone's entitled to their opinion but I personally think masturbation is perfectly healthy and it seems to me you're looking for scientific evidence to fuel your confirmation bias. \n\nI really think parental and religious repression of sexuality and the resulting guilt, shame and anger are more unhealthy than accepting and embracing your sexuality, (including if you're asexual embracing that of course). Do you think your performance issues could be rooted in sexual shame introjected from your parents? \n\nI'm sorry I know these are difficult questions and it's up to you if you want to address them. That's just the impressions I got from how you wrote and my experience studying subjects like this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lazl22/25m_finally_kicking_my_worst_habit_to_the_curb_so/gluri7v/"}
