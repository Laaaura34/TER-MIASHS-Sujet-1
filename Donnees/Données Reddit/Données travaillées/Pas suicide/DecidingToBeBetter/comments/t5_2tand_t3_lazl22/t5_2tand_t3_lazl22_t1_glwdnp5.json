If you can I'd recommend getting into therapy for the addiction component. My armchair analysis (by a stranger on the internet mind you) is that your feelings of guilt and shame are driving some of the addictive behavior (\"I think of myself as a sinner so I might as well indulge that.\") A healthy state would be to masturbate without feeling guilt or any feelings other than pleasure and release. But I'm full aware that's easier said than done hence where therapy can help to disconnect your negative self image associated with masturbation.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lazl22/25m_finally_kicking_my_worst_habit_to_the_curb_so/glwdnp5/"}
