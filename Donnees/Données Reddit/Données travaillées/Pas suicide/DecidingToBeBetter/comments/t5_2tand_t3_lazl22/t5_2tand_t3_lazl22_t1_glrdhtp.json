I've had similar issues with not finishing due to medications I've been on. The feeling my boyfriend got when he'd try to get me off for so long with no success is not anything I ever want to put someone through, but you have to make sure they know it's nothing to do with them, it's you. It still feels shitty for both ends but if you can work together on it, and both look for ways to help your situation, I think it has the potential to make you stronger as a couple as well. I'm off my medication now and sex is almost normal for me, but if it weren't for the times when we struggled to have a good time, I don't think my bf and I would be nearly as close and open as we are now. You can do this, but remember that you're not in it alone. Best of luck bud", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lazl22/25m_finally_kicking_my_worst_habit_to_the_curb_so/glrdhtp/"}
