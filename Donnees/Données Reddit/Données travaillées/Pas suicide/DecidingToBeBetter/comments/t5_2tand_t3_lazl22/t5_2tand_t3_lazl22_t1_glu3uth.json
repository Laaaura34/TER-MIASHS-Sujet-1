You don\u2019t need to shame yourself into success, it can be counterproductive, and make things harder.\n\nBased on your original post, and how you explained yourself OP, I think you have a fantastic mentality. You want to do this for the right reasons, and you\u2019re thinking about a happy future where you don\u2019t have this problem anymore, and that day WILL come eventually.\n\nAll you need to do is take it one day at a time, and if you do fall off, just get back on right away.
