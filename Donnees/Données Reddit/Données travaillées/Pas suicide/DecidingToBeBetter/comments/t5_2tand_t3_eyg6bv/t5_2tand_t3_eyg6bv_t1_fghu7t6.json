That kind of led to me bottling up my emotions and when I felt like I was about to explode I would release the pent up feelings through cutting.  The best thing that I can recommend is to reach out to the people you know who may self harm and hang out. Something as simple as grabbing a coffee with someone who is self harming and talking about how life\u2019s treating them is a perfect distraction from bad thoughts. And if they are close enough to you they may confide in you about why they do what they do. Once you know the root it\u2019s easier to know what to do to help them. However it definitely isn\u2019t your responsibility to be a counselor and constantly remind them how bad what they\u2019re doing is. Chances are they already know self harming is bad and they just need somebody to talk to.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/eyg6bv/self_harm_free_for_6_months/fghu7t6/"}
