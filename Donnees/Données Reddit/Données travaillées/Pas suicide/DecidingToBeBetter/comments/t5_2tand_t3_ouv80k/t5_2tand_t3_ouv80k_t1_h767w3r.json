Metropolitan city with lots of opportunity. Amazing public transportation (by US standards).\n\nFor instance:\nI pay $650 in rent and utilities and live in a pretty cool part of town with quick access to the blue line. That opens up a large part of the city for me to be able to access for jobs with a less than 30 minute commute.\n\nAdditionally, Divvy makes things SO cheap. $108 ANNUAL membership and you get essentially unlimited free or nearly free rides around the city. Imagine not having to pay gas, insurance, or repairs for a vehicle and instead payed $9/month +the $2 for occasional CTA rides.\n\nAldi's and other reasonable priced groceries stores are around.\n\nLow cost of living for the opportunities that exist and the transportation network that exists to access them.\n\nIt feels kind of like cheating to pay this little and have access to so much. It's so easy to cut down expenses and after just a year or two you grt to check out a cool city and save a shit ton of cash just by reducing costs, not including the extra you can gain from the available opportunities.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ouv80k/update_i_will_not_be_homeless/h767w3r/"}
