It's gentrifying but if you shop around you can find places around those prices. My place is quite small but my roommates are easy to get along with, so It's an alright setup for the next year while I get my shit together.\n\nJust start doing some research for places on craigslist and reddit. That's how I did it. I only moved here a few months ago and I found my place for the price I mentioned in the previous comment.\n\nWhat I like about here is that there's tons of short term leases that people want covered. So it's easy to finish someone's lease for 2-3 months, explore the area and then commit to a full year-long one after you've figured things out.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ouv80k/update_i_will_not_be_homeless/h799kzh/"}
