As someone mentioned before. He'll be old news eventually. If he's professional, and focused like I was, this will speed things up. If he enjoys the attention however, then it might take considerably longer.\n\nI usually did my job, and never hung around for too long after work. And they realised I wasn't shitting where I was eating. And some of those girls became negative attention seekers as a result. Wasn't fun anymore then. Glad I got away.\n\nEDIT: If you are worried about being skinny, you can start powerlifting. You'll quickly grow with a simple 5x5 program, focusing on progressive overload. Check out: Starting Strength, Alan Thrall, Barbell Brigade etc. on Youtube.\n\nEDIT2: Also, looks are overrated. Be kind, and be yourself. We all age. And what is left then? Don't put people on a pedestal, and realise we are all human. Vulnerable, and insecure about something. Every. Single.
