First thing first You aren't ugly! I believe in you! I know, I'm only some stranger on the internet but I was through a lot of hard and really depressing times, I have a lot of scars on my back but I manage to come where I'm today and you can too! I believe in you brother! You aren't ugly! just you aren't in your best form you must improve yourself every day, I won't lie to you, a year back I was questioning myself if I'm good enough to be an average guy, and you know what? now I love my self how I'm build and how I look, My advice for you is first to stop fapping and watching porn go on r/NoFap to find out why is fapping and porn mankiller,  second start working out, harder workout better,  find your self a passion, something that will keep you up in nights and will give new challenges every day,  get your self a beard and \"not average\" and everyday haircut, get a bear and haircut as you want and don't give a mashed shit what others think about you, and most importantly learn to love your self, then you will be able to attract other people with positive vibe and amazing personality but it takes a long time to get but you will no matter what :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jgpk3a/how_do_you_get_over_being_ugly/g9so8dl/"}
