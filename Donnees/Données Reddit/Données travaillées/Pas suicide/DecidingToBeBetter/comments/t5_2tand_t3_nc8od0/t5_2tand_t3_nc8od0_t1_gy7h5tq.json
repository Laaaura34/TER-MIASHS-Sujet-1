I have been battling leaving my previous workplace and met some cool people in the company that just became distant with me. We hung out after work and shared a lot of our personal lives together. I realized it's not always a good idea to share so much with your colleagues, but they seem to be trustworthy people. \n\nEventually, they just started ignoring me and not responding to my messages and everyone in the group chat just stopped talking to each other altogether.
