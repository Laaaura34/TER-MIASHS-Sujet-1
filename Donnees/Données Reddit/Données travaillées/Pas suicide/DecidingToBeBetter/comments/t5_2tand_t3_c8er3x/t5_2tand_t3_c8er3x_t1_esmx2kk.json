I am still in the process but it seems like there are always so many helpful books. Especially this one \" Open Her: Activate 7 Masculine Powers to Arouse Your Woman's Love & Desire \" seemed to me (judging at least from the title) one of the very few books about heterosexual relationships without any misogynist or sexist tendencies (as you said the ones about seduction seem to be very manipulative). Curious to get into the other books too!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/c8er3x/im_not_an_emotionally_shallow_asshole_anymore/esmx2kk/"}
