I had actually told her about a few dates I went on and she told me she didn't want to hear about it and asked why I didn't take her seriously as a potential date to which I responded that she straight told me that she's looking to be on a dating show. She said she is but she's still looking for a serious relationship, which is why I suggested grabbing a drink last Friday. \n\nShe was the way that she was because she already had plans and was trying to squeeze me in but wanted to make sure I knew she was going to leave early (which she didn't).\n\nFunny enough, by the end of the first date I did a few videos with her and she said she thinks it's because of me that she's made it to the final round of applicants. \n\nI also have a lot of platonic women friends and considering 50% of the population is female I don't see why I should limit myself to being only friends with people of my own gender. I feel like doing that would mean I miss out on a lot of great friendships. Not every attractive guy needs to try and fuck every attractive lady. \n\nYou made a lot of assumptions based on a very brief summary of events.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/c8er3x/im_not_an_emotionally_shallow_asshole_anymore/esnvv3q/"}
