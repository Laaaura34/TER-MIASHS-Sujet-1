A lot of people here saying they're proud of you and that's cool... I don't know if pride is quite the right word for me though - since I don't know you. But, reading this, I certainly feel in awe of what you did - initially in recognising the need for change, then in planning and executing the escape. and then what you've been able to achieve since. It's inspiring and incredible and I hope you continue to live your best life and grow into it all the more, making it happier as you go.
