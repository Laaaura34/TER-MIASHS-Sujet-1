I was lucky enough to start using [journey.cloud](https://journey.cloud) four years ago, so I have a really good record of the entire situation leading up to my decision, with the added bonus of the memories feature (throwback entries from this time *x* years ago). It's been my therapist at times, and more than once I've only come to a decision or realisation once I wrote out my feelings. Best money I've spent online by a longshot, even though there's a free option.\n\nI have a lot of trouble enjoying success - any achievement feels more like the new ground level I have to work up from, if that makes sense. Writing this and more importantly, reading comments like yours, actually helped me realise I'm in a far better place (in more than one sense!) than last year, five years and ten years ago.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/plcij9/moved_1000km_away_changed_career_escaped_toxic/hcmpp4p/"}
