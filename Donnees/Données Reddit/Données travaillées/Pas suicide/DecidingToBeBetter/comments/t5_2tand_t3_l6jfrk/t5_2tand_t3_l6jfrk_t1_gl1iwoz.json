So much to do, but in what order? Now the oven's burning!  \n\n\nBut with a directed important goal to arrange your day, time and thoughts around, it's like grabbing something at the center of all that junk and lifting it in the air and finding out it's actually an elaborately balanced crib-mobile and all the parts find their natural place.\n\nHyper-focus on training for your first marathon 10 months from now and a 10k for mid-March. Find something that you KNOW would change how you feel about yourself. Choose it. Stand up and bellow and thump your chest and declare to yourself, the universe and any nearby witness within earshot, \"I CAN DO THIS!\"  \n\n\nAnd watch how with a goal, with a plan to work towards it first thing everyday, the little negative voice calms down a little. \n\nAn ambitious exercise decision like this really saved me from a horrendously painful rut. And I hope it might work for you.  \n\n\nHelped my racing mind. Helped my negative thoughts. Helped me feel proud of one little thing each day. Helped me feel motivated and competent to tackle the other things.  \n\n\nBe well brother.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l6jfrk/i_want_to_be_a_better_dad_but_i_cant_get_out_of/gl1iwoz/"}
