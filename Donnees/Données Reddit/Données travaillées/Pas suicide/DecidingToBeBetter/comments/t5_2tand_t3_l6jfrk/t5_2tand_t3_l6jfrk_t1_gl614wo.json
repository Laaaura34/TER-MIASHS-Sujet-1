Okay, I'm going to spend the next five minutes cleaning, then I can go do something I want to do for x amount of time.   Or \"i'm just going to clear off the kitchen table, then I can go watch one episode of my tv show\".     \n\n\nWhen I misplace something, I find that when I am focused on finding it, I can't.  When I focus my mind on something else, then it usually turns up.   I will allow myself a certain amount of time to look for the item, then I make myself take some deep breaths and focus on something else.  If I can't, then I go do something physical.   I'm telling you, burning off that anxious energy helps so much.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l6jfrk/i_want_to_be_a_better_dad_but_i_cant_get_out_of/gl614wo/"}
