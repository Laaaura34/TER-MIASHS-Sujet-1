Not literally, but I\u2019m pretty heavily tattooed and have a resting aggressive face, and I\u2019m a somewhat imposing figure if you don\u2019t know me. I also don\u2019t care for small talk or idle chit chat which puts people off as well so maybe I can help. \n\nAt work I\u2019m often focused, and don\u2019t really like interruptions, especially if it\u2019s not related to my task. As said earlier in the thread, asking for professional opinion is good as it doesn\u2019t seem forced- it opens up the door to a conversation.\n\nWhile there maybe feel out interested so that you might have something in common or a talking point. \n\nI can\u2019t tell you the number of people who don\u2019t talk to me because they think I\u2019m not going to be open to it. A lot of intimidating looking people look that way because it\u2019s a barrier- a safety blanket to protect themselves because they are sensitive!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bitm3h/having_a_hard_time_acknowledging_an_intimidating/em30u87/"}
