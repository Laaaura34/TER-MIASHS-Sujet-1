I have to ignore a piece of me every time I try to connect with people.\n\nI have to ignore the screaming desire in my mind to find out what's wrong with them that they'd talk to me.  To find out how they're just trying to use me.  To see what their alterior motive is.  To play out a thousand scenarios that all end up being bad.  To use these stories as excuses to not interact, to not open up, to not connect.  \n\nI'm getting better at it, but it's taken many many years of hard work.
