What a blessing that your able to be sober.  Unfortunately that opens you to a whole new set of challenges.   Basic ideas - 1.  give this girl space - it is not this girl's job to take care of your emotional safety and self-worth -- that's your job.   2.  Get a support network - some friends or peers with observably healthy relationships- at least two but preferably five - so you can talk to them instead of asking randos on Reddit.  3.  Ignorance is your enemy - If you don't know what a healthy adult relationship is supposed to be then take some of your free time away from this girl to educate yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/idxrnv/ive_recently_tried_to_open_myself_up_to_dating/g2dp3p4/"}
