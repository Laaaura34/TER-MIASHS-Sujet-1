LDRs are difficult, as they test communication skills and trust very early on, but they can work out! I can honestly say that even though we\u2019re hundreds of miles apart, I\u2019ve never been happier. We started dating (were friends first for a while) just as the pandemic was starting to creep into the US.\n\nAnd maybe this is just me, but like. Relationships are nice and fun (and hard work, but i digress), but being in a relationship at all times isn\u2019t necessary. Taking this lockdown to work on yourself is, imo, smart. You have a whole break from people to sit and reflect on where you are and where you\u2019re going. To me, that\u2019s an opportunity. \n\nBut wanting to date in the traditional manner and not being able to is pretty awful, so I feel for everybody trying to find a partner right now. <3", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/idxrnv/ive_recently_tried_to_open_myself_up_to_dating/g2db2x5/"}
