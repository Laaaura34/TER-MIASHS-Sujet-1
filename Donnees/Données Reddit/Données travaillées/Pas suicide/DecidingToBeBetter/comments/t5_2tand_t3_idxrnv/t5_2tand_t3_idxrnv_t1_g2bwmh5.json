It takes a long time to get to know good friends and we don't intentionally seek them. Some people just turn into close friends over time. We should do the same with relationships. Intentionally meeting people to see if they're a fit for a long-term relationship is a bit like randomly trying to get a puzzle done and randomly trying one piece after another.\n\nWhat I'm saying is: At some point you will randomly meet someone with whom it'll work. Trying to find someone intentionally only leads to disappointment and unhappiness, because you're extremely unlikely to find someone that way.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/idxrnv/ive_recently_tried_to_open_myself_up_to_dating/g2bwmh5/"}
