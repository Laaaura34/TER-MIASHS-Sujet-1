I was in university before all this stuff started and the entire time (between community college and university and screwing up a lot, something like six or seven years) never really got involved with people. Right near the end of my run at university, I started hanging out with coworkers because it was a really relaxed working environment, but that was only at the workplace, we didn't hang out outside of it.\n\nI've been told that school is when you'll be the most social. Well. I'm fucked.\n\nEr, I forgot to get to my point. Naturally meeting and getting involved with people is wonderful and does work a lot better than intentionally going out to meet people, for social or romantic reasons. But some people just can't. Either they're isolated from the communities so they can't justify going there without something already lined up, or they're like me and just don't really feel comfortable doing group activities.\n\nSometimes the find-a-friend or meet-a-mate things are the best you have.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/idxrnv/ive_recently_tried_to_open_myself_up_to_dating/g2cpspj/"}
