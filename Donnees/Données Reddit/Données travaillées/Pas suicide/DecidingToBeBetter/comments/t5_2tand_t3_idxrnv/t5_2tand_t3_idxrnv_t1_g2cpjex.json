I had had a bad run of abusive relationships,  so i didn't trust my own judgment. I was worried that if i liked a girl, it was because she was secretly crazy and i was drawn to it subconsciously.  \n\nMy gf now has been with me on and off for 7 years now. We have a child together.  But i really screwed up in the beginning.. i couldn't fully commit to the relationship. Too much self doubt, and also i was still using. We had a lot of ups and downs, and breakups. \n\nToss up between waiting until you are 'ready' or just going for it when you meet someone you like. But def don't string them along if you can't decide...not fair to them.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/idxrnv/ive_recently_tried_to_open_myself_up_to_dating/g2cpjex/"}
