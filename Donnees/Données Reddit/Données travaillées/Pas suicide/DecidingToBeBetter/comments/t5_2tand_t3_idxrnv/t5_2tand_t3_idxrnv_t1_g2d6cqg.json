I\u2019m a year and a half in on my sobriety. I took the suggestion not to date for a year seriously too, but now here I am, and... I have no idea what I\u2019m doing, no idea what to do. Someone asked me when I was first in rehab what my idea of a perfect first date is, and I had to think a moment and realize I genuinely didn\u2019t know anymore. I could tell them what it used to be, hanging out in a parking lot somewhere, talking, listening to music, getting high and maybe hooking up. I realized that my addiction was so pervasive that it\u2019d become my personality, and without it I wasn\u2019t sure who I was or what I wanted. Now I\u2019m a year and a half in and my general feeling of un-readiness has turned into an anxious tummy. I, too, realized how the self-centered-ness of who I used to be manifested in relationships and I how my priorities had been so self serving in the last few years. I even went to a few codependent anonymous meetings (CODA) and they opened my eyes to a whole new landscape of character issues I didn\u2019t realize I was carrying. Which was terrifying. Like finding a new door in your house you\u2019ve never noticed before, and you crack the door open and take a peek inside and... it\u2019s a mess, like a bomb went off. And you think, ohhhh fuck me. This is new stuff I have to deal with. A year into sobriety and I feel really good about my progress and oop, ohhh uh oh, here we go, starting from the bottom again. That said, I really, REALLY enjoyed the CODA meetings and I\u2019d highly recommend them, I only stopped going because of covid. \n\nBut it doesn\u2019t change the fact that I feel like I have no idea how to date now. Where do you go? What do you do? I don\u2019t mind bars either but exactly like you said, it can be a little weird for the other people when you\u2019re not drinking, especially if it\u2019s one on one. Genuinely, I do not know. The other day my dad and I, talking about girls, kind of made a lighthearted comment about how I\u2019m 25 now and getting older and I thought YA THANKS DAD I\u2019M VERY AWARE. What\u2019s the answer? I haven\u2019t got a clue, unfortunately. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be in this in-between-place forever, I have hope it\u2019ll turn out. Just uh.. not sure how the middle steps will look on the way from here to the goal. But I\u2019ll figure them out, I\u2019m confident. \n\nDo let us know if you make some progress or figure it out, myself and other people like you are definitely out here, feeling the same things and wondering the same questions. Best of luck to you, my brother.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/idxrnv/ive_recently_tried_to_open_myself_up_to_dating/g2d6cqg/"}
