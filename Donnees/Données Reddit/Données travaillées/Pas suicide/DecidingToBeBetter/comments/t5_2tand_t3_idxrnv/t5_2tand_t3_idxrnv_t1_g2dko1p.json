Focus on finding something meaningful in your life to work towards. If you have that a) you won't care about having a partner because you'll be so focused on it and b) you'll end up meeting people anyway, who are also aligned with what lights you up. \n\nWhat is meaningful? Something beyond yourself that uses your skills and interests in a way that makes the world a better place for having had you in it. Maybe it is working with addicts or homeless people. Maybe it is cleaning rivers. Maybe misguided youths. Dogs. Elderly people etc... Doesn't really matter - there's endless issues everywhere you look, so find something that lights you up and start making it better.\n\nWhen you meet someone through doing that, the basis for the connection will be authentic - a genuine passion for something beyond yourselves, yet something that you yourselves love doing.\n\nOr dont do this, and be like everyone - all of whom are anxious, insecure, selfish, etc... in their own way.\n\nCheck out Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl - there's free copies online to be found. It'll point you in the right direction.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/idxrnv/ive_recently_tried_to_open_myself_up_to_dating/g2dko1p/"}
