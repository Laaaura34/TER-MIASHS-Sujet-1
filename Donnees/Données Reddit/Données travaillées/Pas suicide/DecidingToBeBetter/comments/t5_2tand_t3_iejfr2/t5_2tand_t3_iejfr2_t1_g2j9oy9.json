I now consider you (like all my fellow podcast and history video watching friends) internet vet. That is every person who\u2019s been on internet and is tired of all the basic and useless stuff internet has to offer and chooses to dig deep down the educational internet wormhole instead, by filtering out the abundant time wasting content. \n\nMany people around me after using the net for around 10-12 years have also done this and now we all share our podcast lessons with each other and off course occasional memes here and there. I wish there was a term to define this internet maturity. I\u2019m glad you hit it.
