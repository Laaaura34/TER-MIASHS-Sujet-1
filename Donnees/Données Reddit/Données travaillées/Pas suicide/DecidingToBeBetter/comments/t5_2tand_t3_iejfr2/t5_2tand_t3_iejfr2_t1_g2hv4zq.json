Congrats! I'm all for self improvement and learning. I love using YouTube for education, there is so much great content on there. I do still love my \"trash YouTube\" though just to relax and turn off my brain after a long work day, but I definitely had to limit the time I spent binge watching mindless content in the past, it's so easy to lose time on there. I now only let myself watch a few short videos like that or one longer one.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iejfr2/ive_changed_my_daily_youtube_time_into_watching/g2hv4zq/"}
