When I am building something in Minecraft, I always get the feeling of wanting to delete it all and start from scratch because I think it is not good enough. When I write texts I usually delete them and write them again multiple times until I am happy with the result. Even small things like ugly fonts can keep me from really working on something that I should be working on. However, I have learned that this does not happen when looking at other people's texts or builds. I usually try to find a time where I am motivated to do as much of the work as I can, using the current motivation to get a lot of it done. Then, at a later point in time, I try to look at what I have previously wrote as \"someone elses\" work, which I can improve, but wouldn't delete.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOddly enough, generally improving your well-being, starting from working out, being out in nature more, eating healthy, socializing, taking care of your own body, all seem to make the problem disappear or at least make it become so small that I can overcome it. There is probably nothing wrong with the things you delete, but something else tells you that something is not right, and the easiest way to reset is doing it with online accounts and games.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbjvzb/im_too_perfectionist_and_thats_destroying_me_i/hha82ur/"}
