Ironically, if you strive to disappoint yourself, you won\u2019t be able to.\n\nHe also stresses the myth of perfection: remember that your idea of perfection is an illusion, a seductive idea that does not exist in reality. Even the people and work you most admire could be improved upon if you look close enough. \n\nHighly recommend the book.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbjvzb/im_too_perfectionist_and_thats_destroying_me_i/hhdmkpk/"}
