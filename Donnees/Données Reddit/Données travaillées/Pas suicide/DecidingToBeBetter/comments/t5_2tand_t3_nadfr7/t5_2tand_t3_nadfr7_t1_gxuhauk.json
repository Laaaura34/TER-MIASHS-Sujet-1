Let things roll off your back like a duck with water. You get stressed and pissed off alot. Honestly I've found restaurant work in general is all about who you work with. It kinda feels like you have a crew you are close with and you survive your shifts together. You let yourself get stressed easily you will be bald within a few years. Also if you don't smoke cigarettes don't start lol. Alot of cooks smoke alot I've noticed lol. Also be nice to your dishwashers. Don't just scream at them when you need something cleaned, they are busting ass too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nadfr7/landed_a_job_as_a_line_cook_my_goal_is_to_become/gxuhauk/"}
