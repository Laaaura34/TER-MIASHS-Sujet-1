I'm sorry but you need to put aside your morality to do it.  Because the only way to get rich is by leveraging human labor and paying it LESS than it generates in wealth for you. \n\nAnd while you may say \"hold on, that's not true. If you create products that make people's lives better and you employ people at a fair wage who otherwise wouldn't be employed, you are making the world a better place.\"\n\nBut it doesn't work like that. Because if you make gizmo A and pay your employees $20, and another company mimics your product and pays their employees $10 bucks (or $1 by using slave labor out of asia), your business will go bust because they can sell the product for less and will get all the market share (even though you were first to market with it). \n\nYou have no choice but to either pay your employees less or start using slave labor yourself. \n\nYes, you can be moral and be \"well off\"... but if you want to be RICH, the only way to do it is to reap the rewards of other people's labor (ie. your employees). \n\nBut as I say, you can be well off and do the right thing, that's totally feasible. But RICH is a different story. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/2v3nch/we_can_be_both_wealthy_and_blessed/coe708v/"}
