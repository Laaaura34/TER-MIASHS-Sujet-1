I\u2019m doing a lot better than I feel I should be,\n\nOur family friend that died early in the month, it turns out she left behind a 12 year old dog and it got passed around a bit since then. I take in the dog this Friday, I\u2019m adopting him to spend out his days with my dog and me, he\u2019s a good fit for my little family. I feel honoured that I\u2019m in a place that I can do something to cherish my friends memory. I\u2019m excited to get this dog and give him all the love he deserves.\n\nTo honour my grandma I\u2019m teaching a friend how to cook and bake like she taught me, and how to knit.  I just want to remember them and tell people stories about my grams and the amazing things she did. My grandma gave me this cook book 10 years ago that was her great great grandmothers and it\u2019s always been on my mind because I love cooking from it, but now it\u2019s a bucket list goal to make every recipe in it. \n\nIf I get to see her again some day I want to sit down with her and my brother and tell them all the adventures and stories that came to be because I was honouring their memory in the ways they would have wanted me too. Not letting depression and sickness win.\n\nDeciding to do better every day right?  I have had some pretty great examples of great people with incredible hearts, I\u2019m lucky to have known them so well that they inspire me every day.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l117fj/i_thought_i_used_reverse_psychology_on_my_mom_to/gjxl5tr/"}
