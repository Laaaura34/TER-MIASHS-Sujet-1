It\u2019s about being able to buckle down and get through the more unpleasant or stressful things to better enjoy the great things. I remember for my 18th birthday I got a tattoo, shaved half my hair off and then drove home to my moms for Christmas. She was super surprised and not all happy lol \n\nKeep a bucket list, and don\u2019t write just big things on it. Write small things, smiles, hugs, things you love and want more of. And if there is one piece of advice I could give you is the word reframing. I\u2019ve never liked holidays because of past abuse and pain, but I decided to start reframing them. Stopping what ever tradition I had and made new ones to reframe the day or the word, and to welcome a future of new memories not inviting the past to have a seat at the main table, kick their ass to the kids table. It\u2019s good to remember the past sometimes but it\u2019s better to make friends with the future.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l117fj/i_thought_i_used_reverse_psychology_on_my_mom_to/gjz9w9c/"}
