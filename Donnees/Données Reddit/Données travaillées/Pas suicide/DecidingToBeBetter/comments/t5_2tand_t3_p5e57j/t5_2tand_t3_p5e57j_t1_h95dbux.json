If they don't hear you, they haven't done theirs. That's their problem. \n\n>I admit I am sensitive and emotional and I am trying to think rationally before I speak\n\nBeing sensitive is nothing to \"admit\" to. It's not a problem you need to solve. If that's who you are, it's fine. Also, the presence of emotion doesn't equal the absence of reason. \n\nSometimes we don't have the vocabulary to put what we're feeling into words.
