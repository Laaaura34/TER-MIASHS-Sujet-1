Telling you that you are sensitive and emotional as if it is something to be ashamed about. It sounds like he is telling you your experience and personality isn't valid and that there is something wrong with you. even if it's not totally intentional, that's very manipulative and I'd almost say it's gaslighting.\n\nmy ex was like this too. from what you're writing here, it sounds like you won't get anything good out of this relationship anymore. even if it gets better I just wouldn't trust my life with a person who can't listen to you. a relationship should give you confidence, growth, safety - not a feeling of being less or wrong or unattractive.\n\ni feel like the faster you can get out of this the better. i wish you luck and strength <3  Things will get better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5e57j/how_do_you_let_go_of_a_person_you_know_is_not/h97uzp4/"}
