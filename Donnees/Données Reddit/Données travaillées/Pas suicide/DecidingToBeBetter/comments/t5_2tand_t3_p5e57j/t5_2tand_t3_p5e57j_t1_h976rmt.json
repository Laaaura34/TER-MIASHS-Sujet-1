End of relationships hurt beyond hurt.\n\nAlso I would argue that humans feel what they feel.  We also desire whatever we desire in spite of ourselves.  None of this is a choice.  We do not get to \"just let go.\".  This is not reality.\n\nThat being said, time will heal and change all of us given a chance.  Unfortunately time takes time (this is an Alcoholics Anonymous saying).  This is not a fun thing to acknowledge.  Many people want to think we can just choose to rid ourselves of unhappy emotions.  We can't.\n\nPlease do see a psychologist.  Unfortunately many therapists are either not good or just not a good fit.  You may well have to try a few.\n\nCourage and strength to you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5e57j/how_do_you_let_go_of_a_person_you_know_is_not/h976rmt/"}
