Usually something excruciatingly painful happens between us that I simply can no longer subject myself to the emotional damage being done staying within a toxic relationship.\nSo what do I do? I cry and I grieve the loss of something that can no longer be and I abruptly remove them from my life. I don\u2019t say goodbyes, I don\u2019t try to gain or give closure, I don\u2019t leave the door open to reconcile and fix things later on. I simply eliminate them in every single way and stay off the radar and bury myself in anything I can to give me distraction and strength. \nIt usually takes a little time, but eventually I finally start to heal and move on and then one day I realize how much better life is without that toxicity in my life and I wonder why it ever took me so long to get to that point. \n\nI\u2019ve done this more times than I wish, but was absolutely necessary as an act of self-love and self-growth. I\u2019ve had to leave behind many people I loved deeply but knew loving myself was just as important and I learned to start taking chances on myself and stop wasting them all on the wrong people. It hasn\u2019t failed me yet. I hope you find the strength to do the same.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p5e57j/how_do_you_let_go_of_a_person_you_know_is_not/h97d65z/"}
