Just won\u2019t admit to it. You are being completely normal.\n\nThe best you can do now is gather what\u2019s left of yourself and your dignity and leave. Make it clear that you are not someone to be degraded on trampled upon. You deserve better. And he doesn\u2019t deserve you.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot easier said than done though. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of good in him that you see. I\u2019m sure you think that he\u2019s a good person, just lost maybe. But if you can see the good in him, you can see the good in anyone. He refuses to even give you a chance.
