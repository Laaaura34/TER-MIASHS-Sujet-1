I wish all the best to you and your daughter. \n\nI just want to say that the title of this post really resonates with me... Right now my life isnt as bad as it used to be but sometimes even just thinking about the road that lies ahead fills me with intense anxiety... But I know that I have to keep going to get stuff done otherwise Ill end up like broken and depressed man... \nWe all have to keep pushing no matter what. And that is a good thing but also super terrifying...\n\nJust remember that you are not the only one who feels this way. Its a very human thing :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/b9cqhb/life_is_terrifying_but_i_keep_pushing_forwards/ek41jq5/"}
