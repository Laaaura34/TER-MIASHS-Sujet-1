And I mean it quite literally, not just a general sort of \"be grateful for what you have\" way. \n\nI remember the homeless man I say yesterday and think \"at least I have an apartment\". I think of the misfortune and problem and diseases of people I know. At least I don't have brain damage, I can speak. I have good social skills. I am not in crippling dept. I don't have OCD or a crippling phobia. My close family are alive. I'm not losing my vision, or living with constant backpain. Further, I think of the news and remind myself that I live in a rich country without war and almost without natural disasters. I got extremely lucky in the birth lottery to have been born where I am, to parents that loved me. It seems a bit entitled to demand even more luck from the universe than I've already gotten, doesn't it? \n\nComparing yourself to those who seem to have it easier gives the illusion that you'd be happy if you had what they have. But even if you magically got it, your brain would just move the goal posts and then you'd want something else.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ocf98t/i_feel_like_my_biggest_struggle_is_comparing/h3w7t6f/"}
