It used to be so horrible that I was just lay around and be depressed thinking I was never good enough. It flares up a lot still but now I have gradually realized that it doesn\u2019t matter what anyone else has and I can\u2019t compare. If I really want something better. It\u2019s up to me to get it. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair to myself to compare. No ones life is the same. Everyone has the same struggles. \n\nWhat I do to get out of a comparison spiral is I start to focus on the people, places, and things that are in my life and I put my energy into improving those things. I will also try and have gratitude for what I do have.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ocf98t/i_feel_like_my_biggest_struggle_is_comparing/h3uvtp7/"}
