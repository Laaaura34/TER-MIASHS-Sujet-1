Prime example? Alcohol. You cant get weed poisoning or go thru seizures because your body became too dependent on smoking daily. Sure, you can become mentally addicted to weed. But you cant compare the horrors of alcohol addiction /withdrawal with your \"weird dreams\" from not having weed. They are not and will never be the same.\n\nYou *can't* die from quitting smoking weed after smoking every single day for a year. You *will* die if you do the same with alcohol.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hvampm/ive_decided_to_take_a_break_from_marijuana_for_a/fytg1ih/"}
