Just doing it constantly, wake and bake, bowls all day long(when I wasn't working or in school of course).\n\nI moved from smoking to vaping and it cut it down significantly. Vaping bud, none of this extract super potent shit. It's still something I do, but nowhere near the amount I was before. Usually a small amount at night.\n\nCentering your life around weed is definitely a problem but people get caught up in it and don't realize where they're headed.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hvampm/ive_decided_to_take_a_break_from_marijuana_for_a/fyszu8y/"}
