For example, love bombing is a term that largely applies to purposefully manipulative people and clinically diagnosed narcissists who are doing it in order to manipulate their partners. Also, clinically diagnosed narcissists and truly toxic people don't typically feel bad about being toxic or have the level of self awareness that you do.\n\nEveryone can exhibit toxic traits sometimes and it's important to be aware of them, but be careful with diagnosing yourself as a toxic person or anything else based on the internet. A lot of people will use terms like love bombing and go wild with them to the point they lose their meaning. You might be noticing clingy behaviors within yourself and also co-dependency, but that's very different from purposefully showering someone with insincere \"love\" in order to manipulate them.\n\nI highly recommend counseling, especially relationship based counseling. While the desire to improve our relationships with others is an awesome reason to go to counseling, try focusing on improvement for your own personal sanity and happiness, not due to pressure from others, no matter their intentions. \n\nI wish you inner peace.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdnt8j/please_help_me_be_a_better_partner_and_adult/haug9o4/"}
