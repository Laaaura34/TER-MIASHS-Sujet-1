But what you\u2019ve said just sounds like he thinks he\u2019s \u201cbetter\u201d than you and he is your mentor rather than your partner (he would leave if he ever felt the relationship was hurting more than helping, he constantly pushes you to be better, he wants anyone he dates to reach certain points). I\u2019m sure he is great but he is not better than you. From what you\u2019ve said, it sounds like you are doing amazingly at life in general, after being dealt a very very difficult hand. \n\nHaving said that, I\u2019m really sorry to hear about what you\u2019ve been through. I hope that in time you are able to rebuild and get back to how you were before.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdnt8j/please_help_me_be_a_better_partner_and_adult/harrvkl/"}
