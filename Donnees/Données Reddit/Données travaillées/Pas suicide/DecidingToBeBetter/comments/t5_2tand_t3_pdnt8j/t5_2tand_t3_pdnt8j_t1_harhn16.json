Have you also discussed your relationship? \n\nI\u2019m just saying this because, and I don\u2019t know all the details, but I just wonder what your therapist would say about your boyfriend\u2019s behaviour. Like I said, I don\u2019t know all the details and I think it\u2019s great that you\u2019re working on yourself and your baggage from the past. I just think that you shouldn\u2019t have to panic because you got into a fender bender (this happens to everyone occasionally, by the way). I don\u2019t think you should feel like you\u2019re a failure or be panicking because you have to prove yourself to your boyfriend. \n\nI don\u2019t know you, but I know that you\u2019re not a failure! And you may have some baggage but I also know that you have a lot of positive qualities and a lot of good things you bring to your relationship and life in general. Sorry I don\u2019t have any other advice, I just wanted to say that. What jumped out at me from your post is that you feel like you\u2019re a failure and not worthy of your boyfriend. I think this isn\u2019t healthy and I\u2019m also sure that it isn\u2019t true.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pdnt8j/please_help_me_be_a_better_partner_and_adult/harhn16/"}
