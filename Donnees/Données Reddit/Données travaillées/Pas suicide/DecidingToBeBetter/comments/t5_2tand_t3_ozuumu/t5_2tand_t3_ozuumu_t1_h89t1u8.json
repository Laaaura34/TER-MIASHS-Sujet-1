Love your examples here. I can relate with what you are saying in how you view your life through memories. Memories are very complicated, their aim is to make sure we have a continuous meaning to connect our actions and life. So when you start questioning why you did what you did using memories without taking the meaning into account, it can get really crazy. I have ADHD and almost all my memories are skewed. Like you I am 200 % into something during the process and when it\u2019s done am like totally out of it and the whole thing feels like a dream.
