Thoughts generally pop up in our heads, and then we react to them. What we to some extent can control is how we react to them. But not the thoughts themselves. Can you promise that you for the next year will never think of elephants? No? That's because you don't control your thoughts - no one really does. I think using the word \"control\" sets up false expectations - as if you are never going to have pessimistic or intrusive thoughts ever again if you just try hard enough.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ozuumu/are_you_a_slave_to_your_thoughts/h835nlt/"}
