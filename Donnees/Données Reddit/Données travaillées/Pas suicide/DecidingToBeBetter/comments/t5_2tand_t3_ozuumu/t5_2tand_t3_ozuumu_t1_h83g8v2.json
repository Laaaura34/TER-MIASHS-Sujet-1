Feeling lonely....... Buuuttt you can find positives. Pursue your interests that conflicted in your relationship. No more debates about what to eat. No one to nitpick at you as a person.. you'll feel lonely but don't fill the gap with alcohol. Fill that empty feeling with hobbies and new activities. Reach out to old friends who fell to the wayside. Drink water... Be healthy you don't need them to be happy. Go kayaking. Learn to ski. Play your favorite videogames for hours and hours without someone making you feel guilty that you put attention on something else. I could go on but I think I've painted a decent picture. DONT LET SOMEONE ELSE CONTROL YOUR MOOD. You have one life, live it to be happy. This is a branch in your timeline but you still control it's path.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ozuumu/are_you_a_slave_to_your_thoughts/h83g8v2/"}
