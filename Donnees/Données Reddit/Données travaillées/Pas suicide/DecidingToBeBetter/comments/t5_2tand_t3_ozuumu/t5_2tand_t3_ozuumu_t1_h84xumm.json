I stopped trying to ignore the thoughts. Instead I asked, are they useful? Do they help me or improve my life? In any way? If the answer is no, they have no place in my mind. If they don't, I can disregard them and basically remove them from my mind. Then I don't have to ignore them, they just go away completely. This has improved my life immensely in a way that I couldn't have guessed when I started doing this. If I am not sure if a negative thought will help me or not I have a whole system for challenging it. I have this series of questions that I ask myself, and it turns out that if the thought can improve my life, it doesn't have to be negative, and in fact the negative part hurts me. So it allows me to sculpt my thoughts into useful, good, and nurturing thoughts that make me happy. It is kind of hard to explain because it is a very personal process that happens solely in my mind but I hope that it somehow helps or gives you ideas on what to do in your situation.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ozuumu/are_you_a_slave_to_your_thoughts/h84xumm/"}
