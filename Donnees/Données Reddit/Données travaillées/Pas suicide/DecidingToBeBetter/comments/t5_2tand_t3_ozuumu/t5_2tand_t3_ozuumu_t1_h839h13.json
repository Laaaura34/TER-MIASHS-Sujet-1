I thought that this was my fundamental nature and any small, incremential difference wasn\u2019t worth it, I\u2019d still be as lonely and unsuccessful and unhappy when I woke up the next day.\n\nTwo things changed it for me:\n1. Reading something about how we believe that someone going back in time and changing one thing can affect the present, why don\u2019t we think one small thing today can change the whole future?\n2. Seeing a graphic on an upward spiral vs downward spiral and how easy it is to get caught up in the momentum of one vs the other.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever reach the point where I can tell myself I can be confident, successful, or open to change. I am taking it one action at a time in the general direction of confident, successful, and open to change.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ozuumu/are_you_a_slave_to_your_thoughts/h839h13/"}
