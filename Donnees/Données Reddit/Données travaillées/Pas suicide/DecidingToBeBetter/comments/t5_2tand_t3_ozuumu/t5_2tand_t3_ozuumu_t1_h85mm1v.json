The need to repress or get rid of a thought sits at the core of almost all thought-based psychopathology.\n\nThe explanation for this is quite fascinating, I think. If you google relational frame theory, you could read up on it. The shortest possible explanation I could give is that if you tie a thought that you cannot have to any kind of avoidance mechanism, those things now immediately become connected. And for every avoidance strategy you employ, or any distracting thought you try to swap out the bad thought with, they are all now connected. It's like trying to get honey off your hands by touching more honey, and then touching other things. All you end up doing is making the other stuff a reminder of what you are trying to avoid, which is probably the reason why people who try to repress thoughts in this way experience them more and more intensely. You basically just create infinite amounts of new triggers.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ozuumu/are_you_a_slave_to_your_thoughts/h85mm1v/"}
