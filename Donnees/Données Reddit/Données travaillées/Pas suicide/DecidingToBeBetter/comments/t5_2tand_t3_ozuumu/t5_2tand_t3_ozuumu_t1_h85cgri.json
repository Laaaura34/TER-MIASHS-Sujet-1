Just suppressing my thoughts caused them to go away sometimes but the pattern persisted. \n\nWhat I do now changes the pattern completely, and overtime most negative unwanted thoughts have gone away. It actually has created a pattern in the opposite direction. My thoughts mostly are helpful and positive. My mind is not likely to bring something up to my attention unless it is useful or good for me in some way. \n\nAnother odd side effect is I don't have many bad dreams or nightmares anymore. Before this I had bad dreams almost exclusively, if I had dreams at all. It was rare that I did. \n\nThis is getting beyond your question, but I hope it is helpful anyways. Through this process with my thoughts, I came to the conclusion that I have to almost treat myself like a baby. My inner self. Something to nurture and protect. The ways that I fuck up are like a baby falling down. Can you blame a baby falling down? Not at all. Can you expect the baby to feel guilty? Of course not. You help them out and keep moving. The only goal is to help the baby avoid falling down again. Does it help to say mean things to the baby? Never. Encouragement and guidance are the only things you should give. \n\nThis things have brought so much peace and value to my life that I can't even describe it. \n\nAgain this is hard to explain but I hope it helps in some way.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ozuumu/are_you_a_slave_to_your_thoughts/h85cgri/"}
