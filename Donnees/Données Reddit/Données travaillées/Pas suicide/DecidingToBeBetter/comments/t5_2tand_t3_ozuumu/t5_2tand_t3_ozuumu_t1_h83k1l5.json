Which actually explains why none of the 15 years of therapy I've gone through has helped me at all. Lol. They don't suggest what to do otherwise, though. Should I just shit-talk myself? Is it like having ADD and taking stimulants, having the opposite effect as it would have on a standard brain?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ozuumu/are_you_a_slave_to_your_thoughts/h83k1l5/"}
