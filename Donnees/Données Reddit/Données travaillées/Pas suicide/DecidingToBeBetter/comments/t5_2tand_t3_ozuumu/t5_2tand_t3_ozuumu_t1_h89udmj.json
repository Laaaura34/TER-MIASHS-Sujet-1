The problem is the term \u201cpositive\u201d. What\u2019s positive for you is not necessarily positive for me. And positive affirmations are end points. When I go through an experience and achieve a positive realization at the end of it, then I can repeat that to myself over time. That\u2019s how effective self talk is created. To me positive self talk is self talk that helps me pursue actions that are inline with my meaning. I ask myself the right questions to do this, not force feed myself with so called positive thoughts. Because what\u2019s positive in one situation is not positive in another", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ozuumu/are_you_a_slave_to_your_thoughts/h89udmj/"}
