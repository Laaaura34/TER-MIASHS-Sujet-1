It's not something one needs to struggle with. Simply be aware of it. Know that everything you know stems from subjective interpretation, and thus is flawed. Incomplete at best. \n\nKnow that your own subjective experience is colored by your past. Karma is the psychological matrix through which life is filtered.  Every piece of negativity you carry rubs off on your experiences. Every positive aspect of you influences what you do. Thoughts are echoes of these experiences. \n\nThis is why people can believe they're behaving well, while everyone around them thinks they're acting like an ass. Negativity rubbing itself off on intention. The subjective experience is unaware. \n\nDepression arises when we allow negativity that has affected our lives to fester. Trauma often has this effect. The seed of fear grows as we dwell on it. The brain is incredibly malleable. Whatever we do in the moment, our brain is making us better at it. When we dwell on negativity, the synaptic pathways linked to it are strengthened as well. In time, the feedback emanating from this karma spreads to every aspect of ones life. Until one finds themselves in a downward spiral. \n\nWhat is success in your opinion? ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/38lztx/how_do_you_stop_comparing_your_current_depressed/cryu94n/"}
