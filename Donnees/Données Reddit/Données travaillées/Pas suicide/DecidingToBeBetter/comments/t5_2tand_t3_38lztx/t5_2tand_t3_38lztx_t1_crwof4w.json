Rather in school there was social engineering efforts due to anti-bullying campaigns to make sure everyone has friends and felt included. \n\nBut in uni, no-one really gave a shit, lecturers were either too busy or couldn't see all the lonely folks. The best we got was 'join a society' blabla. So me having social anxiety and my self-stigma on my mental health, I couldn't get myself to go to societies enough, I tried but chickened out several times-then started FAing and majorly procrastinating online on a student forum (look up Riku on TSR). That then demotivated me from working quite as hard as I could have. I still got decent grades, and came out with a 2.1, but went in with a scholarship, I could have got a 1st if I wanted and worked harder sigh. \n\nOf course there were counsellors and I even had a support worker from the disabled student support team, but they never substitute real friends, it was like having a pity friend...also she was like 30, and kinda hot in an older sister way which made the whole thing awkward :p ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/38lztx/how_do_you_stop_comparing_your_current_depressed/crwof4w/"}
