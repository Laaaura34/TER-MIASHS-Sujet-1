Coping with things differently at different stages of life is not only not unusual, I would argue it is the norm. You are a different person, in a different situation, facing very different realities than you were at age 15. Of course you would react to them differently, it would be strange if you didn't. Its also okay to struggle a little more than you did at age 15. Things were simpler then. Try to be patient with yourself while you work through these new challenges, I'm sure they're very different than the ones you faced at age 15. We all move through life at our own pace, and at times that pace may be faster or slower, but its usually the best pace for us.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/38lztx/how_do_you_stop_comparing_your_current_depressed/crwo8c1/"}
