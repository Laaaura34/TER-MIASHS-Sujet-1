Examine and try to understand the root of that feeling. Will being productive give you lasting satisfaction or will you need to find something else to do afterwards to prevent yourself from feeling depressed again? Must you always be more productive or equally productive throughout your life in order to be happy? Does satisfaction come from external things or internally?\n\nAnd then examine your lack of productivity and de-motivation...\n\nWhy are you not doing the things that you think you should be doing? Is there some inner conflict? \n\nMaybe it's the things themselves... Are the things you're forcing yourself to do actually worth doing or important? \n\nProductivity isn't the end goal. Work has no inherent value. When you are focused and 100% believe in the importance of what you need to do, the actual doing is easy (think disaster/survival situations, or anything that HAS to be done). It's when you are conflicted or don't believe in your mission that taking action becomes difficult.\n\nExamine your motivations. Find the right WHY, create alignment in your life, and then focus on doing the next thing you have to do. Don't get caught in a trap of punishing yourself because you aren't acting the way you think you should, that doesn't do any good. Use everything as a learning experience.
