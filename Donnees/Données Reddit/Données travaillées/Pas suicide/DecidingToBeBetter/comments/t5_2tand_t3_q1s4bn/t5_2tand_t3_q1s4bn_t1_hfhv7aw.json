How is this the best thing that's ever happened to me?\n   1. There's a silver lining in everything (even negative circumstances).  We're used to taking the negative ones but what we don't realize is that the positive ones were always there.  Just our awareness of them.\n2. How is this my fault/responsibility?\n   1. You've taken the first step in owning up to the things that have happened and your current state of affairs.  Sometimes even things outside of ourselves from which we have no control over deals us a crappy hand but we are still at fault or responsible to ourselves.  You're also not just who you are now, you are also your past self and future self.  We have responsibilities to those people as well so how we choose to deal with a predicament now, affects them greatly.\n\nLastly, in the last few sentences on failure.  One mantra I always hold in anything I do now, is \"You never fail or lose, you either win or you learn.\"  \n\nHope this helps you as it has helped me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1s4bn/im_done_blaming_others_for_my_life/hfhv7aw/"}
