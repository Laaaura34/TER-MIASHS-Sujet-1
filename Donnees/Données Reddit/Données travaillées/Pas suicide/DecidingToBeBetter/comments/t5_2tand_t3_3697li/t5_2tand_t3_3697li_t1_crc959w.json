Boredom and dissatisfaction are signs that I am not doing what's need to do.\n\nFor me,  I need to cut out distractions.  That means cutting off the screens.  No tv, no computer, no radio.  I like to go to the lake and sit with a notebook for s day or two.  There's a lot of napping and walking. Maybe some rowing. Usually it takes a few weeks of really paying attention to my head and my body to figure out the direction. Sometimes it's just a day or two.  Then I spend some time figuring out how to start moving in whatever new direction.  \n\nFyi- it's rarely something life changing that I need to fix.  Usually it's things like figuring out that I'm not getting enough sleep or not spending enough time with friends or I need a new hobby or project.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3697li/how_do_i_get_my_spark_back/crc959w/"}
