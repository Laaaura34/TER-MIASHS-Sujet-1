Seriously.   Best cure for what you've got going on.  Even if you can't catch a wave just sit out there and oscillate up and down with each wave on your board.  Feel the sun on your face and the cool water gliding past your toes.  Hear the rhythmic sounds of the ocean meeting earth.  Something about it brings on a cognitive shift.  I sound like a total hippie I know but I know you'd benefit from some quality time out there.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3697li/how_do_i_get_my_spark_back/crc32ab/"}
