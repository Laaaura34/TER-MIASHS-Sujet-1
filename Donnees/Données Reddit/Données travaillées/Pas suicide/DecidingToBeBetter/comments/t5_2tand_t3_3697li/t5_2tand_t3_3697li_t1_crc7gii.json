I'm a medical hypnotist myself and I saw a client last year that was describing exactly the type of life you are. Just a feeling of having lost their 'spark'. Because you've had it once before, it's relatively easy to get back again, especially with a bit of hypnosis. \n\nYou could also get it back following a lot of the other advice people have mentioned on this thread, but I think a session or two of hypnosis is the 'fast' way to do it. :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3697li/how_do_i_get_my_spark_back/crc7gii/"}
