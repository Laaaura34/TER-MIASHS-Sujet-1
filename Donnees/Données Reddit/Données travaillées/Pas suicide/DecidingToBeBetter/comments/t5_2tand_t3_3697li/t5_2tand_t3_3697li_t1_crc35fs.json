The moment you let your ass hit the sofa or the bed your day is pretty much screwed because you've gotten used to that now.\n\nThen when you get home the second time you can curl up and really rest, trust me that's a lot easier when you aren't plagued with guilt. Or try to get up a bit earlier and go for a morning walk. That way, no matter how shitty your day will be, you can start the day with the feeling that you at least reached two personal goals: being a nice dog owner and getting yourself some exercise.\n\nIf your projects are no longer fun, just discard them. Looking around your home and only seeing things you *should* be doing, or telling you that you failed to finish something only adds to the negative feelings.
