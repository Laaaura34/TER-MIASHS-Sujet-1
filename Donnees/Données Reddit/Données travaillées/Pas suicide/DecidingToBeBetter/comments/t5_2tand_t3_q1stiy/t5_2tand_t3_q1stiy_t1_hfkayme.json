Well,  its the same reason, tho i never installed tiktok. Because i had it installed back in 2018. and i knew how devastating shit it was. \n\nInstead i replaced my phone with alot of productive things..\n1. Duolingo. An app where you can learn different languages (very easy and good)\n\n2. Z- library  website. It has all of the world wide available books on it \n\n3. Notion. As a uni student with all the events, seminars, competition and daily uni life happening it was really hard keeping track all of these things plus the deadlines for assignments, projects, lectures, etc. It helped me really manage my academic life vvvvv much easily.\n\nApart from apps i started replacing music with audio books. I am reading as well as listening to the books as i want. I have used reddit to gain knowledge, ofc there are some useful sub Reddits---", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q1stiy/deleted_instagram_facebook_and_tiktok/hfkayme/"}
