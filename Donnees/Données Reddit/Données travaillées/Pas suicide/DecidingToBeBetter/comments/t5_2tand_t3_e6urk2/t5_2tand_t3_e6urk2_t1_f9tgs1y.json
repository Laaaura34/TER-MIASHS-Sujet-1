Thanks for sharing, friend. I spent a lot of my life addicted to this \u201cporn for the heart\u201d you talk about. This was some much needed inspiration for me to quit that bullshit and get a little uncomfortable. It may not always turn out the way it did for you here, but I know it\u2019s worth it. Still, I\u2019m glad your date went well and wish you the best going forward.
