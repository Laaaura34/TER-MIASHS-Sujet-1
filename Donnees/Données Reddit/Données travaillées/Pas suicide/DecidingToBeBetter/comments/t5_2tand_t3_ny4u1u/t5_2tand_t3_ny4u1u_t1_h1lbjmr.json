There are guys who will do that just to mess with their ex. Like it\u2019s a weird guy thing that happens to a lot of people. These guys will literally get a new girlfriend and uproot both of their lives just to follow his ex girlfriend just to mess with her. And the new girlfriend sometimes knows that this is about antagonizing the ex girlfriend but she\u2019s a psycho who thinks this is a #couples goals kind of thing. Or she doesn\u2019t know and she\u2019s trusting the intentions of her new boyfriend having nothing to do with him being a psycho following his ex girlfriend across the country or to a new country. But this is something that I\u2019ve seen other women talk about and that I\u2019ve had happen to me with ex boyfriends stalking me.\n\nBut yeah you need to make sure that it\u2019s a coincidence because some ex boyfriends will actually do this. Block your mutual friends from your old life with him. He might be keeping tabs on you from what they\u2019re telling him. Had that happen. Update your hairstyle and color. Just reinvent your appearance and screen new friends carefully. And if he shows up then update that new friend that he\u2019s literally followed you to a new city. Control your narrative. Nothing is just a coincidence with ex boyfriends as many people who have been in this situation can tell you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ny4u1u/i_finally_unfollowed_my_ex_on_instagram/h1lbjmr/"}
