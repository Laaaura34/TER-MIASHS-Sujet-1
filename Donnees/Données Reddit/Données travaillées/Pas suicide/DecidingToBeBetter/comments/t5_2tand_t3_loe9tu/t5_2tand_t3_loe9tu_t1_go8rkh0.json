It can be bad enough to almost feel like the flu.  I've had to quit caffeine a few times due to anxiety and a chronic pain issue.  100% the best way to do it is ween yourself off slowly over time.  If you are having 3 cups a day switch to 2 for 2 weeks.  Then 1 cup for 2 weeks.  Then try half decaf/half caf for 2 weeks.  You can probably go cold turkey after that with minimal side effects.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/loe9tu/is_caffeine_withdrawal_this_bad/go8rkh0/"}
