Most people don't, I'd wager.\n\nSo what if you aren't 100% dedicated to a craft, a cause, a company, a calling.\n\nYou can still be dedicated to YOU. Self-improvement, Deciding to Be Better, is about YOU.\n\nMake your reason YOU. What if a year from now, when you're healthier/smarter/earning more/just further on with your goals, looking back at this post you made. This future you isn't the now you, it's a person you love and care for deeply, who is utterly helpless. Future you is subject to every decision you make today.\n\nIf you engage in the vices and bad habits you're currently trying to beat, you're just mistreating that person. How would you feel if someone you loved actively hurt you, or did nothing to stop you from being harmed?\n\nAgain, I don't know you, but you know your future self. You know what your future self wants. \n\nTHAT can be your purpose.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lwamj5/the_biggest_why_i_have_hit_on_till_now/gpgamvl/"}
