I have similar CSA experiences - not a family member though - and a very similar history of drugs to numb the pain. I sounded exactly like you at 18. I'm in my 30's now and I'm still working on these issues. It gets better. I promise you, it gets better.  \n\n\nBut they ARE getting better. That constant feeling you have where you simply cannot sit with yourself. That drives you insane if you have more than a moment to yourself. \n\nYou're going to have a hard time accepting love. From other people and from yourself.   \nIt will get better. Keep trying and trying and trying because you don't have another choice. None of this is your fault, but it sadly falls on you to make it better.   \n\n\nGive yourself a lot of patience and love. You deserve it. You're playing life on hard mode. A lot of people won't understand how hard this is.  \n\n\nI've never met you, but I love you, and you deserve to feel and accept love. Just know you are not alone in anything, no matter how dark it feels.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgus7h/im_at_the_point_where_quitting_seems_to_be_the/hi93a1u/"}
