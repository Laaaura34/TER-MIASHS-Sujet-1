Meaning you have to be vulnerable and learn that vulnerability is a fucking sign of strength. I\u2019m a SA survivor and I fought like hell for myself. Because I am worthy of life and happiness and good shit happening to me. And so are you, OP. \n\n\nIf you have access to therapy, I highly recommend DBT. It specifically addresses self-talk. It\u2019s also important to note that that voice that tells you bad things about yourself might not be yours after all. Negative self-talk is, unfortunately, often us internalizing what someone else has told us or how they have made us feel. Breaking yourself open might help you find your voice. The one that roots for you. But until then, know that Reddit is rooting for you to fight like hell (and win) for yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgus7h/im_at_the_point_where_quitting_seems_to_be_the/hi9wl3d/"}
