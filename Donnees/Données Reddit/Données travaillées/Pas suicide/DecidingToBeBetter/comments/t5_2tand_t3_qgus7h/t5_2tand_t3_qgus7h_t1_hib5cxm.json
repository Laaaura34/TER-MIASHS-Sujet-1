That you see these as wrong and know it isn\u2019t fair or right, means part of you knows you are not to blame. This did not happen because of something wrong with you. This happened TO you and you were not protected by those who should have protected you. You dear child deserve love, are capable of love, and should have it. The voice that talks down to yourself isn\u2019t yours. Yours is the one that feels this isn\u2019t right and shouldn\u2019t continue. Don\u2019t let them take this life from you. Please seek help, hotlines, church, support group, therapist, teacher, neighbor, friend, anyone. You can get away from this. You can find healing. You have yet to see who you can be free of this. You can make it through. I went through neglect and abuse and pain. I was on my own before high school ended. I got away and it was hard. You can do this. But please ask for help. I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you. That you reach out means the real you on some level knows you\u2019re deserving of love and to be free of this. Sending you love and strength. You can have a better life. You deserve a better life. You have value.\ud83d\udc9c", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgus7h/im_at_the_point_where_quitting_seems_to_be_the/hib5cxm/"}
