I'm sorry to hear that people abused you.  That's not cool.\n\nGive yourself some credit for making these efforts for yourself, eh?  It takes a lot of guts just to ask for help, to try therapy and to take a step forward. So you have my compliments on your efforts \ud83d\udcaa\n\nI know it really hurts right now, but I promise, if you can just put some faith in yourself to make a baby step every week, you will feel better very soon.\n\nIf you want to DM, feel free to reach out.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgus7h/im_at_the_point_where_quitting_seems_to_be_the/hi8lm5t/"}
