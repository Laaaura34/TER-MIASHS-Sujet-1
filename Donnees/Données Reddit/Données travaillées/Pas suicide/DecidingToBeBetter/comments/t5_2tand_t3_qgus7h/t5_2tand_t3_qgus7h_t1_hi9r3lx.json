A lot of boys and men experience sexual assault but may not feel comfortable talking about it or may not even recognize it as assault. I think it might be helpful to talk to other men who have similar experiences and can maybe help by either getting it off your chest or sharing how they deal with it/move through it? [This group](https://supportgroup.1in6.org/) seems to have regular, anonymous support groups. Maybe that\u2019s a good start? \n\nFrom knowing others that have experienced SA/rape, it\u2019s not easy at all to work through and they\u2019ve felt like they\u2019re not making progress before, but it takes a while to find what works for you and to learn to manage the pain that others have caused you and eventually you\u2019ll have days and weeks and this will progress into longer periods of time where you feel ok and you like yourself and your happy you\u2019re alive. I do hope you and your brother are able to reconnect.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgus7h/im_at_the_point_where_quitting_seems_to_be_the/hi9r3lx/"}
