My heart breaks for you, I wish I could give you a hug and tell you everything is going to be alright. And please whatever you do dont hurt yourself. You were put on this earth for a reason. It might not seem like it at times but you have a purpose, trust me. You have to fight and defend yourself, enough is enough and is noone is going to stand up for you then you have got to. Because no one will do you better than you. You're done being the victim and everyone's punching bag. Take your power back, if you dont like something say so, if you dont agree with something speak up. If someone is acting different and you don't know why then ask them. You need to make your voice heard. And fuck anybody that tries to shut you up or keep you in fear. Get new hobbies like martial arts to be able to defend yourself physically, meditate and look for the answers to your questions within,  trust me the answers are there it just take a little effort and patience and self reflection. If you ever need someone to talk to reach out to me, hope this helps. I'll tell you what my dad tells me \"Todo en esta vida tiene remedio, menos la muerte.\" Meaning everything in this life can be fixed or mended except for death. Chin up kid, you got this.
