So I force myself to listen to happier stuff and it definitely does help. I also force myself to shower even if I don't do anything else, and that also helps. Sometimes I go to the gym and sometimes I just crack open a window for fresh air. I like to binge watch comedies (Brooklyn nine nine, the office, older collegehumor, studio c, etc) And I think the biggest thing to remember is it does get better :) I try to talk to myself positively in my head and encourage myself, because even if that doesn't make me feel better right away, it helps me feel like I'm at least taking some responsibility, if that makes sense? Also medicine. Definitely medicine! Good luck :) sorry for the rambly answer", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7xlv1s/does_anybody_have_a_depression_playbook_they/du9ui5o/"}
