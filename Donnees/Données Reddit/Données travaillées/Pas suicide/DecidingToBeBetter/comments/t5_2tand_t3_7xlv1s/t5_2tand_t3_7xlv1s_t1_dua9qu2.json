It more or less works out for most things.  I still have some nagging issues on the back-burner that I want to keep pushing into tomorrow's task-list, but for the most part I am functional, content, and I am even able to experience genuine happiness, almost every day.\n\nFor something like depression, having someone to talk about it with is huge.  I haven't been in a relationship that long (3.5 months), but it is a healthy one and so far I have been able to be open about depression and anxiety with my partner.
