Feeding myself tends to be one of the first things to go for me, so preemptively making sure I have lots of really easy food options while I have the energy to do so has helped.\n\nI also try to do more than the least effort I could give - it doesn't have to be much more, but I find that even one ounce of effort more than the minimum makes me feels light years better and helps guard against depression becoming worse. So like, I could take my clothes out of the dryer and dump them straight on the floor, or I could fold a single sock and still dump the rest on the floor. The single sock helps me - it feels hard in the moment, but gives me a small sense of accomplishment.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7xlv1s/does_anybody_have_a_depression_playbook_they/du9uz1k/"}
