They\u2019re proof that you realize your actions were wrong and that you don\u2019t want to keep being that same person. I wish there were a silver lining to breaking up with your girlfriend so abruptly, but unfortunately there really isn\u2019t. She deserves her own happiness and peace, and, once you accept that you are not who she is meant to find those things with, it will be easier to accept the end of the relationship and to move on.\n\nI know it\u2019s easy to be hard on yourself right now, and maybe it\u2019s good that you are to an extent, but just remember that at the end of all of this you\u2019re in control of whether or not you change for the better and learn something from this mistake. This is a painful lesson but one that I think will make you a better person- the pain you\u2019re feeling is evidence of this.\n\nKeep your head up and keep taking care of yourself. I would be really happy to give some more perspective or advice based on what I went through if you\u2019re ever interested- I\u2019ll be here if you shoot me a DM. Best of luck mate.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nscrup/i_21_m_was_selfish_and_destroyed_my_relationship/h0lp1a2/"}
