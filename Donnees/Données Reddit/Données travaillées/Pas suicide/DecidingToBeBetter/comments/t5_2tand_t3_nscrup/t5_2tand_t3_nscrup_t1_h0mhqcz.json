As you said, guilt can be debilitating, and I\u2019ve been dealing with that hard these last couple of days. I imagine it\u2019ll get much easier with time, but right now it hurts. I always feel some kind of way whenever I say it hurts because I\u2019m the cause. I know I\u2019m never getting a chance with her again, and that\u2019s what eating away at me the most right now I think, but I understand now more than ever that sometimes it\u2019s absolutely necessary to hit rock bottom to learn about yourself and grow. I never imagined I could do this to someone...but I hope this experience really does change me for the better. Thanks again man, and I\u2019ll try to be less hard on myself keeping what you said in mind.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nscrup/i_21_m_was_selfish_and_destroyed_my_relationship/h0mhqcz/"}
