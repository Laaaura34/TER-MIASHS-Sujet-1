Are you genuinely looking to help? Or is this a little triumphalism that you\u2019ve made it?\n\nSpeaking for myself, as someone who has always struggled with one form of mental illness or another, and is definitely one of the sickos who do all of these things, could I ask you to join me back down in the planes of oblivion for a second? Goal setting is hard because people keep telling me \u201cit will happen,\u201d or \u201cyou deserve to be happy,\u201d and to just believe it. Which is nice. That would be nice. \n\nNow here\u2019s where I\u2019ll say \u201cI\u2019ve tried it and it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d and you say \u201ca ha! I\u2019ve got you now!,\u201d but Here\u2019s the thing, I agree with you about effort. You have to try. \n\nMY problem is that as I HONESTLY assess myself (in therapy as well) I have come to realize that I am 32 and I have NEVER been happy. I have ALWAYS been depressed. All of my actions have been driven by this irrational sickness, and both my failures, and anything I would allow myself to consider successes, are products of this sickness. \n\nThe thought of being happy, and content, and secure, and confident fills me with terror now. I don\u2019t have a coping mechanism for that.  For being \u201cNormal.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t be concrete in planning and goal setting because I seem to be chasing an illusory emotionally stable state (through the guise of career, or love, or esteem) that I don\u2019t know, and seems to be so common that at this point if I haven\u2019t even GLIMPSED it, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t/won\u2019t. \n\nAnyway, just wanted to be honest here because I am at least motivated to try and get better. Thanks for putting this out there, and you are released from Oblivion, blessings and happiness to you on your way. \n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/a1sa4m/here_are_the_worst_mistakes_that_are_stopping_you/eatp6og/"}
