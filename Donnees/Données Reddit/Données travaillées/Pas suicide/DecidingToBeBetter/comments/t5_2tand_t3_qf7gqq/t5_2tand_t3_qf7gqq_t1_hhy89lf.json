To me it means being internally strong, grounded, stable, emotionally balanced and non-reactive, non-blaming. Remove all negative perceptions of women from your vocabulary and learn how to honor women, not from a place of submission but from a place of integrity. In doing so you become something remarkable, powerful, unshakable. If a woman can rattle you with her feminine \u201ccattiness\u201d then there\u2019s still work to be done. If you\u2019re constantly attracting and desiring women who don\u2019t respect and honor you fully then there\u2019s still work to be done. Becoming a true king is one of the most powerful journeys and is not for the faint of heart. \n\nIf none of this resonates then again, start with what being a king looks like to you. Write it down. Describe it. Feel it. Ask yourself, \u201cwhat would this King do in this situation? How would he handle himself and hold his own sh*t in this situation?\u201d Would he cave to laziness or cowardice? Or his own reactivity? Or give himself the breath, the moment, and the space to be able to respond with integrity and virtue? (And kindness!) Celebrating you and acknowledging you in this, the world needs more true king energy \u2728\u2728\u2728", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qf7gqq/best_advice_for_being_on_my_king_sht_so_to_speak/hhy89lf/"}
