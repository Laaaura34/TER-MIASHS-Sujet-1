Think about the kind of person you want to be. Saying that, some people are not good at being asked lots of questions. It makes them feel like you are doubting their intelligence. Also they might not think about things as much as you and might not know the answer. When you think of a question, think about how you could find out the answer for yourself. Make some notes of things to look up later. If there's things you need to know the answer to right now, then you've got to ask a question. So you can ask a question and say why you are asking that if you need to.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/m6g36y/how_do_i_reconsile_accepting_myself_for_who_i_am/gr5vbdw/"}
