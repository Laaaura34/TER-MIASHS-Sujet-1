I agree with you on a lot of them - well, maybe all besides yoga \ud83d\ude09 \nI also try to find happiness in the small moments and gratitude as well. Some other things that come to my mind are: cuddling with my dog, doing something I haven\u2019t done before (newness feels so refreshing), traveling, trying new foods, catching up with an old friend, taking a shower, a rainstorm (I live in AZ and we are excited when it rains), a nice beverage (wine, beer, coffee & tea), socializing with coworkers, taking care of myself (painting my nails or doing a skincare routine), etc.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0loiv/i_am_done_being_depressed_and_anxious/h1x4ck8/"}
