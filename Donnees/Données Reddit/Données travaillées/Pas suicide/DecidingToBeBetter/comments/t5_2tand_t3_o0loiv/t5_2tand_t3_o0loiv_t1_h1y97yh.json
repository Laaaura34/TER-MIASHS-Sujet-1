It\u2019s great that you have so many. Hehe\u2026 I didn\u2019t like yoga either, I\u2019m not flexible at all. But I feel incredible after going to a yoga class. It detoxes my body and allows me to be in the present moment. I\u2019m now a certified Kundalini teacher. Kundalini yoga is something I was introduced to a few years ago and I love it. \n\nSo my advice would be when you are doing the things that bring you contentment, use your 5 senses and really try to be in the moment and absorb it all. You can even write down about your experience so later when you are having a rough time, you can go back to reflect and it will help you feel better. \n\nLife can be incredible, but yes it\u2019s not always easy. I went through my share of crap in my life, including severe anxiety and panic attacks. Now I\u2019m a therapist, life coach, Reiki practitioner, and EFT practitioner so I promise you there\u2019s hope for you. But you got to do the internal work no matter how difficult it is. \n\n\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o0loiv/i_am_done_being_depressed_and_anxious/h1y97yh/"}
