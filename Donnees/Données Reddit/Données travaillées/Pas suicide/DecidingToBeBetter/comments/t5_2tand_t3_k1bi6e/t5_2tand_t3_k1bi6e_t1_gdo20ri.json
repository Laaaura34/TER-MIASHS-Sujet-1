After day 3 its just the addiction/habit. So, I traded one addiction for another.  I used Breathsavers. Each time I felt the urge to smoke I popped one in my mouth. I had really nice smelling breath! My husband used the nicotine patches. Im glad you resolved to quit but also remember that quitting takes practice. I think it took me 5 times to finally pull it off! Finally,  I ask God to help me. I am not a religious person. Probably agnostic. However,  that was the last time I had to quit & that was 18 years ago. Also. I realized I couldn't drink while quitting so I quit alcohol for a month or so. To me beer and cigarettes just went together. Good luck. You can do this! Just find what works for you", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k1bi6e/today_marks_one_day_without_a_cigarette_the_first/gdo20ri/"}
