I remember the pain and moments intensely myself. \nMy dad didn\u2019t want to quit or try to. He knew he was dying so he went all out. He did have a baseball size lump in his throat and was spitting blood. \nOur family is about quality of life. He\u2019d rather have gone sooner instead of more suffering. He would\u2019ve been the perfect candidate for euthanasia or doctor assisted death. \nI\u2019ll listen to any stories about your mom if you want to share.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k1bi6e/today_marks_one_day_without_a_cigarette_the_first/geajeyn/"}
