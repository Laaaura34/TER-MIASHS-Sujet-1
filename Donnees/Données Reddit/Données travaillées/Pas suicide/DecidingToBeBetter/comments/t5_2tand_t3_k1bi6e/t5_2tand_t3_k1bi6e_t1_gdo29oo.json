I was already smoking 1 pack and a half per day, I was a heavy smoker. I'm glad I stopped, as it improved my general quality of life and also saved me a lot of money.\n\nIt is a very tough path, as nicotine really addicts us, but with enough discipline, it is possible after a few stumbles along the way.\n\nWhat worked for me was to cut smoking in a half by each week. On week one, I was smoking 30 cigars pd. On week two, I was smoking 15 cigars pd. On week three, 7/8 pd. Until you are on 1/2, then you stop. This regulates your body's need for nicotine in a progressive way until it doesn't notice it (it actually cheats your body lol).\n\nAlso avoid big meals, coffee, and alcohol. It pushes the need for nicotine.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/k1bi6e/today_marks_one_day_without_a_cigarette_the_first/gdo29oo/"}
