Like, think of a disastrous situation (or near disastrous situation) that came good due to your intervention; think of a group project that was difficult but you helped turn it around; think of a process that you improved or change you implemented that saved X amount of hours/money/drama; etc.  For me, the hardest part of the process is having interesting, colourful, relevant examples.  Have at least three great stories up your sleeve, then practice how you'd use them to answer behavioural style interview q's (you can just google \"Sample Behavioural Interview Questions\" for a pretty exhaustive list)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qcebrc/been_poor_my_whole_life_passed_phone_screen_to/hhga0fi/"}
