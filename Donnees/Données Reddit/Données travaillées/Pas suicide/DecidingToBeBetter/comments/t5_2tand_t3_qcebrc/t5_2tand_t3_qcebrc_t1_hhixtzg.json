But some good ones would be: a time you had to learn something, something you accomplished that you're proud of, a time when you solved a problem creatively, a time you had a difference of opinion with a coworker, a time when you noticed that a process could be more economical or corrected in some way, a time when you've had to explain something to someone without the same educational background as you, a time when you had to persevere through stress, a time when you failed, and the list does go on. But you may find that there can be overlap in what your anecdotes cover.\n\nE.g. I had to drop a course in college once - I can talk about stress and I can talk about failure using just that one example. I dealt with stress by getting organized, and I learned the limits of what I could do with my time when I failed to complete all the courses I signed up for.\n\nThe answers can be very simple.
