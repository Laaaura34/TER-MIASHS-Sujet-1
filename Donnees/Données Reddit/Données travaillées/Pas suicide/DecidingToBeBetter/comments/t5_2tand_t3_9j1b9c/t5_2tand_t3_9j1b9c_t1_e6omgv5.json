But it was different for me this time, and I think it is down to excercise. \n\nAs I said in the OP, that a severe dose of dopamine does something weird to you that time in the morning. I dont do the craziest workouts - nice little 40-45 minutes of lifting, followed by a little dose of HIIT. \n\nFor me that is where the magic happens. \n\nSo in response to answer your question. I am not sure what it is. But what I would certainly be interested in is hearing how you got on waking up at 5-6am and having that dose of dopamine, because that is what changed it for me.
