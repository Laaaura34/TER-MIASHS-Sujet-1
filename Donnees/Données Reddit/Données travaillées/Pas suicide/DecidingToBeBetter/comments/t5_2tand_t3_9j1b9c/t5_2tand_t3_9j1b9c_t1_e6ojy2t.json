Good for OP if 6 in the morning works for him, but you don't *need* to get up at 6 (or 4:30 for that matter) in order to be successful. \n\nThe reality is that at the earlier hours of the mornings, you have less distractions thus can be more productive. Less people emailing you and so forth, but it really comes down to discipline. While early risers are going to bed early, night owls can stay up and (with discipline) be equally productive.\n\nGo with whatever suits your schedule best, there are all sorts of famous people who prefer to stay up later and get up later - Putin is one of them. \n\nEdit: Might add that a lot of the time the success and motivation for life derived from waking up early - is more simplistic. Typically, it's because they're sticking to a schedule and being more productive. They could feel the exact same benefits, going to bed at 2:00 am and getting up at 9:00 am *(assuming they're naturally inclined that way)* it's about routine, schedule and consistency- not a magic time window.
