If anything on those weekend days it becomes some sort of a hindrance as I literally am waking up before my alarm these days. \n\nI think what works for me, and my god it takes a lot of self control - is that when you wake up initially, straight out of bed and feet on floor. For me its the whole snoozing that Fs up my routine. \n\nWeekend spare time though is a thing - I have been off alcohol for the last while, not a die hard avoider by any means, just feel that it helps to avoid it when doing a routine like this, so I haven't really been going out with friends drinking heavily so its just a spare time. \n\nThis year in uni its my time to just relax and do what I want - I have adopted a new approach last year when I started off with all this where I work really hard on studies between 9-5/6 Monday to Friday so I can take weekends off and just enjoy myself. So far going so well. \n\nBut anyway to put some perspective on your question. This weekend for example, Ill be up at 6 on Saturday, will probably do the drive to my girlfriends house (arriving for about half 7 or so) - that time of the morning will be no traffic, Ill be able to catch her parents and chat to them about all things and help flourish my relationship with them even more, then chill out with her all day saturday and sunday and return sunday evening - with alarm set for 6am monday morning.
