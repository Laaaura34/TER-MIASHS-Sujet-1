It becomes a bigger deal as you get older imo. At least for me. Post-35 I could no longer power through a poor nights sleep, I used to stay up until 1-2am and get up at 7. \n\nI\u2019m 37 now and I\u2019ve struggled with sleep issues for the past decade, but it was nothing a strong coffee couldn\u2019t solve. But I\u2019ve noticed in the last couple of years that if I have a poor nights sleep it will completely ruin the next day for me, which never used to be the case. Daily exercise and good sleep has been a game changer for me, I\u2019ll never go back to how I was. I still often struggle with poor sleep, but I go to bed early (9:30-10pm), to give myself the best possible chance of sleeping well and being fresh in the morning.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lheg5u/stop_neglecting_your_sleep/gmx8crc/"}
