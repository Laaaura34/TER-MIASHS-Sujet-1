I realized better sleep should be my New Years resolution, but I\u2019ve yet to actually try to accomplish it. Screens are a huge part of the problem for me, as is fear of my inner monologue. I find that when I lay down to sleep the things I\u2019ve been avoiding thinking about come to the forefront. Additionally, I feel a strange sense of guilt for sleeping, like I should have worked harder that day and therefore don\u2019t deserve it. I have no idea how I arrived at that feeling, nor how to fix it.\n\nHave you ever had those feelings?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lheg5u/stop_neglecting_your_sleep/gmzt3e0/"}
