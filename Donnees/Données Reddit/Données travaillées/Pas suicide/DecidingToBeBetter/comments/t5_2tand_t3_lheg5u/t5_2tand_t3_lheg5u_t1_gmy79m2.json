Something I've been doing to help me go to bed earlier is to eat dinner earlier. Used to eat dinner around 7:45-8PM (sometimes as late as 9-9:30pm), but this week have been aiming for 6-6:30 (or earlier if possible). I feel tired much sooner and have been waking up earlier while getting better sleep. Thought I would share in case anyone was looking for tips", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lheg5u/stop_neglecting_your_sleep/gmy79m2/"}
