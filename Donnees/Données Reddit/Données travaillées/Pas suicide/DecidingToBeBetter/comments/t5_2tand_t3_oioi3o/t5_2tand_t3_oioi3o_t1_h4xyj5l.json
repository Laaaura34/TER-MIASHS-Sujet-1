My parents always tried to scare me with over-the-top social consequences of certain character traits or slip-ups and even I thought that I fear no social rejection for who I am, these threats blew a critical hit on me with a few years delay. Like, I did not fear this until no contact, then I got detoxicated from the first layer of their bullshit and the real damage revealed itself. A pretty frightening experience, I have to say.\n\nBut probably this is just another layer of toxic mist that needs to be cleared out from my head.
