I will save these lines down for myself because I'm sure I will need it on my journey.\n\nYes, my parents were twisted and cutting them off was one of the best decisions I've ever made.\n\nProbably I will return to some activities I found overwhelming and frustrating recently to practice inner peace. This sounds like a great start to me.\n\nReading your comment you must be a very gentle soul and I hope you will keep finding your freedom from suffering! I wish you all the best! \u2665", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oioi3o/overcoming_selfhatred_need_advise/h4wuvjc/"}
