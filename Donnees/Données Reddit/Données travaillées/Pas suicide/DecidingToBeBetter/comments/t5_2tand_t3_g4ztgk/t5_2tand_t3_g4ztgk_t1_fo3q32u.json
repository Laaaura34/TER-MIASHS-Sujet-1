Was living with my SO for 3 years, miserable 2.5 of those years but felt bad every time I tried to leave. When I finally got out though I felt so much relief. I finally was able to focus on my career and health. However now I\u2019m recently crushing on someone new and it\u2019s making all my progress go downhill because I can\u2019t stop thinking about this person. Hopefully someone has some advice for us!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g4ztgk/why_am_i_only_able_to_be_myself_and_prosper_when/fo3q32u/"}
