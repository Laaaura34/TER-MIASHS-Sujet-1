I sort of have two such connections which mostly keep me compassed: 1) I've seen that evil is *real* and that it can operate through the smallest of individual moral failings and reek consequences that those who ushered it in could never have anticipated. 2) I see the future as *real*, and recognize that in the future I will eventually have children that will love me more than I deserve and that I will have a profound influence on the entire course of their lives, how they see the world, interact with others, etc -- that every delta between who I am at that point and who I could have been will reverberate through their lives long after I'm gone. This leads me to the inescapable conclusion that it's a moral imperative for me to constantly be working to improve myself in the present so that I can hopefully measure up to the image that my children will have of me in the future and the responsibility that goes along with it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bqyc2d/how_to_ignore_the_voice_that_tells_me_deciding_to/eocefpy/"}
