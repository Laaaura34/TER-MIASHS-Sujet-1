His fiance whom he's been with for 7.5 years went off to medical school. She ended up emotionally cheating with someone and not even realizing it. He had his suspicions that were undoubtedly confirmed by interactions with her. He broke off the engagement and went on a journey of self development. \n\nI can say that the books he decided to read along with exercising and medation has most definitely changed him for the better.\n\nI hope your journey does the same for you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gixkk8/girlfriend_of_25yrs_left_me_for_someone_else_im/fqitioq/"}
