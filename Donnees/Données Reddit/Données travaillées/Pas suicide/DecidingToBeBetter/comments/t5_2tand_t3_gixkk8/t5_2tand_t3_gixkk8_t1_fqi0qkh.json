I do agree it's immoral. And I don't really care for her. She's the ex of a stranger on Reddit. But I do feel like your motivation to turn your life around deserves respect and support.\n\nMy point is more, that I do understand it hurts. But for you the lesson out of it should be: In order to prevent it from happening again there are two things you should look after:\n\n1. Constantly re-evaluate, if you meet your partners emotional needs. If you do, she should not feel the need to seek emotional affirmation from the outside.\n\n2. If she still has the urge to seek outside affirmation, you should decide, if you have found the right partner or if you partner is worth helping her dealing with her problem and evolving.\n\n\nLike my whole point is: You made a good list of what to improve. But what's missing (from my point of view) is working on the emotional quality you have as a partner. \n\nNo stranger here can really evaluate, how good you are in this specific field. But I do not know a single person, who doesn't have to work on themselves.\n\nLove is feeling. But love is also waking up each and every morning and decide to love your partner with all of his/her flaws und deciding to not stop trying to be a better partner.\n\nEdit: Sorry, I'm not a native speaker.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gixkk8/girlfriend_of_25yrs_left_me_for_someone_else_im/fqi0qkh/"}
