There\u2019s people out there who wash their faces with body wash and a face cloth, meanwhile I can\u2019t even look at a face cloth without my face getting upset. \n\nOP, check out r/skincareaddiction \n\nDo a bunch of research on your skin type, and when all of this is over, I recommend speaking with a professional and looking into if tretinoin (a face cream generally only available via prescription) would be a good route for you to take. It is a little high maintenance, but I can not sing the praises of tret enough. It has been a complete game changer for my skin. \n\nI am a bit of a skincare nerd so feel free to DM me if you need help on where to start.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gixkk8/girlfriend_of_25yrs_left_me_for_someone_else_im/fqj6aw8/"}
