A few thoughts, if I may\n\n>I was loving, caring and **loyal** to her so **she's lost someone who loved her, I've not**. I'm glad someone capable of doing what she did is no longer in my life and hope I find someone who doesn't take me for granted.\n\nand\n\n>While I was with her she was a lovely person so I can't hate her for what she's done. I'm a little bit upset/disappointed about the disloyalty but what's done is done. I want to stay in contact with her, as long as she does too. I hope I'll be successful in my goals and that I'm thankful to her for giving them a jump-start.\n\nPowerful stuff here, dude! True power lies in letting go and moving on. You're well on your way to great things.\n\nYou've listed quite a few things here, some of which you're already doing. Keep doing the things you already are and don't bite off more than you can chew. Try building on top the habits you have by adding to them one by one, every month or so. And don't beat yourself up if you don't achieve all of it.
