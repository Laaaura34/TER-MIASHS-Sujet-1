I am simply offering a different perspective. One that doesn't involve so much pain and suffering in my experience..I understand that when two people enter a relationship, whether romantic or otherwise, there is a common understanding. But if new feelings arise that don't align with that common understanding then communication needs to be had and partners need to be open. If you truly \"love\" someone, how can you let Ego get in the way of their feelings for someone else? If its not your jam, then talk out what is your jam and then make a decision; to stay or to go. Work things out with the \"love\" of your life or explore something else. Whatever we choose is entirely our responsibility and should never be in reaction to the action of the other. Again....these are just my opinions. Take em or leave em\n\"", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gixkk8/girlfriend_of_25yrs_left_me_for_someone_else_im/fqmi2x7/"}
