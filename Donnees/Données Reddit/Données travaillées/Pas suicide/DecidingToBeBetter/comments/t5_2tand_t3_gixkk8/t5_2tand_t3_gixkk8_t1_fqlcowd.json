I never prevented her from texting other guys who she was friends with, but this was beyond the boundaries of our relationship, hence cheating (emotionally).\n\nTo my knowledge she never physically cheated, but I cannot say for certain. I would hope she wasn't disloyal enough to go that far.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gixkk8/girlfriend_of_25yrs_left_me_for_someone_else_im/fqlcowd/"}
