She definitely lined him up while we were still together. She was single for less than a month then straight into another relationship. \n\nI spent about a week wishing I could have her back. I was so lost. I couldn't believe what had happened. Then I snapped into a huge phase of improving myself. I said fuck that, I don't need her or someone else to be happy. \n\n2.5 years later and here I am as happy as ever - still single. She's still with that guy. Is she happy or not? I'm not sure, but I know I am. \n\nMindset is everything in life. If you don't have the right one, you will never be truly happy.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gixkk8/girlfriend_of_25yrs_left_me_for_someone_else_im/fqjgpkq/"}
