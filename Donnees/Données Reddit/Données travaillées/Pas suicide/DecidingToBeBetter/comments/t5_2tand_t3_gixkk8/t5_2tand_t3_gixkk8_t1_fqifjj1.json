Eventually you have to see yourself as good enough and trust yourself to be vulnerable again at some point. It\u2019s good to be motivated for more like you are but make sure to do it for yourself and not out of bitterness, expecting her to notice, to impress others, or to just \u201ckeep working\u201d and putting off ever being vulnerable to someone again until some check point. \n\nMaybe that doesn\u2019t apply to you but it\u2019s a definite lesson I have had to learn and am working on to this day. \n\nGood luck friend, I wish you the best.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gixkk8/girlfriend_of_25yrs_left_me_for_someone_else_im/fqifjj1/"}
