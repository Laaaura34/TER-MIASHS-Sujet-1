Fasting makes it easier to eat less calories if done correctly. That's not anecdotal. Also. The benefits of autophagy are known, those are the benefits that I'm speaking of and it's not some pseudo-science bullshit. Eating less and therefore losing weight also isn't anecdotal. Yeah, OP has to find his own way. Are you saying that nobody that has been in his position should ever mention what worked for them? OP WILL NOT lose weight unless they eat less calories than they burn. They WILL NOT keep it off unless they change their eating habits. That's what I did but that doesn't mean it's purely anecdotal. It's how our bodies work. I'm not deciding OPs diet. I left my own comment saying \"hey man you've got this! I was where you are now and I've managed to change things, lose the weight and I'm still going strong.\" I didn't mention fasting or low carb or anything, just \"you've got this\". I only commented here because dude was getting a bunch of downvotes. Now he's in the positive and I'm being downvoted. I'm not going to argue with people about what works. \n\nOP, I wish you the best of luck in your weight loss journey.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4696x/im_morbidly_obese_this_time_next_year_i_hope_to/hfzseip/"}
