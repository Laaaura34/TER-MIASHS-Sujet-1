It\u2019s probably the easiest way to lose weight. It\u2019s not a quick fix but it works.\n\nBasically avoid eating late at night and don\u2019t eat during the AM. You can eat whatever you want just limit when you eat. Most of the fasting gets done whilst you\u2019re asleep, all you have to do is not eat a couple of hours before bedtime and delay breakfast til the afternoon. \n\nAlso, it would help to reduce your sugar intake. Replace energy and soft drinks with water. Drinking water will also help with feelings of hunger during your fasting periods.\n\nI generally avoid eating before 12pm and after 9pm. Fasting is free and also saves you money. The great thing about intermittent fasting is you can lose weight without avoiding your favourite foods.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q4696x/im_morbidly_obese_this_time_next_year_i_hope_to/hfyzj32/"}
