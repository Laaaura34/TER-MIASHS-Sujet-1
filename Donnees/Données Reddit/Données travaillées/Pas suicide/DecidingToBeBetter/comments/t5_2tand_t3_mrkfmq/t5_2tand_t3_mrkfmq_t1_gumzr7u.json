A child raised by a narcissist can look rather narcissistic.  Much like a kitten raised by a momma cat with fleas will themselves have fleas.  But - you can de-flea yourself.  That early behavior can be unlearned.  You are clearly already well on your way to figuring out that you are not your pain, not your past, you can and are becoming - learning, healing, becoming better.  From one who\u2019s walked/walking a similar path - for what it\u2019s worth. I\u2019m proud of you. That first steps a doozy.
