You want to know what motivates me? Pancreatic health. No joke, I\u2019ve had severe acute pancreatitis (caused by gallstones, which were likely  caused by weight cycling ), and the pain was beyond  what I realized was possible. I thought I was dying, no joke. But I just kept living, and feeling it. Like someone was drilling into my torso. Afterwards I couldn\u2019t eat solid food for a month.
