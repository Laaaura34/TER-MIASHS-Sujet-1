I can't speak for anybody else but me, and let me tell you, I have had my share of wanting to jump out of a bridge and nearly doing so.\n\nAnd at some point my friends brought me back, and I became friends with God again, I found my center and I know now who am I and what are my values.\n\nWhat's the point? Because I feel like it, because at the end of the day I choose to do many things, I choose to sit down and learn a new career, I choose to work a dead end job that doesn't pay enough to live to support my studies, I choose to live with my family even tough things are tight, I choose not to spend on things I would like so I can get that study that will get me my good job, I choose to believe in God, and I choose to do what I can as a Christian.\n\nI am not perfect son but at the end of the day I choose to do so because I believe things will get better for me, but if they don't, I don't care, I did what I did because I believed in it, and chose to stay true to my beliefs.\n\nI am 27, I expect to die past 100, and if by the end of my life I get a glimpse of what's on the other side, whether there is something, I can sigh on relief because I was right, if not, if there's nothing then what a relief that I did get a life to avoid it, and if there's something completely different then let my last words be the laugh of a mad man who did what he wanted to do based on his principles and did it right.\n\nThe point of life is living life, find your ground, and start walking!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pc41l7/whats_the_point_in_doing_anything/haiechz/"}
