Best way to do that is to get outside and let the sun shine on your face within 30 minutes of waking up.   Just 2-10 minutes is all you need.  Don't cover your eyes with sunglasses, wear a hat with a visor if you need to shade your eyes bit.  And if you can, then go outside and do it again when the sun is setting.  This will start your dopamine production and as a bonus will help your natural melatonin production and help you sleep better.  \n\nSource:  [this](https://youtu.be/vA50EK70whE) Huberman Lab podcast", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pc41l7/whats_the_point_in_doing_anything/hahxakz/"}
