How do we know reality, as we understand it, isn\u2019t the other way around and we\u2019re actually having a death experience?  In order to have clarity, we must first verify what\u2019s defined as life and death, but since we can\u2019t have physical death experiences and come back to confirm it, all we have to work with are our physical life experiences.  We\u2019re only as good as to what we understand and we\u2019re not omniscient beings by any means.  There\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know, but this is how we fill our time as we\u2019re alive to do so, to find the answers to these questions.  If you\u2019re alive right now, then you must tend to your current state.  The other option is not living, but then again, it\u2019s uncertain if there\u2019s a consequence to that.
