I also appreciate criticism, so thank you. \n\n1) Are you saying that I should go more in depth with some of these topics? I try to find a good balance between giving good information but not overwhelming my readers. Also, I disagree with your suggestion to create a series. Usually, \"stand alone pieces\" get more attention. \n\n2) My goal with my posts is to articulate my thoughts on a subject, and to try to give the best advice I can give. I use a combination of personal experiences and knowledge from books and from my studies. You mention 4 markets. Honestly, I don't care too much about this. My writing is part of my legacy, and my goal with my writing is to speak my mind. I don't want to persuade anyone. I want to write what I think. If someone likes what I have to say, great. If not, that's okay. With that being said, usually I like to introduce my topic in a way that makes sense for beginners, and then slowly talk about it more in depth. Perhaps my content falls under groups a/b/c, in that case. With the passing of time, I'm sure that my writing will continue to change, improve, and adapt. \n\n3) Interesting point about the google searches. I think a combination of method and experience based results is best. I also believe that a combination of using logic and motivation is best. Are you saying that motivation is not my strong suit? Finally, I'd like to ask you why you fall under group D. Why is your ideology different from mine?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ob4xja/the_8020_principle/h3naoec/"}
