It does sound like depression and you seem to be putting a lot of pressure on yourself.  We are human and cannot be perfect all the time.  It's stressful and draining.  You've taken some self-care steps, but it sounds as though some counseling could maybe get you through this difficult time.  You may have to arrange your schedule to attend, but making this a priority will make you a better spouse, parent, employee, etc. and just help you feel more fulfilled by your blessed life.  Prayers for peace, strength, wisdom and guidance.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qg750s/when_you_should_be_happy_but_your_not/hi8xclu/"}
