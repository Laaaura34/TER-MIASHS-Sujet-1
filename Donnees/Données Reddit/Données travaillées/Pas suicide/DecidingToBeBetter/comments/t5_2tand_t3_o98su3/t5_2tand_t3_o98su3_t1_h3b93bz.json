There's great prompt questions like this can bring constructive reflection:\n\n\"How can I use this circumstance to my advantage?\"\n\n\"Is this situation unedurable?\"\n\n\"Is it impossible to still do something beneficial in my situation?\"\n\nThe secret sauce is to treat this like a puzzle. Yes things suck sometimes, and yes there's a lot outside of our control. But if you try to spot at least one way you can work with your present circumstances to make things better that will completely change your mindset. Stoic philosophers would say \"Imagine there is a trickster god who gave you these challenges so you could practice a virtue or grow stronger in some way, but you have to figure out what it is.\" \n\nThat's not meant to be a religious point, the fact of the matter is there's pretty much always constructive things we can do in any situation. Maybe it's just meditating to practice serenity, maybe it's trying something again and learning resilience, maybe it is learning to better deal with difficult people. There's always something you can find. If you train your mind to look for those opportunities like a game then unexpected challenges in life aren't really a curveball anymore. It's just one more game of \"how can I use this to my advantage.\" It happened anyway. You can't control that. You can control your action, though, so take a perspective that helps you instead of frustrating and stressing you out.\n\nWishing you all the best!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o98su3/any_tips_to_help_starting_to_focus_on_what_you/h3b93bz/"}
