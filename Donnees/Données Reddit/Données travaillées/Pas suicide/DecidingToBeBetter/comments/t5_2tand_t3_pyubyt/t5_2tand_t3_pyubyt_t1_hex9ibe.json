I have 2 kids (2 and 4yo), and I've found that a surprising number of things don't change between kids and adults in regards to sleep! As ridiculous as you may feel, set a time that you start your \"bedtime routine.\" From there, no matter what you do, do the same thing for about the same period of time each night before getting in bed. Obviously if you can incorporate things like reducing blue screens before bed, etc etc that's great, but before long your body will start to succumb to the rhythm and schedule. \n\nFor instance, with my kids we do dinner, bath time, books, then bed. The schedule does change time a bit, usually within 30 minutes to an hour of fluctuations, but we do the same order every night. And even when sick, upset, usual kid things, they pass out pretty easily.\n\nThere are always going to be nights where sleep doesn't come, imo, but I feel like this helps a lot. \n\nP.S. my husband falls asleep in 5 seconds flat.
