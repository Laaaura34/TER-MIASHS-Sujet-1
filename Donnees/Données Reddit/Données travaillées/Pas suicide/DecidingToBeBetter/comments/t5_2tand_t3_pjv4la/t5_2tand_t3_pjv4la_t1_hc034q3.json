All art is modelled off the things an artist has experienced, in some way or another; the same with all authors. No work is truly original nowadays, and you're not a fraud for being good at and enjoying reading and absorbing the ideas you find there; that's what every author does!\n\n\nNeil gaiman replies to people on twitter and tumblr. He's a world famous author. Shoot him a message asking about originality, and see what he says; I guarantee you he'll help dispel this myth in some way or another.\n\nUsing reference points is a cornerstone of academia, being able to parse text well and then recall your observations or understand and internalise others observations is part and parcel of this, and I can guarantee that if you've won awards, someone's checked that your work isn't plagiarised!\n\nThe issue here is not that you are a fraud, but that you don't have faith in yourself, and hold yourself to a standard no-one could possibly meet. There are all sorts of ways to address impostor syndrome, but my favourite one has got to be watching unquestioned great artists talk about how they experience it, because it really brings home the reality that most of us will feel this way at some point, and it's usually not based in truth.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjv4la/i_have_no_ideas_of_my_own_ive_been_a_fraud/hc034q3/"}
