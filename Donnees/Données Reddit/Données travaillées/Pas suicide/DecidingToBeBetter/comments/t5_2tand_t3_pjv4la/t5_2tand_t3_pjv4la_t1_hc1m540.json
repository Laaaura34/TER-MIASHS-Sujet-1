Think of it this way, you put in loads of work and studied a lot of ideas, which means you can now apply those ideas in a new way. It doesn't matter if the first time you use those ideas it is not original, the point is you have picked up and understood those ideas, and will be able to use them again in the future. \n\nOne thing humans are very good at is pattern recognition, and understanding patterns as a way to solve problems. What this means is that you should be able to recognise and apply the same ideas in other areas, and have a combination of different ideas which may be applicable or not. \n\nDoing academia is supposed to be a learning process, and a lot of what you typed out is really just a long way of saying \"I did a lot of research and I learned things\", which you should be considering a success. Sounds like you just need more confidence, which will come with time.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjv4la/i_have_no_ideas_of_my_own_ive_been_a_fraud/hc1m540/"}
