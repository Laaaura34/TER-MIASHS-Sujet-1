Like others have said, nothing is new. Everything is built on the context of what you have experienced - but guess what? You are unique in that all your experiences, all of the context of your being, is unlike anyone else in the world. That is where things are different. \n\nCombining things you read, putting things together in new combinations, writing things in new order. I can guarantee your college/university would know if you were actually plagiarising - there are systems such as turn it in, after all. \n\nHave you done any research/postgraduate study before where you were required to do a dissertation or thesis? Even if you haven't, your supervisors for your PhD will guide you towards creating something novel - that's their job! I'm in academia, so I can promise you that 'novel' does not necessarily mean 'completely and utterly unique, never seen before'. You just have to alter one thing slighty for it to be new - and you will have help for what that is.
