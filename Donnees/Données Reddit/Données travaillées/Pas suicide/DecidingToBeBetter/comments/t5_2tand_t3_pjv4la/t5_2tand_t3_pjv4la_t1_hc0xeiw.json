Well, that's the gig. That's what you have to do and what you've been trained to do. Have you ever actually tried presenting an original idea or interpretation for a paper?

If you're wondering what's the point of all this regurgitation of what's already there, though... well, there's a reason I never got my M.A. in literature criticism.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjv4la/i_have_no_ideas_of_my_own_ive_been_a_fraud/hc0xeiw/"}
