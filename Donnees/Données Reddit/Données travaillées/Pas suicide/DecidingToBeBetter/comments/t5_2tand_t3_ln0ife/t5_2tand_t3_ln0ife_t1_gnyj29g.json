Don't be so hard on yourself, be harder on yourself. You know what opportunities you have, and you also know what to do. I want to drop everything and just focus on starting up a business, or pursue my passion, or follow my soul for a better community and live for individuals, be it through STEM or Art and all the roles to play within those. It, your goals, can be done, but no, I'm not going to do that. I can't do any of that. I have used enough resources on redundant things, but that is my survival. I know it is not possible for me to be amazing right now. I see what to do, I know what to do, and everything is fine right now. So if it ever becomes urgent, or the unexpected occurs, I will have it all planned and ready to go, that is what I should do in the meantime. Be it alone or in cooperation, you need to build it, whatever it is. You'll survive as long as you want, the satisfaction will follow the struggle you endure. Clean your slate and find a routine, not on paper if you'd like, and follow that mental map you route. Only focus on what must be focused on. Maintain and improve while you have focus, effort, patience, and persistence. Find a balance, and I hope you find what you can do into the future. Don't think of anything but \"What should I do to not feel miserable?\" And pursue it through reality until it is obvious. How can you go about starting a independent life that you are in full control of? Don't be afraid of help or advice that is useless, ignore this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ln0ife/i_think_i_might_finally_open_up_to_my_family_and/gnyj29g/"}
