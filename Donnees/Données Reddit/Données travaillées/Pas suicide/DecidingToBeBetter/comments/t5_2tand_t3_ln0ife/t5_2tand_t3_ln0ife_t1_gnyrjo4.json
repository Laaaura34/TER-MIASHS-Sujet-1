We feel we will be judged, not taken seriously, or we might worry others when that is not our intention. It's good you got to the point of wanting to share this with them, because they are there to help.. and sometimes even just talking about it with someone can relieve some of the weight of it. Go for it, perhaps maybe you can get further help after that to a road of great improvement.
