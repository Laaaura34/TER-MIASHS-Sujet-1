Your parents are good people for taking care of you and i would do the same if I were in their position. Do you want a family? Do you want to make a lot of money? Use those goals and your intelligence (you\u2019re clearly smart from your writing) for fuel to just keep doing better. You always have your parents to fall back on if something goes wrong. You\u2019re lucky, go make the most of life. You only get one.
