I mean, how much negative connotation does that have? It conjures up visions of a mental institution. I mean, we get physically ill and talk about it with no problem. \"I've got the cold. I've got the flu\".  To say I'm mentally ill? woah, I'll just keep that bottled up thank you very much. \n\nThe truth is, I was mentally ill. I was anxious, stressed, depressed, and trapped in my own head. \n\nI don't know what will work best for you, but I started with a therapist. It was a much safer environment to tackle these issues. When I told my family about it, all they did was downplay it or didn't understand it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ln0ife/i_think_i_might_finally_open_up_to_my_family_and/gnzt4gc/"}
