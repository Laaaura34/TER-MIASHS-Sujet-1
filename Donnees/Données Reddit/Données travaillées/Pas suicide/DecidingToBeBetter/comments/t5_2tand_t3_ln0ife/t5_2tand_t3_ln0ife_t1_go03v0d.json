I could finally talk to them about my problems; depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation etc, and just talking about it helped, I mean fuck just THINKING that I COULD talk to them if I wished was often enough to help. My parents were there for me, they understand me so much better and whenever I need them to catch me they can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf your parents are anything like mine it will only be a positive influence on your life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for being 27 without a job being at home; I've failed at most things I have tried in the past few years, sometimes due to my health (depression, anxiety, cancer etc) and sometimes due to things that are my own fault or external factors. You have so much life left to live, you have a lot of time to make good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou say you're fit and healthy, this is a big thing.
