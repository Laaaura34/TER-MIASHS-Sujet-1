This is very humbling. \n\nTo reply to you :\n1) I do not have such a female friend. I threw away my female best friend when I understood she would always say amen to me and would never be brutally honest because she \"didn't dare to be honest because she didn't want to hurt me\". \n\nI'm new in a small city. I really lack friends and my work doesn't allow me a lot of free time to be social. I'm working on this, but at this rate it will take me years... and that's quite the problem - I'm really afraid of being \"too old\" already for things that take years to accomplish. :/\n\n2) Yes, I'm a keen observer and quite empathic when it comes to people I meet. But that is different of being with a woman I can share my passions and hobbies with. My ex-wife wasn't like this, and it wasn't easy everyday... so yeah, it would help to find someone likeminded I guess. \n\nI'll look for events in museums, maybe I'll find some interesting stuff, thanks for the tip ! \n\nThanks again to you.
