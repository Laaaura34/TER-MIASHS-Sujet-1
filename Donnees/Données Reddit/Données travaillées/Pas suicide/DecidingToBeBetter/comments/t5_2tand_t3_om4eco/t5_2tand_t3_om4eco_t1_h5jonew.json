Too many people accept a huge sacrifice of their life purpose for a comfortable but utterly boring existence. It's literally a devil's bargain. If I could give any advice to most young men, it's go for your dreams, and fuck the system. If you want to be a painter or beer brewer, do it. Don't become an accountant because it's a safe job and you just want comfort. I mean, do that, but only if you are fully taking responsibility for your life being slightly boring and comfortable. \n\nPS: I'm saying this coming as someone who pursued higher education and high level money jobs (banking & finance), and actually think it was ultimately a mistake. Probably going into coaching & sports which is my vocation.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/om4eco/you_will_stagnate_and_fail_if_you_are_not_willing/h5jonew/"}
