It\u2019s hard to know beforehand what one wants. Even when we get there (if we ever get there), we might realize it\u2019s not what we wanted. However, in the context of goals, you\u2019re sacrificing something be it comfort, time, loss of friends, etc. You decide what you are willing to sacrifice. \n\nYou\u2019re strong for battling the depression. You continue to make sacrifices which may be futile. But you haven\u2019t given up. That\u2019s a great foundation to work with and build upon. \n\nI hope things start looking up for you, and if you ever need to chat feel free to message me on here! :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/om4eco/you_will_stagnate_and_fail_if_you_are_not_willing/h5jhjir/"}
