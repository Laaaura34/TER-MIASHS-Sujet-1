It's an addiction to an addictive substance that short circuits the learning process in your brain. It's a matter of fact, smokers are addicted to consuming nicotine, people who have an alcohol habit are addicted to consuming ethanol(the same stuff that's in gasoline). \n\nIt's not shameful to get addicted to alcohol when most of society considers drinking an addictive poison to be fun. \n\nTrust me, get sober for a bit so you can sort out some mental health problems and you'll be well on your way. \n\nOne day at a time, I will not drink with you tonight.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ohv6nc/help_im_having_a_rare_moment_of_hope_and_want_to/h4rjub7/"}
