Write down each little thing that you can do to advance towards your goal, and physically check things off once you\u2019ve done them. It helps to write these things down, so that you have a physical plan that you can refer to each day. \n\nChecklists help, as you can see, on paper, how you\u2019re progressing towards your goal.\n\nBe kind to yourself, it\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t accomplish something right away. Take your time, and make sure to congratulate yourself for small steps taken. \n\nIf you can\u2019t identify a goal right away, try making lists of things that you like and dislike. Writing is a good way to organize your thoughts, and to clarify the things that you want out of life in general.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g5mdio/im_scared/fo4i9b9/"}
