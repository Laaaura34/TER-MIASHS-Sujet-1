I was a decent athlete, but was always afraid to participate.  I am 53 now, and regret not participating in sports when I was younger.  I still feel the same fear.  Although I'm now an engineer, my fear of failure still holds me back.  I'm tired of it.  I'm going to see a doctor tomorrow.  Wish me luck.
