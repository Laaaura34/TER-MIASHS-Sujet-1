This is called **codependency**. You seem to have it in spades. The gist is that you\u2019re looking for other people (beautiful women) to fulfill you. Of course, you have no control over other people, so your emotional and mental well being is at the mercy of other people\u2019s whims. \n\nThere is a cure for codependency, and once you have the cure, you will be infinitely happier. However, it takes a lot of work on yourself and time to get there. The internet can probably explain it better than I can. The first step is to stop relying on others to feel good about yourself. Are you working out to get sex or are you working out because it gives you a nice jolt of energy to last through the day? Did you get tattoos to make you stand out to women or because you think you look awesome with them and the tattoos have some sort of internal meaning for you?\n\nThoughts = feelings = actions. It starts with changing your thought habits.\n\nOne last thought: women are not tools to be wielded for your own personal use, and it is not fair to use them as such. Women are humans, just like you, with needs, desires, and feelings. Respect that. You\u2019ll find more meaningful, less codependent relationships and friendships, and you\u2019ll feel better about yourself in the long run.\n\nGood luck.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oav6ix/craving_female_attention/h3k2otq/"}
