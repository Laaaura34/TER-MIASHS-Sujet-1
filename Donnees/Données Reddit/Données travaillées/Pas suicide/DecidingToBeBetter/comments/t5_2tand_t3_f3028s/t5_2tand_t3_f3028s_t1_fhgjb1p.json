I find myself to be quite sociable when I meet people in person. I honestly do not understand how people can maintain a hundred parallel conversations on WhatsApp whereas I find it dry, superficial and clearly lacking in intimacy. \n\nThe problem is even more acute for me since most of my friends are concentrated in other towns and get to meet them over occasional layovers. \n\nI hope I'm not the only one facing this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/f3028s/the_importance_of_maintaining_a_social_life/fhgjb1p/"}
