You aren't late for work because \"traffic was crazy,\" you got to work on time because you leave early enough that you are always on time even in the worst traffic conditions outside of Acts of God. You don't come to work super hung over and useless because you knew you were working the next morning so you didn't drink much. \n\nYou do your job the way yours boss wants you to, not the way you want to. Your boss doesn't pay you to do stuff your way or do what you feel like.\n\nYou don't touch anything that could be described as \"drama\" or \"rumours.\"\n\nYou are forward-thinking and always eager to learn more even if it doesn't benefit you directly. You want to go above expectations whenever possible. That could be doing something really well that could have been half-assed, or doing something that probably SHOULD be half-assed but being really quick about it so you can focus on what's important.\n\nIf you find yourself having to look around to make sure you don't get 'caught' doing something, you just don't do it. You follow the rules whether they are convenient or not and make it all work.\n\nIt all more or less comes down to reliability. People ask you to do something, you say yes, then it's as good as done. People aren't going to come back and hear excuses or promises it will be done soon. Even if there are a lot of things that could have made it not happen, you don't let them get in the way.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7phmt7/hi_reddit_what_do_you_think_is_the_secret_to_a/dsi4otp/"}
