Trust is something you BUILD with others (e.g. your boss, your clients, yourself) based on your credibility. It\u2019s something you earn, it\u2019s not a given. It\u2019s not JUST being honest or being a good person, though those are important components. It\u2019s also about your skills and results (competence). You can be the best person in the world, but if you don\u2019t have the skills to be a doctor, no one should trust your medical diagnosis (and you should be humble enough not to offer it). Same for results. If you don\u2019t get stuff done, especially stuff you said you\u2019d get done, you\u2019re simply not reliable, and no one will nor should trust you.\n\nI could keep going, but I recommend you read the Speed of Trust by Stephen M.R. Covey (the son of Stephen Covey who wrote the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People). \n\nThe SPEED of TRUST: The One Thing That Changes Everything https://www.amazon.com/dp/1416549005/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_xfRvAbKT12TTZ\n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7phmt7/hi_reddit_what_do_you_think_is_the_secret_to_a/dshwa9l/"}
