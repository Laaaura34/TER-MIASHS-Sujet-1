I\u2019m trying to move through it, but it\u2019s hard. \n\nBut I\u2019ll never stop trying and I know that theres so much to learn and change and grow through. \n\nThanks for your input friend, much appreciated \u2764\ufe0f you take care too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bx4cqk/we_are_not_meant_to_constantly_suffer_through_life/eq64lgq/"}
