I know I will not change unless i do something different.\n\n here is a test if you are up for it :\n\nI am sitting at a red traffic light yesterday morning,  a pickup truck comes roaring up in the empty lane beside me and intentionally goes right through the red light. How would you suggest that i , as a normal human being deal with that?\n\nI can be tempted to do the same thing, \"HE got away with it, why should I follow the rules like a sucker?\"\n\nI can get very angry at the driver, even though there was only one vehicle in the opposite lanes and he must have heard him coming because he didn't move until the truck had roared through, so there was not even a close call, it is an unsafe and selfish thing to do.\n\nI can console myself as i have in the past with the knowledge that karma will catch up with him and if he keeps pushing his luck he will either get caught or t-bone somebody.\n\nMy program teaches me to not look down upon people who are selfish but to remember how selfish i can be and be thankful that i am not that driver putting others at risk just to get myself somewhere, i suppose that is the \"healthiest\" way of looking at it, at least for me, ok, you pass the test! : )", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bx4cqk/we_are_not_meant_to_constantly_suffer_through_life/eq4s6a6/"}
