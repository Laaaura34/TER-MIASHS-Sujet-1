I didn't think it would be too much for me but I got a fever and chills and had to call in sick to work for two days and put off all working out for who knows how long. Now, I know I might have gotten sick anyway, but I was definitely more worn down and vulnerable than I would have been otherwise. I am hoping getting a car and skipping those winter walks to work will let me work out harder at home.\n\nIt is much better to admit your lower capabilities than to push your limits past your breaking point. I got off easy with a temporary illness, but a lot of people will decide they're runners now and end up tearing a tendon or something. Build up strength and experience before moving to harder things.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/f1q14a/taking_this_whole_sub_on_a_walk_this_am/fh9k6bn/"}
