I started that habit like a year and a half ago and it was something that changed my life for good. I feel confident saying that i wouldn't be the person that i am right now if i hadn't started that habit. The fact of taking a walk outdoor by night without many distractions (car noises and for me sometimes sunlight) it is very helpful for the mind and for developing your creativity. I used to go for a 5km run between 4:30-5:00 AM every single day, now i don't make it very often because of my school schedule but i will highly recommend you to give it a shot, just starting to take short walks by evening or even if you want and it's possible for you, trying to make your walks your first activity of the day, this is very powerful. Don't want to spoil you so much, i prefer that you found it and feel it by yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/f1q14a/taking_this_whole_sub_on_a_walk_this_am/fh9wv3y/"}
