Better have the truth than live in a lie. On my 17th birthday I confessed to my crush and she said we are friends and I was excited even for that, since I don't have many friends, especially girls. Then I spent the next few months thinking that it was the best birthday, but everything spiralled down because fast forward to the present day she seems to ignore me, she acts like I'm a pain to talk to and puts no interest in our \"friendship\". Even if it was fun at the moment, I realise now my best birthday was a lie. It's better to not hang on on lies.
