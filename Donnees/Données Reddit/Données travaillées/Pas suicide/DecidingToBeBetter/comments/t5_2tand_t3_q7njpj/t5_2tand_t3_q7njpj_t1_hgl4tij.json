It wasn't until then that I realized all the ways she was holding me back and not letting me be myself (we were just not right for each other, which I refused to admit until I couldn't ignore it any longer). \n\nAfter that point, I feel like my life actually began. Even though I had just finished college, I hadn't been true to myself before then. I started doing the things I wanted to do, spending my time how I wanted without anyone telling me I was doing it wrong. I spent more time with my friends, found new hobbies and met someone new who sees me and supports me for who I am. It's been almost as long since I broke up with my ex as I had been with her, and I haven't regretted it a single day. \n\nIt may be hard some days but my best advice is find those people who are close to you and just **talk to them.** If you're feeling lonely, rejected, torn apart, anything - spend it with your younger siblings and the people who love you. You don't even have to share how you're feeling if you don't want. Just share that time with them. They're there for you, so let them be, and just being with them will make you feel better. You may miss the companionship your ex gave you, but she doesn't deserve it anymore. \n\nYour life is just beginning. You're young and have plenty of people who love you! So happy birthday - celebrate you, the person you are, and the person you will become.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q7njpj/its_my_21st_birthday_today_my_girlfriend_of_5/hgl4tij/"}
