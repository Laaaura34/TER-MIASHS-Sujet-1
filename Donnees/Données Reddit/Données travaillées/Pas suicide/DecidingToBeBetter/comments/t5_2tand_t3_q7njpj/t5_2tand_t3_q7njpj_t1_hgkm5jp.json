Ten years later I have no idea why I was with her for so long. You'll be okay. You're free to do as you please now. Once the shock has worn off, take time to reflect on what didn't work in that relationship; what you wish could be better or improved. Because you will find those qualities in someone else. Don't waste too much of your time mourning her; you've already devoted five years and you should cut it off there.
