That might not be what you wanna hear, but you just got rid of a cheating girlfriend! I\u2019d call that an accomplishment. And going forward, you can make new friends. Being lonely is much better than having \u201cfriends\u201d that actively drag you down. It sounds like you have a great family behind you! \n\nTry to think of your situation as a clean slate. You can build a solid foundation on this, and it sounds like you\u2019re putting in the work to make it happen. I don\u2019t know you but I\u2019m proud of you! \n\nIf you ever want to talk to someone, my DMs are open!
