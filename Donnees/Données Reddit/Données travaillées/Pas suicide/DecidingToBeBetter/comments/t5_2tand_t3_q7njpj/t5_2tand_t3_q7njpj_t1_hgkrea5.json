I am happy that you have such a supportive family for when life takes these unexpected turns. You sound like a hard worker and a bright young man. My best advice is just take care of yourself when times get tough like this. Stay focused on your goals, lean on your support systems, and take care of yourself physically. Don\u2019t be afraid to be kind to yourself during these times, maybe it\u2019s your favorite meal, renting your favorite movie, or taking a day off work to relax.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q7njpj/its_my_21st_birthday_today_my_girlfriend_of_5/hgkrea5/"}
