Similarly to you, I had a 5 year long relationship, that I thought was \"the one\", that ended devastatingly when I was 21. The heartache was nearly unbearable. \n\nA year later I met my now husband and we have built the perfect little life together. There are of course ups and downs, but looking back I am so thankful that my previous relationship ended so that I had the chance to meet him. \n\nChin up my friend, you have the right outlook on life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q7njpj/its_my_21st_birthday_today_my_girlfriend_of_5/hgo7pve/"}
