Days later, I learned she had been cheating on me for two months. The first time she cheated was when I went home for my (human) best friends funeral, after he committed suicide. Sad story, I know, but it doesn\u2019t bother me to tell it now. (It\u2019s been 15 years)\n\nThe point here is that I felt so rejected that I didn\u2019t even try to find someone else for almost a year. Looking back, it was not a noble decision, but a silly one. Had I only tried, I would have found out that there were a few women I knew that though I was a great catch. When I finally did open myself up to a new relationship, I found someone who I really connected with. After that, the feeling of rejection passed and I grew up a little. \n\nDon\u2019t go telling everyone you\u2019re not ready for another relationship, or that you just want to be alone, because the people that really care (or may be interested) will take that seriously. Leave yourself open and a new connection (even if it\u2019s just a new friend) might be what you need to relieve the pain. So, if you get invited out to a social event say yes at least half of the time. You\u2019ll be happy you did.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q7njpj/its_my_21st_birthday_today_my_girlfriend_of_5/hglmlm1/"}
