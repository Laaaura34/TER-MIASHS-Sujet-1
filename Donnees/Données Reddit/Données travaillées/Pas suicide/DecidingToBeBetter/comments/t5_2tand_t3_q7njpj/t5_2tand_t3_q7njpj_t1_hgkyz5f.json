FYI, I was chemical engineering, too. That degree opened a lot of doors for me, and I'm currently working a great job at something completely unrelated -- but I only got it because I was chem-e in college.\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your girlfriend, but at the same time, you're lucky to be 21 years old and freed from a 5-year relationship that clearly was not worth your investment. Even if it doesn't feel that way, you are liberated and should feel excited about the person you're becoming and the opportunities you'll have. \n\nIt's okay to feel lonely and sad. I feel these feelings, too, sometimes even in my relationships. I think it's part of the human experience, and at the age of 80 or so you'll feel a lot of compassion when you look back on today. I hope you make the best of your loneliness, sadness, and chances to live life. Best of luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q7njpj/its_my_21st_birthday_today_my_girlfriend_of_5/hgkyz5f/"}
