There are no bad decisions...as Steve Jobs told, we \"have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future\"...and i can tell you, they do connect.

Once you get out of her spell, it will be easier to see.\nGood luck my friend!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/79h0ep/im_terrified_but_im_ready_to_jump/dp3is2r/"}
