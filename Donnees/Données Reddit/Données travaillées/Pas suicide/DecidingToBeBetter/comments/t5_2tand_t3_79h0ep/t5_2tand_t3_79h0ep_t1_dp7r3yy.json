Staying true to the self is tough... wait.. no... no that's bullshit.  Staying True to Self is easy - once you're there.  You're situation though is that *you've got to get to where you are True to Self*.      I would just make the severe breaks, and then small steady progress forward between them.   \n\nSo your question becomes, then, \"Where do you want to land?\" and how do you make it happen?\", right?   man, i've written a thing to two redditors recently, I'm just ogoing to link it to you here, instead of taking up the space.   ([First post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/79wdgt/hi_my_dudes_how_do_i_reboot_myself/) & [second post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7a569i/i_need_to_improve/))  I'll sum it up here, though, as You need A Goal, and you need A Method to get to The Goal.   It doesn't have to be a long-term, hard-core, scheduled-by-the-month plan, but it needs to be a Goal floating out there.   You obviously want something.  go get it. \n\nAnyhow.  That's what I've got.  \n\nSemper Anticus", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/79h0ep/im_terrified_but_im_ready_to_jump/dp7r3yy/"}
