It's the sort of thing where I'll be going out to the store and she goes along, or she gets off work and wants to go out for dinner, so we go together.  We've been together now for over 10 years, so it's kind of hit a level where it's hard to imagine being alone.  Also, I moved some distance from home and family, and most of my friendships have dulled to a level where we just email each other from time to time.  That's what I mean by saying that she's all I've got.  I'd find myself in a very vulnerable place to be without her and the support she does provide.\n\nMy problem with a career change is that it really would be starting over from scratch in any other field.  Even if I were to swallow my pride regarding wages, it would take me 5-10 years to get back to a similar level in a new career.  I'd likely be going back to school,  hopefully a night school so that I could keep working my day job to pay for it.  I wouldn't have the opportunities for internships that I would on the first go around. So I'd graduate at 35+ years old, with no real experience and try to compete with 20-somethings who had been interning, etc.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3fhabc/how_to_handle_a_lack_of_interest_in_life/ctpmkpa/"}
