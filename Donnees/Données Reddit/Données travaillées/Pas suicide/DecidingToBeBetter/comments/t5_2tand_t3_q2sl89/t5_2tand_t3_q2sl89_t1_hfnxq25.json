I typed up a draft and was about to ask some friends if the wording was OK\n\nI applaud everything you're doing but I also want you to know that the above example is SO INCREDIBLY COMMON within my female friends. My male friends as well but a bit less so. Even the most decisive, self assured woman I know does this when it comes to dating. Point being, good on you for wanting to be more decisive, but know that its incredibly common behavior and there's nothing wrong with you for doing that. \n\nI don't have any advice beyond that you just have to keep making decisions. That's all it is. You'll feel a pull towards the one you want to do and the more decisions you make the more decisive you'll become. If its a 50/50 decision, I like the advice of tossing a coin and calling it. If it lands on tails when you wanted heads, you will feel disappointed and therefore your decision should be the heads option (even if it landed tails)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2sl89/im_not_going_to_ask_for_your_advice/hfnxq25/"}
