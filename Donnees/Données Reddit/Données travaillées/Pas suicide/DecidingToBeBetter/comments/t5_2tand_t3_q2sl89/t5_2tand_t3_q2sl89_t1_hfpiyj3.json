I also used to always ask people for advice, on the premise that I just want to get the opinions of people I trust to help me think of all angles of a given issue. \n\nBut then I realized this made me less likely to develop my own voice and learn to listen to my own deepest feelings and desires. But in reality, I am an overthinker and it is very unlikely that I would not already have thought of all possible angles - multiple times - on my own haha. \n\nGood for you for trying to stop that habit. Learning to listen to your own voice and trust yourself is one of the most rewarding things you can do for yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2sl89/im_not_going_to_ask_for_your_advice/hfpiyj3/"}
