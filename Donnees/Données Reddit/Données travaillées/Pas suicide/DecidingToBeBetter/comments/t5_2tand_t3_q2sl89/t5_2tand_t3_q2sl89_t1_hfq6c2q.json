Did you like the food you chose at a restaurant? Remind yourself that it was a good choice.\n\nOppositely, try and reframe choices that didn't work out, as lessons, not bad choices. This helps you reframe as steps into the future. Did you *not* like the food? The lesson is: don't order that again.\n\nTry and identify why you're scared. Is making a decision terrifying? Or making the wrong decision scary? Is that the same? Because sometimes I feel like even low consequence decisions I find hard to make, like do I want a single or double cheeseburger? Where as, sometimes there are big consequences, like, should I move to a new city?\n\nThink about decisions you have already made and build. Do you have a *favorite* ice cream? That's a decision you made. Also some are easier, for instance, is there a grocery store that sells it cheaper? Again, recognize that you have made choices in the past, and challenge yourself to make decisions now, then be conscious of the results and how they make you feel.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2sl89/im_not_going_to_ask_for_your_advice/hfq6c2q/"}
