I've been having to be exceedingly independent lately and one of my recent decisions - to change jobs - ended up being the wrong one. My old job somewhat reluctantly is taking me back and I'm going to be eating a bit of crow for a few weeks- probably a lot of my coworkers talking/giving me a lot of shit. I had boasted pretty hard how happy I was with the new gig... and then I only lasted a week there. Shitty managers be shitty yo.\n\nThat's the hard part after the hard part- Making one's own choices is already a challenge, and then having to eat shit when it ends up being a *disaster*... That's fucking hard. I'm in a new city right now, and I don't even really have anyone to talk to in my family about it either. Having to take that entire responsibility on myself, knowing that there's no plan B if I fuck up hard... Shit sucks. \n\nIt's been the cause of a lot of reflexion and self-reliance which is good. But yeah. It hurts. It hurts alot.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q2sl89/im_not_going_to_ask_for_your_advice/hfoxdpo/"}
