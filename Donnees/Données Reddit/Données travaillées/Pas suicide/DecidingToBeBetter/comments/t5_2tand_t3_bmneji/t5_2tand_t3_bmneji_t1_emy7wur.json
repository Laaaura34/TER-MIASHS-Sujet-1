I used to live in a college/resort town that was very leisure focused and had this attitude that you basically had to sacrifice career/financial success to enjoy the paradise around you, but I found that to be depressing as I was tired of not getting ahead despite working multiple jobs to the point that I didn't have time to enjoy myself. Moving to a new place on your own is hard, but can be worth it. My career has grown leaps and bounds by relocating to a major metro, and while I'm glad that I got what I wanted, it came with a lot of sacrifice, suffering, and hard work. If you're happy and getting everything else you need otherwise, why not try harder to seek out the one thing you want where you're at before making the decision to walk away?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bmneji/my_city_is_complacent_and_i_think_its_stifling_my/emy7wur/"}
