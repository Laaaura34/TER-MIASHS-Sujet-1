For example I messed up a practical in biology that didn\u2019t matter but I dropped out anyway. See I\u2019m so stupid, right guys?  Please tell me I\u2019m smarter than I think\u201d\n\nYou need to stop feeling sorry for yourself and just focus on what you want to do. Stop comparing yourself to others because you\u2019re not doing yourself any favors. You know you are smarter than some people, but not the smartest and somehow that\u2019s the end of the world. You know you could pass biology, but you\u2019re sabotaging yourself for some reason. You know you could have a relationship or have sex with someone, but you have sensationalized it so much and have high standards to the point that you\u2019re acting like you\u2019re an involuntary celibate. None of that is true. Just stop caring what other people think, you don\u2019t need validation from strangers. Just believe in yourself. I know for a fact you can pass your classes and get your degree. College is literally set up for everyone to be able to pass. You can definitely find a relationship. Just believe in yourself and know it\u2019s all going to happen for you. Stop fishing for compliments and complaining about yourself; it\u2019s a big turn off and will push people away.  \n\nSorry for being harsh but you have to understand that no one in this life is going to come save you. You have to do this yourself, but you definitely can do it.  I wish you the best of luck and I know you will turn your mindset around.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/prtefy/im_not_good_enough/hdocfsi/"}
