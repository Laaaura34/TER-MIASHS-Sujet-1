To be sat there on your phone says to me your not that happy with your job or you like being on your phone too much either way it\u2019s not a positive way to be living. I really don\u2019t want to sound like a dick but it sounds like you could be doing a lot more to be at your best and if you feel like your health is suffering with your current lifestyle you need to make some positive changes. Less time om your phone, exercise, eating healthy spending more time talking to people face to face and being present in the moment also mediation is always good", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/lqp3lg/how_do_i_feel_confident_that_im_doing_my_best_how/gohpzha/"}
