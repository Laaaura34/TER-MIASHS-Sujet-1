It can help to pretend you\u2019re in the presence of someone who would give you trouble if you were swearing a lot around them- like a really intimidating boss. \n\nThis has helped me because I am pretty afraid of getting in trouble and I may very well end up with a boss one day who is super intimidating and I would hate to slip up. If that doesn\u2019t work it can also help if you act as though there could be a kid around, this helps me in public bc I am actually not super observant of my surroundings especially if im distracted by a conversation so there very well could be kids around and that automatically makes me censor myself a little.\n\n\nBut for real - start with replacing the word or try to stop yourself in the middle of the word. I find \u201cFrick\u201d to be sort of hilarious but also very satisfying because of the hard R sound & hard ck. \u201cShoot\u201d is another good one, \u201cdarn\u201d - they\u2019re super corny but try to lean into it a little. Sometimes it is easier if you take on the personality of someone who doesn\u2019t swear and then the actual actions just naturally follow. \n\nBut also, don\u2019t be so hard on yourself. If you stub your toe you\u2019re in a pretty vulnerable situation and it will take time to train your brain to have a different immediate response. You should start by situations where you can control your response easier - like laptop not working? Take a deep breath and walk away. Don\u2019t let your self get to the point of frustration that you want to verbally express ur anger.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qfiqce/how_can_i_stop_myself_from_cursing_so_much/hi04fy6/"}
