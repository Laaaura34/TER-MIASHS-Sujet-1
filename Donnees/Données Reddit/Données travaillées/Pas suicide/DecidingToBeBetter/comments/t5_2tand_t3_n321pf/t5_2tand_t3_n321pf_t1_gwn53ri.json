If you don't know, he's a huge deal in music right now. Got some Grammys and is an absurd musician. \n\nHe said exactly this. To state it in another way, he said he observed that in the West (the US and the UK at least), we're all encouraged to keep working hard so that we may get the things we want. Often it goes further than that. We're almost indoctrinated to believe that, with enough hard work, we may finally reach the lot in life we've always wanted. The \"perfect\" life.\n\nClearly, this serves as a critique of modern capitalism, but putting that aside, it's a critique on the way people think in the States right now. Fuck the hustle, the success, the clout. Think about what you're feeling this very moment. How you're processing your surroundings. What thoughts you have, what emotions you feel. Think about life the way you've perceived it since you were a child. \n\nYour perception of the universe won't change. You already know what life is and how it feels to be alive, so if you don't like it now, you most likely won't like it at any point.\n\nWith that being said, everybody can enjoy life. We were made to enjoy it, so enjoy it and enjoy yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n321pf/happiness_is_where_you_are_now_or_nowhere_at_all/gwn53ri/"}
