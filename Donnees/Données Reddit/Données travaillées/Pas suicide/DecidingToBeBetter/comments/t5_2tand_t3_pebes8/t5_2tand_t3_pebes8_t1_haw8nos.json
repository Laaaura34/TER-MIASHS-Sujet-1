Don\u2019t confuse your mind with yes/no questions, it will only result in worry but accept the worst with some reasoning and be content with it.  For instance, Accept that you will miss the little events but it will be worth it.  Accept that you won\u2019t like the new city but you will gonna manage. Accept that might not meet the family again but you spent a good time with them. \n\nDefinitely, worry not gonna vanish completely in any case but acceptance will definitely gonna reduce it and will give you more mental strength to fight it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pebes8/how_to_stop_worrying_so_much_about_the_future/haw8nos/"}
