Good to hear that you like it! Feel free to use it, I will keep posting about my journey - about how it's going and how I keep improving my method.\n\nYou're have a good point, about not focussing on the number and trying to hit too much. I imagine myself trying to do 110 things, and \"only\" doing 100 in a rushed way, feeling stressed out and still like a failure because I didn't hit my target. No, that's not going to happen \ud83d\ude0a. I will find out what a good pace is for me, and the journey is as important as the outcome!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mm4b39/method_10000_tasks_challenge/gtp6cl4/"}
