I think that it will make the biggest tasks seem achievable because you divide them into lots of subtasks. \n\nWill you plan your day the evening beforehand or in the morning?

I wish you all the best of luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mm4b39/method_10000_tasks_challenge/gtq85uv/"}
