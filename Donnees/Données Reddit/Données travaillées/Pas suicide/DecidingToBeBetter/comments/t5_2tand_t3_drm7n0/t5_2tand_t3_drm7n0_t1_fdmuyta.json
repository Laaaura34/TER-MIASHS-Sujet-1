I want to make it clear \nThe point 1 means that someone born in a rich family and someone born in a poor family just a few example and in the book of can't hurt me what david mean by \"life isn't biased to anyone\" was he is referring to the mind if you use it well enough you will get what you desire  and everyone has a mind it depend on how you use it so if someone is doing well life is not biased okay \nWhat point 1 mean was life is biased is simple when you are born that's why he wrote it in point number 1 of a life.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/drm7n0/50_life_lessons_from_an_80_yr_old_man_for_some/fdmuyta/"}
