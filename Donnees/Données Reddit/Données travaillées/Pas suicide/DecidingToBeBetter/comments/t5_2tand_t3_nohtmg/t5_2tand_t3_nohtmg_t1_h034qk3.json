If you really want to get into meditation you can also make it a part of your daily routine for example doing it everyday before you shower or eat breakfast. Also don't start doing 15-30min meditations but build it up doing it for around 6min a day.   Make sure when you meditate that you are in a comfortable spot where nobody can distracts you mid meditation. But they will prob tell you this at the start of the guided meditation sesh.
