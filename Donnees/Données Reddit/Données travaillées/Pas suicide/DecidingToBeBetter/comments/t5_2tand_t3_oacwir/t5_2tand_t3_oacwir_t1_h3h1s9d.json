I despise that app. It is a hotspot for markets looking to buy the attention of users. It is true that there are some advantages. Nonetheless, I believe the cons for a regular person (not an influencer/ business person) are more than the pros. As long as one has these apps installed, one feels that it is impossible to let go. FOMO plays a huge role in determining whether you become a victim of these attention sucking apps. However, from my experience, deleting the App, and redirecting your close friends to WhatsApp/SMS/iMessage works wonders. Out of nowhere, you end up having plenty of time. Whenever there is an urge to get back onto this social media bandwagon, grab a book, go for a walk, listen to songs, plan your week and so on and so forth. Just know that almost everything you do is better than aimlessly scrolling through Instagram. Continue building that momentum each and every day until you reach a point where you don't even feel the need to get back on to these apps (YES it is possible!). \n\nIT IS ALWAYS BETTER TO GIVE MORE TIME TO YOUR CLOSE FRIENDS AND FAMILY (by talking, texting or calling) OR TO YOURSELF (READ, WRITE, COOK, EXERCISE). Imagine overlooking your personal growth and wasting time on a random person on the other side of the world trying to a weird body wiggle. Your time is precious, give it to the right people and the right tasks.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oacwir/limiting_social_media_my_observations/h3h1s9d/"}
