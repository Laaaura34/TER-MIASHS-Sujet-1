Congrats!! I\u2019m so proud of you! It\u2019s hard fucking work. I was prescribed Benzos for ten years for severe panic attacks and I was addicted to pain pills for 4 years. I went down hill past on the opiates. I got off both at once and had a bad seizure. They had to taper me off the benzos after that instead of cold turkey. But I\u2019ve been pain pill and benzo free for 4 years, going on 5 in Nov. Life is completely different isn\u2019t it! It was the scariest thing not to lean on the benzos for anxiety.. And it is the ONE thing I do miss at times.. especially when life gets hard.. but the alternative is much worse. You sound like you are doing so much better and are genuinely happier. I love hearing success stories like this because I can relate and understand how hard and impossible that first step seemed and the struggle of each step after. You got this and every single day gets easier than the last.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/htt0si/i_got_out_of_my_benzo_addiction_during_lockdown/fyke87q/"}
