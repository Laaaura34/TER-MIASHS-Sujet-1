First day was hell, I went to bed and told my fianc\u00e9e at the time that if I died in my sleep I loved him.  Woke up the next day, went to get breakfast with the fianc\u00e9e and had a grand mal seizure in the car.  Woke up a half hour later getting loaded into an ambulance, scared shitless, mind racing, full panic attack.  Since then I\u2019ve been diagnosed with epilepsy and have had a smattering or seizures since.
