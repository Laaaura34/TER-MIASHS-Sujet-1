If I feel like a big ol\u2019 duffel bag of shit but think \u2018I want to be happy,\u2019 that thought alone cannot make me feel happy, so I also couldn\u2019t just think myself into being happy. If I feel happy, but think about something that is framed in me with an unhappy association, those thoughts can easily alter how happy I can be. The challenge for me is achieving active mindfulness, which makes unifying myself more likely than if I\u2019m moving through the world focused on anything other than now.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pmvqr1/choosing_happiness/hckx3qh/"}
