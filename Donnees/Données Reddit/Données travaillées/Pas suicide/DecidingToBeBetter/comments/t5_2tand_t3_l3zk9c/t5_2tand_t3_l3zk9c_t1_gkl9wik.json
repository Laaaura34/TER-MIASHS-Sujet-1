You should really have a look into social anxiety disorder and maybe get some help. It\u2019s not even something rare, a lot of people suffer from social anxiety disorder, some to a higher extend than others. \nIt doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be 1:1 therapy, there are online courses around this problem as well. These courses work especially well, as people with socially anxiety rather not talk to a stranger about their problems. \nUsually they take an approach on cognitive therapy, helping you to self-analyse the roots of your anxieties. Usually with the right commitment most people resolve their problems within 8 weeks. However, everyone is different, so if you\u2019d need more time that\u2019s nothing to worry about. \nI hope you understand that your issue isn\u2019t something you can solve with a quick 10 item tip list. But it\u2019s still nothing you need to live with the rest of your life. \nI wish you the best of luck, you can get this solved out.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/l3zk9c/how_do_i_become_more_comfortable_around_people/gkl9wik/"}
