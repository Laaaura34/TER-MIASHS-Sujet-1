It's about someone they is also struggling with depression and feeling alone. She attempts to take her own life and on that moment, she's in a dream state and is in a library that allows her to live out all of the different versions of her life she could have lived. Very interesting, humbling, and uplifting. Got me through some loneliness/depression earlier this year. \n\nI'd also suggest reading Man's Search for Meaning.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o8msxy/how_to_improve_myself_over_the_summer_without/h3bylpu/"}
