After you do that, focus on what's actually important for you. This will help you do better. Also once you feel comfortable with your own self in future then maybe you can go back to social media. I will advise not to but if you want it so badly keep reddit but only go to subreddits that can actually be meaningful to follow.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivk1uw/i_cant_stop_comparing_myself_to_others_and_its/g5rxwhe/"}
