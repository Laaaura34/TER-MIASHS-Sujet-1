You could say it's blind optimism but I see your side as blind pessimism, at least the way you're expressing it. You're basing this on a lot of \"it could be worse\" ideas, but on the flip side, it could get better. But I'm offering a realistic, and functional, suggestion that has helped me time and time again, not trying pressure or push. I was in this exact situation extremely recently and it's what worked for me. I made it my focus and worked my ass off. Got a promotion as a result. If you get you butt moving the spirit will follow. Again, worked for me so I'm offering this as a suggestion. If you don't like it or disagree, feel free not to try it! I'm sure you or OP will find something that works for you \ud83d\ude0a", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivk1uw/i_cant_stop_comparing_myself_to_others_and_its/g5v8t31/"}
