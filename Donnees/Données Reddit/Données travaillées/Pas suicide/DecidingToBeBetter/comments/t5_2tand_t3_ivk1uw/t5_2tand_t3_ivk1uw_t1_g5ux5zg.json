What i'm getting at is that it's not a concrete solution. If you're comparing yourself to someone who's in college, or making decent money taking on a simple job could possibly worsen this no? \n\nAlso, unless you're putting in crazy hours you still have plenty of time to cruise social media  and the comparisons might get even worst because now you're making chump change vs the person you compared yourself to before who's really making the most out of things. \n\nAlso, you can always go farther than rock bottom. There are those who hit rock bottom but never get back up or wake back up. Idk I feel like this sort of blind optimism for something could lead to a lot more tragedy than it does success.\n\nThat said, you're right, it is ultimately on the person but thinking something is like definitive isn't always ideal. Something that saves your life could end another.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ivk1uw/i_cant_stop_comparing_myself_to_others_and_its/g5ux5zg/"}
