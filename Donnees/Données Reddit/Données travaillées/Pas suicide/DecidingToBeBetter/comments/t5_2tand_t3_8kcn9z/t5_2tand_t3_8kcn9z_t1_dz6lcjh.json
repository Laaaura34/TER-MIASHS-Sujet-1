I was a lot like you in my teens and even on into my 20s. Sounds to me like you\u2019re generally unhappy with yourself.  Later on in my 20\u2019s I started drinking a lot to deal with those feelings. (Or rather NOT to deal with those feelings). I draw parallels from the smoking bit and the not really feel like enjoying hobbies.\n\tMy advice to you is to better yourself. Quit smoking, start exercising and get out of your comfort zone. Go and do things around town even if they aren\u2019t your thing. Join a gym, go to museums, festivals, live music. Depending on how much weed you smoke you may want to quit or cut back. (Make sure you\u2019re not using it as an escape. Don\u2019t live a life you need to escape from.)\n\tWhen you are happy with yourself others will see that too. When you\u2019re out there enjoying life trying these new things you will meet new people who are doing them too and that\u2019s how friendships are going to be formed.
