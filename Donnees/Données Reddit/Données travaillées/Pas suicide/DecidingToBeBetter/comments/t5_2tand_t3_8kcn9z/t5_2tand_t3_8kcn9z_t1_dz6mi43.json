Stop hanging with stupid people who don\u2019t appreciate you or see your value. Find people who challenge you but make your life feel rich. Seek out people who have similar interests or passions. Quit smoking weed and cigarettes, those habit get much harder to quit as you get older and they don\u2019t really do much good for you. It will only get harder. I\u2019m 34 years old and I\u2019ve been smoking weed and cigarettes since I was as old as you. It\u2019s not worth it. The temporary high or buzz is not worth selling your life short and not getting all you can out of it. Eventually the people you think are your friends, usually the people you do drugs with, will turn out to not be your friends, they are just addicts too. Using each other to get our next fix. It\u2019s best to realize this now. You\u2019ll go through a period of loneliness and depression. But use this time to find out what makes you... you. Keep trying different hobbies until you find one that sticks. Let the passion flow through you and go on to inspire others. You\u2019re young, you can do it. But seriously the weed and cigarettes need to go. It seems like those things are cool in movies and in music and culture in general. But that\u2019s all a lie. I can\u2019t reiterate this enough. There is nothing cool about being a grown man who is a slave to his own addictions. It\u2019s like being in prison, but it\u2019s worse because you\u2019re the one who has put yourself there and holds the key.
