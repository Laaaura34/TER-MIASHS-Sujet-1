If yiu feel yourself getting over whelmed, pay attention to how your body is reacting to the stress. Consciously make the effort to slow your breathing rate, maybe get up and walk around. You have to short circuit the stress reaction.  Or, you can just let yourself have a little cry- it\u2019s ok to be frustrated and upset. Tears release stress chemicals- you will feel better after. Then just get yourself together and move on, don\u2019t beat yourself for having normal emotions.  Life is hard, and it\u2019s ok to be overwhelmed sometimes", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pvb4uu/i_cry_over_things_i_shouldnt_be_crying_about_how/he8tghe/"}
