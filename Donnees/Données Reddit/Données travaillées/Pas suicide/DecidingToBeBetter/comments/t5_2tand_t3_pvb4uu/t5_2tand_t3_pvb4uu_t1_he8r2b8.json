It could be part of your personality, it could be poor stress management, it could be a combination of heaps. \n\nAll I can really say is that you should just take your time. So long as it isn't shock trauma (generally catastrophic) then you should count to five. Shut your eyes, count to five, then decide if you should cry about this or not. Sometimes crying is exactly what you need - soemtimes your brain hits the panic button and the tears flow.\n\nYou're not overly sensitive. You're not a wimp. Your brain is just doing brain things.
