I appreciate the comment. It\u2019s sort of strange, but I think I could just quit them without tapering, because I can go without them now, without experience any kind of withdrawal symptoms or need/desire for more pills immediately. They just help a little when the pain is unbearable.  I\u2019m hesitant about trying cannabis, because my doctor told me if I quit pain management for medical marijuana, I can\u2019t come back to him for help. I feel like I\u2019m dealing with a two edged sword here...\n\nThanks again for your advice.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ln0376/decided_to_cut_weed_because_my_memory_and/gnzg6b1/"}
