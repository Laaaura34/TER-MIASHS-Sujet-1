I\u2019m now a disabled veteran on pain management and I take between 8-10 Oxy\u2019s a day to deal with my pain and they don\u2019t really help that much or for very long at all. I heard that you could get hooked on smoking, but I thought it might be better than popping these pills every day and the likelihood of having to take more pills as time goes on, doesn\u2019t sound very appealing to me. \n\nI\u2019m 52 and a day trader now and I don\u2019t want to lose my motivation, but I\u2019m also tired of hurting all the time. I heard smoking helps the pain and I would appreciate any insight you could give me on whether or not you think it would be better to just stick with the pills, based on your experience with smoking.\n\nThanks bro and congratulations again on your sobriety. \u270c\ud83c\udffc", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ln0376/decided_to_cut_weed_because_my_memory_and/gnzal8b/"}
