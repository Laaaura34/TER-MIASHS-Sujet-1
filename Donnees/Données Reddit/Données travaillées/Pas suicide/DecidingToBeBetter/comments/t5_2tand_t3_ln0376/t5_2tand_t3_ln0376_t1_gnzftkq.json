On the third day, I took myself on a walk in the forest and spent a few hours reflecting on my decision. it\u2019s easier to not smoke than it is to smoke. If I want a joint I have to find the weed, grind it, roll a filter tip, roll a pape, find my lighter, constantly relight it, and throw the butt away. Not smoking simply requires me to do nothing. \n\nI used to bargain with myself all the time. Only on weekends. I\u2019ll take a break for a month. But the last time I didn\u2019t set up any of those conditions. I just decided to stop.
