(He's 17 and has nonverbal autism and anxiety. I have PTSD and anxiety from his violent outbursts.) \n\nI don't want to give us more problems. I see many people in here giving up weed like it's just the worst thing. \n\nI don't even know enough about it to ask a better question than should we steer clear?\n\nAlso, we've tried pharmaceuticals for him, but they've made him gain 40 pounds in six months so I weaned him off of those.\n\nI was really hoping marijuana would be a great option for us.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ln0376/decided_to_cut_weed_because_my_memory_and/go1j9tz/"}
