I used to smoke joints, then I transitioned to a vaporizer cause I hated the taste of the joint, then I moved to carts, and then I gave weed up entirely and moved to Delta 8 (which was amazing for me since it was less psychoactive and more body high tbh). I started abusing it almost every 3 hours and then transitioned to once every night. I haven\u2019t smoked since Sunday and tbh I feel amazing. My mentality and decision making is the best it\u2019s ever been, plus I\u2019m so calm and collected. I\u2019m considering giving it up for a long while or switching over to using it as a reward once every month or so.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ln0376/decided_to_cut_weed_because_my_memory_and/gnyw3jq/"}
