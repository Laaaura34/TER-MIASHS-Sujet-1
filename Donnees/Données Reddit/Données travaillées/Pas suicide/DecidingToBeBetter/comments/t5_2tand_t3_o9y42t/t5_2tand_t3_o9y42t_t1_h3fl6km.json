You know, when I was going to college and working and married with two kids, sometimes I was in survival mode and that's okay, as long as I didn't quit.  Sometimes we just have to survive and other times I did great and thrived.  I used to be a long distance runner and while out on the course, there were times I needed to walk or lightly jog but it's all okay because I was still moving forward.\n\nHang in there and be right where you are.  Trust the universe and your skills to keep you moving forward.  You'll do great......because you know what you want.  Best wishes....", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o9y42t/after_dropping_out_twice_im_going_back_to_college/h3fl6km/"}
