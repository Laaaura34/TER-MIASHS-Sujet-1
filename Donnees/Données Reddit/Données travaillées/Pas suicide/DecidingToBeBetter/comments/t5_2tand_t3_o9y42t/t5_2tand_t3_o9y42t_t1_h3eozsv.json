Now follow through. Seek perfection in all your studies. Never be satisfied with a mere 90%--try for 100%--every time. Talk to the financial aid office--they are the experts and will guide you through--just make an appointment to see what is available. I'm 53 now. At 26 I was just out of the military, had no real skills, had some money saved and a little coming for the GI bill (14 grand over four years back then). All my jobs were unskilled prior to that. And my high school average wasn't spectacular and that was  8 years prior. I'm a physical therapist today at times and other times a YT'r on reinvention of Self and writer. If I can do it, you can do it. Hope that helps--Charles", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/o9y42t/after_dropping_out_twice_im_going_back_to_college/h3eozsv/"}
