Like a terapist or something because it sounds like you seem to know that you cant get better on your own and idk if that what i (or anyone here) would advise could help if your on your own to do the first step. Regardless i think you need a hobby. Something that you like and keeps you active. So i dont know you and have no clue about your interests so it could be anything from sports (gym, running, football, minigolf, billard, boxxing, yoga,..) to music - as example learn guitar by yourself. Im currently doing this because theres no better time than now for selflearning an instrument and i can say its really rewarding to see the progress. It brightens my day and helps me keep the momentum going for everything that is a necessity like work, cleaning, etc. Maybe try a new receipt, something small like a browny in a cup as a dessert. So that you instantly gain something from it and the active change in the other aspects will follow. With the current state of the world some things are harder or nearly impossible to start but dont get discuraged and try multiple things out. Something will stick, i promise. I wish you all the best and please remember that noone can really get you going if not yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mxrcf5/i_think_i_know_whats_wrong/gvrark6/"}
