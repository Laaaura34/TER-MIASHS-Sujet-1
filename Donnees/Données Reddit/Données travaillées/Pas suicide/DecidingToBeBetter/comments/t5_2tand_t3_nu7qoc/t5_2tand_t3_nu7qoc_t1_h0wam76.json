So, next time just ask for some ideas and give feedback on how the journaling is making you feel.\n\nJournaling and gratitude are great and do work. However, it takes time and practice.\n\nIt took me a long time to try it, but meditation partially helped my self esteem as well. It made me feel better, but also just the act of taking 10 minutes just for myself was satisfying. \n\nI've also tried reframing things to see them from a more \"selfish\" perspective. For example, I always make my bed without thinking about it, but now I try and be mindful and think 'yes, I deserve to have a nice and tidy, made bed that'll feel good to get into tonight'.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nu7qoc/how_to_improve_selfesteem/h0wam76/"}
