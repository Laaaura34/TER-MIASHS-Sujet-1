Signed up for the gym and have been going every day since. Started cooking for myself and my family. Started becoming more health conscious with meals and what I eat.

Other little things too. Feeling good so far!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jn9lra/you_can_not_always_change_what_happens_to_you_but/gb05537/"}
