I just know how (some) people judge. I didn\u2019t even want to be on it, but it\u2019s a long story lol. \nI do remember feeling wonderful before when I wasn\u2019t on anything but my depression/anxiety meds, & I was just as happy..unfortunately a guy ruined it in a nutshell. I don\u2019t condone blaming others for drug use, but in this case you\u2019d understand. Plus I didn\u2019t want anyone to try to take away the days I\u2019ve been free from any other substance. \nI take Effexor for depression/anxiety btw- it does take the few weeks to work but oh does it work. I strongly recommend it. No narcotic obviouslyyyy ! Lol", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g6vzsj/dropped_my_narcissist_bf_my_drug_habit/foquckc/"}
