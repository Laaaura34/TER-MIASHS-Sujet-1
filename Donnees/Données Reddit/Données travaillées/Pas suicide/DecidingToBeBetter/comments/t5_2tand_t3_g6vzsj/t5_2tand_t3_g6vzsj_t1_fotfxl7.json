Observing your emotions and finding ways of expressing and processing them was the main thing that I needed to learn after i quit amphetamin. You really need to watch out regarding the metadone, a lot of people actually get addicted to metadone. I don't know how it is in your country, but in mine the people have to go every morning to a doctor and get their metadone treatment which also makes everyday life more complicated. I would try subutex, which can be stored at home for about two weeks and is more for people that have a job and all, also less addicting to my knowledge. I wish you the best.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g6vzsj/dropped_my_narcissist_bf_my_drug_habit/fotfxl7/"}
