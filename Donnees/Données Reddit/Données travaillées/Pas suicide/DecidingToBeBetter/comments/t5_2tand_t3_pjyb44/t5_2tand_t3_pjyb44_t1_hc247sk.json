But you seem to regret what you could have done if you didn\u2019t got pregnant, dropped out, didn\u2019t start drinking etc. That is your past. Don\u2019t deny what you achieved and didn\u2019t achieve. But take it from there and think about the future (future orientation).\n\nThink about these questions. \n- what have you learned about yourself?\n- who do you want to be\n- how do you want your kid to remember you?\n- describe your ideal day in 5 years. Be as specific as possible\n\nI created a free course on reflective journal. Let me know if you want it. Might help.\n\n\nDisclaimer: I\u2019m a single mum (widow) of 4 kids. Turning 36 on Sunday. I travel with my kids and just moved from Ireland to Spain.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjyb44/how_do_i_get_back_on_track_after_ten_years_of/hc247sk/"}
