It sounds like you're on a good track considering you have no debt, you have savings, you're sober, with a place to live. It's usually pretty hard to go back to school as a single parent (depending on which country you live in), but if that's what you want to do then go for it. What you go with depends on what you value most, whether that be trying to minimize debt and look for jobs in your area, or pursue further education and take on more debt. No one can make the decision except you but I wish you luck :)) it's never \"too late\"", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pjyb44/how_do_i_get_back_on_track_after_ten_years_of/hbzt2et/"}
