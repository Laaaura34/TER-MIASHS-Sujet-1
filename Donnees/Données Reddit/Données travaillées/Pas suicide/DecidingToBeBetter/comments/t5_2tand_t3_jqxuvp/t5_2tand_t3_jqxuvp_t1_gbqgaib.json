I will say i just got a puppy and this mindset was further challenged and changed from how would i stack up to others to excitement for how it will all turn out.  She\u2019s not going to be the smartest puppy in the world, she\u2019s not going to know every trick in the book, but she\u2019s going to be mine and she\u2019s going to understand me and that is something I\u2019m okay with and am actually really really excited for.  What I\u2019m trying to say is, understand why you are doing something, if it\u2019s for you, then enjoy the fact that it\u2019s for you and get excited for how it will turn out, if it\u2019s for someone else, like a job, that\u2019s why you have a boss, someone who theoretically knows the process and will help guide you, so you don\u2019t have to worry about how it will turn out, they will let you know.\nLastly, whenever trying something new I\u2019m a big fan of quantity vs quality, just get in there and do it and start seeing how it all works, then once you\u2019ve got some basics discovered, go back and make things more quality.  Be kind to yourself and appreciate how you got to this point, no one is perfect and perfect people are annoying to be around", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jqxuvp/how_do_i_overcome_a_fear_of_practicing_making/gbqgaib/"}
