I\u2019m only 22 myself, but I recently got into a better job and that was kind of a trigger for me. It just kind of clicked with me one day, but I reflected and realized I was very toxic when I was young and hurt a lot of other people and didn\u2019t even realize it. Some stuff from 2018 Ish I\u2019m still trying to patch. But the way I see it, some introspection is the first step man, being able to realize that \u201choly shit I wasn\u2019t that great of a person back then\u201d is something a lot of people won\u2019t even think about. But now, my girlfriend moved in with me, I got some of my best friends as roommates and all is good. I think all will continue to be better for you. All I can say is, while you may never be able to forget it, maybe that\u2019s a good thing as well. Think about how much you\u2019ve grown and how you are now.  We\u2019re all human, people change as they get older. Happy for you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/owqdjd/i_was_a_horrible_toxic_person_when_i_was_around/h7hkt2t/"}
