It means the problems from the past were most likely not solved if they keep coming up in your mind. (former depressive and 80% cured now). First you have to get in your mind that it probably won't be 100% solved--we all carry demons with us--but those who thrive keep them locked away most of the time. But you start with a physical fitness program and clean diet, minimal caffeine, no smoking, minimal alcohol and sugar (note I didn't say give them up totally). Then you get involved in meditative work--15 minutes a day of tai chi, yoga or the like. This keeps you in a state of calm which naturally attracts people and keeps you from flying off the handle and engaging in negativity. And advance your trade or career--always be in a state of advancement, next cert, next class, next try for that promotion. This also feeds your emotional health and physical health feeds both. You will find the anxiety and depression stays minimal if you work on these three planes and when someone is positive, others will be attracted to it. Hope that helps--Charles", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/owqdjd/i_was_a_horrible_toxic_person_when_i_was_around/h7l4sbc/"}
