Just have to give it time. \nAnd working on your self worth. And realising that it\u2019s in the past. And that you\u2019re a better person now homie. \n\n\nMy ex broke up with me a year ago , and I was seriously such a shit boyfriend to her. I was a shit person in general . \n\nThis took me a long time to forgive myself for. Simply because I was highly naive back then .\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to contemplate your own mistakes , but you need to reiterate in your brain that you\u2019re a new better person now. \n\nBest of luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/owqdjd/i_was_a_horrible_toxic_person_when_i_was_around/h7i5gnn/"}
