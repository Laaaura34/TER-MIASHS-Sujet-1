So there\u2019s a possibility for you to gain a better perspective here. To reframe the problem, the worst case scenario is that you do encounter people from your past and you get to apologize to those you wronged, and ask if there\u2019s a way to make amends. They don\u2019t have to accept your apology or want your friendship but good people make the humble and sincere effort to do so, it\u2019s what people deserve. \n\nAs for being an anxious over sharer that\u2019s not anything to apologize for, and therapy can help unpack why you feel that way in the first place.
