Forgive yourself first and foremost. It won't be easy. It'll take time. Dig in deep and recognize you are a valuable person. Be who you are today and forget the past. You can't change it. You have today, this moment moving forward to be that person you want to be. Take time to figure out who that person (you) is. It's not an easy discovery. You have a lifetime to perfect it.\nI'm 63. I was a horrible person in my 20s and 30s. It took addiction, recovery, therapy, toxic relationships,, bankruptcy, and many wasted years beating myself up to get to where I am today. I was a train wreck. Today I recognize it and I don't look back.\nI don't act like an arrogant big shot, I try and be kind, and I try to remember to treat myself the way my mother thought of me, as a valuable person for no other reason than who I am.\nI've run into a couple of people I did damage to in the past. It was scary. Nothing happened in any of the instances. I tried to apologize and in all cases the person's said let it go, it was old history.\nStay in the moment, be the best person you can be, and try to enjoy your life. It is short, but you don't need to fill it with regrets. Good luck and God Bless.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/owqdjd/i_was_a_horrible_toxic_person_when_i_was_around/h7i8xw5/"}
