I was toxic, selfish, manipulative, basically everything horrible when I was younger. I look back on this with large amounts of guilt and regret, especially for one person in particular.\n\nBut I believe with every ounce of my being that I am a good person who is capable of growth, love, peace, kindness, etc. I know there is nothing I can do to change the past, for myself or for the people I have hurt and it takes a lot of pain to accept that. I have to tell myself every day that I am not the person I was then, especially because of how young I was and my life situation (which is no excuse for my actions I know).\n\nI am capable of loving myself and the people around me now, I actively try to love and be kind. I make myself and my life be who and what I want to be. My past does not define who I am now, even if the people I hurt once will always see me as the epitome of hatred I once was. I have grown and changed for myself, I don't need to prove it to anyone.\n Of course if I could go back and redo everything I would, but I can't. And I will have to live with that forever. So I will live in the moment with who I am now, and I will work towards maintaining health and happiness as best I can for as long as I can.\nEveryone deserves to heal and love, everyone deserves to be able to grow and change. You do too, no matter how bad you have hurt someone. It is a long path of acceptance, guilt, and self forgiveness that I hope you will be able to prosper through.
