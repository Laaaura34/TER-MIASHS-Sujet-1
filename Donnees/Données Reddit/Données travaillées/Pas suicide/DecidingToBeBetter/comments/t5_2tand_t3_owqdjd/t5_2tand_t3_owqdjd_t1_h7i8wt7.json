The only thing you have control over is how you live life moving forward. You can be good to people, you can be a friend that others will love to have, you can love yourself while acknowledging and accepting that you\u2019ve made mistakes in the past\n\nSetting realistic expectations and goals is important as well, as I\u2019m sure a professional would agree with. For example, sometimes what helps is simply reaching out to those that you believe you\u2019ve \u201cwronged\u201d in the past, but you can\u2019t expect forgiveness, sunshine and daisies, happily ever after. Sometimes they still harbor a grudge or ghost you, and that\u2019s okay! The only forgiveness you truly need to seek and rely on is from yourself. And, good news \u2014 you actually have control over that! :)\n\nAnother possibility is writing to these sorts of people from your past and simply never sending the message or letter. It can be helpful from my understanding, but I\u2019ve never taken the plunge myself so I can\u2019t speak from experience there\n\nI hope that some of this is helpful and that you\u2019re able to relatively quickly move into the next stage of your life, free of the burden of guilting yourself. And remember, something like PTSD or trauma or depression or anxiety is not a life sentence behind bars or completely unmanageable. You can successfully live a fulfilling and worthwhile life with any or all of these diagnoses. But, one step at a time, and your first step may be to discuss your end goal with a therapist that you like and trust, and go into as much detail as you need to with him or her if it\u2019s perhaps even just a matter of getting it all out there and off your chest to begin with\n\nAnyhow, I\u2019ve maybe written too much, but I again hope that there is something of value here for you. And once again, you are absolutely not alone; there is support out there!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/owqdjd/i_was_a_horrible_toxic_person_when_i_was_around/h7i8wt7/"}
