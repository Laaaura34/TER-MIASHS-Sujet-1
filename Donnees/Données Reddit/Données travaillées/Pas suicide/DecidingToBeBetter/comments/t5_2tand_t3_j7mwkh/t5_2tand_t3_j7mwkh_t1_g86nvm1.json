Then counting calories.  Everything you eat, just write it down.  When you go through the app it gives you a target daily calorie goal and if you continually hit it you will just lose weight, like 1-2 lbs a week.  Very simple approach that worked for me, went from 250 to 200lbs in like a year.  Just slow and consistent progress.  It's all it is.  But in the beginning what it really took was for me to just say to myself I actually want to lose weight, I will just do whatever it takes because I've just been kind of overweight my whole life up to that point like you said.
