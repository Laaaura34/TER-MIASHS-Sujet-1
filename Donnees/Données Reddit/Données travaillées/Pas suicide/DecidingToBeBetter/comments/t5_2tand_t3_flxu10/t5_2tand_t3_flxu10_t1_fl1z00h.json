Some guys don\u2019t realize that women want to get off too and that there are other things they can do (oral, manual stimulation, etc) to ensure that their partner is satisfied. It matters to us women. It would be like getting blue balls instead of finishing every time you go to have sex, if your partner decides to stop because they\u2019re done (early). Or make sure they\u2019re satisfied before penetration, that works too.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/flxu10/how_pornography_changed_me_and_my_relationship/fl1z00h/"}
