We don't know if they talked about this or for how long it was going on. If op and his girlfriend talked about this and she asked him to change but he refused then sure, it was his fault but if she didn't even try to talk and let him know what's wrong then OP is not to blame. \n\n\nAddicted people often don't realize they have a problem, OP realized it only after his talk with a specialist and there is nothing wrong, there is a high chance you will be addicted to something as well and the faster you will realize it yourself or your so/family/friend/doctor will \"punch you in the face\", the better.\n\n\nStill, cheating is one of the worst things you can do to another person, just because someone did one wrong it doesn't justify another wrong.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/flxu10/how_pornography_changed_me_and_my_relationship/fl1e1vh/"}
