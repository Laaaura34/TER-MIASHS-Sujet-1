From your foray into the stoics: amor fati. Whether you like it or not that shit happened, and we can only ever move forward.\n\nYou're passing, and that's all that really matters.\n\nThe degree itself may have been useless in one certain sense but it has built me up to who I am today and I learned a LOT about such a wide variety of things that I wouldn't change it given the chance. And ultimately it isn't your degree but your savvy that determines whether or not you come out on top. So don't discount what you learned as you move forward. Workforce adequacy is quite different from classroom adequacy so as you look to your future, relish instead the chance to remake your future into something you can work with. It's not a matter of jumping through the right hoops or checking the right boxes: it's about moving forward, no matter what. You sound anxious about what the future may bring; I'd say another way to parse the same situation is to look forward to leaving the bullshit you put up with behind. Embracing uncertainty and ambiguity is everything in \"the real world\" outside of academics; I don't know you very well but I believe you, like most people, have what it takes to meet those challenges despite the narrative your educational experience may want to weave about you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mqeqtu/how_can_i_start_being_grateful_and_feel_less/guge6x0/"}
