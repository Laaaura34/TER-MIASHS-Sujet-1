I\u2019m actually majoring in neuroscience as well as my specialty within my major so I think there are a lot parallels in our experience.  I said it in another reply but I really wish that I hadn\u2019t come to this university I\u2019d be a much happier person and the fact that I\u2019m now going to be pursuing a Masters here is scary and I legitimately feel so unqualified even now doing the work. Fortunately I\u2019m actually only a few credits away. I really hope it works out for you, biology feels like such a useless degree if you\u2019re not doing medicine or pursuing a PhD. I got lucky at least and did a good bit of CS and statistics coursework so was able to pivot towards that but still feel woefully inadequate.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mqeqtu/how_can_i_start_being_grateful_and_feel_less/gug116j/"}
