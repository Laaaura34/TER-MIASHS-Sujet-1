I\u2019ve been focusing a lot on my inner child and shadow self and it\u2019s been vital during all of this work. \n\nThe first key is definitely realizing what we\u2019re constantly doing no longer works for us. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a process for sure! I do really well sometimes and fall a little bit short in others but I learn every time and it\u2019s helpful to be like, oh yeah- that really doesn\u2019t work for me! Forgot for a sec... oops! Or when i ignore my intuition and then I\u2019m like whhyyyyy did I do that!? Looking at it as an experiment has been super important for me too because I\u2019m not beating myself up since there is a learning curve and we always do the best we can at any given moment. \n\nThanks so much for your kind words and sharing your experience. I know what it\u2019s like to stay way longer than I would\u2019ve liked or then was good for me but truth is I know certain relationships had to unfold the way they did to lead me to where I am now. It\u2019s impossible to see the bigger picture when you\u2019re in it and when things are still aligning. \n\nI\u2019m glad we are not alone and experiencing similar revelations. It\u2019s pretty cool.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfwbwr/get_comfortable_with_being_uncomfortable_its_the/fpxaont/"}
