I\u2019m very happy you\u2019re growing and developing a sense of self-confidence. \n\nIn OCD, one of the best ways to heal from an obsession is to do exposure therapy. Basically, it means to expose yourself to what is making you uncomfortable and not do anything about it. An Obsessive-Compulsive Person would have something known as a \u201critual\u201d, which is an activity they must do as an urge to calm down the anxiety. Once you expose yourself to your fears and let the anxiety succumb you end up teaching your brain that their is nothing to fear, allowing one to drop the obsession and improving their relationship with life.\n\nI\u2019ve dealt with all kinds of illusions throughout my life. My best way to deal with it is: allow yourself to feel it. Be mindful, though. Don\u2019t fall for the illusions of anxiety; anxiety can try to convince you that anything is \u201creal\u201d. Ignore it, let it be, until you slowly start to heal and no longer fear what\u2019s troubling you. It is then that you have officially let it go.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfwbwr/get_comfortable_with_being_uncomfortable_its_the/fpxcao8/"}
