Our relationship is better than ever and she is my greatest teacher in many ways (as well as my biggest trigger). My dad passed away last year from a long term battle with Parkinson\u2019s and dementia and that was a big moment for us and understanding what truly matters. I love her but she is still extremely toxic at times, but is on her own journey and working through a lot of her childhood stuff right now which has brought us closer.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gfwbwr/get_comfortable_with_being_uncomfortable_its_the/fpzy5n3/"}
