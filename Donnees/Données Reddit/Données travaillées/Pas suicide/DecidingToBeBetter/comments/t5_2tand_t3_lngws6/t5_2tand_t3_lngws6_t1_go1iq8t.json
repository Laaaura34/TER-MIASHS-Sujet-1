I found myself feeling the same emotions you expressed throughout your journey in your post and the pain you must have endured. Even though it was super tough you managed to take a step back and reevaluate which is major and even harder to do. Especially when you're going through something like you endured. I've been really struggling with my academia since last year and this post really helped me to know that I have the power to change that. Thank you for sharing your story and this internet stranger is so proud of you! You better go celebrate your awesomeness!!
