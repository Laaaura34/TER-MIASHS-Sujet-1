Which you could build by respecting yourself and acting in a way that is better for your \"higher\" self. \n\nThe first step has to be self-talk. Calling yourself an idiot is not going to help. You'll feel stupid for thinking you ACTUALLY AREN'T an idiot, but that's because depression speaks loud. But being louder doesn't help win the argument. \n\nAlong with actively changing your perception of yourself, you need to reinforce that self-talk. Set goals for yourself and start small. If you want to lose weight, start by cutting out soda. When you choose water over soda, give yourself a pat on the back. Literally say good job to yourself, either out loud or in your mind. If you drink soda instead of water, just be nice to yourself and try again next time. Your mind will jump to calling yourself an idiot, but you need to consciously catch and challenge that thought.  \n\nIf you overwhelm yourself with a massive amount of work, then you'll burn out. Right now, your brain still needs those unhealthy coping mechanisms. Don't expect results right away, but I can guarantee as long as you go in the right direction you will get to where you want to be. \n\nThis won't cure your depression though. Some days you'll fall much harder, but the important thing is to try again when you can. Don't give up on all your progress.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/89rm30/how_do_i_turn_my_darkness_into_light/dwt6fvn/"}
