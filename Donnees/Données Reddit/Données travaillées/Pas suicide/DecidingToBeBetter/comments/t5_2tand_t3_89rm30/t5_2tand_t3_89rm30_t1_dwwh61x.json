Continue to approve only virtuous and valuable information vocally or written and as publicly as you can. Never argue their authenticity with anyone because you may just corrupt the instructions your brain received. You believe it is verified so what will you gain by arguing about truth with someone else. \n\nI expect you will be in weak spots very frequently for sometime friend, especially as this is a cocoon phase for you but I assure you that every caterpillar that enters a cocoon is expected to emerge from the cocoon as a beautiful butterfly. You, friend, are coming out of this season of your life as a beautiful butterfly, trust me. In Jesus Name.\n\nI support your cause to reach the light even through this darkness because I am also walking daily, perseveringly and steadily towards the light myself. Cheers!! \n\n", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/89rm30/how_do_i_turn_my_darkness_into_light/dwwh61x/"}
