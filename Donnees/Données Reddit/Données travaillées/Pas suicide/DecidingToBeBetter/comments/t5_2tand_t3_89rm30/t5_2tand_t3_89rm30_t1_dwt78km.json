I\u2019m working my way out of a very similar situation.\n\nSomething that helped me out (I also ruminate on thoughts) was cutting coupons and taping them to the item at the store.  At first I just did it to have a distraction in my mind, I could think of the smiles people would have, who would likely use it, etc. and I didn\u2019t have to think about my own thoughts. \n\nIt\u2019s a Random act of kindness, getting out of the house, and a task accomplished sort of endorphin rush.  Its easy, because you don\u2019t have to interact with people unless you want to.  It\u2019s good for the soul.\n\nI started doing it more often.  Eventually, I began doing it whenever the circulars arrived.  I took a shower.  I brought my dog.  I made a date of it. \n\nIt became a solid, predictable event in my life that\u2019s something to look forward to and is easy to build upon.  I leave basil cuttings in front sometimes with a sign to \u2018take me\u2019.  There\u2019s always an old granny \u2018ooh-ing\u2019 over them when I get back outside and I can choose to reveal to them that it was me, or not, but let me tell you, appreciative old ladies are some of the BEST self esteem lifters.  \n\nIt sounds like you could use a similar lift.  If you can try not to focus on yourself so much when you\u2019re so down.  Direct your attention elsewhere and only let it return when it behaves.   Is there anything in your life that you could do to make other people smile?\n\n\nFeel free to PM me if you need an ear, I\u2019m here to listen to whatever you need to say.  :)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/89rm30/how_do_i_turn_my_darkness_into_light/dwt78km/"}
