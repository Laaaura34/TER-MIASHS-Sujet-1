I've been diagnosed with depression 3 times in the past. I share that as hopefully showing you that it is a period of your life but not who you are or who you always will be. I found in the end that meds on the smallest dose didn't cure anything but kept me level enough to not go to the darkest places. It's not for everyone but just saying from my own experience. I ended finding meditation and yoga as a prevention to going back into the dark. My trigger is worthlessness, but it got worst projecting the bad situation or feelings as if it would always be that way. You only have right now, and if you're breathing you're doing ok. Don't worry about tomorrow. Don't worry if you'll never this or that. Your job is to survive right now. And then the next minute. And then the next minute. And eventually those minutes will add up to you having a pretty good hour, or day, or week, or month. \n\nNo one else will solve this either and no one else is better or worse. More light is good. More dark is good too. You are great for who you are knowing that you are imperfect. Hang in there. 22 is tough. It will get better. It may also get worse. But it will also get better again. Remember that there are people who get you, who've been through it, and it is worth you surviving. You're going to make the world a better place one day. Even if you impact only one other person's life, that is important. It's too early to give up. ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/89rm30/how_do_i_turn_my_darkness_into_light/dwt64i9/"}
