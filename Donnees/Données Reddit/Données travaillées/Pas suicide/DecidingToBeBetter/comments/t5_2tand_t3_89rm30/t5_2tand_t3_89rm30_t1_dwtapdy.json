Asking for help, for me, was absolutely the hardest thing. Telling the psychologist that I was sick of having to try so hard to be okay reduced me to tears.\n\nBut...\n\nI have been in therapy for 2 years, and got lucky with a medication that works, and I have worked damn hard on myself so that the down times aren't so bad, and I am at peace in my head.\n\nThe fact is that you've already begun to succeed if you have decided to get help. Know that the work you put in is the success. Every day that you try, and every day that you work on being a healthier you is an awesome successful day. Don't mind the down moments, and don't fear them. They will pass and you will continue to get better.\n\nGood luck", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/89rm30/how_do_i_turn_my_darkness_into_light/dwtapdy/"}
