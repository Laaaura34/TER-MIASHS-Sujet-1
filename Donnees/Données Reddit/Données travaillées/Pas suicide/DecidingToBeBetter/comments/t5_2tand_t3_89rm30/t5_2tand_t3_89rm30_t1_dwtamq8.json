I highly recommend you listen to Jordan Peterson's lectures.IMO There is no greater modern inspiration than him. He is just fantastic and guides you in gaining a purpose in life.I was bullied relentlessly in college for believing in god and I almost became a nihilist until I stumbled upon this man. This man's logic and rationalism is just stunning.\n\n[This is a good video to begin with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi-RT1jYP_A) \n\nAlso listening to him alone is not enough, once you define a purpose for yourself, get on your ass start setting goals and work on them with diligence and discipline. You are just 22, you have a long way to go and loaads of time. I believe in you!  \n\n\nI wish you all the very best. And do share your progress, that helps you gain further motivation .", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/89rm30/how_do_i_turn_my_darkness_into_light/dwtamq8/"}
