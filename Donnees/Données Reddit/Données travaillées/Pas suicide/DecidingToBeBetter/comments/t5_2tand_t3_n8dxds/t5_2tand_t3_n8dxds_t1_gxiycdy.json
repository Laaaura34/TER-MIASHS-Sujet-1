It's always nice to have more options. SMART is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, and is a skill-based methodology to learn how to better understand the science of addiction and reframe our thinking that has brought us back to addictive behaviors again and again. It does tend to lack the social support element of NA (no sponsors, less time spent on processing during meetings), so it's definitely not for everyone. They are doing meetings over zoom during the pandemic through their online portal, SROL.\n\nGlad you are ok and working towards a better life for yourself.
