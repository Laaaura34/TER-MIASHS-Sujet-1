You want to be proud of yourself for achieving your self improvement goal, right? Me too. \n\nThis weekend I set myself the goal of always being productive and not procrastinating. But when I woke up on Saturday I imagined how I'm gonna feel after forcing myself to work on my long-term self improvement, and I realized I was gonna feel DEPRESSED. \n\nI realized that I had set all of these goals for my super long term happiness, and none for my immediate happiness. What's the point of that? Isn't my ultimate motivation for Deciding To Be Better the idea that I want to be HAPPY in the future? Then why not be happy NOW?\n\nI don't think you should quit ANY of those things, if you do them because you enjoy them. \n\nSo, are you watching Netflix because you enjoy it? Then keep watching. \n\nAre you watching Netflix because you are lonely? Did you feel less lonely after watching? Yes--good. No--OK, go do something else for your loneliness like joining a group activity. Etc.\n\nTL;DR: \n\nSo you're depressed and want find a deeper long-term enjoyment of life. How did you learn that? By paying attention to your long-term feelings. How do you change your long term enjoyment? By paying attention to your short-term feelings. (AND by being patient. Let your feelings run their course, let them out somehow, even if it's in the form of awful poetry that you immediately delete.)\n\nAfter writing this out, I feel kind of lonely too. I guess I'll try to get outside and see some people. I don't have any friends around but whatever, gotta make an effort.
