You want other people to tel you how to be the best you. Only YOU can figure that out. \n\nYou're trying to change your overall self to fit this image of what you think is the perfect or optimal teenager. Why? Why are those things so important to you? \n\nDo you think listening to classical music will make you a better person? Do you really think no fapping is going to cut it as a hormonal teenager? \n\nLike I said in my other comment, the underlying issue is you need to talk to someone professional about all of this. Have them help you sort out why you want to change so drastically, and how to achieve what you're looking for without having to do that.
