We are living through some difficult times now and it must be hard to be celebrating when the whole world is suffering. It likely isn\u2019t how you expected it to be. \n\nLeaving high school is also difficult, as you spent years with people and everyone is heading off in different directions. It\u2019s okay to grieve that. \n\nIt may also be worrisome that college will be harder than high school. You can do this! \n\nYou have achieved something incredible. And it\u2019s okay to not be sure of where to go next, or to change your mind about that. I would say that you have a very big challenge ahead of you. If this challenge is maybe not the one you had in mind, then being at college may give you an opportunity to figure out where you really want to go in life. One thing you appear to have is opportunities.\n\nSummer is a time to rest, relax, ponder, maybe work, or volunteer. It\u2019s okay to not feel great about it and it\u2019s okay to be proud you accomplished this.\n\nIf you continue to feel this lack of joy, you can always talk to someone at the campus health office, as lots of people feel this way.\n\nAnd congrats... it may not make you feel better, but I have to say it because you did something great, and during what is a very difficult time for everyone.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/nlkhjw/feel_pretty_lost_after_achieving_a_lifelong_goal/gzj2ntx/"}
