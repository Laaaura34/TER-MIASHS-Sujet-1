I identify with your situation way too much, so maybe I'm biased, but you know your intentions.  You know you didn't want to make those people feel bad.  It was a misunderstanding, and now you have a chance to get people to see what you're really about and not be scared of you.\n\nDon't change too much, just change how you relate to people.  Hey, what might help people to understand that you meant no harm, is to turn that humour onto yourself and make it clear that you can take a joke about your own faults, so your jokes don't represent a judgment on others.  You still should get to be funny, just be the volunteer to be the butt of the joke.  \n\nBut please, OP, don't hate yourself for this or feel like shit.  You're not, you just didn't realise what was happening.  Everyone does this.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/26fsna/yesterday_i_received_the_worst_feedback_ive_ever/chrdhka/"}
