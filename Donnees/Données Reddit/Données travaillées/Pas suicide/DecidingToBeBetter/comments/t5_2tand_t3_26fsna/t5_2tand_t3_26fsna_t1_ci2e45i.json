If it's a really nice group, you can also be a nice alpha. But if you made your choice that you will not be alpha at any costs, then you should just live with that and see how your social persona changes and adapts over time.\n\nI can be a jerk, still am sometimes. I'm not the alpha of any group, I don't belong to any group, I just say what I need to say. Sometimes I get negative feedback, but I don't care much about it. Sometimes I see people get nervous when I confront them about who they are or what they are doing (yes, I am judgmental, no exceptions, meaning I am most critical about myself), but that will not stop me. I get the validation of my actions from a different place than emotional approval of a person.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/26fsna/yesterday_i_received_the_worst_feedback_ive_ever/ci2e45i/"}
