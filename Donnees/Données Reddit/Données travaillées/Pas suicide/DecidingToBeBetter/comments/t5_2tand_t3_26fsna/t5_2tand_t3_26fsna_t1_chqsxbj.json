But the thing she said which devastated me the most was, \"When I see you, I get scared, and I cannot emotionally trust you anymore.\"\n\nThis makes me wonder about the general dynamics of this group you're hanging out with. There's not enough information to determine this, but you may actually be a funny guy, *who just happens to be hanging with a group of overly sensitive wusses.*\n\nOr it could be that this particular person is the overly sensitive person, and all the rest of them are fine with your charm and cheeky remarks. This sounds completely normal, as long as you're not *too* insulting, or at least balance it out with genuine friendship. \n\nSo, it's up to you to determine whether it's you, or whether it's them that are the problem.
