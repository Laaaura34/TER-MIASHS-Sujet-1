I had stage fright in the early years but not any more. I\u2019ve had several life changes & haven\u2019t been on stage for over 3 years. I didn\u2019t quit due to fear though & I find myself missing being up there. The trick, I\u2019ve found, is to be confident in my abilities. I can be in an audience & bands who know me call on me to sing & I do. People say \u201cwow! How can you go from just being a regular person to THAT?!\u201d. I just say thanks but it\u2019s easy. Does everyone love my singing? Nope. Do most of them? Yep. Everyone has different tastes & that is okay! I don\u2019t really care-I just get up & deliver the talent I\u2019ve had since birth & honed for ten years or more. Those that don\u2019t like me? I don\u2019t care. Those that do? It\u2019s flattering. I\u2019d say don\u2019t give it up for fear! I\u2019m thinking of getting back up there soon myself. Fear will not rule me or my actions-panic disorder be damned... I hope you won\u2019t let it rule you! That is true emotional well being for me.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/bi3mxm/the_difference_between_giving_into_fear_or_taking/elxy9d7/"}
