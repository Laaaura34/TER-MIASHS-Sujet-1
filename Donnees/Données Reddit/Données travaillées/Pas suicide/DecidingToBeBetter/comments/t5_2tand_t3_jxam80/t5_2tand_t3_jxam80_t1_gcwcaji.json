I send money to my parents, sister and brother. When my brother was laid off due to pandemic, I hosted him for 5 months. When my nephew wanted a new pair of shoes, I sent him money to buy 2 pairs with new jeans. It feels so good to know my family will always be secure and I can handle them single handedly.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jxam80/tell_us_something_that_youre_proud_of_yourself/gcwcaji/"}
