Often times people keep taxing environments while trying to be healthier and the benefits are minimized. Good on you.  \n\nAs someone who (for many years) had difficulty saying \"no thanks\" to invitations or obligations, I've found it empowering to do just that.

It's hard to write that (and I'll have to think about why, wtf ) but thank you for your post. Your post has given me food for thought.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/n7wgql/im_determined_to_spend_the_next_year_of_my_life/gxfbuax/"}
