I don\u2019t mean to be insulting by saying this, but I\u2019ve found that a lot of people get caught up in specifics when a generally healthy approach would be simpler and less stressful to their needs. \n\nBut if you don\u2019t feel like reading this whole thing than I would say: nutrition, sleep, exercise. Don\u2019t just eat healthy foods, eat appropriate portions of them. There are guides online that can show you rough measurements using parts of your hand. Like, a protein serving (like a fish fillet or chicken thigh) would be about the size of your fist, a teaspoon of oil would be the tip of your finger. They sell plates and Tupperware that have these portions marked so you don\u2019t overeat. Work on trying to sleep 7-9 hours and not oversleep or under sleep. Obviously this will change once the baby comes, so it might help to look up what other mothers of newborns suggest to help their baby\u2019s sleep schedule so they can regulate their own. Find a form of exercise you enjoy, and focus on aiming for a healthy lifestyle for yourself and your baby. Don\u2019t get caught up in comparison/competition between yourself and others.\n\nI have plenty of relatives who are athletic who don\u2019t count calories, and the reason is because they know enough about nutrition and exercise to understand what to expect. Try to look at general health recommendations by actual national and international organizations, rather than looking at influencers who often are lying about how they look the way they do, or lack experience in training people and are just saying what worked for them. I really like some influencers, but take their advice with a grain of salt.\n\nTo be honest, you can make a lot of huge strength gains as a beginner who doesn\u2019t exercise a ton. I am a little jealous of your position. And if you know you are eating unhealthy already, you don\u2019t have to go cold turkey on things to start seeing results or to make improvements. There\u2019s a lot of benefits to being a beginner. Good luck on your journey!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/niznr5/i_have_to_get_healthy_but_there_are_some/gz4pxrl/"}
