I came here to say that I'm 36 and even though I'm almost certain it's too late, I'm still trying. I've lost more than 20 yrs to depression and lately, I've been wondering if it's too late. So you've no idea what it means to me to read this. At this age, it feels very lonely & hopeless to be where I am. So to know that someone else didn't give up and they made it to where they want to be - *that is everything*. **Thank you.**", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kkcac9/its_too_late_to_start_is_better_say_goodbye_yall/gh2glq6/"}
