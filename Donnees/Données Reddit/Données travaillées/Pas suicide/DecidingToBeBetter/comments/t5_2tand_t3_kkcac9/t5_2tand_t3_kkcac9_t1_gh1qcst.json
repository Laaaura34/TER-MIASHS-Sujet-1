There is no effort in history that will get back the time that has already passed. \n\n*However*. You can absolutely learn from those mistakes and make your future worth the experience of learning. Don\u2019t make your past mistakes have been in vain. Don\u2019t keep letting yourself down. Don\u2019t keep wishing you\u2019d start doing something, actually do it. \n\nPeople start over their lives constantly. You can be 60 and decide to make a radical change and start working towards something new. \n\nBut when you are living for the idea of \u201cmaking back the past\u201d you aren\u2019t living in the present. You need to do TODAY what you want to be able to be good at TOMORROW. But you need to do it because you want to be better than yesterday, not to make up for it. If you live for guilt you\u2019ll never get out of the hole.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kkcac9/its_too_late_to_start_is_better_say_goodbye_yall/gh1qcst/"}
