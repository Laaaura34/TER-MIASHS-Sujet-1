I quite literally didn\u2019t even know how to use Word or even Type when I did my degree. I had to learn how to use a computer for something other then social media and I can\u2019t tell you the amount of times I\u2019d call my daughter in tears because my screen went blue and my work disappeared or something else happened. I once rang my son to ask him how to use Paint as it was required for an assignment. He laughed for a full 5 minutes before he could explain it to me. My daughter would also laugh and tell me what buttons to press to fix my mistakes. It was all good natured laughter of course and they helped me immensely. By the time my daughter went to University the year after I finished I was helping her with referencing and research for her assignments. I\u2019d never dreamed I could do that!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kkcac9/its_too_late_to_start_is_better_say_goodbye_yall/gh2ydq2/"}
