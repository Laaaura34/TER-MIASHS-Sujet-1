It\u2019s a cycle, and it\u2019s all bullshit.\n\nI do believe our fear and shame keep telling us we can\u2019t change and it will come up with whatever story it can to convince us this is true. I highly recommend mindfulness exercises, learn to focus on the now. I understand there are lessons to be learned from reflecting on the past, but sometimes I think it\u2019s best to just forget all that shit and focus on the new story you are gonna tell yourself about who you are, what you want, and how you are going to get there.
