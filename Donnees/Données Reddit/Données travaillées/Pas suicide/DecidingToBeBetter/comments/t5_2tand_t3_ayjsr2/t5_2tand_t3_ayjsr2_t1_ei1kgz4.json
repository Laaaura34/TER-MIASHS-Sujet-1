Values are not goals as they merely impose restrictions on your life, the point is to determine if you want to abide by them.\n\nOne can take the life of honorable people(not just famous ones, check in for people who make an impact but are just there serving others for example) and see what type of values and principles they live by. Religious people turn to their scriptures for guidance, others go on to explore the world to discover it, etc.\n\nOnce you have an idea on how your character is going to be defined (by your values and principles) then you can apply it to what life offers(career, friendships, etc).\n\nSome people define their character earlier than others, it's a personal journey.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ayjsr2/how_can_i_figure_out_what_to_improve/ei1kgz4/"}
