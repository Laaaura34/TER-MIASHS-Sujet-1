It's incredibly rewarding as a lot of people with unspectacular voices can do really amazing things. You'll also meet some of the coolest people on the planet, and the contest side of it is hugely competitive and rewarding, while still maintaining friendly rivalries everywhere.\n\n**Barbershop seriously changes lives. Like, seriously.**\n\nFinding a local barbershop group requires a different pathway depending on where you are and whether you identify as male or female (it's pretty much a non-mixed thing, although mixed groups are beginning to become popular).\n\n**USA**\n\n*Female*\n\nLook up Sweet Adeline's International or Harmony Incorporated.\nBoth have different viewpoints on what barbershop harmony is. Maybe go to both and see which you prefer.\n\n*Male*\n\nThe Barbershop Harmony Society is where you need to go to find your local chapter.\n\n\n**UK**\n\n*Female*\n\nLook up Sweet Adelines International Region 31, or the Ladies Association of British Barbershop Singers (LABBS).\nLABBS is pretty much the British equivalent of Harmony Inc. in terms of values.\n\n*Male*\n\nThe British Association of Barbershop Singers (BABS) is where you should go.\n\n\n**Elsewhere**\n\nAnything outside of the US and UK are pretty out of my experience, but there are barbershop organisations all over the world including New Zealand, Australia, and loads of places around Europe. Just do a Google search and you can't go far wrong.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3g75it/what_are_some_cool_hobbiesinterests/ctvwoj2/"}
