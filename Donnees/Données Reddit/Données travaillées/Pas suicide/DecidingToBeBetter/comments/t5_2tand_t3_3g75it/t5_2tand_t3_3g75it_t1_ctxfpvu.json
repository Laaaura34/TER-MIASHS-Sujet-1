Me eating out at restaurants seems kinda dumb to talk about, but seeing people's reactions when I tell them what head cheese is (a p\u00e2t\u00e9 made of various parts of the face of the pig), makes conversations pretty enjoyable. Besides, if I wanted hobbies that make me interesting to others, I'd just join a fantasy football league, which I personally consider an enormous waste of time.\n\nNot that I don't like people who do that, but I'm not going to pretend to like it just because it makes conversation easier.\n\nJust keep asking people questions, and as they open up more, you'll find more to talk about.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3g75it/what_are_some_cool_hobbiesinterests/ctxfpvu/"}
