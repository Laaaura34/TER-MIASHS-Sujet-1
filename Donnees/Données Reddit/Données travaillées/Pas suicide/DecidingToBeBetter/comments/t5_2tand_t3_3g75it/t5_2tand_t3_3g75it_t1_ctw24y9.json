I don't know what that is for you, but working out. I.e running, swimming, hiking, going to the gym. Rock climbing (my personal favorite). You could join a masters program or a softball/soccer league, etc. \n\nOr maybe you already work out. Then what about taking classes for fun? Like dance, ceramics, painting, a language course at a local community college or something. \n\ni don't know what it's like where you live, but surfing? Scuba? Cooking? Brewing beer? Bouldering? Slam poetry? Stand up comedy?   Archery, rock climbing. Etc", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3g75it/what_are_some_cool_hobbiesinterests/ctw24y9/"}
