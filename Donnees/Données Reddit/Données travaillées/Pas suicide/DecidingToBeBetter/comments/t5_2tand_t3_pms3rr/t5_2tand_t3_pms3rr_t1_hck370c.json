I am 2 years sober now for the first time.\nI can't say how incredible it was for me to read this personally. No man is an island and it has sure felt that way for a lot of my sober journey so far.\n All the things you said above really hit home with me, especially about the having real relationships instead of the Grey \"meh\".\nThat was me up until yhe last 2 years as well.\nI wanted to say thank you for this. Thank you for sharing and for being a badass. \nLife kinda \"resumes\" once that mental fog gets lifted. And you're right about it being spiritual to socialize and do things sober.\nSo thank you for sharing and know that this genuinely meant a lot to me to read and know that we're not alone. \ud83d\ude4f we got this!!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pms3rr/45_years_sober/hck370c/"}
