Like all things in life it's complicated.\n\nI believe most people drink, because they're not comfortable to let loose by themselves. They don't feel comfortable to be playful as adults. They drink to give themselves an excuse \"well, I was drunk\", to live in the moment. That's how drinking to let loose is like drinking to deal with an uncomfortable emotion.\n\nOur subconscious mind is constantly taking note of what we do in life. If we drink to let loose once, it registers it. Next time it'll be a bit harder to let loose without alcohol, so we grab for a drink sooner. And so on, so on. You'd have to balance out sober nights out with drinking nights out.\n\nIs drinking to let loose the worst form of alcohol abuse? Of course not, it can be benign. It can be the first step towards frequent blackouts, risky behaviour and other worse consequences from alcohol abuse.\n\nLike smoking a cigarette once a week can be benign, but it can be the first step towards habitual smoking.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pms3rr/45_years_sober/hcp8n5s/"}
