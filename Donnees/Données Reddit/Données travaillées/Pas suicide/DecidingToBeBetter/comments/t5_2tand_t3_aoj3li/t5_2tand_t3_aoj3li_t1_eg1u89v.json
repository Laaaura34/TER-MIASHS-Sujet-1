Seeing that you are working in a related field and are still hoping to complete the program even years later I think will definitely work in your favor. \n\nOf course it\u2019s possible that the new dean has the same mindset as the last one. But a lot of other things may have changed with the school as well over the years and they may even be willing to overlook your history with them to improve their numbers on a purely business level. \n\nYou\u2019ve got a good case if you can express yourself adequately and show your passion and desires when appealing to the powers that be. \n\nMakes sure you have/maintain a good support system in your personal life and you\u2019ll be all set for success. \n\nAnd if they say no, maybe it just isn\u2019t the program for you. In the long run, as long as you have the piece of paper and the knowledge gained from obtaining it, it doesn\u2019t really matter where it came from. \n\nBest of luck!
