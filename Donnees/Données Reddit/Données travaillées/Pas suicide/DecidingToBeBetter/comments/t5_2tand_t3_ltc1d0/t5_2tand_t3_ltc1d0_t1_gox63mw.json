Obviously I can only judge based on what you've written but it's pretty obvious your boyfriend doesn't respect you as a person.\n\nIt took him WEEKS to accept a no? What the fuck????? This is absolutely insane. \n\nAnd then he somehow lacks the basic understanding that bi doesn't equal poly or whatever? What is he, a teenager???\n\nI can tell you one thing though - it absolutely isn't you, regardless of how you look or think you look in revealing clothes. Technically there's nothing at all wrong with non monogamous relationships, but your boyfriend is one giant red flag.\n\nWhat does your friend think of the thruple idea? Does SHE even want to? Was this immature dumbass just gonna try and talk two women into fucking him? Was she on board? Did he cheat and try to conceal it this way? So many questions tbh but one thing is undeniable - based on what you've written here, he does NOT respect you at ALL. A relationship will never work like that.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ltc1d0/my_long_term_boyfriend_told_me_two_months_ago/gox63mw/"}
