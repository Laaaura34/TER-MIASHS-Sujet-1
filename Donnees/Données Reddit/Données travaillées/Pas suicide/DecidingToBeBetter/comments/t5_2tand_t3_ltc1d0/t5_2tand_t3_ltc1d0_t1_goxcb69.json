I know what kratom is and not related to this but he should be INCREDIBLY careful with that, it has some nasty aspects to it. Anyway, idgaf if he was on meth, gaslighting you is not okay!! Sounds like he's made some improvements at least, which is good.\n\nOK honey reread that paragraph. This is emotional abuse. HE THOUGHT HE COULD CONVINCE YOU IF HE MADE YOU ACCEPT YOU'RE AT FAULT? there are no ifs or when's or buts here this is incredibly toxic.\n\nHear this: No is a complete sentence. Nothing else is required. Do you want a threesome? No.\n\nThat's an entire conversation right there. You shouldn't even LISTEN to all that toxic garbage much less take it seriously. Not now not ever.\n\nThanks for clearing that up - this deadbeat really was just fantasising then lol. Loser.\n\nIt is absolutely not hard to say. I beg of you, believe me, nothing you've described is normal, and almost everything you've described is textbook toxicity. I'm not a professional therapist at all but I do have a background in psychology, and I'm dead serious when I tell you that based on what you've written, he absolutely doesn't respect you.\n\nHold yourself to a higher standard. Set your boundaries and ENFORCE them. No means no. End of story. It's a super important thing to learn :-)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ltc1d0/my_long_term_boyfriend_told_me_two_months_ago/goxcb69/"}
