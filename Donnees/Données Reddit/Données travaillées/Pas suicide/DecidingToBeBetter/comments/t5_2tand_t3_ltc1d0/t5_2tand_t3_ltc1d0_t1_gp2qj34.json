Your pained reaction would be felt by anyone in love. It's rather foolish or hypocritical of him to expect you to get over it so easily, especially with your self-esteem issues. \n\nYou will never find true inner-peace through another. Self-love is paramount. It should be the core of your being, the foundation of your psyche. \n\nYour insecurities, whatever they may be, will absolutely need to become your number one priorities. Understand that it may be quite difficult to tackle your own demons without some detachment from your boyfriend's own emotional baggage and demands. \n\nI don't wish you any sadness, but time on your own might be the best thing to facilitate your journey to becoming a sovereign, non-dependent individual. \n\nGood luck. I hope you realize that being loved should not come with the burdens of doubt and insecurity.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ltc1d0/my_long_term_boyfriend_told_me_two_months_ago/gp2qj34/"}
