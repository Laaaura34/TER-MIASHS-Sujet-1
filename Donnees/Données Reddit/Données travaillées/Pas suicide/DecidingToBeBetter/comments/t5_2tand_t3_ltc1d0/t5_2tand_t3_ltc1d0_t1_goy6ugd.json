I understand all of this is hard to digest and honestly a long-term relationship makes the feelings so complicated and difficult to act on; I have 100% have been there. I had a bunch of people outside of my relationship telling me to leave but I just couldn\u2019t see it while I was in it for the longest time, and even if I did love and all the time together and all of that got in the way. Something my mom said has always stuck with me and might help you: if the relationship is not right, it\u2019s not right. And you will always know, even if it\u2019s deep down, even if you can\u2019t embrace it at the time, when it isn\u2019t right. I hope you can find strength and peace through all of this \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ltc1d0/my_long_term_boyfriend_told_me_two_months_ago/goy6ugd/"}
