This sucks. I don\u2019t have a ton of advice for you. Can just commiserate. My ex-husband wanted a threesome with my best friend. I said hell no. Then my ex-bf unknowingly messaged my same friend in a dating app while we were together! He had never met her before! She\u2019s like 6 inches taller and 25 pounds thinner than I am!!! I guess I didn\u2019t get too insecure. What I realized is that I have my fabulous bestie all to myself because she would never ever want to be with one of those guys over keeping her friendship me!!!!! I think you could build yourself confidence by finding a guy that doesn\u2019t want to share you!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ltc1d0/my_long_term_boyfriend_told_me_two_months_ago/gox6cpz/"}
