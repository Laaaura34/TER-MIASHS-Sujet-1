I'm sorry about what you went through with your ex and all that. That's just rough. I can't even imagine how you must feel? I can't relate because I've never been there but with a manipulative ex-girlfriend. It's rough and hard to move on.   \n\n\nI hate that I relate to this post though on the effect of how awful a sex addiction. I wish I could PM just so that I could ask how you've pushed past and such? I don't go spamming dick pictures everywhere because of personal reasons and it's disrespectful to my partner. I feel though sometimes my drive is so much stronger and it comes in waves. She wants more of me and I'm trying hard. I've broken out of watching pornography EVERY SINGLE DAY for hours on end. So that's a plus right?! Just wish I had more self-control, be more dominant/decisive/leading than allowing the switch in me to be a beta pushover all the time.   \n\n\nI've made some steps forward and some back. 2021 my resolution is to become the leader my partner wants me to be. Grab full control over our kinks and my own (somehow) and just fly like an eagle without pushing the boundaries. -sigh-   \n\n\nThank you for the inspiration. Thanks for making me reevaluate everything I've been involved with. I really appreciate it. One step at a time I guess?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kw6bfz/today_i_unsubscribed_from_over_400_nsfw/gj4polr/"}
