Men are shamed for jerking off too, but it is sort of jokingly accepted, I think, in a \"boys will be boys\" sort of way.\n\nSo, if masturbation isn't something you're allowed to admit to doing, why would you admit to being addicted to things that are clearly designed to aid masturbation, or lurid fantasies?\n\nGlad my openness could help reassure you that sex addictions are genderless.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kw6bfz/today_i_unsubscribed_from_over_400_nsfw/gk9t5nr/"}
