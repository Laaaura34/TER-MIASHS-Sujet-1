I have replied to another user who expressed the same sentiment, indicating that we all have to start somewhere. This is not a sub devoted to perfect people who live perfect lives discussing how easy it is to be perfect, this is a sub about hard talks, and seeing where you are and wanting to be somewhere better, and then about taking the steps that you need to to get there.\n\nThe fact that I am working to be a better person, in my books, means that I am a work in progress. I don't think that that is gross, I think that that is honest. We are all messy. We are all broken in our own ways.\n\nEverybody has their demons. These are mine, and I am learning to manage them. I wish you the best of luck with yours!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kw6bfz/today_i_unsubscribed_from_over_400_nsfw/gj5knd8/"}
