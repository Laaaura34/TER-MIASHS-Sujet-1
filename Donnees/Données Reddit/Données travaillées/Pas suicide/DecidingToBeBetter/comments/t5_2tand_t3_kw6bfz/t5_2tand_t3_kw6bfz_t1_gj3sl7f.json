Not just for the unsubscription to NSFW subs, but everything. Leaving a toxic marriage. Being willing to see yourself in a better light. Being willing to accept that your needs matter. That your feelings matter. That's something a lot of people exiting codependent relationships really need to hear. It's remarkable how many people are going around in the world living their lives as if their needs don't matter.\n\nI would say I wish you the best in your journey, but I don't think I need to. I think you recognize that you've got this. That you know what you want and need. And the journey for you will be just fine. Keep being the person that you're so glad to be.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kw6bfz/today_i_unsubscribed_from_over_400_nsfw/gj3sl7f/"}
