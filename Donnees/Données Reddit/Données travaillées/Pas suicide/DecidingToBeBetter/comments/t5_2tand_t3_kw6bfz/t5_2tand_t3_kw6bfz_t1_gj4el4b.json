I am messy. I have an addiction issue that I am working to remedy. \n\nThere is a reason why this isn't a sub called \"People who are already perfect sharing stories about how easy it is to be perfect\".

I have remorse and pain and guilt for many things that could have gone differently. But, wallowing in those feelings will not serve me in this walk to be better.\n\nEveryone has to start somewhere. This is where I am at today.\n\nI'm sorry if this triggered you in any way, or made you uncomfortable. I didn't add trigger warnings at the top because I felt the NSFW in the title was enough of a warning.
