I saw it as someone reading things into my story that probably come from a place of their own pain, maybe something similar happened to them and they feel bitter seeing someone celebrate the other side of their own personal pain. I tried to add extra details to show that They had valid points but also some Invalid assumptions.\n\nI have been told that I am \"painfully introspective\". It doesn't mean that I behave perfectly. It often means that I overthink things, and that I worry about offending someone by having said X not Y when they barely remember a conversation. I also accidentally offend people by keeping too much context in my head, and using verbal shorthand that comes off as callous or insensitive at times. \n\nI am a work in progress. I am human. I want to be a better human.\n\nMy father struggled a lot to find his place in the world, and his career. He usually listened to a lot of manly classic rock. But one of his favourite pop songs was Michael Jackson's \"Man in the Mirror\". I know the words well, and though I am not a man the same sentiment applies. Find the change you want inside of yourself. I have known this to be true for most of my life, but I'm finally acting on it.\n\nThank you for your kind words.
