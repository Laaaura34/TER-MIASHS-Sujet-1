I have felt like a failure for a really long time. I used to, and probably still will occasionally, dwell on all the things that I shoulda or coulda done differently to end up in a different place than I am now. I would spiral and wonder if I was forever doomed to repeat the same mistakes. And maybe I will make some of those mistakes again, but I have learned something through all of this, and I think I can make choices that are better for me now.\n\nI think I'm finally crawling out from under that rock. :)\n\nThank you for the kind words.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kw6bfz/today_i_unsubscribed_from_over_400_nsfw/gj5824h/"}
