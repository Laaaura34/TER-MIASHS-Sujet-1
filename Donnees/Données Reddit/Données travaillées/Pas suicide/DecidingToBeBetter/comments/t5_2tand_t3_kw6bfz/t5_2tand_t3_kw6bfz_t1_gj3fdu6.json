All of this was really great to read. I can't talk to people in my real life about any of this because I live in a very conservative area where just admitting I'm bisexual is enough to make some people avoid me at work or in social settings. So, this really is my outlet for all of this stuff. Thank you for cheering me on. You're incredible positivity and realism is appreciated!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kw6bfz/today_i_unsubscribed_from_over_400_nsfw/gj3fdu6/"}
