I have left out details, for sure. I felt like it was already too detailed. I felt like it was already too hard to  read. I promise it was hard to live through. But I did, I am still here, and that means I have the opportunity to choose a life where I feel valued. By myself, and by the people I choose to surround myself with.\n\nIt was a lesson learned the absolute hard way, but I think it has finally clicked.\n\nGood luck to you as well, kind stranger! Thank you for taking the time to reply in a supportive way!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kw6bfz/today_i_unsubscribed_from_over_400_nsfw/gj5gvbc/"}
