When I started this account and dove into the deep end of NSFW subs it was because I was rtryit to find an outlet for my sexual energy while my spouse was away all the time and I was intensely sexually frustrated most of the time. Back then, turning to Reddit thirst traps rather than an affair was me being better (though I did ruin one friendship by suggesting an affair, twice, under misguided ideas, but that's a story for another day).\n\nThe thing that saved me then, and served me then is no longer serving me the way it once did. So, time to Marie Kondo my subreddits. \"Thank you, GoneWild, for your service.\" *unsubscribes*\n\n\ud83d\ude09", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kw6bfz/today_i_unsubscribed_from_over_400_nsfw/gj3eo00/"}
