I still slip into old ways at times, but in general I'm with you. Feeling much more like myself, and much less consumed by all the sex I'm not having because of the pandemic and my poorly timed divorce.\n\nI'm really glad my sharing was able to help you. Honestly, I had no idea how many different NSFW subs I had joined until I went to delete them all. It was shocking, but I think getting out of that headspace has helped. I can still go look at those subs when I want to, but they aren't filling up my entire feed with smut all the time, which helps.\n\nHere's to a brighter, more mentally healthy year!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kw6bfz/today_i_unsubscribed_from_over_400_nsfw/gspn2vt/"}
