Maybe they had a deadbedroom or where cheated on. I can't know that about them, so I will assume that they are coming from a place of hurt and I will try to offer them my compassion and empathy to show them that not every story is the re-enactment of their pain and their fears.\n\nAlso, by helping them see the bigger picture about my one-sided story, perhaps I can help *them* have empathy and understanding towards those who have wronged them. Helping someone have forgiveness for those who have trespassed against them is a big part of the small set of values that I picked up through my limited time being raised in a church going household. We stopped going when I was 8 because my baby brother was too noisy for church. But. Forgiveness and empathy and kindness towards others were big parts of how I was raised. \n\nI don't always get it right, but on the good days I do. Yesterday was a very good day. I finally had the motivation to unsubscribe from all of those things, after over a month of thinking that I should.\n\nBe patient with people these days.
