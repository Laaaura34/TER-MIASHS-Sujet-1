Shit got serious enough around here that we can't see people outside of our home (people living alone can visit only two friends), and so any attempt at meeting people is just silly. And, as much as I would love to build a sexy, seductive relationship with someone before ever meeting them, most people on those services are wanting to fuck now and think about their health and safety later, from what I've seen.\n\nThanks for the idea for multiple accounts. I'm from a long line of stubborn bastards that go cold turkey on their addictions. My parents both stopped smoking the day they found out they were pregnant with me. My dad went back to school in his mid thirties with a stay at home wife and three kids and was drinking 2x 12-cup pots of coffee a day, and then went cold turkey when his sister, a dietician, told him how fucking terrible that much caffeine was for his everything. If I have a problem it needs to go. Now. None of this slow peel of the band aid. Rip that shit off and get it over with. Haha. (This is from the same person that took more than 7 years to finally leave a shitty marriage, but... Yeah... Living. Learning. Etcetera.)\n\nI'll look into SLAA!
