I ended up going to therapy to look at my patterns as to why I would jump from man to man trying to get attention to feel good about myself.  After my last hookup I felt empty and the reality is I don\u2019t want to be a person who uses people.  When you are jumping around it is just using someone.  It\u2019s hard to change your patterns but it is doable and it will feel uncomfortable as fuck at first.  The biggest thing for me was that I was using men to not feel emotions and hurt.  I have now reached the point where I notice my mind is spinning/anxious about a man I know it means I need to feel a feelings.  Most times it\u2019s a huge cry and then I go back to being level headed again.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qbif4m/how_do_i_stop_using_sex_as_a_coping_mechanism/hh9vq59/"}
