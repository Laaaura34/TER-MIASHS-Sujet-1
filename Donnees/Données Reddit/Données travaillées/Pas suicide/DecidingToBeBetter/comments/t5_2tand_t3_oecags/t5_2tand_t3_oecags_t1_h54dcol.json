Your body needs vegetables/fiber too. If you really are considering this please see your doctor. I'd hate for you to become deficient or suffer health consequences.\n\n You have decided to do better for the long run! Speaking of runs....\n\n(Lame segways but I was thinking about the whole jumping in and going increasingly full throttle part)\n\n.....you could run a marathon next week. You could probably finish. You would feel like shit, but it would prove something- that you \"could.\"  It wouldn't be healthy at all.  \n\nIf you have a little voice pushing you to go balls to the wall, tell it to shut the fuck up. Being truly better means Healthy. That's the prize and the weight will come off too.\n\nObviously you can disregard all of this.
