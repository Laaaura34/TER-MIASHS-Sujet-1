I'm currently doing something similar, but I also recognize that I really enjoy soda. I've just switched over to Olipop Root Beer. Has 35 calories & no sugar/carbs. Doesn't taste quite as good and is a little pricey but gets the job done. Highly recommend if you want to still have something to enjoy while transitioning away from the more sugary drinks.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oecags/i_just_drank_my_last_soda_so_begins_my_attempt_to/h477fi0/"}
