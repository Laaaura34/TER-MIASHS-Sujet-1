I eventually lost 55 pounds, and I have since run a marathon, three half marathons, and a few shorter races.  I started running by doing one minute of running followed by one minute of walking, and doing that for 20 minutes three times a week.  When that felt too easy, I added a minute of running, so I would run two minutes and walk one.  Each time it got easy, I'd add another minute to the running interval.  When I got to 7/1 intervals, I started doing 20 minutes non-stop, then added two minutes to my runs each week, until I was running 30 minutes non-stop.  Once you can do that, you can train for a half marathon.  Building up slowly made it relatively easy, as opposed to going out and starting with death runs.  My point  is that if I can do it, so can anybody else who is reading this!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/oecags/i_just_drank_my_last_soda_so_begins_my_attempt_to/h479bh6/"}
