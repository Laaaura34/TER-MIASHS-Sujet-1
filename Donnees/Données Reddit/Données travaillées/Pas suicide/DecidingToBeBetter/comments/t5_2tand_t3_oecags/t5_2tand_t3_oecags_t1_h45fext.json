I've found that it's easier to stick to a new developing habit if I try and rewire how I talk to myself:\n\nBefore:\" I can't have a coke\"\n\nAfter: \"in the past, I would have had a coke and if I couldn't i would have lost my shit lol! Now, I  drink water and my body is loving it. I'm doing great. So fucking proud of myself.\" I say that out loud lol\n\nI find using \"in the past....\" and \"now I....\" super helpful. \n\nHave any rewards planned for yourself? Fresh flowers for your table?
