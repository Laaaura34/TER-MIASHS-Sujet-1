My looks, my brains, my work ethic, whatever.\n\nI like going to restaurants and bars where the staff is attractive. It's just what people want. \n\nAnd I don't give a shit what the cook looks like.\n\nAttractive people are in sales and hospitality. It's just part of the job.\n\nIf you want to be successful, you have to know how you can maximize yourself. \n\nA short, slow un-athletic person shouldn't try to be an NBA player. There might be a place for that person to be a coach, manager, or a front office person, but not a player.\n\n\n ", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/2phh44/i_am_a_thin_beautiful_privileged_woman_article/cmwv2si/"}
