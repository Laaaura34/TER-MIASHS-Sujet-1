So, one of the side effects is that you kind of start to feel like you don't have 'solid' friendships. These people aren't always there for me in the same way that I can't always be there for them. I often catch myself thinking, when I get a sudden burst of social energy on a Saturday, why haven't any of my friends invited me to do anything?? Do I even have friends?? But really it's that we have this shared distance and our social energy times don't always match up. It takes a lot of occasional dropping a line or extending the invitation to them yourself and feeling okay about them not responding sometimes in order to maintain these kinds of relationships. And a long time of coming back to them again and again before they feel solid and real. \n\nOn a side note, it's nice of you to write such thoughtful replies to everyone!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mogatc/ive_been_trying_to_not_be_a_lazy_loser_for_years/gubcdpo/"}
