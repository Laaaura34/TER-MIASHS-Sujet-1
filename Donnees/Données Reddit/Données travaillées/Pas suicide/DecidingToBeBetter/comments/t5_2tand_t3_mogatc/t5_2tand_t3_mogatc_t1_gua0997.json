It's really really good advice. Constant obligation in friendship will just tear me apart. \n\nAnd you're right about exercise, biking and weightlifting have always worked to my benefit. When they catch up, everything else seems to work too. Just a bummer it's so hard to be consistent about it.\n\nBut I also appreciate your point about being grateful that being inconsistently functional means being functional nonetheless, despite everything that we're being told. It's a bright perspective I haven't looked at before.\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to write this, it's really insightful.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mogatc/ive_been_trying_to_not_be_a_lazy_loser_for_years/gua0997/"}
