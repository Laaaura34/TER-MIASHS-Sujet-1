Her entire life changed after that choice; dropping smoking, being healthy, ect. I had something like that happen to me when I discovered running the Disney marathon/challenges. Now, a lot of my energy is spent towards that silly goal, from running, eating right, constant research, plus the exercise/outdoors benefits. \n\nPerhaps it's stubbornness, but that serendipitous discovery changed my life. I volunteer, go to school, go to therapy, but having that was the best thing for me. \n\nFeel your story, OP. Spent hours reading/watching self-help advice, too. Broke bridges with my friends. Convinced myself there was something innately wrong with me mentally.\n\nYou're absolutely not lazy; your mind is trying damn hard to find a solution. You might think you are because you don't see the progress you want, but it's there. Send kind words to yourself, OP. You really do deserve it", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mogatc/ive_been_trying_to_not_be_a_lazy_loser_for_years/gu72gi0/"}
