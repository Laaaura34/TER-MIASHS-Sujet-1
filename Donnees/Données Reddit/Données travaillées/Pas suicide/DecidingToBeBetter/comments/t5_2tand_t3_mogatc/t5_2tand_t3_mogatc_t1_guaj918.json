It *could* be. It's not *not* the first step towards world domination. Leaders and villains alike have great teeth. I keep using this example because it's a recent one I've overcome, but understand that your particular challenges may be different! \n\n2) I work to identify and cultivate my cornerstone habits. These are the habits that other habits gravitate towards. For example, hiking in the morning is a cornerstone habit, it makes my whole morning work, because when I hike, I take my meds first and they have time to activate before my first meeting, and the exercise really centers me, and it helps motivate me to eat better, etc. Things just really flow from there, but I don't think about all the things I have to do... I think, I just need to get up and go on that hike. \n\n3) not gonna lie, medication has helped a ton. I don't always notice what it's doing for me day to day, but I 100% notice that since I've been medicated I have gotten things together much better. So it's doing something, even if it's subtle enough that it's not always on my radar.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mogatc/ive_been_trying_to_not_be_a_lazy_loser_for_years/guaj918/"}
