One question: if a good friend told you a story like you\u2019ve just shared what would you say?\n\nI\u2019d guess that you\u2019d likely encourage them, tell them that their worth is not defined by arbitrary measurement humanity has generated for success, tell them they\u2019ve grown massively and how many great things lie ahead for them. All that\u2019s all true for you friend, please be kinder to yourself. You have grit, you are still trying, still growing, still chugging away. Try to step back from the perfectionist microscope and see a bigger picture of you with kinder eyes.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mogatc/ive_been_trying_to_not_be_a_lazy_loser_for_years/gu4opdt/"}
