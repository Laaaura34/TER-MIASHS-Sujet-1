I mean everything I wrote sincerely and it makes me happy to see your reply/replies. It is clear that you are a remarkable human being. I truly hope that it will become easier for you to see that. Did you ever see that Will Ferrell movie. Stranger than Fiction? I won't spoil anything but the main character begins to actually hear his moments narrated. A literal voice that outlines his actions and thoughts/insecurities/reasoning. If you haven't seen it, I'd highly recommend it keeping in perspective your own daily narrative. If I were narrating your life, I would use words like brave and celebrate you. I'd celebrate each accomplishment AND each time a mistake didn't impact you so much. Our mistakes make us human. I believe that. I also believe that your life has the potential for great happiness. \n\nI see you received book recommendations. I'd be interested  to know your thoughts one them, should you care to. \n\nEngineering!  That's a smart- math people program right? Nice and not surprising given your intellect.\n\nI believe a  form of cbt that is sometimes helpful for those struggling with negative self talk is  dbt. I don't know much but it was recently recommended for someone I know. Idk but it may be worth looking into, given that cbt itself wasn't so helpful.\n\nGood luck my fellow human. This stranger admires you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mogatc/ive_been_trying_to_not_be_a_lazy_loser_for_years/guaacyx/"}
