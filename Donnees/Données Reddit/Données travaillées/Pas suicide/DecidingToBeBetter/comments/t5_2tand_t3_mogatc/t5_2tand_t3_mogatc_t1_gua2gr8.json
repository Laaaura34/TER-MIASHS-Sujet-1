Heard about it to often before to let it slip and slide this time. I've never heard about 'The Agile Way', bummer it's not on Audible. But the title is compelling and I want to take a look at it, gonna have to be on Kindle.\n\nWhile your first two points are good arguments towards optimism despite all the failings and defeats, I think the third one really brings it home. My life is such a rollercoaster that goes deep in the depths and high in the clouds that it's really really difficult to see whether the average is going upwards or not over the years.\n\nAnd it's really hard to manifest patience when you don't know if you're going in the right direction. But your comment paired with others made me understand that, and I think I have a new angle from which to look at things, and new points of reference to analyze my position.\n\nThank you so much for your insightful advice and recommendations.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mogatc/ive_been_trying_to_not_be_a_lazy_loser_for_years/gua2gr8/"}
