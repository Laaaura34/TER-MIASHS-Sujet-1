Saw you DM'd it to me too, thought I'd answer here in case someone could benefit from that discussion.\n\nI do have a tendency to self-admonish to a large extent. It's just hard not to blame myself when I regularly let people down; I kinda value myself based on my ability to have a positive impact around me, and letting people down repeatedly makes it hard to have a positive image of myself. \n\nAs for your third point, I also believe that goals are huge catalysts for actions; the problem in my case is goal setting has never an issue. Always had dreams, goals; learned to break them down and set goals one day at a time. But I've seen my goals get thrown into the dumpster after repeatedly seeing myself fail to take action towards them. Even when I reorient and focus on something that's more adequate and realistic, my inaction keeps me still and stuck. I always end up having to chose between giving up and stubbornly stick to it, which by experience, tends to leave me in a very bad position that's not very different from not doing anything at all.\n\nAnd for your fourth and fifth points; I'm always going to be looking for a way out and forward. It's just... I don't want to keep living like this, you know? Life is a gift and it feels like I'm just wasting it. Being neuro-atypical may be an impairment, but I refuse to see it as something that can't be worked around/coped with.\n\nThanks for taking the time, sorry the wall of text.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mogatc/ive_been_trying_to_not_be_a_lazy_loser_for_years/gu9qq8p/"}
