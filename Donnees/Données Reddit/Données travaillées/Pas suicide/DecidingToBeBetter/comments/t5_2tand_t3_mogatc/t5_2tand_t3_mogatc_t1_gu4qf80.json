That\u2019s how I did it. Didn\u2019t want to. Wasn\u2019t easy. We have a dopaminergic reward system. Do something and you\u2019ll feel better and want to do more. Kind of like u did when u took the step toward buying and reading those books. One thing that\u2019s helped I think, is that I\u2019ve always lifted weights. Always. Since I was a teenager. Maybe try that. Gives u structure. And discipline \n\nEdit: how tf did u manage a 4.1?
