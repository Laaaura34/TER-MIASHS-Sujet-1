You\u2019re not alone in feeling this way, and you\u2019re not broken.  What you have now is a crossroad.  The path you know is familiar but you know it isn\u2019t the right path, yet it feels safe somehow.  \n\nThere\u2019s a mindset change- instead of beating on yourself over things you\u2019re unhappy with, challenge yourself to do something about it. Activity and purpose and yes, exercise and sunshine.  Volunteer work in particular, try your hand at Habitat for Humanity or something that appeals to your sense of morality.  PM me if you want a friendly ear, it can and will get better.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mogatc/ive_been_trying_to_not_be_a_lazy_loser_for_years/gu3sn7s/"}
