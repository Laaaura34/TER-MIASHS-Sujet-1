There doesn't seem to be anything stopping you other than your mentality, which is why you should see a mental health specialist. \n\nIn the meantime, get some support from your department in the courses you are having difficulty with. Go to office hours, or find a friend you can pair up with to help you learn the material. You're already 2 years into your degree, you should be finished soon. Don't stress over jobs yet. Make an appointment with one of your professors and ask about what your job opportunities will look like, and whether he/she can help you with that. Don't overthink your future too much, you seem to be on the right track already.\n\nAs for your personal life, start fixing it 1 step at a time. Start by designating a full day cleaning your room completely, coming up with/researching a personal hygiene regimen, start learning how to mealprep and construct a diet for yourself based around healhy foods that you actually enjoy and can make without much trouble, research and create an exercise program, and research 1 hobby you want to get started on. Then afterwards, allocate a specific time each day where you maintain your room, take a shower/take care of your skin, go to the gym (or workout at home, you can dm me for home workout ideas), and spend some time on your hobby. Set clear goals so you can make tangible progress and monitor them, especially when it comes to your hobby.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jvka4s/a_21_yo_ball_of_shame_and_wasted_opportunity/gckj2ox/"}
