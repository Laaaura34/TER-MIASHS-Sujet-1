Put the end goal on the day it's due (like \"essay,\" or whatever the assignment is), and then work back from there, putting in all the steps and exactly when I planned to work on each step, coordinating with my work schedule and so on. \n\nSo one day I might have \"research and take notes,\" and the same the next day. Then \"organize notes; start outline.\" Going on to finish outline, write first draft, revise, edit, etc, make bibliography.. \"\n\nIt really helped me to see the days laid out, and to put the small pieces where they fit with all my other classes, work, and even an occasional social event(!), so in the end the task got done and I wasn't cramming everything at the last minute. \n\nBest of luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/priczv/im_a_senior_in_college_and_i_really_need_to_get/hdiwk50/"}
