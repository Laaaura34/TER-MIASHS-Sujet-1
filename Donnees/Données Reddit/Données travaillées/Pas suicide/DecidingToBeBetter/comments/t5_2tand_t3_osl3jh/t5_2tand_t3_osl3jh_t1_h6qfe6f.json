Since your struggling with reading non-fiction books, why not start with something that peaks your curiousity just as it does when it comes to history. It could be a book on business, Personal Finance, creativity, productivity, personal development, dating, biographies, etc. Pick up anything that sparks your curiosity and slowly work your way towards it.\n\nIf you like Biographies then there are tons of great ones like Elon Musk, Bob Iger (CEO of Disney), Michelle Obama (I think), Greenlights written by Matthew Mcconaughey, and so on. \n\nIf it's dating then I hear Models by Mark Manson is a great one and then there's The 5 Love Languages, and so on. \n\nSpeaking of productivity there's Essentialism by Greg Mckeown (I hope I spelled it right), Getting Things Done by Paul Arden, books by Seth Godin are pretty great and so on. \n\nAlso, I do have some fiction books I want read. Most of them are based on movies I saw about them so like Harry Potter, The Maze Runner (which I do have the first two parts that I'm planning to read), The Fault in Our Stars, All the Bright Places, etc. \n\nI wish you the best of luck in getting out of your comfort zone and trying out new genres! \u26a1", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/osl3jh/after_struggling_and_giving_up_for_2_years_or_so/h6qfe6f/"}
