The greatest achievement is to be at peace.  school work money these alone do nothing.  It's full of city bears with diplomas and money :) first make peace with yourself and accept your past.  love your failures in life that made you who you are.  at least so far you have ideas and experiences about how you can fail.  start with small steps, lose and win, experiences will teach you everything and you will get better each time.  Opportunities never end, just start, even a small step can open dozens of new doors for you.  love my friend, may everything be according to your heart", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/q8kdcp/were_do_i_start/hgpw0gn/"}
