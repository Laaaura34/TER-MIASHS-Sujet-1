The HARDEST part for me getting and staying sober is looking at the mess I made of my life in the sober light of day - I 100% understand why people stay high/drunk long after it is fun - the brutal reckoning on the other side. \n\nYour daughter has never seen you high and that is the result of you finding the strength to get clean and sober when it mattered **most.** You got this!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kc6dxd/today_121220_i_have_2_years_clean_my_daughter/gfq8hcf/"}
