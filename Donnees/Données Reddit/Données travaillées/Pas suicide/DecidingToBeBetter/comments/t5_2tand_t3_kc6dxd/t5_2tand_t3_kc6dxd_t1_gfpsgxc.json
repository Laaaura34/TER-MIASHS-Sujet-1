I was shocked, scared to death, and literally looking over my shoulder thinking \u201csurely they\u2019re not going to just let us walk out with him.\u201d \n\nI was thinking it was so irresponsible of them (the hospital) to let two young, ignorant people just leave with a newborn baby. I know now that no new parents know what they\u2019re doing. We all kinda figure it out as we go. Know this though\n1. They\u2019re not as fragile as you think\n2. You will make mistakes, and that\u2019s ok. \n3. All they really need is food, shelter and your love.\n\nEdit: Formatting", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kc6dxd/today_121220_i_have_2_years_clean_my_daughter/gfpsgxc/"}
