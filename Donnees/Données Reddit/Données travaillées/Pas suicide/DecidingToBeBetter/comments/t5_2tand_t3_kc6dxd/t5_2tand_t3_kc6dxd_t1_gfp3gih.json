I was the kid in a similar scenario -sadly my Dad put alcohol before me and as a result the last time I saw him as a child was when I was 1. Next time I met him I was 25, he wasn't willing to accept resonsibility for not being there for me as a kid so that was our last meeting. It was sad, but it was too little too late and I have a great life now so its all good. Just be there for your daughter, put her first above everything,  and remember she's your priority. Make sure she knows she's loved. Wishing you every success.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kc6dxd/today_121220_i_have_2_years_clean_my_daughter/gfp3gih/"}
