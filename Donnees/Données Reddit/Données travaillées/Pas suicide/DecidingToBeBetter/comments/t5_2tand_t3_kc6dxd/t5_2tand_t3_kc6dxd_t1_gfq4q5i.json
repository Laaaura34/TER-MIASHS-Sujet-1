I think too often we think the joy of it will override the negative, but if you are running on empty the joy won\u2019t always shine through. \n\nMy advice would be to take care of yourself so that you don\u2019t run your tank dry. Figure out what self care means for you. For me self care meant getting enough sleep and saying \u201cscrew it\u201d to chores, sleep had to come first. Then later on self care turned into focusing more on my health, exercise, eating habits, etc. Self care also means listening to audiobooks and playing video games. \n\nDon\u2019t worry about getting everything done. Communicate often with your SO. Are they overwhelmed? Do they need help? Tell her that you don\u2019t care about XYZ getting done and to go have time to relax.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kc6dxd/today_121220_i_have_2_years_clean_my_daughter/gfq4q5i/"}
