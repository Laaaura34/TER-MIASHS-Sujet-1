Meditated on it, prayed on it, and one night around Christmas the answer came clearly:\n\n\"Just be the best man you can be, and you will be the father you are meant to be.\"\n\nKids learn more from what we do than what we say. So ask yourself regularly - what can you do to be your best self, and set a good example?\n\nI stopped partying as much, got fit, went back to University and got a degree, earned and progressed in a great job, started volunteering at charity events, etc. \n\n17 years later my son is a fine young man. We both reaped the benefits.\n\nEdit: I see your hugely positive message, and kudos to your overcoming addiction and willingness to be a hand up for others.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kc6dxd/today_121220_i_have_2_years_clean_my_daughter/gfotjom/"}
