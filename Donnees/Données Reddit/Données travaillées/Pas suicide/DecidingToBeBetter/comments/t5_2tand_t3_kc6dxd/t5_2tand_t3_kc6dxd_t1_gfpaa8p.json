Except mine was pills. The beautiful life you\u2019ve created for yourself is something you should be beyond proud of yourself for. What stops me from moments of weakness is I look at my daughter and think she deserves the best mom, not a mom who is high all the time. It would destroy her if something bad happened to me. Keep on keepin\u2019 on. The joys of this life far far far outweigh nodding off on a couch somewhere.
