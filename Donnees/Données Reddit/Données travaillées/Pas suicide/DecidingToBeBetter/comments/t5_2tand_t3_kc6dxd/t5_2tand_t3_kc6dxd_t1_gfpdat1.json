As a father to a child who just turned 8 months old, the best advice I can give you is to:\n\n1) Be there for her and take her needs in piece meal, because they will be a lot, but all simple if you look ok at them as little pieces,\n2) Be a good role model. Teach her the kind of person you want her to be and the kind of men that she should want in her life,\n3) Teach her to be independent. There will be times that she'll want you help, and when you give it, guide her to an answer, but make sure you teach her they she can do it on her own, and\n4) enjoy your time with her.\n\nEverything else is just noise.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kc6dxd/today_121220_i_have_2_years_clean_my_daughter/gfpdat1/"}
