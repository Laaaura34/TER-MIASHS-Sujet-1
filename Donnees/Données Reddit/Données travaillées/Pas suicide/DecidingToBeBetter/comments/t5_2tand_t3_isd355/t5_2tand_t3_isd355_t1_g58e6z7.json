Otherwise, there's loads of stuff you could do at home; what is it you like to do? Freelance writing is always an option, you could start a home business to bring in a bit of extra cash and see how it goes.\n\nThe way I see it (and the way I try to remember it in my own life, too) you're going to be 40 one day no matter what.
