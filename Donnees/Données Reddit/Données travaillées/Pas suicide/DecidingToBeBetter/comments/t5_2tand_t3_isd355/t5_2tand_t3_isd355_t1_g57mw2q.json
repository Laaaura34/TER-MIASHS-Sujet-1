The life you want for yourself is not impossible or that far away. It\u2019s just not here right at this moment. And that\u2019s hard, but it\u2019s not impossible. You have to decide each day, how you\u2019re going to live today to achieve your dreams and goals. So first, write down your dreams. Then research how you can achieve that. Nobody here will have the answer on how to fix your life, ultimately only you know how to fix/change it, but it will take time because it still doesn\u2019t happen over night. It feels hopeless but it\u2019s not. You\u2019re just in the middle of it right now. Eventually this moment in life ends. And sometimes sooner than you think. And moving towards your goal instead of staying stagnant makes you feel better at the end of the day, even if you\u2019re not where you want to be yet, at least you\u2019re working towards it. How will you work towards it today?\n\n\nAlso side note but make sure you dream bigger than just having sex. You should at least aim to have sex with the coolest person you ever met that was equally attracted to you. Aim high. Strive for the best. Because why not? Why can\u2019t good things happen?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/isd355/looking_for_someone_to_try_and_give_me_hope_if/g57mw2q/"}
