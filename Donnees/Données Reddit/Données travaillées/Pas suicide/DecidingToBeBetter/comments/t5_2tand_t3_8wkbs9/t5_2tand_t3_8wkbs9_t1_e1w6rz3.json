For me, I just accept the shortness of life as something beyond my control and use it as motivation to stay active and enjoy whatever time I get to have and the people I get to know. I don't deserve anything, so every day and every friend is a gift.\n\nAs far as death is concerned, since I won't be around I don't care too much about what happens to me after death. What I do have control over is how people remember me and the things I leave behind. This motivates me to be a great person, to make a positive mark on as many lives as I can, to leave this world better than how I found it. Our bodies die, but our deeds live on. It is through our deeds that we achieve immortality.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8wkbs9/hard_time_trying_to_find_religion/e1w6rz3/"}
