Attend church services at churches that interest you.  Read books about the faith you feel drawn towards.  I think different things draw different people in, and perhaps God speaks to us in ways unique to our own understanding.  I was largely unreligious growing up and it was seeing my now husband\u2019s love for the faith and wanting to live that life with him that drew me in.  It is so much more fulfilling to me than I had ever assumed it would be being on the outside looking in.  Feel free to message me if you\u2019d like any suggestions on books to read or questions you may have, I can at very least point you in the right direction.  I wish you well on your search!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/8wkbs9/hard_time_trying_to_find_religion/e1w6o0b/"}
