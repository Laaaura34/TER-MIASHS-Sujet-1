Reading through the Bible you'll find many people with all sorts of doubts that God worked in spite of.\n\n**Faith is not the absence of doubt. It's acting on what you DO know.**\n\nI agree with the people on here that don't even believe in God. **I urge you to read the Bible and test what Jesus said. (You have to resist the urge to bend the words though).** I have found him truthful...even when I really wanted otherwise -- so I could have my own way :)\n\nThe thing that keeps me going is I try to remember what God HAS done for me. I don't try to conjure anything up. Just focus on what you believe He has done and go from there.\n\nYou'll also notice that in the Bible, God tells people to do the exact same thing. When you see him work in your life (big or small), write it down! When we forget, doubts rush in.
