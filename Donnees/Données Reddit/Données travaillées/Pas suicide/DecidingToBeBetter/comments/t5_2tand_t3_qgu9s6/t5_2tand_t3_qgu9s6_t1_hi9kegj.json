There's a lot of gold in there.\n\nAs they say, self-hate and hyper-criticism are learned behavior. Someone on here not too long ago said that something that helped them get over this was to take the other route completely and make huge over the top compliments to themselves *especially* when they did something they would have normally criticized themselves for.\n\nExample: They would be walking somewhere and stumble a little on their own feet, instead of saying \"god I'm so clumsy\" they would think to themselves \"I have the grace of a ballerina, I should join the Moscow ballet\", it's self deprecating sure, but it's not reinforcing a negative thought pattern, it's helping to unlearn the hyper criticism and maybe when you get a bit more used to it you can start making **Actual** compliments to yourself like, \"Phew I almost tripped but nice save, I could have eaten concrete there\".\n\nAnd please remember that no one is going to be as hard as you on these things, people don't care. You do something stupid and most have moved on with their lives within 20 seconds.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgu9s6/how_do_i_stop_hating_and_cringing_at_myself_for/hi9kegj/"}
