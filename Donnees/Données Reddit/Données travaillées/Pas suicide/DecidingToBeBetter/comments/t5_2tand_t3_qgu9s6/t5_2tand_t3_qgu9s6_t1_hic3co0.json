He casually handed me a museum-quality trilobite fossil last Saturday like it was nothing! I was scared to breathe on it wrong but he just went on talking about the local limestone deposits and how this other geode was taken from a core sample he took while scouting a site for new construction\u2026. Like????? \nThis dude has amazing rocks. \nHis petrified wood has RAINBOWS of color! My best piece is mostly grey and creamy white!!  His trilobite was barely bigger than my thumb but had PERFECT preservation of its face and mouthparts!?! I wanted to cry, it was beautiful", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/qgu9s6/how_do_i_stop_hating_and_cringing_at_myself_for/hic3co0/"}
