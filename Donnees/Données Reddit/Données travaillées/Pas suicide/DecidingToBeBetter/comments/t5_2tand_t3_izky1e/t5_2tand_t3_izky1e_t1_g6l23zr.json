Funny and interesting how much psychic energy I put into the concern that I would be the only one not drinking in a group, that my friends would think it was weird, that I would feel like the odd ball and not fit into the crowd. At the time it seemed like a legitimate concern. I didn\u2019t want to be weird and different from the group. Now I don\u2019t think about it at all and don\u2019t care one bit if I\u2019m the only person drinking ginger ale. And, from what I can see, no one else seems to care either!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/izky1e/1095_days/g6l23zr/"}
