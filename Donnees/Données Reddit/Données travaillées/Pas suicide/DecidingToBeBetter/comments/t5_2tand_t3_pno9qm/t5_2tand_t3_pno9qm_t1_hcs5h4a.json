You get a great education, it is cheap (and now in some places it is free), if you want to you can transfer the credits to a four year school and voila - educated without a giant life destroying debt.

A terrific choice.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pno9qm/i_think_i_actually_like_community_college/hcs5h4a/"}
