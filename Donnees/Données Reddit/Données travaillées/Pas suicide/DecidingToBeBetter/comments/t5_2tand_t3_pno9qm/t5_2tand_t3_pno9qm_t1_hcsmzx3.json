Most people overlook this part.\n\nAlso, as you said the main upside of university is the \"experience\", the parties etc. It's just not worth it paying this much for parties...  \nPeople might say that you also pay for a better education but we don't care, nobody cares about how good was your education, employers care about the reputation of your school/university/college. But what they care the most about is personnal project (if you can do projects) or portfolio.\n\nSo really just try and meet some interesting and different people from your college and work on projects/associations/your portfolio and you will lend jobs as if you went to regular (overpriced) university!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pno9qm/i_think_i_actually_like_community_college/hcsmzx3/"}
