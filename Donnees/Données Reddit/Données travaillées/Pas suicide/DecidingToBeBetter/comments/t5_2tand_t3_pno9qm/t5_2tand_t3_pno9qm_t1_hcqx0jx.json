Much wider variety of people around. Much more interesting than just being around a bunch of high school 4 year college kids. I missed some of the partying and Greek life crap by going to a CC but the up side is that I graduated with a BA without any debt. FAFSA kicks in hard around 24 if you don't make a lot of money. Plus I met such a crazy variety of people- Vietnam vets, gangsters, artists, erotic fantasy writers, hearse collectors, all sorts of random people I probably wouldn't have if I ended up going straight to a 4 year from high school (and thus probably straight into debt)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pno9qm/i_think_i_actually_like_community_college/hcqx0jx/"}
