Antidepressants alone don't help you. They might be useful in the beginning to see for yourself how you feel but after sometime it isn't helpful. Depends on you and on your own will to get better and get out of the situation. Might be helpful to do something you enjoy and that helps you to enjoy yourself and have fun. See what you can change in your routine (might be something that can help you clear your head without antidepressants). Although exercise helps, yea it's more about your mindset more than the exercise itself. Plan what you want to do and just stick to it. Unless you feel it doesn't work, you can change but just try whatever you can and everything in your power not to be dominated by dark emotions. I still struggle with this myself but I am trying, I am not letting depression get in my way.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fjkiv4/how_can_i_become_a_doer_rather_than_just_a_planner/fl42rcp/"}
