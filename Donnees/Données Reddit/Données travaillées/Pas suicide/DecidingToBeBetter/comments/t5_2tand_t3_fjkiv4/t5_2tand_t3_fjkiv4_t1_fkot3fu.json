Those years were beyond tough for me.  It took me a long time to develop tools for living my life.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>why did you name it your \"done list\" rather than just a todo list?\n\nI call it the \"Done List\" as I only write what I have already done.  This makes me focus on what I have accomplished rather than all I have yet to do.  The 7 things I have on the list above are things that I completed in that hour not things I was planning on doing.\n\nMy planning is pretty minimal.  My To-do lists are rarely more than 3 tasks (tiny tiny tasks).  Getting off my butt to do these tiny tasks usually leads to doing more so I usually have more than 3 to write down.  If I only do the 3 tiny things, I still write it down.\n\nI so so hope you don't get this pestilence.  Ugh. \n\nLet me know how you get on with or without the pestilence.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fjkiv4/how_can_i_become_a_doer_rather_than_just_a_planner/fkot3fu/"}
