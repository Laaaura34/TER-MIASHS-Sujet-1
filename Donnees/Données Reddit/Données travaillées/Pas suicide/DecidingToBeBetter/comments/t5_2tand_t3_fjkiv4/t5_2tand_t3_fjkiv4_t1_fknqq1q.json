I struggle with making to do lists with too much on them and feeling unaccomplished even if I've worked for hours. It doesn't help that my projects are so large I can spend hours on one task. I want to try this idea! I've done it before sorta by adding tasks I've done to my to do list if I forgot and then crossing them off right away, just because I still think I deserve to cross them off lmao. I think a done list could work really well for me. And focusing on 3 tasks. I just have a hard time prioritizing and feel the need to be being productive all the time.. since that isn't possible I end up burning out every day going as hard as I can and then feeling shitty for not doing as much as i \"could.\" And then the next day I'm more likely to struggle as well. So I'm going to try this technique!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fjkiv4/how_can_i_become_a_doer_rather_than_just_a_planner/fknqq1q/"}
