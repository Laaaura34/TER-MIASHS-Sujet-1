Lately, my work has been extremely stressful and basically a total shit-show. And I notice that when I focus on the bad stuff (and some of it is really bad), I feel worse. So when I tell my supports about what happened, I now make a point to also talk about the GOOD things that happened in the day. This helps both of us have a better picture of what my job is really like, on average. Otherwise I'd be constantly wanting to quit and my supports would probably be urging me to do the same, since all they hear is how bad it is.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mxcrnh/i_realized_im_only_journaling_about_the_bad_stuff/gvpqfa5/"}
