You can basically start however you want to start. For me, when I have an anxiety episode, I start by writing what I feel, then I write the \"what if\" questions that make me feel that way. It's not a rule I follow, it's just how my thought process goes, like, \"My heart is beating fast because I am thinking what if this happens.\"\n\nMy anxiety makes me believe in worst case scenario things that have little to no evidence in reality, so the way I sift through it is I create a T chart. \n\nOn the left, I write the thoughts, the what ifs, and the worst case scenarios that bother me (for example, \"I am scared I have cancer because one of my moles looked funny. What if it's cancer? I'll have to go to chemo and I will have to drive myself to poverty to cure myself.\"). \n\nOn the right, I basically try to \"expose\" those thoughts as fake by listing reasons why they may not be true (\"I am not a doctor nor am I an expert in determining skin conditions. This might be something less serious. I may have just scratched it. It never really changed in shape or color, you just think it's weird.\")\n\nIf that does not work, I list things that I notice, like the bird chirping, the fan noise, etc. It helps distract the brain. I sometimes just doodle.\n\nThe process of writing itself is what helps me get through the thoughts.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mxcrnh/i_realized_im_only_journaling_about_the_bad_stuff/gvo5gmn/"}
