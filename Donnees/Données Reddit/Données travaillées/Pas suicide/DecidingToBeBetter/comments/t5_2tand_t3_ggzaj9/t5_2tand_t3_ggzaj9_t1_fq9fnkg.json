This would result in me not completing the task or completing it with poor effort.\n\nI realized that if i were to rather act fast (avoiding analysis paralysis) and react slow (increasing my resilience by not focusing on negative reactions), I would have a higher change of completing the task I set out for myself.\n\nIt's like they say, you only lose when you give up. Reacting negatively to a task is giving up in a sense. You can still achieve and complete the task in this mindset but that will cause you to use an immense amount of mental strength and will most likely be unstable.\n\nTLDR: Be fast to act towards your goals and opportunities and be slow to react in discomfort.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/ggzaj9/the_fast_slow_principle/fq9fnkg/"}
