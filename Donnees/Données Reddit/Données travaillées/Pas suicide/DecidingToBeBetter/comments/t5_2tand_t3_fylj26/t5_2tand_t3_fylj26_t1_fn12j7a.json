Now our bodies don\u2019t know the difference between mental stress / physical or emotional. All of these are seen as stress which results in high levels of cortisol. When we get past a sustainable level of this hormone it is detrimental to our body, it can even trigger our bodies to start breaking down proteins from our muscles as energy and send us into a burnout state. Good indicators of high cortisol are elevated HR at rest (you can check in mornings and compare to other days) and high blood pressure. It\u2019s smart to avoid HIGH stress activities when you notice these things. Take time to thank yourself for all your hard work during the week. Do something to thank your body! Stretching, meditation, yoga, deep breathing. No hard working machine can continue endlessly without either a catastrophic failure, or regular maintenance.\n\nWhen we understand our physiology better and listen to our bodies we come to respect that we too need a balance (good diet, exercise, mental clarity) to continuously perform at a high level.
