I recommend boardgame meetups because there are a lot of nerdy people there that are also socially awkward. You can find public events through news papers, magazines, online event calendars like EventBright, Facebook, meetup.com, or your local library. If you're into a subject or hobby you can chat with local businesses to see if they know of a local group that gets together. For example in my area there's an astronomy meetup where people bring their telescopes to check out stars and planets but you'd never know unless you googled astronomy groups in Utah and found their website.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cs1nnp/how_to_be_comfortable_in_your_own_skin_and_stop/exdfnol/"}
