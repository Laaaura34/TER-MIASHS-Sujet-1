For example\n\n* Instead of going to the local better basketball court, I'd just play basketball on my drive.\n* Instead of doing self-service at stores, I'd rather go to old school checkout because I didn't want to press a wrong button and get embarrassed.\n* I used to wear my hood up all the time because I felt 'exposed'\n* I'd always have my head down when walking\n* I never looked strangers in the eye when walking past\n* I never used to take up space (power poses) when sitting down and always had my legs crossed (I am a man too)\n* I didn't wear clothes I really liked because I'd feel too overdressed\n\nIt took time, but now I do the opposite of all these things. I always like these flashy windbreakers and would be nervous to wearing them as they'd look too different, now I wear them all the time. I always liked extreme super skinny jeans because you don't always see men wearing them, but only recently decided to wear them. These are just a few examples.\n\nThe best way to is to just really learn the art of not giving a f\\*ck. Read Mark Manson's book and start to understand social psychology. You will also learn that people really don't give a shit, so why should you?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cs1nnp/how_to_be_comfortable_in_your_own_skin_and_stop/exce0kg/"}
