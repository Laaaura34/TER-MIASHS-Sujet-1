I've struggled with social anxiety and body presence insecurities. Mindfulness practices are great, but if you someone who is willing to endure an extreme approach, I would highly recommend social dancing. \n\nSpecifically, when you are at events, try to ask whomever you are most afraid to dance with to dance first. Usually this is the most attractive and/or skilled dancer. It is terrifying, but if you can get yourself to do it even once, it is the most empowering feeling in terms of overcoming what you fear. The best part is it doesn't even matter how well you dance with them! Only you will know your true goal, and you will succeed with every attempt!\n\nDancing also can be extremely fun! The best part is that if you do for a little bit, say around three months, your body and social confidences will skyrocket. \n\nBest of luck my friend! I've heard the phrase \"It doesn't get easier, it gets better\" and I partially agree. With anxiety, it gets better until you face the underlying fears causing them. Then it gets better and easier.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cs1nnp/how_to_be_comfortable_in_your_own_skin_and_stop/exdnyan/"}
