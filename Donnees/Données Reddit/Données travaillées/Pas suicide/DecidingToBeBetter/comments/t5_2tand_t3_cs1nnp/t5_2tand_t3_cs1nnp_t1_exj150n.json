You seem like such an inviting, non argumenative  person..\n\nIf you want to overcome social anxiety. You have to actually want it.     Otherwise everything else is just a blanket to later be removed.    If you want something badly enough your mind will take you there.  It will figure out the ways to overcome it.  But it will take time.  Years.  But like a lot of people they cant seem to understand that.   And that nothing is instant overnight gratification. \n\nWork on yourself.  What you can control.  Make yourself FEEL confident.   Thats step one.   What I already put in my last comment.   Make yourself feel confident.  Feeling confident is half the battle.   Find what makes you feel your best    Once you do that  practice self talk.   What gets you most about social anxiety and being in public.  Take risks.  Overcome your fears. Make mistakes. And learn from each time.    Make people like YOU. Just by being you. \n\nOr piss and moan that you have 'no control' and continue being a miserable sob   \n\nI spent 13 years with depression anxiety and 5 years of suicidal thoughts.   Nothing was going to change unless I decided to.  \n\nIts been 2 years of therapy, psychotherapy and changing my life around 180\u00b0.  I have quit my job, started my own business moved across the state, bought and renovated an rv and continue to thrive.\n\nYou cant overcome something unless you really want it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cs1nnp/how_to_be_comfortable_in_your_own_skin_and_stop/exj150n/"}
