But here's advice that goes to the root of the problem.\n\nThe problem is that you're uncomfortable being uncomfortable.

The problem is that you're embarrassed that you feel these things and try to hide it. Judging our emotions as bad or wrong amplifies them out of control. \n\nTake a deep breath, love yourself regardless of what fears come up and laugh at the ridiculous of it all.
