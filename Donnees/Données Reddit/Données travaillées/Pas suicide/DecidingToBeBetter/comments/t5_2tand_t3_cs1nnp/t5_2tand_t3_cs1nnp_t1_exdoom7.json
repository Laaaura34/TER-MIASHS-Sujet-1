What the ACTUAL HELL. This post is literally me. I am also 6'3\" and decent looking (at least average....I think, nobody would say I'm ugly at least) and I am SO awkward with women but most guys will like me. Cant help it. Also I wanted to say I understand the height thing so much man... I went to the biggest mall in florida and so many people turned heads at me, I felt like all the short people decided to go shopping that day so I was over a foot taller than the crowd. With so many people looking at me and my awkwardness, I have no idea what to look at or when I do look at someone they are already looking at me so I look down quickly and if it's a girl they automatically assume I like them (even if I dont, I am that awkward) I think I suffer from extreme social anxiety. I dont like doing anything in public and avoid people because I dont like being looked at. I'm so tall i take the old people carts at walmart and sit down and drive that thing around just so people dont notice me from my height when standing up. I for real cant di anything about this awkwardness I've researched and read books and thought about it and tried not to care but I'm just hella awkward. Probably never going to get a girlfriend either because of my trouble talking to girls...damn this sucks.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/cs1nnp/how_to_be_comfortable_in_your_own_skin_and_stop/exdoom7/"}
