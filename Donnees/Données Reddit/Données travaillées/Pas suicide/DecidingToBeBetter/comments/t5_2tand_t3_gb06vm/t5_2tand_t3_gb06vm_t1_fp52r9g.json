Just because you\u2019re not rich doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not priviliged or entitled. \n\nIt\u2019s not about what you have, it\u2019s about your complete lack of understanding others and expecting them to conform to you rather than you to the world.\n\nAll reactions to you, fair or otherwise, have been a result of your own behaviour. Based on your attitude in this thread (which you posted to ask for help!) I would not judge you kindly either.\n\nI don\u2019t care about the coat, pens or vocabulary. You just don\u2019t seem like a nice person.\n\nI made my \u2018useless\u2019 hobby into my career, even those that didnt believe in me were nice to me because of how I interacted with them and the fact that my confidence did not come from their approval, so I wasnt looking for it and certainly not trying to force it by putting down others, like your default defense mechanism in this thread. \n\nI don\u2019t see your Victorian interests being an issue, just your attitude.\n\n(P.s throwaway account, I\u2019m a gaming related youtuber)\n\nP.p.s. That is not to say people will not judge you or be rude, but it should be exceptional and unimpactful rather than your first interactions with people to go like they did above. Impressively poorly for someone that supposedly thinks a lot about how to speak properly.\n\nI would recommend putting time into *what* you\u2019re saying and not only how you\u2019re pronouncing or wording it.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/gb06vm/i_feel_as_if_my_victorian_lifestyle_is_going_to/fp52r9g/"}
