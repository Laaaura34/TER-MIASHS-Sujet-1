Your many posts about your family being well-off. All anyone has to do is come across one of your posts to see how entitled you are. \n\nThe real world is a huge part of all of our lives. We are dealing with the lockdowns for the greater good. Look beyond yourself and find a hobby and just stop crying. This isn\u2019t the end of the world. \n\nI get that you\u2019re young and you have no real problems or responsibilities so this seems bigger than it is. We are all dealing with the same thing and 99% of us are getting by.
