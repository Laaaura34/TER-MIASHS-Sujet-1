I tried to take my life because as much as i can shut myself off from other people, i can\u2019t shut myself off from myself. I essentially killed that inner voice or that \u201ctrue self\u201d a long time ago trying to please everyone else. It\u2019s not coming back anymore. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, everyone is supportive and nice to me, but i always put everyone on a pedestal and assume they\u2019re judging me, when they might not be. I end up antagonizing them because of my own personal thoughts and give myself unnecessary grief, that\u2019s why i\u2019m cutting everybody off. When your brain makes your friends and family look like enemies and competitors, the best thing to do is to stay away from them so your brain can\u2019t make anyone look like they\u2019re against you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/okxpz6/i_have_decided_to_give_up_on_being_better/h5e9i7m/"}
