Got straight Bs instead of straight As and got rejected. I retook the finals again and shelled out a bit over a thousand shortly after, and ended up getting straight Cs haha. Just goes to show that trying again will always lead to failure. \n\nI don\u2019t have any job that I would foresee enjoying, so I decided on being a doctor since it\u2019ll probably pay the highest in the end and I can pursue my other interests whatever they\u2019ll be. Besides that, nothing so far has ticked with me or made me happy\n\nI don\u2019t foresee myself surviving until the end of the decade right now tbh. Life throws so much at me and I got pretty close to dying last month; it just needs to get lucky one more time and push me over the edge again. That\u2019s why i\u2019m giving up on long term goals altogether and doing what makes me happy, which is sleeping the whole day through, haha.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/okxpz6/i_have_decided_to_give_up_on_being_better/h5e7qzr/"}
