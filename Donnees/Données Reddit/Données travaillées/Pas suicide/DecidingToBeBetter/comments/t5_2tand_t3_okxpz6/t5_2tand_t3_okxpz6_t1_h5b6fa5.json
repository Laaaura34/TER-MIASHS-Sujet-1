What is a type of job that you might enjoy long term?  What skills would you need to perform that job? Spend a little time everyday learning one of these skills, or maybe just learning more about the job. In time take a single class, to develop that skill. \n\nSide note: several universities offer their classes online for free, you don\u2019t get credit for them, but you learn the same things as any paying student, if you are afraid of paying money and failing, maybe take the class for free first, then when you pay for it later you will already know what is expected of you. \n\nInstead of where do I want to be in a week/month/year. Ask, where do I want to be in a decade?  And take tiny actions to get there. Let yourself fail, no one who has ever accomplished anything at all hasn\u2019t failed more than they\u2019ve succeeded. Try, fail, learn, repeat. Things aren\u2019t linear, they ebb, they flow, try to learn to enjoy the ride.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/okxpz6/i_have_decided_to_give_up_on_being_better/h5b6fa5/"}
