Yeah, I think I should work on improving my existing relationships first. \nStarting today I am going to be more social.\n\n\nCan you recommend any blogs or books to help me on this path?\nI've already ordered \"the art of communicating\" by Thich Nhat Hanh from Amazon. It will get delivered to me by next week. \n\nI am also thinking about putting myself out there and sharing whatever I learn. \nBig Gary Vee fan. \n\nThanks", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/flqiqs/30m_single_feeling_lonely_never_had_a_girlfriend/fl02uh6/"}
