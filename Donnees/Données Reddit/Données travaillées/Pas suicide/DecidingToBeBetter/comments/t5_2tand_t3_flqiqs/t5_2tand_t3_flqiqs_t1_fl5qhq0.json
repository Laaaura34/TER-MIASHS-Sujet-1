I saw one video yesterday by 'Julien Himself', it was about how not to be boring. I could relate to the things he was talking about like the stuff that goes on in our head and what to do about it etc. It's unreal how much I gained from that 1 short video. It's a whole new subject for me. I am just exploring the whole thing. Also found another guy called Owen Cook I've subscribed to him on YouTube. It's definitely going to change the way I look at things and help me be more socially confident.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/flqiqs/30m_single_feeling_lonely_never_had_a_girlfriend/fl5qhq0/"}
