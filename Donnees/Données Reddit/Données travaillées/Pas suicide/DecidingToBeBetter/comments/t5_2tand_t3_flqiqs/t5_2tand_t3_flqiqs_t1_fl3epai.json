That's a great tip. I definitely need to join some communities and attend meetups etc more often.\nI have done this in the past but that was long back, almost 2-3 years ago. I didn't have the right mindset at the time. I used to attend some random meetups and was doing it just to find clients for my web design business. I met some amazing people but  didn't do anything to grow those relationships. Yes I must be more positive. Need to become more aware and stop acting like a victim.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/flqiqs/30m_single_feeling_lonely_never_had_a_girlfriend/fl3epai/"}
