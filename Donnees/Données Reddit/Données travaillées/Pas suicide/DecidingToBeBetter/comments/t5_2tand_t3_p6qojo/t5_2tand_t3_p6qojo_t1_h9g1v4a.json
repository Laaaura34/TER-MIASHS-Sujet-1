This very nice and kind of you to say, and I think that is do-able - rest and then tackle things, one at a time :)\n\nA part of your text, however, intrigues me - the feeling that if you could, you ought to let someone more deserving live your life and take advantage of your opportunities - could you explain a bit what you meant and what made you feel that from my message above? I feel like you are trying to say that maybe you, just like myself - there is a bit of lack of gratitude for the oppprtunities I have been given. Perhaps, and I did consider that a lot, contributing to the cycle of shame and \"meh\"..\nI am simply just curious what you meant :) because if it is the above - how doea one get out of it?
