I also quit weed a week shy of 3 months ago (This time for good). \n\nI've just run out of vape juice and I wont be buying any tomorrow because I've got some nicotine chewies to further taper down, before giving up nicotine hopefully for good as well.\n\nI'm only telling you this, because I guess that I'm proud of myself, and that I don't have many in my life to share it with.\n\nI was considering either getting a ps4 and some games this coming week. To help distract me from vape/nicotine  cravings in the coming months. I was also considering buying a restored lux 2nd hand road push bike. I was leaning towards the ps4, but reading this post, maybe I'll get the bike instead. I'm not very overweight, but I could certainly lose 5-8kg'sfrom my lower and upper-torso and and give my lungs a workout!\n\nthese times are the best times!
