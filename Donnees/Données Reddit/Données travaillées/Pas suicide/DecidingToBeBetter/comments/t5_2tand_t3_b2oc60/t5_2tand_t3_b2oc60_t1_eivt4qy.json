Honestly. You wrote out such a long, thoughtful response and that already made my heart swell. I've tried something similar, when I had a bullet journal and used a monthly tracker, but I got so stressed about making it look perfect that the moment I missed a day of doing something, I felt inadequate and like I failed the entire month. It seems like that method will allow me to not feel so guilty if I mess up, and show progress rather than trying to make a whole month perfect. Ill definitely be taking your advice and trying it out.
