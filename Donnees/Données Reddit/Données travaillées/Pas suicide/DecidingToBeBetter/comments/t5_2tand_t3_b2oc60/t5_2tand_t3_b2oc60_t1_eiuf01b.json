While this works, the need to maintain the organization is still there. No matter how good you get everything to look, it will all go back to what it was if you do not maintain it. Think about it like losing weight and having to eat healthy to keep it off. \n\nFinally, I\u2019ll leave off with my last tip that I always take advantage of. I, for one, use my driver side door pocket to keep garbage (empty water bottles, receipts, etc), but I\u2019ve seen people purchase and use cloth trash bins to attach to the backs of the seats in their car. Either way - make sure that whenever you gas your car up, take advantage of the trash cans at the pump. It gives you something to do that\u2019s productive while waiting for your gas instead of just standing there browsing Reddit :)\n\nHappy maintenance!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/b2oc60/im_cleaning_my_apartment_for_the_first_time_in_a/eiuf01b/"}
