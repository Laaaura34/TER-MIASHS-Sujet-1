To find the motivation to fill 22 bags of garbage can\u2019t have been easy. You should be really proud of yourself. I know you say you have a way to go but two weeks ago I bet you never thought you could achieve this and you did. Have you watched any of the Netflix shows on tidying like Marie Kondo? My friend said she found another one she liked which inspired her more. There are probably lots of things on YouTube or Pinterest. I think you just need to keep your motivation up by imagining how great you will feel once you are finished. And you have inspired me by posting this as I\u2019m totally overwhelmed with clutter just now. And I won\u2019t put it off tomorrow *again* \nSo thank you, OP.
