I live with room mates and its so hard to keep clean. I work 2 jobs too, and I am home at 9 to 10 pm. After that my brain is just fried. I mostly do a rough 5 minute clean up on the weekends. I just sort things make sure they are in their place.  \n\n\nI actually genuinely love how I feel after I am done cleaning that I am slightly motivated to do it. I also do the cleaning while watching Netflix or TV. Or when I don't feel like studying.   \n\n\nI also just pick what I see. For example, the trash in the kitchen that's been bothering me, I just pick it and throw it. That sock on the floor that's been there, as soon as I notice it and the thought comes to mind, I just pick it. Or anything else that's there. I basically don't ignore things out of place. that brush I left on my bed in the morning, lets just quickly put it away.   \n\n\n&#x200B;", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/b2oc60/im_cleaning_my_apartment_for_the_first_time_in_a/eiv5spu/"}
