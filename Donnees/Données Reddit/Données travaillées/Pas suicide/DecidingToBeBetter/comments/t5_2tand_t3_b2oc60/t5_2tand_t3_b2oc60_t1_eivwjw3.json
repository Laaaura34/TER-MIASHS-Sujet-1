I've definitely thought about reaching out to someone and asking for help but all my friends have had a very hard year and it felt like something I couldn't put on them, and yes, I was unbelievably ashamed to admit the state I was living in. For now, though, I think it's something I have to do myself. Not out of pride this time, but out of kindness to myself. I have to put myself through this and be accountable, and that way I can make sure I won't let it get this bad again. I don't know if that exactly makes sense, and maybe it does sound prideful, idk, but I promise, if I get overwhelmed or hit a wall, I'll reach out to someone for help.
