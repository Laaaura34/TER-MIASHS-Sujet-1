Starting is the hardest part. Once you have the place to where you want it, I like the 2 bins method. Everything that comes through the door and I mean EVERYTHING either has a place that it gets put, refrigerator, drawer etc, it gets put in a bin to be thrown out or a bin to be donated. When the trash bin is full, you empty it, when the donate bin is full, you donate everything. If it doesn\u2019t have a \u201chome\u201d it goes in a bin. Nothing is put on the floors, stored on counters etc. I hope this helps and keep up the GREAT work. I\u2019m proud of you!!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/b2oc60/im_cleaning_my_apartment_for_the_first_time_in_a/eiu8fsa/"}
