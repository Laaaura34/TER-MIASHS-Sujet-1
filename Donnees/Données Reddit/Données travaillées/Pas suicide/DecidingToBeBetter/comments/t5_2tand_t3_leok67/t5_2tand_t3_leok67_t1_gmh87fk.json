(That is to say BETTER books since you mentioned reading)\n\nChoose a book that really aligns with the type of games you like: military themed, fantasy-esque , car racing etc. Don\u2019t give a second to a book that doesn\u2019t absolutely blow your socks off \n\nOne thing I think people like about gaming is the suspense of what will happen next and the thrill of what\u2019s to come. And it\u2019s addicting. Also it takes a lot of focus. Maybe try getting a well known super good book and see if that tickles your fancy. Keeps you interested, takes focus and keeps you in suspense especially if it\u2019s a murder mystery or something.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/leok67/i_dont_want_gaming_to_be_my_only_source_of_fun/gmh87fk/"}
