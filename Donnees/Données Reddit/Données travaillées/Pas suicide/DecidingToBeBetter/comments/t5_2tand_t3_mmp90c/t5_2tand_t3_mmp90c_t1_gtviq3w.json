I lie in bed or whatever the moment is, stuck. And I think hey. Ok what would make the next moment just a tiny bit better?... Logically maybe.... A shower?? A tiny walk? Emotionally or physically maybe the most delicious scone from my favourite local cafe? Or A chocolate bar? Reading a chapter of a book? A good nap? Multivitamins? And so on and so on. \n\nAnd so I go do that (with much effort). After that I decide the next thing. Light a scented candle? Sure why not. I usually like that. \n\nSo at the end of the day when you look back, even though it was impossibly hard and shit, in a way it could have been worse. Like at least now you slept a little or showered. Or in your case brushed your teeth. And those things, over time help your body to heal physically and mentally to just be in a better place (I don't mean a perfect place- just even a tiny difference). And a tiny difference can mean a welcome shift in things. Just gets you to a different place than you were. And that I figure is something good. \n\nWell done for doing that task, it's victories in the small moments!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mmp90c/i_was_actually_able_to_wash_my_teeth_everyday/gtviq3w/"}
