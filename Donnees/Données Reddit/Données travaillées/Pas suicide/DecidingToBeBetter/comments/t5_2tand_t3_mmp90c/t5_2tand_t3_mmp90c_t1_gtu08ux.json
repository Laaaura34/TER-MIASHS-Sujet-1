They were both locked into a claw-like grip, and they looked like balloons with how swollen they were.  \n\nShe lived that way for about fifteen years.  \n\nIn the last couple years of her life, she lost vision in one of her eyes, and at the end she lost vision in the other.  \n\nBut she was always cheerful and optimistic. She continued to drive until the last year of her life, despite it being an agony to work the controls, and she cooked for all of us. It was her favorite thing. She made butterscotch pie from scratch, and always fed me corn flakes with as much sugar as I wanted and half and half instead of milk when I was a kid.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mmp90c/i_was_actually_able_to_wash_my_teeth_everyday/gtu08ux/"}
