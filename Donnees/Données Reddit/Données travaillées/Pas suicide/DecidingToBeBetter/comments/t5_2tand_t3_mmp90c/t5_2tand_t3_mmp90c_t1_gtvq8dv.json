I know why it feels like, having gone weeks sometimes not showering - which inevitably made me feel 100 times worse. It\u2019s the most debilitating thing anxiety, it destroys you. I\u2019m not too sure how I dragged myself out of it but it started slowly by just doing simple things like brush the teeth, then strip was then eventually shower. Just thinking about it now is disgusting and really shocking to me because my personal hygiene has always been really important to me. \nI don\u2019t know why we treat ourselves in this way. We are worth so much more. \nKeep at it and love yourself. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/mmp90c/i_was_actually_able_to_wash_my_teeth_everyday/gtvq8dv/"}
