So it's important to tackle that, before trying to logic yourself about the this that's causing you Anxiety. Like if you're feeling that heart pounding terror that if you post \"x\" then \"y\" will happen. You aren't able to reason with youself because your using the part of your brain that's fight or flight, not the let's think logically part.\n\nWhich means it's totally okay that you're not able to logic yourself out of feeling anxious.\n\n2 - One thing that can make social anxieties feel bigger than they are is the subconscious belief that saying \"x\" online is related to who you fundamentally are as a person. When you connect these two things: \"what you say online\" = \"who you are\" then you feel way more threatened by negativity. Because someones negative comment is a threat to \"you as a person.\"\n\nIt can take a good deal of time and energy to convince yourself that these things are separate. And that you don't have to have that terror response because these things are not a threat to you, they are just a response to some words that you put out there.\n\nIf you want me to send you some of the resources I used to help me change some of the \"beliefs\" that were holding me back, I can. But the best thing for me was talk therapy, having someone who can point out when you're jumping to conclusions and lead you towards different patterns of thinking than the ones you default to can be a huge help.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h8sdcs/my_social_anxiety_is_so_bad_if_ever_i_make_a_post/fut4p8t/"}
