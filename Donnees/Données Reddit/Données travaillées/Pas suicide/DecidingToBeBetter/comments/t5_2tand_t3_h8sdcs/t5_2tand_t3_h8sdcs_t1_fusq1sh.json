Personally, I've found that increasing the sense of self worth for an individual works best for reducing anxiety and increasing confidence. Knowing that you have value and no other human is more valuable than you can do wonders. Most people perceive you based on how you view yourself. If you respect yourself and stand up for yourself then people will treat you with respect and if they don't, fuck em honestly. \n\nA good way to increase your sense of self worth is through constant positive affirmations. Wake up in the morning and dedicate 5-10 minutes for reflection and positive self-talk. Remind yourself of the good things you've accomplished in life and your drive to keep improving. Hype yourself up, you're a badass! No one on this Earth is living the life you are now, it is a unique struggle and you're gonna crush it! Remind yourself all throughout the day that you are valuable and that no one can take that value from you. \n\nI really do believe this practice will help reduce your anxiety. If you keep reminding yourself of your value it'll eventually stick. Now for internet trolls, I honestly dont have an answer except for ignoring them lol. Like you said, they're losers. Misguided people expending their energy on negativity. Rise above them. We're in the business of building, not destroying.  I wish you all the best on your journey!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h8sdcs/my_social_anxiety_is_so_bad_if_ever_i_make_a_post/fusq1sh/"}
