It's sometimes better to do nothing.\n\nAlso start something for yourself, it doesn't have to be expensive or \"cute\" but something to work at/ enjoy helps to have something to talk about, it could be a musical instrument/ painting, craft/ cooking, reading to shelter dogs. Something that gets you out of home.\n\nToastmasters also helps with confidence and public speaking, so it could help.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h8sdcs/my_social_anxiety_is_so_bad_if_ever_i_make_a_post/fusolmt/"}
