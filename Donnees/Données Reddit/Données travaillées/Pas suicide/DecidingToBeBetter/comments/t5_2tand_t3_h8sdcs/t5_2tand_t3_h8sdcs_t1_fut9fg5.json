Sorry, but this comment really resonated and I truly appreciate such insight. No apologies needed for the long comment, I read every word. So thank you. I need to step back and really analyze what exactly it is about these interactions that makes me so anxious. I think it\u2019s a bit of both of the reasons you mentioned and truthfully I didn\u2019t even *think* about how I may be experiencing byproducts of these coping tools I had when I was younger. I will say that the similarities I\u2019ve found with people/situations that make me so anxious is the fact that they\u2019re either dominant people and/or authoritative figures. Bosses, my father, other adults I regularly interact with, even the strangers on the internet. As a child I always tried to be that person that adults liked/loved/thought was a good person. And when I got that approval it was amazing. Because the approval of adults, for a while anyway, mattered way more to me than other peers my own age (until around puberty, of course). I guess in a way I thought if adults liked me they wouldn\u2019t be mean to me or yell at me.\n\nI guess somehow that gas boiled over into my interactions with everyone else and how I go into certain situations *expecting* a reaction from others as to prepare myself, like you said.\n\nAnyway, I digress. I think talking to someone would really help. It isn\u2019t cheap but I\u2019ll certainly figure out a way.
