People.\n\nThe fear of people is pretty common in public speaking. And the main reason for that is because we turn the people in the audience into a mass, without any distinct characteristics. A big blob of scary faces.\n\nNext time you come across a troll, give a funny face to the person. Imagine it has a huge nose, and skinny fingers and wearing a sock scarf. Give it the Mickey Mouse voice and super tiny feet.\n\nThe point is to create an image that you will find hilarious. Who wouldn't take that seriously, right?\n\nThere is no doubt that being belittled growing up played a part, but you have the power to reframe your thinking into something more productive. Don't give the power away by curling up in a ball. Make it fun to create avatars.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h8sdcs/my_social_anxiety_is_so_bad_if_ever_i_make_a_post/fv2pafc/"}
