You are who you are right now, and that\u2019s okay. Being kind to yourself, loving yourself, treating yourself as you would a friend is the best thing for you. If you make mistakes, forgive yourself, if you fail, acknowledge it and get back up. Once you accept yourself and love who you are, you\u2019ll be able to overcome the negative feelings, and not be as bothered by others comments. As long as you\u2019re living true to your values and what you care about, people\u2019s opinions won\u2019t matter as much. You\u2019re great, and once you realize that you\u2019ll be amazing. Accept yourself, and then work on things you don\u2019t like so much. Good luck!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h8sdcs/my_social_anxiety_is_so_bad_if_ever_i_make_a_post/fusqf56/"}
