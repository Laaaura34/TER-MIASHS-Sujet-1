Act like Linda in the office who could stare down a rabbid pit bull until it rolled over to be belly rubbed. \n\nWhat would she do if the she were in your situaution. Now pretend that you are her and mentally think of yourself in a play, playing the part of Linda.\n\nNow to be fair, you are going to suck at playing the Linda role at first but you will get better over time...and sooner tha  you imagine, you simply stop playing Linda and are just you.\n\nThis works for everything...dating, job interviews, public speaking, etc. \n\nStart by acting the part of a specific person who would be awesome in that sutuation and over time you will no longer need to act.\n\nFinally and this is really important. Forgive yourself when you fail. That is 100% ok. That is past you not future you. Anxiety about past failures will impair future you's ability to change.
