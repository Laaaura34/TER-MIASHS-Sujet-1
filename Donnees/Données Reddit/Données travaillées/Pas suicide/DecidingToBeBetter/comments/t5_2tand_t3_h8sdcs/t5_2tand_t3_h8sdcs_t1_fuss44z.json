I have pretty bad anxiety and I'm the exact opposite of thick skinned. If anyone says anything to me, I take it to heart. I get anxious if I find anyone talking about me. I have been on reddit for about a year and only started posting since a couple months ago. Thanks to quarantine, I had nothing better to do. And I think things have gotten a tiny bit better. In fact, I have some comments heavily downvoted in another subreddit (I'm not sure why) and I couldn't care less about it. \n\nOne thing that's I like about reddit is that no one knows shit about you. Give it a try. Majority of the time you won't have to deal with mean comments.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h8sdcs/my_social_anxiety_is_so_bad_if_ever_i_make_a_post/fuss44z/"}
