We have been displaced from clinical due to COVID-19 and have been approved by the BRN to discuss health-related issues with the online community. We are working under the supervision of our instructor, however, the education we give is not to replace that of your Primary Care Provider. I have found the following information to answer your question relating to social anxiety disorder (SAD) and mental health. I understand your situation because I, too, have been through verbal abuse having my self-esteem go down. Research has shown that individuals living with SAD experience discomfort when socially interacting due to fear of acting in a way that could lead to humiliation or rejection (Chapdelaine, et. al., 2018). When one feels this way, it is important to get checked by their primary care physician. For treatment, psychotherapy may be needed to help overcome these feelings and thoughts. I am not a medical doctor. Please follow the advice of your Primary Care Physician. I can answer questions, but my information does not replace what your Primary Care Physician has stated. \n\nReference:\n\nChapdelaine, A., Carrier, J.-D., Fournier, L., Duhoux, A., & Roberge, P.
