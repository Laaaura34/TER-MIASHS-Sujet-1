Can\u2019t expect overnight with drugs and therapy to fix this. Likely they\u2019ll say the same thing. \n\nHow would baby steps work? \n\nStep 1. Start by introducing yourself to a stranger in a coffee shop 3 times per week. Little introductions can be scary because what if they reject you. \n\nHow I would do it? Sit down next to them for 5 minutes and ask what they\u2019re reading (if it\u2019s a book). Talk about it.\n\nStep 2. Sharing an opinion in public. \n\nDon\u2019t progress into this until step 1 feels comfortable and not scary. \n\nIn the same conversation with the stranger recommend a book that you enjoy. That\u2019s completely unrelated and different than the one they like with the likelihood they won\u2019t be a fan.\n\nWhy? This isn\u2019t rude and people do this all the time. You likely do not. This is a mini conflict. \n\nStep 3. Sending your food back \n\nAfter recommending a book feels okay, try sending your food back. \n\nGo out to eat at a restaurant late in the day. If the food is anything but perfect, ask the server to fix it.\n\n1.  \u201cThere aren\u2019t enough black beans\u201d is a perfectly reasonable request. \n\n2. \u201cThis is cold/overcooked/tastes funny/etc. is perfectly reasonable to bring up\n\nWhy? This is slightly more of a conflict. Other people\u2019s screw up doesn\u2019t mean you should suffer. It\u2019s uncomfortable to have this conflict but it\u2019s important. \n\nStep 4. Challenging an interrupter \n\nIf someone interrupts you, try your hardest to speak up and say \u201cexcuse me, I was talking.\u201d \n\nStep 5. Instead of challenging and interrupter, just start talking louder and look mad. \n\nOnce you\u2019re comfortable doing that, try to just continue talking but louder if someone else interrupts you. \n\nIf someone\u2019s rude, pipe up and ensure they know that it\u2019s not okay. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve gotten through all of these, conflict shouldn\u2019t be as difficult. \n\nThis + a sports team and/martial arts would be huge for you.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h8sdcs/my_social_anxiety_is_so_bad_if_ever_i_make_a_post/fut45ki/"}
