This makes a negative comment feel crushing because it seems to have as much authority as a positive one. \n\nWhat matters isn\u2019t the comment but who says it. With friends you know in person, you have learned to trust their opinions and value their feedback. \n\nWith anonymous online people, we have no such trust unless we go from the history of what they write. But we must accept that these people don\u2019t really know us. And some people delight in scorn and criticism. \n\nThere is a saying that when a dog pees on the floor, he isn\u2019t being mean to you, he\u2019s just being a dog (or something like that). In some sense, you can cast negative commenters the same way. You don\u2019t have to engage them. If they don\u2019t want to spend the effort to understand you, they are just being negative for the sake of it. You can dismiss them as people raving. \n\nDoes this help?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h8sdcs/my_social_anxiety_is_so_bad_if_ever_i_make_a_post/fusqtf1/"}
