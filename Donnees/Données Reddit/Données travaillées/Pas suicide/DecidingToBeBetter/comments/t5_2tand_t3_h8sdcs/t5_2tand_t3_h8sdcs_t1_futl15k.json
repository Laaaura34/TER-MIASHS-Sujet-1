I have notifications turned off for Reddit, so that I can only see responses when I\u2019m ready.\n\nEdit: sorry, I thought this was on DAE. I realize now you were actually asking for advice, not commiseration. I don\u2019t have time right now to organize my thoughts into advice, but it seems like other commenters have said some helpful things.
