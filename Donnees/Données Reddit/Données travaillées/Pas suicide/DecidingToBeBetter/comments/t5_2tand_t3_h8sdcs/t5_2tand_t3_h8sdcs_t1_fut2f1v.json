It's called Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria.  Lots of people have this but very few know the name. I used to think I was just a garbage person because everybody just seemed to hate me. In fact it was my anxiety making me think they hated me. A small comment of hate ballooned exponentially in size compared to a neutral comment.\n\nI don't really have a solution. I wish I could help. I usually just cry when presented with criticism or even just a new situation. I can't really be happy outside my safe bubble of familiarity. Adding new situations I feel comfortable in is exceedingly laborious.\nThe quarantine has shrunk my world and I greatly fear expanding it again.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/h8sdcs/my_social_anxiety_is_so_bad_if_ever_i_make_a_post/fut2f1v/"}
