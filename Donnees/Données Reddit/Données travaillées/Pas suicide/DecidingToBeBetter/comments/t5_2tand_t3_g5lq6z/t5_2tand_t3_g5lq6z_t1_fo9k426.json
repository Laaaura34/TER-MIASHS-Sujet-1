Having just one and then just leaving it at that as if it\u2019s nothing. I struggle with the whole quitting for life vs. every once in a while thing and I haven\u2019t yet found an answer. For me it\u2019s not alcohol as much as it is cigarettes though. I know that quitting is objectively the best decision for my health and well being.... but but but but. There\u2019s always ways I try to justify keeping it in my life. \n\nAnd I really don\u2019t know :/ I too am a 20 something year old trying to keep myself from sliding into depression. I\u2019m also surrounded by current or ex addicts. So I don\u2019t know that I am qualified to advise when my life is far from perfect, but I know that making my bed in the morning and waking up at a consistent time every morning does WONDERS for my overall mood. That and the feeling of productivity that comes from cleaning. And when I feel better, I do better. I work harder. I have more meaningful interactions. And from that comes less of a desire to find escape in substance (hedonic pleasure) because I\u2019m already satisfied with life (eudaemonic well being). \n\nI hope that helps? I can definitely sympathize, and you shouldn\u2019t guilt yourself cause that probably just makes you feel worse! I believe you are strong and that you can kick addiction\u2019s ass! I think what you are doing now in reaching out through reddit is already a HUGE step. You know where you\u2019re at; not many people have that insight. Now use your self awareness to make decisions that move you toward your life goals!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g5lq6z/seven_months_off_booze_today/fo9k426/"}
