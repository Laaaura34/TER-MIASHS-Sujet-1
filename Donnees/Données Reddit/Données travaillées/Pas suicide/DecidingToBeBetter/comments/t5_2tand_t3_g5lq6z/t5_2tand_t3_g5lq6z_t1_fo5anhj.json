Ones like, you can\u2019t have cake for breakfast, ice cream for dinner, no computer games, be productive etc. That stuff was a good distraction and easier to roll back. \n\nAny time I got the urge to drink I would smile as hard as I could and say \u2018I know what that is, that\u2019s normally when i would have wanted a drink but, awesome! What a relief! I don\u2019t need one today! Yes!\u2019 And try and feel excited at the idea.
