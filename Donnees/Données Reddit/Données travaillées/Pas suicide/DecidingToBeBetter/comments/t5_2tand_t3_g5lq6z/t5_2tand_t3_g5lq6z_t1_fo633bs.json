I decided to stop alcohol, cigarettes, and junk food for one year on 02/02/2020. Felt right and wanted to prove to myself that I have control over my mind and body. It was time to get healthy again.\n\nFor the last few years I would only drink on the weekend, but I would drink hard. By myself. A bottle of really good whiskey washed down with beer and cigarettes. Sometimes a nice weed kicker. I'd vibrate deep into the quiet night, reveling in the solitude. Never got hungover, woke up early, worked around the house, fed the cat, and made breakfast for the wife when she finally got up.\n\nShe didn't like that I would drink alone so that was part of taking the long break, too. I'm fortunate to be able to quit cold turkey like that. I have friends who simply cannot have a drink because they may not stop. The \"just get drunk once\" idea is not an option. That's why they consider themselves *recovering* alcoholics - they're never fully recovered.\n\nNgl, I'd fucking murder for a tall glass of rye, cold pint of Stella, and my smokes rn. The first weeks were the easiest for me but it's all just mental. Cheers, cowboy! Enjoy the ride tonight ~", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g5lq6z/seven_months_off_booze_today/fo633bs/"}
