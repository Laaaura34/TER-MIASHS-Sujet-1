In my head I always feel like I\u2019m letting addiction win if I ever decide to stop something forever. I want to be able to get drunk af on a Friday night, and be fine every other day. I want to beat addiction like it\u2019s an opponent l if that makes sense. It\u2019s so tough and scary tho cuz my whole family is either addicts or completely abstaining.\n\nGot any advice for a 20 year old who\u2019s slipping down a depressing path?\n\n\nEdit: sorry for being depressing, I\u2019m proud of the effort you\u2019re putting into this world. We\u2019re a symbiotic species, if you make yourself a bit better, we will all be a bit better. Thank you \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m so cringey when I\u2019m drunk ffs lmfao", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g5lq6z/seven_months_off_booze_today/fo5wwpe/"}
