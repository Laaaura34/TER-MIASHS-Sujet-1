For some, it is a true physical dependence. For others, it\u2019s a mental/emotional reliance. \n\nI don\u2019t have a physical dependence, and I\u2019m not sure if I will be sober the rest of my life. But I am for the meantime, just under a month. For me, drinking was/is a way of self medicating to handle my anxiety and depression. It\u2019s because you do enjoy being drunk that makes it dangerous. Especially when I was quarantining alone, it was too easy to drink daily, or drink during the day. My anxiety and shame/guilt the following day, even if I hadn\u2019t done anything, was very high. Anxiety/embarrassment about what you did or may have done is horrible, and I don\u2019t WANT to get to the point where I\u2019m physically dependent, or I do something really bad/stupid. \n\nSo for me... addiction is....Thinking about your next drink a lot, or having a drink at night is something you always look forward to. It\u2019s \u201chey a drink sounds good\u201d becomes your response to everything- bored? Drink! Lonely? Drink! Celebrating? Drink! Sad? Drink! It\u2019s when you can\u2019t/don\u2019t stop with just one or two drinks. It\u2019s feeling ashamed of your drinking, and find yourself hiding how much you drink, but simultaneously justifying it to yourself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/g5lq6z/seven_months_off_booze_today/fo60949/"}
