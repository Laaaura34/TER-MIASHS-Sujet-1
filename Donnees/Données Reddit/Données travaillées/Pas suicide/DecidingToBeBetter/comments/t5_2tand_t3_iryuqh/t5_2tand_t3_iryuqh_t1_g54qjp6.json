She\u2019s an amazing human being, but had had the traits you mentioned. All I can say is, people make mistakes. Sometimes the people you love the most will say things about them, but remember they\u2019ll love you no matter what. They might remind you of your mistakes at times, sometimes be harsh. But they\u2019re only trying to help you out in the long run. They\u2019ll love you unconditionally, flaws and all so don\u2019t worry, just don\u2019t make the mistake of repeating the mistakes nor pushing the people away.\n\nAnother thing, forgiveness. Yes, please. You are human, it\u2019s okay that you made mistakes. Most people don\u2019t even recognize it, but you did which shows growth. You\u2019ve got such amazing potential and I wish you the best! \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iryuqh/you_have_to_forgive_yourself_so_you_can_truly_be/g54qjp6/"}
