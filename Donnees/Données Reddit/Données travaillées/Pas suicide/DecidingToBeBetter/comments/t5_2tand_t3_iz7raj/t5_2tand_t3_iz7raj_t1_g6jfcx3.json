I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. \n\nMy dad passed away in May 2019 and the grief still overwhelms me at times. It can feel super alienating especially if you don\u2019t have people who can relate to what you\u2019re going through. But you are not alone \u2764\ufe0f \n\nI completely relate to everything you wrote out. Some days I feel like I\u2019m worse than before because I \u201cknow\u201d what to do and can\u2019t get myself to do it. But this is part of being imperfectly human. We are not meant to have it all figured out and sometimes life is really really rough. I wrote a post a few weeks ago and someone literally said I needed serious professional help in a derogatory way and I feel like we\u2019re often taught it\u2019s problematic to get help or that the feelings that come up in this human experience are somehow crazy. \n\nwe are meant to feel it all and sometimes that fricken blows. But I\u2019m learning to sit with the feelings instead of push them down bc I spent years repressing stuff & they only fester. I am so proud of you for how far you\u2019ve come and for recognizing that it may be helpful to get some outside professional help to hold space that we often don\u2019t have in our daily life. I\u2019ve been teetering on starting therapy to help me deal with the overwhelming things. \n\nYour sadness and anger are totally valid but they\u2019re also fleeting emotions that pass with time. I had these feelings this week and even though they hurt a lot, I also had this sense that as long as I allowed them - they would pass eventually. \n\nYou got this. You\u2019re aware of what\u2019s going on internally which is the biggest battle. Most people are just meat suits walking around & while I used to envy those because \u201cignorance is bliss\u201d - I also realize ignorance is also ignorance and I\u2019d rather be participating in my life than just going through the motions and awareness helps me do this. \n\nYou\u2019re doing a great job. \u2764\ufe0f", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iz7raj/i_missed_meditating_for_a_day_and_instead_of/g6jfcx3/"}
