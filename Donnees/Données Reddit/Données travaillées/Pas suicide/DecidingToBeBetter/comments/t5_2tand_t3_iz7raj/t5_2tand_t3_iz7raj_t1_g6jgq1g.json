I know this journey is a difficult one at times. I think right now the collective energy is sooooooooo unbelievably heavy. I\u2019ve been in the same spot as you. \n\nAnd HELL TO THE FRICKEN YES about feeling guilt actually means we\u2019re in a higher vibration now because we\u2019re able to see the consequences of our actions & actually care about that. I\u2019ve been saying to myself \u201cI am good because I can feel bad\u201d which sounds kind of silly but it\u2019s helped when I was really lost in those guilty shameful thoughts. \n\nWhat\u2019s your insta? Would love to support you and follow your journey \u2764\ufe0f mines @erinpanzarella \n\nThanks for reading & for your comment. I totally resonate with everything you said", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iz7raj/i_missed_meditating_for_a_day_and_instead_of/g6jgq1g/"}
