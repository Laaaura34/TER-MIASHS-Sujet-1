Sometimes I write gratitude lists. sometimes I just write about what happened in my day. Sometimes I write love letters to myself. Sometimes I write to my dad who died.  Sometimes I write to people who are alive - things that I would never tell them in person but that I need to say anyway. Sometimes I write how terrible I feel about my life. My journal holds all my ups and downs and in-betweens. It\u2019s really great just to get stuff out of your head and onto paper. I can get lost in contemplation & feel overwhelmed with thoughts and writing in a journal is a great way to get your whole body into it and moving it through. There\u2019s been a lot of times I\u2019ve felt a lot of heavy emotions and then felt immediately lighter after writing it out. Writing in it is one of my favorite things to do these days & definitely a form of therapy in itself.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/iz7raj/i_missed_meditating_for_a_day_and_instead_of/g6hyp1l/"}
