I was the same way. Extroverted and the class clown in middle school. Whenever my parents sent me to a different school for high school, I knew absolutely no one and people were just unaccepting of the new guy. It seemed like my problem was all these other kids mostly grew up together and they didn\u2019t want to get to know any new people that came to the school. I was bullied. Suddenly I was introverted and wouldn\u2019t talk and just needed to be alone to feel safe. I developed bad social anxiety. I think my entire 9th grade yr I barely said a word to anyone. Whenever I could I\u2019d bust out whatever book I was reading and that\u2019s how I passed the time. After that year of loneliness I was completely changed as a person. \nSeeing what you did to get out of that is encouraging. Ive had the same thoughts before about moving away but I didn\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m running away. It kinda makes sense though. It\u2019s hard for me to be myself around here. Maybe I\u2019d have the chance to grow if I moved away for awhile. I\u2019m 23 and still have no clear idea of what I want to do. I have like 4-5 things I think I\u2019d like to do but I\u2019m not sure what to pick. Maybe time away from everything I\u2019m used to will kick me in the ass and get me going? Any advice?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jryx9r/at_18_years_old_i_was_a_depressed_introvert/gbyidhn/"}
