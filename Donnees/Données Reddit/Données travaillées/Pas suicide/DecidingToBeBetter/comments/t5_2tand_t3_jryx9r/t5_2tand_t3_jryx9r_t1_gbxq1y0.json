After that exam, I\u2019m gonna go from school to straight into the real world. I\u2019ve just had an unfortunate situation with a girl during my last two years at school but she made me realise that I\u2019ve been making no progress throughout my life. I\u2019ve had no drive, motivation, skills, talents, hobbies, confidence and had majorly low self esteem. I\u2019ve always felt lower than low all of high school. This girl has now left from my life but she\u2019s definitely made me realise I need to turn things around for myself. \n\nIt\u2019s really consoling to see someone who was once in the same position as me and I\u2019ve been also checking this sub for inspiration and I definitely some in this post :) Super great to hear you\u2019ve made an improvement!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jryx9r/at_18_years_old_i_was_a_depressed_introvert/gbxq1y0/"}
