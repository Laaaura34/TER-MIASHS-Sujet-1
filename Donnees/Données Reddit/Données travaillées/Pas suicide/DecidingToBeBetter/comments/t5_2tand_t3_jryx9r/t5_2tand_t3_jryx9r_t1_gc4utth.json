Have you murdered someone? Do you torture puppies for fun? Or is it something more mundane such as a chronic medical condition? \n\nDuring my times of depression and suicidal ideation, I've often felt like how you describe; that I'm alone, and I alone am the only one who feels the way I do. It's part of the reason depression is such a nasty disease. It lies to you constantly and obscures your ability to objectively judge yourself, others, and reality. \n\nYour problems are not unique. There is nothing new underneath the sun. I can guarantee you that while I may have not gone through specifically what you have, it's not something that you alone are struggling with. It's also not something that you have to struggle through alone. If you want to chat, I'm always available and have ridiculous insomnia. \n\nEven if you are the absolute scum of the Earth, I passionately believe that you are redeemable. You can be a better person if you're willing to put in the effort, and yes, you might have to put in a great deal more effort than me. But that doesn't mean it's not possible and it doesn't mean you're not capable of doing it.\n\nI think you already know this is true, because why else would you be on this subreddit?", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jryx9r/at_18_years_old_i_was_a_depressed_introvert/gc4utth/"}
