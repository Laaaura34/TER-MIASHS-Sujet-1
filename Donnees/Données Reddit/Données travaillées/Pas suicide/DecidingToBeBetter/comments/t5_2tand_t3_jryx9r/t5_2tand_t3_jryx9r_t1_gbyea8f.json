But when I entered my teenage years, something changed. In school I came into a new class, and some of the guys I made \"friends\" with turned out to be extremly abusive bullies. To make it short, the next couple years were hell. The teachers and classmates didn't have the courage to help me and I made the mistake to not tell my parents anything about the bullying because i was ashamed. This is not the only reason for my change in character over the next years, but it started a process in me that turned me into a introvert and shy person. \n\nIt feels like you told the story of my life in this bracket.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jryx9r/at_18_years_old_i_was_a_depressed_introvert/gbyea8f/"}
