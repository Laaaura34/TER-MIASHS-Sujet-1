Sorry for the late response, I\u2019ve had a lot of work piled up from my crisis days. Now that I\u2019m okay I\u2019ve been picking up my slack and more!\n\nThanks for the lovely words! It\u2019s comforting to know someone knows exactly what I\u2019m going through. My parents are the same and are actually self-aware now that they weren\u2019t and still aren\u2019t (but soon will be!) more equipped with my anxiety and depression. \n\nOf course, they don\u2019t define me. You\u2019re correct. I just think that getting diagnosed and confirmed really reassured me that there really is nothing \u201cfucked-up-and-unsolvably-wrong\u201d with me. It\u2019s like, having them defined and pointed out to me was like confronting the demons I didn\u2019t know I had, saying \u201chello nice to meet you\u201d to them and then they vanish into\nbecoming manageable because i did the first few steps in \u201csolving\u201d a problem: realizing, recognizing, and accepting them, myself, and reality for what it is.\n\n(Thanks for commenting and for reading my rant! I haven\u2019t been out or talked to many people due to\nmy anxiety with covid so this is like my few social interactions in a while.)", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/hmm8h4/after_5_years_of_waiting_i_finally_got_to_talk_to/fxedifs/"}
