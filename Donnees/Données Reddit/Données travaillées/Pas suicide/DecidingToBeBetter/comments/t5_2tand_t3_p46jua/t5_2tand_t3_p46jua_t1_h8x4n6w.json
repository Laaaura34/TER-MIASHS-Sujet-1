Skipping a new habit a couple times doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed and shouldn\u2019t bother anymore, and not doing things as quickly as you\u2019d like doesn\u2019t mean you haven\u2019t made progress.\nAnd of course it\u2019s easier said than done, but sometimes you just have to do a thing regardless of how you feel about it, because you\u2019ve decided you\u2019re going to do it.  Over time, it should be easier to do things even when you don\u2019t feel like it because you\u2019ll learn how to tolerate and resist negative thoughts and feelings.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p46jua/how_do_i_convince_myself_that_the_most_basic/h8x4n6w/"}
