It is just hard. Depression makes it hard. It is physiologically difficult to do the things. If somebody had the flu, would you fuss at them for not running their daily 5 miles? If somebody had cancer, would you put them down because there are dishes in the sink? Depression is an illness. You don't get to choose how you feel. You can get treatment, which long term can help but on the day to day, you get what you get. \n\n Some days if you got out of bed long enough to shower and put on fresh PJs, that's a win. Some days moving from the bed to the couch is a win. \n\nFussing at yourself because you didn't do all of the things is burning energy you could be using to do the things. \n\nMy advice is when you wake up in the morning, ask yourself what feels possible today? Then set goals according to your energy. Make then small goals so you can achieve them and feel good. Instead of vacuuming the house, you can vacuum the bedroom. Instead of cleaning the kitchen, you can load the dishwasher or wash the spoons. When you go to bed, congratulate yourself on your progress. \"I didn't do much today, but tomorrow morning, I am going to eat my yogurt with a clean spoon. Those spoons are sparkling!\"\n\nSending you love and light.\n\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9b", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/p46jua/how_do_i_convince_myself_that_the_most_basic/h8whasb/"}
