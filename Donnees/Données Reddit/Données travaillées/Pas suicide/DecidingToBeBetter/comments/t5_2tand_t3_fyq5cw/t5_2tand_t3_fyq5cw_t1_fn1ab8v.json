I'm an expert on being depressed and generally feeling like life is a fucking joke and I also know what it feels like to lose the love of your life and in the worse way possible so I'm not going to candy coat anything or bs you with platitudes and nonsense because it doesn't ever really go away but it does get easier w time and just keep pushing forward one day at a time and you will be just fine...trust me! If you need someone to talk with or just vent you can always message me...stuck inside for foreseeable future w a pre teen and a 6 yr old who both miss their mom and blame me for things they are not old enough to understand yet so any distractions are welcome lol... seriously though keep your head up and just remember life goes on and this too shall pass my friend!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/fyq5cw/we_broke_up_i_havent_been_doing_good_even_before/fn1ab8v/"}
