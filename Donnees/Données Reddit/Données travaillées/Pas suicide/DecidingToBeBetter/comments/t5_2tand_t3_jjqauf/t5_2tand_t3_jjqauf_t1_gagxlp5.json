They only want to hide away in their cave. Years ago I want to join a marathon challenge (I was skinny and weak but I wanted to be challenged) and a science club and they be like : \"waste of time, pfff, who do you think you are?\"\n\nSo well, I grow up and hide away from everything just like how they teach me, 24 years I have never done any run myself, walk for few days and still \"pfff\" from my parents. Now I feel its so hard to start to walk, just sit infront of TV/laptop for whole day. \n\nYou are so lucky!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/jjqauf/came_back_from_my_run_this_morning_to_my_mom/gagxlp5/"}
