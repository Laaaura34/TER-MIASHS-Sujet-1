At one point I was also smoking on a daily basis. I wanted to quit for a while due to anxiety, but it was such a staple in my daily life that I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to. Fortunately(?) i was forced to quit due to probation, and I felt SO MUCH BETTER better once I did. Less depersonalization and my brain felt a lot more clear. It does get a little hard when 98% of your friends smoke, and I\u2019ve come across a couple of people who just cannot fathom that weed can give you a negative experience and will give you a hard time about it, but it\u2019s definitely worth sticking with. I\u2019m happy that you\u2019re doing better, cheers to a new chapter!", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kddmdv/one_week_sober_from_weed_after_2_12_years/gfw2vf1/"}
