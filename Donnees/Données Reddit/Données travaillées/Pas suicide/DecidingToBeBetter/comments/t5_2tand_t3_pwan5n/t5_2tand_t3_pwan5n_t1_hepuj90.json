The last few sentences you wrote were eye-opening. I feel like being on social media (I deleted Instagram last month and Snapchat two years ago but I have Facebook) all I see is others succeeding. While I am happy for them I always beat myself up that I'm not doing enough.  I really need to learn that it's okay to do things at my own pace as long as I'm making progress towards my goal. I'm happy to hear that you are doing well, even though you're a stranger. It's hard to make changes let alone in the light of losing a parent. Funny enough I'm 23 too and always feel so behind in life but I've hopefully got a lot of time left to make things happen.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwan5n/at_what_point_did_you_decide_enough_is_enough/hepuj90/"}
