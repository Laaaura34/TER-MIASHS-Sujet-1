Between then and now, I've been reading for 4 hours a day, 4 days a week, nonstop until now.\n I feel like I've amassed enough knowledge, but I'll keep up this pace of reading until December 31, then on January 1, I\u2019ll start reading 1 hour a day, 5 days a week.\n\n\nSo, basically, it's family business thingy. I used to be my dad's assistance, but you know what they say about never doing business with family. I used to sabotage and frustrate him a lot, although sometimes I put in the effort to do what was proper but I just had no keen interest. But after he died, I immediately got fully immersed into getting better so that when I do resume working, I'll be doing so from a perspective of knowledge and experience (I already have the experience, and I recently got certified and licensed as well)\n\n\n I hope this counts. Wow, I have indeedd changed TREMENDOUSLY between last year and now. It seems that in life, rather than linearly, growth occurs in spurts. I'm on my path to financial stability, thankfully, to be skilful in what I do. It's not my goal to be the most skilful, or the most knowledgeable, but to be as effective and as efficient as I CAN.\nI'm not competing with anyone, just seeking to do the best in my present circumstances, and if it matters I'm 23\u00bd years old, Male.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/pwan5n/at_what_point_did_you_decide_enough_is_enough/hei1mmo/"}
