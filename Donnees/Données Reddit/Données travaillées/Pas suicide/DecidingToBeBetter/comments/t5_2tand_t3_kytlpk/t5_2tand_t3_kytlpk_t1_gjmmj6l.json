When I read it I definitely felt like it was helpful d applicable to me. But of course you can never cater to everyone and it's OK to have different opinions, in fact it's often a good thing!\n\nI am curious, however, on whether there are specific examples of what you want to learn or would like him to go through? In his book \"Models\", which covers how to become a more attractive way, he does go through many specific examples on different situations and I really liked that. Models sounds super cringy as most dating books do, but in my opinion it is a very honest and helpful book. Both it and the rest of Mansons works have really helped me become a better person, and I would say it has helped me out with the ladies as well.", "permalink": "/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/kytlpk/10_takeaways_from_the_subtle_art_of_not_giving_a/gjmmj6l/"}
